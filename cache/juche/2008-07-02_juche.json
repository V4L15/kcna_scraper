Involved in the war maneuvers were over 90 air-striking means including fighters of the U.S. air force in Pacific, its mainland and in south Korea and the south Korean puppet air force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary brands the above-mentioned war maneuvers as a premeditated playing with fire aimed at escalating the military confrontation and tension on the Korean Peninsula and driving its situation to the catastrophic phase of war and an adventurous war gambling designed to make a preemptive strike at the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. introduced into the above-said exercises B-52 which earned ill fame for its armed invasion and war of aggression against other countries in the past. This is a revelation of its dangerous scenario to make a preemptive nuclear strike at the DPRK any time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. oft-repeated talk that it has \"no intention to attack\" the DPRK can convince no one as it sounds hypocritical.  It is nothing but a deceptive artifice veiled with the smokescreen of peace as it is aimed at disarming the army and people of the DPRK mentally and militarily and realizing its war scenario to invade it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. is truly willing to settle pending issues peacefully through dialogue with the DPRK, it should refrain from such provocative acts as leveling its gun at the dialogue partner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n Dialogue and saber rattling can never go together. The danger of war can never be removed from the Korean Peninsula nor can peace settle on it as long as the U.S. persists in its moves to ignite a war of aggression against the DPRK in a bid to stifle it by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had better behave itself, pondering over the consequences to be entailed by its anti-DPRK military hysteria which may derail dialogue and disturb peace.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"
