These are clear evidence of the development of ancient astronomy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   These stars carved on the front side of cover stone of each dolmen proved to be 5,000-year old. This testifies  to the fact that the basin of the River Taedong was one of the cradles of ancient astronomy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Those dolmens have different sizes of holes which mark Polaris, the big dipper and many other stars, big and small. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is just like the method of the contemporary astronomy whereby stars are classified according to their luminance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAnd the diagonal directions of the cover stones in different shapes are guessed to indicate the solstitial point, the summer solstice, the vernal point and the autumnal equinox. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   On the cover stone of the dolmen in Ryongdok-ri there are 80 odd stars showing eleven constellations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The stars carved on dolmens represent a valuable scientific and cultural heritage of the nation as they show a high level of the development of science in the period of Kojoson (ancient Korea). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This custom of carving stars on dolmens was inherited by Koguryo, whose people would draw stars on ceiling of mural tombs. There are at least 20 mural tombs dating back to the Koguryo dynasty where such scientific and well-regulated star are painted. \r\n\r\n"
