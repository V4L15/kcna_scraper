This was an intolerable insult and hideous challenge to the dignity and sovereignty of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The provocation was a striking manifestation of the hostile policy toward the DPRK and a war act against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They assert that the DPRK is banned from launching satellite even though it is a right recognized by international law and that the DPRK is not entitled to have access to nukes even though they brandish nukes at their will. This is the height of brigandish action aimed to check the DPRK's advance for prosperity and force it to disarm in the end.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Words and truth do no work on the U.S., chieftain of aggression and war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK are full of the spirit of annihilating the enemies and are ready to counter the war of aggression with a great and just war for reunification of the country, and the provocation of a nuclear war with a stronger nuclear retaliatory strike. It is their unequivocal answer to the warmongers. This is also a final conclusion drawn by the DPRK in the century-old confrontation with the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has built invincible revolutionary strength, tightening their belts, under the great banner of Songun and finally emerged as a world-level space power and a nuclear weapons state. This was an expression of the national self-esteem based on the historical lesson.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean nation has nobody to be afraid of in the world and no one in the world can provoke the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The all-out action declared by the DPRK is a sacred and patriotic one for setting right the wrong world order by which injustice prevails over justice, and for fighting against the arch enemy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the final battle the DPRK will win national reunification, the cherished desire of the nation, and lose only the military demarcation line.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the Koreans should turn out in the patriotic nationwide action and fulfill their noble mission and historic responsibilities as a member of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the Korean compatriots at home and abroad!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Today's all-out action is a showdown between all the Koreans and the U.S., one for defending the dignity and sovereignty of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There can be no separation between the north, the south and abroad and no distinction between ideology, ism, class, strata and age and sex in this sacred battle of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now is the time for all those with the blood and soul of the Korean nation to unite as one and take part in a patriotic action to defend the destiny of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the Koreans should strongly reject and foil the U.S. and pro-U.S. traitors' moves for a war of aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those in south Korea and different parts of the world should raise the flame of patriotic resistance against the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialist aggression forces, root cause of all misfortune and pains, should be driven out of south Korea and the cause of a war be removed as a whole.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nation can neither be safe nor escape from a disaster of war as long as the pro-U.S. group of traitors is allowed to lord it over in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the Koreans should join the great and just war for national reunification and sweep away the pro-U.S. forces standing against reunification from south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's nuclear deterrence is a symbol of the nation's sovereignty and dignity and a treasured sword for safeguarding the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the immutable truth that a nation can not exist if it has no strength to protect itself. It is also a lesson taught by the tragic situation in which the jungle law prevails.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Aggressors are bereft of common senses and reason, and therefore, dialogue will never work on them who are utterly in disregard of international law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the Koreans at home and abroad should be proud of the great Songun politics and the DPRK's nuclear deterrence that protect the nation, and fully support them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's sacred war of justice is sure to win a shining victory as it is led by Marshal Kim Jong Un, illustrious commander of Mt. Paektu who glorifies the cause of President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il, peerlessly great men, at the highest level.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Immense is the pride of the army and people under the leadership of the great brilliant commander and mounting high is their spirit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces provoke even a bit the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK, we will mercilessly wipe out the provokers and aggressors and achieve the final victory of national reunification at a breath.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the Koreans will turn out in an all-people resistance, a just patriotic war for reunification to foil the south Korean puppet forces' reckless confrontation and war moves and thus build the most prosperous and powerful country on a reunified land of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We firmly believe that all the Koreans will positively respond to this patriotic and ardent appeal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Final victory belongs to the Korean nation."
