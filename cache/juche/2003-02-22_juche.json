Koreans make overland on-site tour for building Kaesong Industrial Zone \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kaesong, February 21 (KCNA) -- An overland on-site tour was made by those concerned from the south side to build the Kaesong Industrial Zone on Feb. 21 after the completion of the west coastal temporary road, part of the projects to  reconnect the west coastal rail and road links between the north and the south amid the ever-growing desire of all the fellow countrymen for reunification.\r\n At least 30 officials of the Hyundai Asan in charge of the zone construction and a land project of South Korea including president Jong Mong Hon and managing director Kim Yun Gyu made the first trial passage through the temporary road between Munsan and Kaesong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The buses carrying them passed through the demilitarized zone of the military demarcation line and entered the portion of the north side at 10 am. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri Jong Hyok, vice-chairman of the Korean Asia-Pacific Peace Committee, and other officials concerned greeted president Jong Mong Hon and managing director Kim Yun Gyu of the Hyundai Asan and other officials concerned from the south side with warm compatriotic feelings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those from the south side toured the point where the west coastal road line is reconnected and the sites for the building of the zone and historical relics in the area of Kaesong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The opening of the Munsan-Kaesong temporary road to traffic in the wake of the trial excursion for the overland tour of Mt. Kumgang and the trial overland tour through the east coastal temporary road provided more favorable conditions for  promoting the common interests of the nation and inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation by concerted efforts of the north and the south under the banner of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration.    \r\n\r\n"

Our pluck is firm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our army and people will not remain an onlooker at the U.S. imperialists' reckless moves to provoke a war of aggression but deal a stern and decisive blow to the aggressors with the might of army-based policy to prove how miserable the end of the aggressors is. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the South Korean warhawks join in the U.S. war moves,  regardless of the interests and security of the nation, they would face a stern judgment by the nation and history.    \r\n\r\n"

They were followed by others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They said that in the whole period of their military occupation of Korea after their invasion the Japanese imperialists forcibly drafted Koreans in a brutal manner and massacred them, the most hideous state-sponsored crimes against humanity in human history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They cited historical facts to prove that the indiscriminate drafting of the Koreans for slave labor was part of the Japanese imperialists' policy to enforce a harsh colonial rule over Korea aimed at exterminating the Korean nation and a deliberate and  premeditated crime to attain its final goal of sacrificing the Korean nation for the prosperity of the Yamato nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the recently disclosed fact that since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war in 1937 the Japanese imperialists forcibly drafted more than 8.4 million Koreans, they cited Japanese government documents including the recently surveyed statistical data to prove that the Japanese imperialists drafted a great number of young and middle-aged Koreans under the pretexts of \"military service,\" \"labor conscription\" and \"volunteers' corps\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these facts go to clearly prove that it is an unavoidable state duty of Japan to compensate Koreans whom it had forcibly drafted, they added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They urged the Japanese Government, an assailant, to probe the truth behind the hideous crimes committed by Japan against the Korean people in the past and make a sincere apology and a full compensation for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An appeal to all the Koreans in the north and the south and abroad was released there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The appeal called on all the Koreans to wage a nationwide movement to denounce Japan's brazen-faced criminal acts and force it to apologize and compensate for its unprecedented crimes against humanity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It expressed the belief that all the Koreans and the world progressive people would positively respond to this just appeal. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It was in that historic period that the revolutionary spirit of soldiers, a model in the times, was created and a breakthrough was made towards the victory of the Korean revolution and the prosperity of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A radical change is taking place in the ideological and moral aspects of our people. it is the real picture of our society that all members of the society are emerging staunch fighters in the era of the army-based policy to display heroism and perform feats by learning from the ideological and mental traits of the servicemen of the KPA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary spirit of soldiers represents a powerful engine for the building of a powerful nation in the era of the army-based policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is clearly evidenced by such proud victories and successes achieved in the revolution and construction in recent years as continued victories in the political and military confrontation with the imperialists, a brilliant victory in the \"arduous march\",  the forced march and a leaping advance made in the drive to build an economically powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The prospect of the Korean revolution advancing in the revolutionary spirit of soldiers under the leadership of  Kim Jong Il is bright, it is sure to triumph and a prosperous and powerful socialist nation is certain to emerge on this land..    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a shameless mockery of human conscience and justice and a revelation of partiality and double standards. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality clearly shows who should be called into question as regards the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Minju Joson says the behaviour of the U.S. and the IAEA applying the double standards to the nuclear field is no more than a rash act of those accustomed to dealing with the international issue in their political interests    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
