Rodong Sinmun Monday says this in a signed article.\r\n The anti-U.S. struggle is to defend the dignity and independence of the nation and it is urgently required by the cause of national reunification itself, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation is subject to the tragedy of division and has not established its sovereignty nationwide owing to the U.S. military occupation of south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has kept its aggression troops in south Korea and persistently pursued its aggressive Korea policy aimed to foster the north-south confrontation and war for the last six decades in a bid to dominate Korea and, on this basis, put the whole Asia under its control. This will bring the Korean nation nothing but slavery and a war disaster. Therefore, the Korean nation's struggle for national reunification precisely means an anti-U.S. struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-U.S. struggle is an urgent task raised by the present situation to the Korean nation. The U.S. has gone to extremes in its criminal hostile policy toward the DPRK aimed to isolate and stifle it by force of arms under the pretext of the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Having already worked out many war scenarios against the DPRK, the U.S. imperialist warhawks have massively introduced latest weapons of mass destruction into south Korea and its vicinity and become all the more pronounced in their moves to stifle the DPRK by force of arms while staging large-scale war maneuvers one after another. In consequence, the situation on the Korean Peninsula is so dangerous that a war may break out on it any time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-U.S. struggle means patriotism and justice and herein lies a rosy future of the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun Sunday said this in a signed article. It went on:\r\n This is evidenced by the fact that the United States has staged mock space war exercises and accelerated the development of the missile defence system (MD) and smaller nukes since the outset of this year in a bid to bolster its war capability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commander of the space war centre, who is in charge of the mock space war exercises, disclosed that the main target of the exercises is to maintain the U.S. edge in the space. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His remarks clearly suggested that in stepping up the preparations for the space war the U.S. persistently seeks the aim of maintaining an unchallenged military edge in space and thereby containing and suppressing other countries in a bid to achieve its goal of domination over them with ease.  The U.S. MD is, by nature, aimed at mounting a preemptive missile attack on any country and region of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is talking about \"peace\" and \" elimination of nuclear weapons\" but is, in fact, accelerating the preparations for a new war of aggression and nuclear attacks by bolstering the nuclear armed forces behind the curtain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is keen to realize its ambition for world domination by use of military force and a nuclear stick.

            "content": "KCNA Slams Japan's Moves for Constitutional Revision\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 7 (KCNA) -- Disclosed recently were the clarified arguing points in the preamble of the new constitution written by the sub-committee for drafting a preamble of the committee for working out a new draft constitution of the Liberal Democratic Party chaired by Yasuhiro Nakasone, former Japanese prime minister.\r\n According to the disclosure, it decided to include the phraseology of \"positive pacifism\" in the preamble which would mean the dispatch of the Self-Defence Forces (SDF) overseas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This laid bare Japan's true intention to legalize and escalate its moves to emerge a military power and realize expansion overseas under the pretexts of \"world peace\" and \"international contribution\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of revising Japan's present constitution has long been controversial. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an aim sought by the Japanese reactionary ruling quarters to legislate on their moves to emerge a military power and realize expansion overseas, not completely bound to the present constitution called a \"pacifist constitution\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is hard for Japan to find any pretext to arm itself and for its SDF forces to be free from restrictions in their involvement in overseas military operations as long as the present constitution remains in force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Therefore, Japan has tried by hook or by crook to render the \"pacifist constitution\" invalid and enacted and implemented various laws to justify SDF forces' advance into the continent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In 1954 it enacted the \"law on Self-Defence Forces\" and the \"law on establishing the Defence Agency\" and drastically amended them in the 1990s, thus making it possible for the SDF to dispatch aircraft and warships overseas under the pretext of \"rescuing overseas Japanese\". In 1992 it adopted the \"law on cooperation in UN peace-keeping operations\", thus legally paving the way for the active overseas dispatch of the SDF forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn 1999 it adopted the \"law on emergency in areas surrounding Japan\", thus expanding the scope of the operation of the SDF. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' moves to provide a legal guarantee for their overseas aggression have become all the more pronounced in the new century as evidenced by the adoption of the \"law on the special measure for combating terrorism\" in October, 2001 and the adoption of the \"emergency legislation\" in May, 2003 which justified the SDF's participation in war of overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is, however, the first time that the Japanese reactionaries openly disclosed their ambition for overseas expansion in the preamble of the constitution which can be called the face of the constitution and represents its core. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's decision to stipulate \"positive pacifism\" in the preamble clearly testifies to the fact that its moves for overseas aggression have entered a very dangerous stage as it is nothing but a dangerous and crafty trick to cover up its aggressive and predatory nature and launch in real earnest its operations to conquer Asia and other parts of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Positive pacifism\" much touted by the right-wing conservative forces of Japan is nothing but a version of the motto of \"the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\" put up by the Japanese imperialists in the past to beautify and justify their invasion of Asian countries and rhetoric to cover up their ambition for expansion overseas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The Japanese reactionaries seem to work hard to retrogressively revise the constitution at any cost this year, 60 years after the defeat of Japan and 50 years since the formation of the LDP, talking about \"peace\". This can not be construed otherwise than a rash act as they impudently work, quite unaware of the position of Japan which still remains recorded as the only war criminal state in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should redeem its crime-ridden past as early as possible before talking about \"international contribution\" and \"positive pacifism.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That would provide the best way for the Japanese politicians to actively contribute to the world peace and security.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
