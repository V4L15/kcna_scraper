That is why they are conducting their moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK so persistently and viciously. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans should never tolerate the U.S. imperialists' reckless provocative moves intended to bar the reunification of the country and bring nuclear holocaust to the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. will face a thousand-fold retaliatory strike by the entire Korean nation if it continues to run amuck.    \r\n\r\n"

And he proposed measures to be taken to cope with such developments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The participants in the meeting denounced the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK as an act of going against the world tendency towards dialogue, detente and peace and as an open challenge to Korea's reunification and global peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They reached a consensus of views on the need to build up public opinions on the gravity and consequences of the U.S. reckless moves and launch a vigorous international campaign on continents, regions and countries to check the moves, and discussed measures to this end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then, the meeting adopted a statement, which said: U.S. President Bush has threatened to take a hardline stand toward the DPRK. This is an intentional move to foil the already started peace process and restore the dangerous confrontation policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Worse still, the U.S. is these days shipping sophisticated weapons into South Korea and unhesitatingly staging large-scale military exercises against the DPRK. The facts clearly show what the real intention of Washington is, the statement pointed out, and said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world people who love justice, independence and peace will never tolerate the moves of bush and U.S. war hawks to unleash a new war in Korea in disregard of its people's desire for reunification, but turn out in the struggle against the U.S. imperialists, the common enemy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will become a great number of \"doves of peace\" against the U.S. war hawks and smash the moves to foil Korea's reunification and peace process.    \r\n\r\n"
