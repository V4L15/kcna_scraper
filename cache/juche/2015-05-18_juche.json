Picoteo que la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea \"se derribaria pronto\" debido a la \"inestabilidad del regimen\". Disparateo como sonambulo que no es permisible mas el \"problema de derechos humanos del Norte\" diciendo que \"es irrealizable la linea de desarrollo paralelo\" y la RPDC \"opta el camino de aislamiento\" de la sociedad internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ademas, atemorizada de la noticia del exito en el lanzamiento justo del proyectil balistico de submarino estrategico al estilo coreano, suelta palabras tales como \"provocacion\" y \"creacion de amenaza\" y ordena a los belicistas de la capa militar titere que tomen la \"reaccion inmediata\" y den \"castigo rotundo\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Para colmo, trama complot para que la ONU tome nueva medida de presion a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la historia de division de la nacion coreana habia los malditos de mala fama por la confrontacion fratricida, pero Park Geun-hye se entrega mas perversamente a menoscabar a la connacional RPDC e inculcar el enfrentamiento fratricida desde los primeros dias de su mandato hasta la fecha. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn estos momentos llegan al climax las maldiciones de la mandataria Park Geun-hye a fin de liberarse de la peor crisis de dominacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora Park Geun-hye vive en agonia como una vela batida por el viento, porque se revela sucesivamente el hecho de que ella tomo el poder con los fraudes ilicitos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY en este crimen estan involucrados por un hilo los \"vasallos meritorios especiales\" de Park. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto evidencia quien es el caudillo de los casos de irregularidades y corrupcion y origen de los malos sociales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAunque sea ahora, Park debe cerrar la boca a lo minimo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs una absurdidad si ella piensa en que sus maldiciones abominables serian un remedio para salvar la crisis. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebe tener presente que su chismorreo traera con antelacion el resultado tragico. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras Park Geun-hye, malcarada y virulenta que no se cuida la lengua, este como duena de Chongwadae, la politica del Sur de Corea no se liberara del abismo de corrupcion."
