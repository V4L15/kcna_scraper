He victoriously led the grim Fatherland Liberation War, which could be called confrontation between rifle and A-bomb.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He successfully carried out the historic cause of founding the party, state and army and developed them into the powerful political weapons for socialist construction as required by the developing revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Regarding the national reunification as the greatest patriotic cause and the supreme task of the nation, he had devoted his all to the work for independent reunification of the country until the last moments of his revolutionary life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through his energetic external activities, he remarkably raised the international position and influence of the DPRK and boosted its foreign relations and sincerely helped peoples of different countries struggling for independence and socialism against imperialism and steered the struggle for accomplishing the human cause of independence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His greatest feat is that he successfully settled the issue of succession to the revolutionary cause to provide a sure guarantee for accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The revolutionary cause of Mt Paektu started by the President had made a steady advance thanks to leader Kim Jong Il and now it is greeting a fresh historic turning phase under the stewardship of respected Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un, the reporter stressed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reporter called for advancing the Korean revolution on a higher stage and accomplishing the socialist cause with the idea and exploits of Kim Il Sung as an eternal cornerstone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Similar meetings took place in all provinces, cities, counties and at complexes on the same day."

All the brigandish provocative moves of the U.S. in the political, economic and military fields pursuant to its hostile policy toward the DPRK will thoroughly be foiled through the toughest counteraction of the army and people of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Our toughest counteraction against the U.S. and its vassal forces will be taken in such a merciless manner as not to allow the aggressors to survive.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Under the prevailing grave situation, the U.S. has to come to its senses and make a proper option for the solution of the problem.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will as ever courageously counter those who encroach upon the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK and will always mercilessly foil all the provocative options of the U.S. with Korean-style toughest counteraction."

This encouraged the world progressives in their efforts to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of their countries whereas it dealt a telling blow at the reactionaries of history.\n\t\t\t\t\t VOA, Google News, the New York Times and various other media and analysts of the U.S. commented that the message, sent by the Supreme Leader of the DPRK to the Syrian president at a time when there is wide-spread public view that U.S. forces' strike at Syria serves as an act of \"warning\" against north Korea, was a frontal rebuff at the Trump administration that trumpets about threat and warning to the DPRK, and an expression of its will to resolutely stand against the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already known, the Trump administration mounted massive attack on an air-force base of the Syrian government army with 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles, charging that the Syrian government army \"used chemical weapons to massacre civilians\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent missile attack of the U.S. was an open violation of sovereignty and state-sponsored terrorism aimed to weaken and overturn the anti-imperialist Syrian government.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world takes note of the fact that the recent military action against Syria reminds one of the situation in 2003 when the U.S. launched a military campaign against Iraq under the pretext of \"weapons of mass destruction\" and thus led the country to a collapse and escalated the threat of international terrorism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is still hatching endless plots and perpetrating provocations aimed at overturning the government of Syria in its several regions including the suburbs south of Damascus under the pretext of \"chemical weapons\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is that some describe the U.S. military attack on Syria as sort of \"warning\" to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are mistaken. The DPRK will never be taken aback by such warning.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent Syrian incident teaches the bitter lesson that any illusion about the imperialists is taboo, and that one can defend oneself from the imperialists' aggression only when one builds one's own strength.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present situation clearly proves that strength should be countered in kind and the DPRK was quite right when it opted for drastically bolstering up its nuclear force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Neither nuclear threat nor economic sanctions can ever check the dynamic advance of the army and people of the DPRK determined to foil the U.S. moves to stifle it, and certainly build a powerful socialist country under the guidance of Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the invariable stand of the DPRK to bolster its military capabilities for self-defence in every way and defend the security of the country, the nation and the region with its own strength to cope with the U.S. evermore undisguised nuclear war moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Trump administration had better stop going reckless, bearing deep in mind that it is in its supreme interests to face up to the strategic position of the DPRK and the trend of the times and behave with prudence and self-control."

coreana llena de las pruebas sin precedentes, y recordo la vida revolucionaria y hazanas del Presidente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNacido en la familia de Mangyongdae revolucionaria y patriotica de generacion en generacion, el Presidente emprendio a la tierna edad de diez anos y pico el camino de la revolucion con el gran proposito de salvar el destino del pais y la nacion, destaco y prosiguio:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Presidente concibio la inmortal idea Juche, la de Songun, tras aclarar los principios del Juche de que la revolucion debe ser realizada conforme a la realidad de su pais basandose en las fuerzas del pueblo y los de la revolucion del Songun de que las fuerzas armadas poderosas garantizan la soberania y la independencia de la nacion y la victoria de la revolucion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA partir de la firme posicion autoctona, dio claras respuestas a los problemas teorico-practicos que se presentan en todas las etapas de la lucha revolucionaria y en todos los dominios de la construccion socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin la retaguardia estatal ni el apoyo de las fuerzas armadas regulares logro la causa historica de la liberacion de la

exito la causa historica de construccion del partido, el Estado y el ejercito y fortalecio y desarrollo el Partido, el Estado y el ejercito como las poderosas armas politicas de la construccion socialista conforme a la demanda de la revolucion en desarrollo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tConsiderando la reunificacion del pais como maxima causa patriotica y suprema tarea nacional, hizo todo lo posible para lograrla hasta el ultimo periodo de su vida revolucionaria. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon sus energicas actividades exteriores, elevo extraordinariamente la posicion e influencias de la RPDC en la arena internacional, amplio y desarrollo las relaciones exteriores, ayudo con sinceridad a los pueblos de varios paises que luchaban por la independencia antiimperialista y el socialismo y condujo al frente el cumplimiento de la causa de independencia de la humanidad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa proeza mas notable del Presidente es haber preparado la garantia para llevar a feliz termino la causa revolucionaria del Juche al resolver perfectamente el problema de sucesion de la misma empresa. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa causa revolucionaria del Paektu iniciada por el tuvo firme continuidad gracias al Dirigente Kim Jong Il y acoge hoy dia el nuevo periodo de viraje historico bajo la guia del Maximo Dirigente Kim Jong Un. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay que llevar a la etapa mas elevada la revolucion coreana y cumplir sin falta la causa socialista tomando la idea y proezas de Kim Il Sung como eterna piedra angular.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl mismo dia, se realizaron actos

Nuestra reaccion superintransigente frente a EE.UU. y sus satelites se dara sin piedad tomando como su meta el castigo destructivo que no tolerara la supervivencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. En cuanto a la grave situacion dada, EE.UU. debera escoger con sano juicio una opcion correcta para la solucion del problema.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn lo adelante tambien, el ejercito y pueblo coreanos se enfrentaran sin vacilacion alguna con los que traten de infringir la dignidad y soberania del pais y frustraran siempre sin piedad con la reaccion superintransigente al estilo coreano todas las opciones provocativas de EE.UU."
