            "content": "Spokesman for CPRK Slams Park Geun Hye's \"Address on August 15\"\r\nPyongyang, August 16 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea issued a statement on Sunday lashing out Park Geun Hye for letting loose a spate of invectives against the DPRK in an \"address made on August 15.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement noted:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park again let loose a litany of reckless remarks seriously insulting the dignity and social system of the DPRK while talking about \"purge\", \"threat of provocation\" and \"isolation and destruction\", far from repenting of the thrice-cursed crimes of having driven the inter-Korean relations into the worst catastrophe.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t And she impudently behaved as if she were interested in dialogue and cooperation while proposing the building of \"a park for peace\" in the demilitarized zone, re-linking  of railways and roads, reunion of \"divided families\" and exchange of sports and culture.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is no more than sheer sophism intended to tarnish the international image of the dignified DPRK, pass the buck for the deteriorated inter-Korean relations to it and justify her policy of confrontation on the verge of bankruptcy as it is malignant outbursts of the anti-reunification element hell-bent on the confrontation with the compatriots in the north and sycophancy and treachery.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As well known to the world, the DPRK put forward landmark proposals and took a series of important measures to bring about a great turn in the inter-Korean relations this year, marking the 70th anniversary of Korea's liberation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group, however, staged nuclear war exercises against the north, leaflet scattering operations and kicked up human rights racket and other rows against the DPRK, backed by the U.S. from the outset of this year, deliberately bedeviling the inter-Korean relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently the puppet regime dampened the aspiration of all Koreans and their efforts to make August 15 an important occasion of north-south reconciliation and national unity by conducting anti-north psychological broadcasting and leaflet scattering operations in the wake of the fabrication of the \"mine explosion,\" a poor farce.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It announced that it would stage large-scale Ulji Freedom Guardian joint war drills aimed to preempt a nuclear strike at the DPRK together with the U.S. from August 17 quite contrary to \"defusing of military tension\" and \"confidence-building\" she mentioned in her address.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is that she malignantly hurt the dignity and social system of the DPRK, by talking rubbish about \"purge\" and \"uneasiness of inhabitants\" on the auspicious day of liberation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an intolerable politically-motivated provocation and a declaration of confrontation and war. Park's above-said utterances are the height of hypocrisy.   \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She should abandon bad blood towards the compatriots in the north and wild ambition to achieve \"unification of social systems\" before vociferating about what she called for \"cooperation.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If she stands for \"defusing military tension\" and \"confidence- building,\" she should not take issue with the north's nuclear deterrent but halt the north-targeted war drills with U.S. nuclear hardware involved as they are the root cause of escalating tension on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is long since the DPRK has seen through the ulterior motive of Park.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet regime barely exists through the flow of foreign capital, without having anything of its own. Its talk about \"leap\" and the like only makes even a cat laugh. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Hye had better stop her rash acts, clearly mindful that her despicable tongue-lashing would only bring her bitterer shame and final ruin."
