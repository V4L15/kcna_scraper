But we will resolutely fight against those who threaten our dignity and sovereignty and deal merciless retaliatory blows to them.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. urged to withdraw its troops from South Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 16 (KCNA) -- U.S. President Bush and other official figures and military bosses are scheming to shift onto the DPRK the blame for no progress of arms reduction on the Korean peninsula, talking about \"cutdown of conventional arms and military forces\" of the DPRK.\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun today runs a commentator's article, which says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will never tolerate the U.S. ruling quarters for groundlessly taking issue with the DPRK, reversing black and white. It is because of the united states that there is no progress of arms reduction on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK-proposed arms cuts presupposes that the Korean people are not exposed to a military threat from the U.S. imperialist aggression forces. The DPRK can never cut down its armed forces in any case if it is threatened by the U.S. imperialist aggression forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have ceaselessly escalated war moves against the DPRK in the whole period of the second half of the 20th century as well as even after the end of the Cold War and committed military actions threatening the DPRK on over 438,000 occasions in the past ten years and critical moments when a war might break out numbered 120 on a daily average. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is only too natural and self-evident for the DPRK to take self-defensive steps against the U.S. forces' threat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of arms cuts on the Korean peninsula is linked with the issue of the withdrawal of the U.S. forces from South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is impossible to achieve arms cuts on the Korean peninsula and ensure a lasting peace and stability under the condition where the U.S. forces are present in South Korea and committing the moves of aggression and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to ease tensions and ensure peace on the peninsula, it is imperative to get the U.S. forces withdrawn from South Korea first of all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration consisting of hawks is intensifying the reckless hardline policy against the DPRK, pulling it up over the non-existent \"threat\" in a far-fetched way and openly branding it as a \"rogue state\", \"terrorism sponsor\" and \"no. 1 enemy\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration has no intention to ease the military confrontation on the Korean peninsula and works hard to escalate it against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The prevailing situation requires the DPRK to make the withdrawal of the U.S. forces the foremost task of its policy toward the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Option is not a monopoly of the U.S. the DPRK is entitled to take an option. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As regards the arms reduction on the Korean peninsula, we clarify that there is no need for the U.S. ruling quarters to noisily talk about it and the issue of cutdown of military forces in the north and south of Korea will be dealt with between them in the process of reunification by federal formula after the complete withdrawal of the U.S. forces from South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of the \"cutdown of conventional forces\" in the DPRK peddled by the U.S. can never be a bargaining of the DPRK-U.S. relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The attitude toward the withdrawal of U.S. forces from South Korea is a criterion that proves whether the bush administration truly wants arms reduction on the Korean peninsula or not.    \r\n\r\n"
