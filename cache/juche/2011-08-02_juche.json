Kumgang tourism and the \"May 24 measure\" agreed to take a joint action, the newspaper said, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey are contemplating such actions as suing the Unification Ministry for damages, paying a protest visit and returning business licenses to the ministry and staging demonstrations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some of the companies already claimed damages but it is the first time for them to take a joint action. So, its effect is likely to be serious.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the wake of the interruption of the Mt. Kumgang tourism, south-north economic cooperation projects and trade were totally suspended, except the Kaesong Industrial Zone, by the measure taken on May 24 last year. The related companies are heavily suffering from the measure, many of them being on the brink of bankruptcy for lack of money. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are now demanding compensation for damages. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They made investments in the projects with confidence in the government's north policy. The government, responsible for the people's life and property, should provide them with conditions necessary for their business and take care of them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t First of all, the government should take a long-range view and save the companies engaging in south-north economic cooperation projects from a crisis to invigorate them."
