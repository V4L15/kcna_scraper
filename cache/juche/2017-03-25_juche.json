Every year an average of 3,400 young people seek foreign nationalities for the evasion of military service.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 73 percent of middle- and low-ranking military officers and 85 percent of non-commissioned officers have the tendency to evade service and over 85,000 soldiers request discharges from service, complaining of melancholy and other mental troubles, according to data minimized by the puppet military.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Branding the south Korean army as a group of undisciplined men resembling the corrupt \"yusin\" prostitute, the white paper goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the puppet defence ministry ordered \"contingency\" in February 2013, more than 240 military bosses including the air chief of staff and the navy chief of staff were dined and wined in a back parlor and played golf, after sending their soldiers to the first line, which sparked off a social uproar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An average of one suicide in three days is reported in the army and those who were confirmed not to be appropriate for service doubled as before. A total of 49,300 soldiers are classified to belong to soldiers of \"concern and danger\" as they are judged to be capable of committing such crimes as opening fire into superiors and colleagues with the development of symptom of mental derangement attributable to harsh exercises and physical torture.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet army is a huge Mafia group trained by the \"yusin\" descendent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With the traits of making money through the supply of cheap and poorly-made munitions to military units after being bribed by munitions businesses prevalent among generals of the army, 70 percent of those above lieutenant general gained $700,000 worth property each and eight generals embezzled over one million U.S. dollars each in 2013 alone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Scandal is most serious in the field of munitions industry.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Military-turned munitions businessmen form a network among themselves to be called military mafia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea has turned into a scrapped U.S. weaponry exhibition and the military into a concentration camp without bars and an approved theatre of human rights abuses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such military warmongers as puppet Defence Minister Han Min Gu still incite war fever, recklessly crying out for \"punishment\" and \"readiness for war\", far from drawing a lesson from the miserable end of traitor Park Geun Hye who was severely punished by the public for her hideous provocations and north-targeted war exercises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Should a war break out, the arms of the soldiers of the puppet army will be aimed at the corrupt and incompetent Park Geun Hye group of traitors including Han Min Gu before anyone else."

Anualmente, mas de 3 mil 400 jovenes como promedio anual adquieren la nacionalidad extranjera para evadir el servicio militar. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun las estadisticas publicadas por el circulo militar surcoreano reduciendo cifras de verdad, el 73% de los oficiales de la capa mediana y la baja y el 85% de suboficiales tienen la tendencia a evadir el servicio militar. Actualmente, sobrepasa 85 mil el numero de los que solicitan la licencia quejandose de melancolia y otras enfermedades mentales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito titere surcoreano es la soldadesca parecida a Park Geun-hye, degenerada descendiente del dictador de Yusin (renovacion). \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando el Ministerio de Defensa dio la orden de entrar en el \"estado de emergencia\" en febrero de 2013, mas de 240 figuras de la cupula militar, inclusive los jefes del Estado Mayor de las Fuerzas Aereas y del Estado Mayor de la Marina, empujaron a la linea avanzada y disfrutaron banquetes opiparos ofrecidos a puertas cerradas y jugaban el golf, hecho que causo un revuelo social. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn las filas del ejercito surcoreano surge un suicida a cada 3 dias como promedio y se duplico el numero de los calificados como inaptos para servir en el ejercito. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLlega a 49 mil 300 el numero de los soldados clasificados como \"los bajo el cuidado y los peligrosos\" que muestran senales de trastorno mental debido a los ejercicios y castigos salvajes y pueden cometer crimenes contra sus superiores y colegas como el uso de armas de fuego.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito titere surcoreano es la horda de mafias formada por la descendiente del dictador de \"Yusin\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos generales obtienen fabulosas ganancias con el metodo de suministrar pertrechos baratos y defectuosos a las unidades a cambio del dinero que les pagan los complejos de industria belica. A citar un ejemplo, solo en el ano 2013, el 70% de los generales superiores al grado de teniente general acumulo cada uno los bienes valorados en mas de 700 mil US$ mientras 8 magnates del nivel de general de ejercito desfalcaron mas de un millon de US$. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa industria belica es el sector donde se reportan los casos mas graves de corrupcion e irregularidades. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora, los funcionarios de origen militar, que ocupan cargos importantes de la industria belica del Sur de Corea, se ganaron el apodo de \"mafias militares\" porque estan vinculados estrechamente para las practicas de corrupcion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la actualidad, el Sur de Corea se convierte en el mercado de armamentos chatarreados de fabricacion norteamericana y el ejercito titere surcoreano es repudiado como prision sin rejas y violador autorizado de derechos humanos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos belicistas del circulo militar como el ministro de Defensa Han Min Gu infunden hasta en este momento el clima de guerra diciendo disparates imprudentes como \"represalia\" y \"no vacilar en desatar la guerra\", lejos de sacar la leccion del fin tragico de la traidora Park Geun-hye, condenada severamente por la poblacion por haber recurrido freneticamente a las graves provocaciones y los ejercicios belicos contra la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el caso de estallar la guerra, los soldados surcoreanos apuntaran primero a Han Min Gu y otros compinches de la banda corrupta de Park Geun-hye."

Tratan de adelantar la instalacion del sistema de defensa antimisiles capaz de interceptar en la altura maxima de 1500km y revisan la introduccion de THAAD.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor otra parte, tuvo lugar el dia 17 en el departamento de Akita el ejercicio de evacuacion de civiles por primera vez despues de la Segunda Guerra Mundial suponiendo el lanzamiento de cohetes balisticos de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe expande en la sociedad japonesa la opinion en favor de ampliar el teatro operacional de las \"Fuerzas de Autodefensa\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo ocultamos que el reciente ensayo es para hacer frente a la campana de guerra nuclear anti-RPDC bajo el protagonismo de EE.UU. y tuvo por su objetivo atacar las bases militares norteamericanas en el pais isla en el tiempo de emergencia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo olvidamos que durante la guerra coreana desatada en la decada de 1950 por EE.UU., todo el territorio japones se ha convertido en la base de retaguardia y logistica para las tropas norteamericanas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl entonces embajador norteamericano en Japon dijo que \"el archipielago japones se convirtio a una velocidad tremenda en un gran almacen de suministro. De no suceder eso, EE.UU. no habria podido hacer la guerra coreana\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTomar el camino de reagresion con la ayuda de su amo norteamericano usando a Corea como trampolin es la invariable ambicion y el objetivo estrategico de los reaccionarios japoneses. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor eso, los gobernantes japoneses entregan su territorio como base de logistica norteamericana adhiriendose a la estrategia de EE.UU. de dominar Asia-Pacifico. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCoincidiendo con los ejercicios militares conjuntos Key Resolve y Foal Eagle de mayor envergadura en la Peninsula Coreana, Japon lanzo un satelite espia y libro junto con EE.UU. el entrenamiento naval conjunto. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapon debe actuar con prudencia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi las \"Fuerzas de Autodefensa\" intentan la nueva agresion junto con las tropas yanquis, Japon sufrira las consecuencias daninas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi los maniacos de guerra, que perturban la paz de la Peninsula Coreana y la estabilidad regional y llevan la situacion al umbral de guerra nuclear, se atreven a lanzar una sola bala siquiera hacia nuestro territorio sagrado, Japon no podra evitar el desastre fatal. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA ese pais le convendria abandonar la imprudente sumision a EE.UU. y la campana anti-RPDC."
