            "content": "DPRK's Stand on Six-party Talks Reclarified \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 2 (KCNA) -- We will go to the talks any time if the U.S. takes a trustworthy sincere attitude and moves to provide conditions and justification for the resumption of the six-party talks. The DPRK Foreign Ministry declared this in a lengthy memorandum released Wednesday to explain the reason why it maintains such stand on the talks.\r\n The memorandum cites concrete facts to prove that the U.S. is wholly to blame for the fact that the talks have not yet been resumed and the solution to the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. has been delayed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The following points have been stressed in the memorandum: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is left with no justification to sit at the negotiating table with the U.S. for the six-party talks or bilateral talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The second-term Bush administration, just as it did in its first term, adopted it as its policy not to co-exist with the DPRK and bring down the system chosen by the Koreans themselves, thus eliminating any justification for the DPRK to participate in the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bush, instead of retracting his remarks listing the DPRK part of \"an axis of evil,\" termed the government in the DPRK installed by its own people an \"outpost of tyranny\", singling it out as the object to be removed to the last, outcries worse than those remarks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n How can we sit at the negotiating table with the U.S. given that the U.S. has rejected the government of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should apologize for his above-said remarks and withdraw them, renounce its hostile policy aimed at a regime change in the DPRK and clarify its political willingness to co-exist with the DPRK in peace and show it in practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is imperative for the U.S. to rebuild the groundwork of the six-party talks and create conditions and atmosphere for their resumption as quickly as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, it has gone so shameless as to demand the DPRK come out to the six-party talks, asserting that there are mature conditions for them, while escalating political and diplomatic pressure and military threat to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This reminds one of the \"gunboat diplomacy\" pursued by big countries to occupy smaller countries in the past 18th- 19th centuries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is foolish of the U.S. to calculate that the DPRK will come out to the talks and yield to it under its military pressure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's demand that the U.S. renounce its hostile policy toward the DPRK and rebuild the groundwork of the talks is not a precondition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. truly wants a negotiated solution to the DPRK-U.S. nuclear issue, it should rebuild the groundwork of the talks it had destroyed unilaterally, renounce its hostile policy aimed at a regime change in the DPRK through practical actions and opt for co-existing with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK urges the U.S. to make a switchover in its policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's principled stand to achieve the goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and seek a negotiated peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue still remains unchanged.    \r\n\r\n"

This is a mockery and insult to the Asian people who suffered bitter humiliation and tremendous damage due to Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The appeal underscored the need to positively solidarize with the world's human rights organizations and organizations demanding the Japanese authorities' compensation to call into question Japan's moves to evade its past liquidation and conduct positive international activities against its bid for permanent membership of the UNSC.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Newspapers today observe this in signed commentaries.\r\n Accusing the U.S. of kicking up a noisy anti-Syria campaign, baselessly linking it to the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, Rodong Sinmun says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. singled out Syria together with Iran as the country to be stifled and has since escalated its interference in the internal affairs of Syria and pressure upon it under the absurd pretext of \"being a terrorism sponsor\" in a bid to implement its policy to invade the Mideast. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its anti-Syria campaign has got more frantic since the former Lebanese prime minister was killed in a bomb explosion in Beirut. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is taking the incident as a golden opportunity to slander and internationally isolate Syria and, furthermore, invent a pretext for mounting a military attack on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the U.S. seeks through this is to justify its aggressive anti-Syria policy and tighten its economic sanctions against the country and increase its political and military pressure upon Syria by labeling it a \"terrorist\" at any cost and thus finally bring Damascus to its knees and control it. It is the U.S. stereotyped method to pressurize independent countries and commit military aggression against them through a false propaganda and smear campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. anti-Syria moves can never be justified as they are a wanton infringement upon the sovereignty of Syria. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson notes that with nothing can the U.S. ever shake the Syrian people's faith and will to defend the sovereignty of the country and nation, firmly convinced in the justice of their cause.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Its ruling glaringly proves that laws in south Korea are anti-popular ones as they grant the foreign aggressors extraterritorial rights while mercilessly cracking down upon the people engaged in a righteous struggle to have their just demands met. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should drop their sycophantic treacherous mentality of regarding foreign forces more important than their people, reading the U.S. face and blindly kowtowing to it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
