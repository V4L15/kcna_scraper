Paektu was a great fortune for Korea as it brought a bright future of the revolutionary cause of Juche and a great event for the Korean nation, he said, adding that thanks to this day the Korean revolution could win victory after victory through generations, firmly preserving the bloodline of Juche and dynamically steering the advance of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il has developed in depth the Juche idea of President Kim Il Sung and formulated it as a revolutionary philosophy, political philosophy serving the popular masses in their practical struggle to achieve independence. By setting out the Juche philosophy he performed a brilliant ideological and theoretical feat as he established a perfect revolutionary outlook on the world centered on the popular masses, the first of its kind in the human history of the development of progressive philosophy and provided the people with a powerful weapon for the revolutionary struggle for independence and socialism and the training of independent human-beings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He has carried forward the Songun idea and line set out and consistently embodied by the President and further developed them in depth as required by the times and the revolutionary development, clarifying from a new angle the idea and theory on the Songun politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tremendous vitality of his revolutionary idea lies in the fact that it scientifically indicates the road to be followed by the times and revolution as it is based on the Juche idea, which crystallizes the popular masses' idea of independence, and takes the Songun idea as its cornerstone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il has strengthened the WPK into an invincible militant party leading the Songun revolution and the DPRK into a powerful revolutionary regime based on the Songun politics and consolidated the single-minded unity of the society as firm as a rock. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter called for bringing about an eternal prosperity of the country by dynamically speeding up the general march for the Songun revolution under the slogan \"Let the Whole Party and Army and All the People Unite as One in Mind and More Strikingly Demonstrate the Might of Songun!\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He underscored the need for the whole Party and army and all the people to fully apply the idea of attaching importance to the army and military affairs, true to the Songun politics of the WPK, and thus augment the military muscle of the country in every way.\r\n  It is necessary to effect a fresh revolutionary surge on all fronts of the socialist construction by dynamically speeding up the general march for the Songun revolution and bring about a decisive turn in the economic construction and the improvement of the standard of people's living this year which marks the 60th anniversaries of the WPK and the liberation of the country, the reporter noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should concentrate all efforts on doing farming well this year, build monumental edifices for eternal prosperity and effect an uninterrupted boost in production to translate Kim Jong Il's plan for the building of a great prosperous powerful socialist nation into a brilliant reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will achieve the historic cause of national reunification at any cost by realizing the three forms of cooperation for national independence, peace against war and reunification and patriotism under the banner of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration provided by Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. administration disclosed its real intention to escalate its policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK. If the U.S. recklessly opts for a war of aggression despite the repeated warning of the DPRK, our army and people will mobilize all potentials, built up pursuant to the Songun politics, and deal merciless crushing blows at the aggressors and achieve a final victory in the confrontation with the U.S.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
