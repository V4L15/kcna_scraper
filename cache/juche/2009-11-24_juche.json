            "content": "Kim Jong Il Inspects Industrial Establishments in North Phyongan\r\n Pyongyang, November 24 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il provided field guidance to industrial establishments in North Phyongan Province.\n\t\t\t\t\t The first leg of his guidance was the Ryangchaek Bearing Factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After being briefed on the modernization of the factory, he went round the processing shop and other places of the factory to acquaint himself in detail with its technological updating and production.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Expressing great satisfaction over the fact that the workers of the factory are successfully rebuilding the factory as required by the new century and effecting a steady surge in production, he highly appreciated their feats.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If modernization and scienfication based on the latest science and technology are realized while steadily strengthening the Juche character of the national economy as this factory is doing, it is possible to give full play to the advantages and vitality of our self-supporting national economy in all fields, he noted, adding that the revolutionary fighting spirit and enterprising work style of the workers of the factory making uninterrupted advances and innovations without moment's stagnation and marking time are the example to be followed by all the units. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the nation's machine-building industry making rapid progress is requiring a steady boost of the production of bearing, one of the indispensable parts, he stressed that in order to find a satisfactory solution to this urgent problem it is necessary to decisively improve the quality of bearings and, at the same time, develop and perfect new varieties of diverse sizes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said in order to bring about a radical turn in the bearing production it is necessary to continue dynamically pushing forward the modernization and scientization of the factory and, at the same time, pay primary attention to the work to introduce ultra-modern science and technology and raise the producers' level of technical skill. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The next leg of his guidance was the Sinuiju Shoes Factory. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round the room for the education in the revolutionary history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The factory has developed to be a reliable shoes producer playing a big role in settling the shoes problem of our people under the wise leadership of President Kim Il Sung, he said, adding that seeing this factory alone, one can know well how devotedly the President worked for the improvement of the standard of the people's living.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then he made the rounds of the sole shop and other production processes of the factory to learn in detail about its technological equipment and production.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was greatly satisfied to learn that its workers are keeping production going at a high rate by putting the production processes on a modern and scientific basis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He noted that in order to increase the production of shoes suited to the developing trend of the times, it is imperative to strengthen researches into this domain and, at the same time, steadily raise the level of technical skill of the producers and wage a dynamic drive to introduce advanced science and technology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He praised the factory for having spruced up its interior like a palace and its exterior like a park and built all necessary cultural and welfare facilities, thus establishing a high level of cultured practices in production and life and providing the workers with good living conditions, underscoring the need to continue paying deep attention to this work.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed expectation and conviction that the workers of the factory would creditably perform their honorable duty and thus produce and supply more quality shoes for the people of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then he saw varieties of grass crafts produced by the Sinuiju Grass Craft Production Cooperative to learn about its management and operation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Expressing great satisfaction over the fact that the cooperative is making varieties of attractive and useful grass crafts with locally available raw materials and agricultural by-products including sedges and corn-shucks, thereby contributing to the improvement of the standard of the people's living, he highly praised its workers for devoting their wisdom and energy to the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The last leg of his guidance was the Sinuiju Chicken Farm rebuilt on an expansion basis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After being briefed on the farm in front of a huge map showing its panoramic view, he made the rounds of the computer control room   and the room for incubation and other places to acquaint himself in detail with its technological updating and production.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Expressing great satisfaction over the fact that the employees of the farm have made leaping progress in the production of meat and eggs by intensifying the technological updating of the production processes and putting the breeding on a scientific basis as required by the IT age, he praised them for having devoted their wisdom and energies to serving the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a success worth a high praise that in recent years this farm has boosted the production of meat and eggs with less production cost through a positive introduction of ultra-modern science and technology, thus making a great contribution to improving people's diet, he noted, adding that the experience of this farm proves that only when a farm is based on high level of science and technology can it bring about a fresh turn in poultry, too. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tã€€Saying that the reserve for boosting the production in the poultry, too, lies in solving the problem of breeding chicken, he underlined the need for the farm to continue thoroughly implementing the Party's policy of bringing about a radical turn in raising breeding chickens to positively introduce chickens of good stock which grow fast and are high in egg-laying rate, while consuming less feed. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to keep the production at the chicken farm going at a high rate it is necessary to pay primary attention to solving the feed problem, he noted, stressing the need to decisively increase the grain yield in feed bases by increasing the production of organic composite fertilizer by use of excretion of chickens. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed expectation and conviction that the workers of the farm would continue effecting a surge in production by fully displaying the popular character and thus make a positive contribution to improving the people's diet.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that the miraculous achievements made by North Phyongan Province recorded with creation and feats, racing against time, fully reflect the dynamism of the country dashing ahead towards the eminence of a thriving nation, adding that this eye-opening speed of advance is a great fruition of the indomitable will and inexhaustible mental power of the Korean people confidently advancing, remaining single-mindedly loyal to the Party despite any trial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Kim Phyong Hae, chief secretary of the North Phyongan Provincial Committee of the WPK, Kim Ki Nam, secretary of the WPK Central Committee, and Pak Nam Gi and Jang Song Thaek, department directors of the WPK Central Committee."
