            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on Danger of RIMPAC War Gamble \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 20 (KCNA) -- The RIMPAC-2006 joint military exercises are overall military operations and a preliminary war aimed to take a preemptive attack on the DPRK in view of their period, contents, characters and scale. \r\n Rodong Sinmun Thursday says this in a signed article, and goes on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists described the military exercises as those for guaranteeing \"security of sea routes\" and countering \"terrorism\". This is nothing but a sophism to cover up and justify the criminal nature, purpose and danger of the exercises. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The exercises are part of preparations for a new war in line with the U.S. aggressive Asia strategy and a gamble for the provocation of the second Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. warmongers began to stage the RIMPAC joint military exercises on June 25, when they ignited the Korean war 56 years ago. This clearly suggests that the U.S. imperialists are seeking to provoke a new war again to invade the DPRK instead of drawing due lessons from their defeat in the past Korean war. During the exercises they are practicing comprehensive military operations such as firing of missiles and guns, landing of marines and sweeping of mines. They are attempting to emasculate the war deterrent of the DPRK with large-scale attacks from sea and air and occupy it with ease as they did in Afghanistan and Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Participating in the exercises are armed forces of those countries actively following and supporting the U.S. policy of aggression against the DPRK. They have participated almost in all the RIMPAC military exercises and practiced the way of combat activities according to the U.S. military strategy of aggression on the DPRK. When a war breaks out in the Korean Peninsula they will be the first to commit their armed forces to the Korean front. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the facts show, the U.S. imperialists are seeking to trigger another Korean war under the pretext of \"anti-terrorism\" and \"peace-keeping\" and inveigle multi-national armed forces into the Korean front as they did in the past Korean war. In this way they are trying to realize in the new century their ambition for aggression on Korea which they failed in the 1950s. Herein lies the danger of the joint military exercises.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

State-sponsored terrorism of Israel and the U.S. must be stopped to straighten this situation out.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Thursday observes this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIsrael's barbaric air-raids on Palestine and Lebanon are brigandish state-sponsored terrorism as they wantonly violate the independent rights of the sovereign states, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Israel's recent military aggression is a replica of U.S. horrendous state-sponsored terrorism perpetrated under the pretext of a \"war on terrorism.\" The barbaric military aggression perpetrated by Israel against Palestine and Lebanon created such a serious situation that a new Mid-east war may break out. The responsibility for this entirely rests with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seeks to shift the blame for it on to Syria, deliberately linking the current Mid-east situation to the country. This is aimed to brand anti-imperialist and independent Syria as a \"criminal\" and stifle it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Quite just are the stand of Syria and its efforts to render positive support and encouragement to Palestine and Lebanon in their resistance against Israel's military aggression and achieve Mideast peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people extend firm solidarity to Syria and bitterly condemn Israel for having perpetrated armed aggression against Palestine and Lebanon under the U.S. patronage and backing.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "\"Mindan's\" Unilateral Nullification of May 17 Joint Statement under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 20 (KCNA) -- The unilateral nullification of the May 17 joint statement by the \"ROK Residents Association in Japan\" (Mindan) is nothing but a move to torpedo the process of reconciliation launched by the Korean community in Japan, a product of the alienation strategy of the forces opposed to the reunification of the Korean nation.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Thursday says this in a signed commentary. It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is an intolerable perfidy and anachronistic challenge to the desire and aspiration of the Koreans in Japan to put an end to the tragedy in which compatriots have lived separated and hostile to each other even in an alien land and achieve unity and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint statement reflects the strong expectation and desire and ardent patriotic will of all Koreans in Japan to see Chongryon and \"Mindan\" to contribute to the reunification and prosperity of the country by swimming with the strong trend whereby all Koreans in the north and the south and overseas are heading for reconciliation, unity and reunification in the spirit of \"By our nation itself\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To settle the issue of Koreans in Japan presents itself as an important national issue in view of the historical background against which they were compelled to settle there and of their present conditions. What is most urgent at present is to achieve reconciliation and unity among the Korean community in Japan. The Koreans in Japan under Chongryon and \"Mindan\" are subject to national humiliation there. Then, why should they remain hostile to each other, in stead of turning to each other for help?  It is painful, indeed, for the \"Mindan\" to have declined the opportunity of reconciliation provided with so much effort. Those who declared the joint statement invalid and those who instigated them to do so should think twice over their national conscience and behave themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those who go against the nation and reunification contrary to the demand of the national history and the desire of the fellow countrymen are bound to be judged by history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Mindan\" should stop playing into the hands of the Japanese reactionaries and anti-reunification conservative forces to hurt the compatriots, and lend an ear to the unanimous voices of the whole nation, though belatedly, and retract at once its unreasonable decision to scrap the May 17 joint statement of Chongryon and Mindan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans will closely follow the future attitude of \"Mindan\".    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The army and people of the DPRK are all astir in the fighting spirit to destroy the enemies, while keeping a sharp watch at their every move. It is the will and pluck of the army and people of the DPRK to sweep away the aggressors out of this land to the last man, whoever they may be, by giving vent to the long pent-up resentment of the nation, if they dare invade even 0.001 mm of the land of the socialist country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK strong in the sense of self-respect will never read other's face in any case. They will steadily build the worthy socialist new life their own way, holding high the banner of Songun with rock-firm faith in their cause in the future.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The book, written in a diarial form, contains records of historical facts and individual figures in the period from 1864 to 1910. Maechon was the pen name of Hwang Hyon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was born in Kwangyang County, South Jolla Province, in 1855. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He won the first place in the state examination in 1888. But he refused to enter upon a wild political career, went back to his home town and was devoted to reading. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unable to control his wrath at the occupation of the country by the Japanese imperialists, he committed suicide on September 10, 1910, after leaving four poems. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Among a lot of data are records of a scramble for power between Taewongun, father of King Kojong, and Queen Min, the strong-arm politics of Queen Min and her relatives on the mother's side, the Kapsin Coup D'etat, the Kapo Reform, the Ulmi Incident, \"Emissary Incident in Hague\", the Kapo Peasant War, the Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War, fabrication of the \"Ulsa Five-point Treaty\", treacheries of pro-Japanese bureaucrats and tax extortion of people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The book details the internal situation and international relations of the then Korea embracing political, economic, military, cultural and external fields. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Maechon's Records\" serves as a valuable old book which is of importance in the study of the modern history of Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

After the liberation of Korea on August 15, 1945 they occupied south Korea under the mask of \"liberator\" and perpetrated ceaseless provocations to invade the north. Finally, in June 1950, they launched a war of aggression against the northern half of Korea, during which they ruthlessly killed a great many innocent civilians and destroyed peaceful towns and villages, schools, hospitals and even temples. They are still committing murder, plunder and moves for aggression and war in south Korea. They are really the sworn enemy of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The speakers strongly denounced the U.S. for staging mad-cap RIMPAC-2006 joint military exercises targeted against the DPRK, trampling underfoot the earnest desire of all the Koreans for peace and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They called on all the Buddhists in the north and the south of Korea and abroad to unite in Dharma-minded concord in accordance with the idea of \"By our nation itself\" to resolutely foil the maneuvers of the U.S. and its followers to ignite a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula. They also urged them to actively turn out in a practical action to bring earlier peace and reunification to the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Written prayers for the reunification of the country were read out at the masses.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
