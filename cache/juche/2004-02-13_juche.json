This can take place only in such an abnormal country as Japan where moral vulgarity and shamelessness have reached their height. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries who have acted a shock brigade in implementing the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK are now asserting that it is now possible for Japan to unilaterally apply sanctions against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a wanton violation of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration in which both sides committed themselves to abide by international law and refrain from doing any act of threatening the security of the other side. This also clearly proves that the Japanese reactionaries' thinking power has reached the state of paralysis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's hostile policy toward the DPRK is getting all the more pronounced as the days go by though it is not yet 2 years since the publication of the Pyongyang declaration. This is hardening the determination of the Korean army and people toward Japan which has brought all sorts of pain and misfortune to the Korean nation in the past to fully settle accounts with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries have constantly applied economic sanctions against the DPRK for scores of years since the end of the war. But it is the first time that they have become so frantic in their economic sanctions against the DPRK. \r\n The DPRK will regard any economic sanctions against it by the Japanese reactionaries as a declaration of war and take a resolute counter-measure for self-defense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries should clearly understand that the Koreans are not what they used to be in the past when they were oppressed and despised by the Japanese imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan will have to bear full responsibility for all the consequences to be caused to the bilateral relations if it keeps going reckless, forgetful of the historical lesson.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Such behavior of the south side is a very unreasonable act quite contrary to the nature, purpose and spirit of the inter-Korean dialogue for reconciliation, unity and reunification of the Korean nation and a blatant challenge to the aspiration and will of the nation to get reconciled and cooperate with each other and achieve the reunification.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea of \"By our nation itself\" is the common desire of the whole Korean nation, a historical terminology of the present times and a principled idea of the movement for independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south side took this attitude for fear that this idea may offend the forces opposed to reconciliation and reunification of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already disclosed, from the very outset of the year the U.S. put pressure upon the south Korean authorities to adjust the process of improving the inter-Korean relations depending on the progress made in settling the nuclear issue. In a word, the U.S. sent a red signal to this process. If the south side had a principle and remained independent it would have behaved otherwise. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are firm in their will to defend peace of the country and develop the process of reconciliation and reunification through national cooperation under the banner of \"By our nation itself\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north side at the talks served a warning to the south side by stating that if it continues paying lip-service to the development of inter-Korean relations, not respecting the idea of \"By our nation itself\" clarified in the June 15 joint declaration, and the north side can not but take other options. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south side is well advised not to drive the situation to such a phase.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "21st Century to Witness Victory of Songun Idea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 12 (KCNA) -- The 21st century will be exalted as a stirring century when the popular masses' cause of independence, the cause of socialism, will triumph under the banner of Songun idea, says Rodong Sinmun in an article Thursday.\r\n The present era witnesses a fierce struggle between socialism and imperialism and between independent forces and dominationist forces, the author of the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Imperialist reactionary forces can be contained only by armed forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary philosophy that arms precisely mean revolution and represent the victory of socialism and the Songun principle that the popular masses' cause of independence can be won only by a key and leading role played by the army were propounded in the grim reality in which unprecedented ordeals were overcome with the army in the van. And, in this course, the Songun politics have been completed as a political mode in the present era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Songun idea is an idea calling for putting the army before everything and a great line, strategy and tactics of Songun revolution calling for advancing the revolution and construction by putting the army in the foreground as the pillar and the main force of the revolution and relying upon it. It is a revolutionary idea representing the era of fierce struggle against imperialism and a revolutionary theory of a higher phase whereby all the countries and nations advocating independence are building independent and prospering new societies today when the imperialists' aggressive and predatory nature have been carried into extremes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Songun idea indicates the way of achieving the final victory of the revolution by strengthening the driving force of revolution and immensely enhancing its role as required by the Juche idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hundreds of media of over a hundred countries have vied with each other in covering the news of leader Kim Jong Il's inspection of units of the Korean People's Army and carried special write-ups and reports introducing his extraordinary leadership traits thousands of times since he started on the long journey of Songun revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Seminars, lectures and round-table talks on his revolutionary idea and exploits in Songun revolutionary leadership were held at least 300 times in over 40 countries in 2000, over 350 times in more than 60 countries in 2001,over 400 times in several dozen countries in 2002 and more than 500 times in 70-odd countries in 2003. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At least 340 party delegations from all continents of the world had visited Pyongyang to study and learn from Songun politics up to June 2002. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many groups for the study of the Juche idea all over the world are engaged in activities for the study and dissemination of Songun idea and new groups for the study of Songun politics are taking shapes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Brisk activities are underway in various countries to deeply study Songun politics and apply it to the specific realities in their countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The 21st century will shine as a century when the human cause of independence will triumph under the banner of Songun, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
