The commander of the U.S.-South Korea combined forces and the deputy manager of the U.S. boeing company are known to have forced the South Korean military to buy \"F-15K\" fighters. U.S. senator Christopher bond from Missouri state where the plant producing \"F-15K\" is located blustered that South Korea would face a \"miserable situation\" if it refuses to buy fighters. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The U.S. is forcing South Korea to bear the cost of weapons of mass destruction to be deployed there beforehand in a bid to realize its Asia-Pacific strategy and pocketing a huge amount of money through arms sale. This is the height of impudence. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minju Joson demands the U.S. face up to the situation, stop its madcap arms buildup and take a measure to withdraw the U.S. forces from South Korea. \r\n\r\n"
