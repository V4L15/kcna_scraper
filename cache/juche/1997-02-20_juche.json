He said that the north and the south must thoroughly maintain the independent stand, direct primary attention to achieving peace and promote the great unity of the nation.\r\n   The author of the article further says:\r\n   Over the past five years, the Workers' Party of Korea and the DPRK government have made every possible effort to honestly implement agreements between the north and the south and accelerate the independent and peaceful reunification of the country.    However, all their efforts have failed to bear fruits owing to the perfidious acts of the South Korean authorities.\r\n   Particularly, the inter-Korean relations have been driven back to the acute phase of confrontation before the adoption of the north-south agreement and greater obstacles and difficulties have been created in the way of peace and the peaceful reunification of the country since the Kim Young Sam group, who are more anti-national, anti-reunification and bellicose than the former military dictators, took office.\r\n   With the Kim Young Sam group left intact, neither national independence nor peace nor the peaceful reunification of the country can be achieved nor can the fellow countrymen evade being victims to a nuclear war of outside forces. All the fellow countrymen should turn out as one man in the struggle to overthrow the Kim Young Sam group opposed to national independence, peace and peaceful reunification. \r\n\r\n"
