This is clear evidence that they are inveterate fascist tyrants and enemy who are dead set against independence, democracy and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"security law\" should be repealed at once as unanimously demanded by the South Korean people and the world progressives, concludes the commentary. \r\n\r\n"

As a result, the waters north of the line have come under the KPA side's military control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nA grave armed conflict took place between the KPA and the South Korean puppet army in the waters of the west sea on June 15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The conflict between the two sides brought about an unprecedented tragedy of bloodshed that claimed sinking of battleships and human losses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The military conflicts were mainly ascribable to their different assertion about the maritime demarcation line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK and the United States have had six rounds of general officer-level meetings, two rounds of colonel-level meetings and several contacts between staff officers so far to prevent recurrence of conflicts in the waters at issue and ease the tense situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAt the meetings and contacts the KPA side proposed to fix the Military Demarcation Line by extending the provincial boundary line between Hwanghae-do and Kyonggi-do (A-B) stipulated in paragraph 13, B of the Korean Armistice Agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   On the contrary, the U.S. forces side insisted on the \"Northern Limit Line\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe \"Northern Limit Line\" is an illegal line that the U.S. forces side unilaterally set deep inside the DPRK territorial waters, disregarding the KAA and the international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. forces side's insistence on the \"line\" was an grave encroachment upon the DPRK's sovereignty and, after all, the meetings produced no results. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThus, the KPA side could not but take its unilateral option. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK will exercise its right to defend the waters under its military control. \r\n\r\n"

This is nothing but a premeditated and intentional  criminal move to throw a wet blanket over the desire for reunification growing strong among the compatriots, occasioned by this festival, and block the hard-won three-way solidarity and alliance among compatriots in the north, south and overseas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He underscored the need for all organizations of reunification movement and people from all walks of life in South Korea to set the struggle for the release of pro-reunification patriotic figures as their urgent task and vigorously struggle to implement it in solidarity and unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities should drop their anachronistic views on confrontation with the north, guarantee the freedom of activities to all forces desirous of reunification through alliance with the north and immediately release the delegates of pro-reunification patriotic organizations, he urged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   An appeal to the South Korean people from all walks of life was adopted at the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The appeal said that an energetic  struggle for the release of the delegates is not just a struggle to save a few pro-reunification patriotic figures but a just patriotic struggle to defend democracy and rights of people from fascism and bring about a phase of a turning point in national unity and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The appeal called for fully supporting and encouraging the struggle of the south headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification (Pomminryon), the \"National Alliance for Democracy and Reunification\" and the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils Hanchongryon for the release of the delegates who visited the north and tearing off the South Korean authorities' provision branding the south headquarters of Pomminryon and \"Hanchongryon\" as \"enemy benefiting organizations\" and defending the pro-reunification patriotic organizations from the fascist suppression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nPointing out that the \"National Security Law\" in South Korea is a rare fascist law for division which antagonizes compatriots and bars the national unity and reunification,  the appeal calls for escalating the struggle to scrap the \"NSL\" rejected and denounced at home and abroad, checking and frustrating the South Korean ruling quarters' anti-north confrontation and their \"cooperation\" with foreign forces intended to do harm to compatriots. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The appeal underscores the need to strongly reject the \"engagement policy\" and the \"argument about the principal enemy\" on the lips of the South Korean ruling quarters intended to obstruct the normalization of the north-south relations and fan up north-south confrontation and thoroughly implement the three charters of national reunification and the five-point policy of great national unity, the great banners for national reunification and national unity, and thus accelerate the independent and peaceful reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The appeal said that all people in the north will as ever fully support the just struggle of the South Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Present at the meeting were senior officials of political parties and  social organizations including Kim Yong Dae and O Ik Je. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
