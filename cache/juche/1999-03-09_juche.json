This is a manifestation of absolute support and trust of all the people in the socialist government, Rodong Sinmun says, and goes on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elections powerfully demonstrated the might of the political and ideological unity and cohesion of the revolutionary ranks, which have grown purer and stronger despite rigorous ordeals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the stirring reality produced by the single-hearted unity which grows stronger despite manifold difficulties that all the electors turned out and cast yes votes.   Thanks to this unbreakable unity and cohesion the revolutionary government remains mighty  and the country is demonstrating its dignity as an ideologically powerful socialist state.   Elections have provided a firm guarantee for enhancing the militant function and role of the people's government.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The local people's assemblies have been reorganized with people's true representatives with the result that the revolutionary government has struck roots deeper among the popular masses and the revolutionary system of state structure has come to display its great superiority and vitality.   This is a proud victory achieved in the year that marks  a great turning-point in building a powerful nation.   Through the elections  Korean-style socialism, which enjoys full support from the popular masses, demonstrated once again its invincibility at home and abroad.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The election results clearly proved that neither moves for isolation and stifling nor vicious ideological and cultural infiltration by the imperialists and the reactionaries can ever destroy Korean-style socialism.   Minju Joson stresses that the elections provided an important occasion in strikingly demonstrating the superiority of Korean style-socialism based on the Juche idea and accelerating the building of a powerful nation. \r\n\r\n"

They underlined the action program and tasks of the parties advocating socialism, including matters of building revolutionary party and increasing support, cooperation, solidarity and unity among the parties.   They also underscored the need to learn from the experience of the WPK in the party building and leadership, adding that the ideology and theory of Kim Jong Il on preserving the Juche character and national character in the revolution and construction, were the great  idea and theory that serve as a guideline for the world's progressive parties desiring socialism in party construction and activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The seminar adopted a joint statement supporting the struggle of the WPK and the Korean people and issued a communique of the seminar as its final document.   It also adopted a letter to Kim Jong Il.   It decided to have the 4th seminar in next February in Mexico under the name of \"forum of the world political parties for building of socialism\" and formed a preparatory committee. \r\n\r\n"

This is an inevitable consequence of the flunkeyist, treacherous and anti-social misrule of the present self-proclaimed \"government for the people,\" the reporter said, and went on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief executive of South Korea in a \"dialogue with the people\" and a \"press conference\" cried that he would push ahead with the \"restructuring of business groups\" even though the number of the unemployed increases. This is the worst anti-social and anti-national one which can never be pardoned.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean workers whose existence is hourly being threatened should not resign themselves to retreat. If they expect anything from the authority's misrule and make any concession as regards their vital interests, they will undergo bitterer misfortunes and sufferings than now.   The South Korean workers should give a decisive blow to the South Korean rulers and regain their vital rights through  their intensified struggle.   They also should direct the edge of struggle against the U.S., the root cause of all misfortunes.   All the members of the trade unions  and workers in the no�@North Korea will firmly stand by  their fellows in South Korea.   The reporter referred to concrete measures to extend solidarity to their struggle.   Speeches were made and an appeal to the South Korean workers was adopted at the meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The appeal noted that South Korea has now become a living hell of workers with the total bankruptcy of the economy and unprecedented massive unemployment.   The only way out for them is to struggle against the colonial rule and traitorous moves of the South Korean rulers to the last, the appeal said, and went on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the U.S. colonial rule continues, there will be no improvement in the plight of the South Korean workers and people although \"regime\" is replaced there  hundreds of times.    The workers should wage a death-defying struggle holding aloft the banner of the anti-U.S. independence and put an end to the U.S. colonial rule.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They must firmly unite around an independent labor organization, strengthen solidarity among sections, business categories and regions and endeavor to realize worker-student solidarity and worker-farmer solidarity.   They will certainly win in their just struggle to build a new independent and democratic society where popular masses enjoy a genuine life as masters. \r\n  \r\n"

South Korea has been turned into the most dangerous hotbed of nuclear war and the largest nuclear advance base in the far east under the aggressive U.S. Asia strategy, the paper recalls, saying:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deployed there are almost all types of U.S. made nuclear weapons and the danger of nuclear war is growing as days go by.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   With the present situation left uncontrolled, not only the Korean peninsula but also Asia and the rest of the world will not be free from terrible nuclear disaster.   The United States has hindered the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, increasing nuclear war danger.

The U.S. can never  escape war damage as life-and-death battles are bound to be fought on the front and at home simultaneously.

It accused the DPRK of \"human rights problem\", arguing there is a \"camp of political offenders in North Korea\" and it is a \"wasteland of human rights.\"   This assertion is a serious encroachment upon the Korean-style socialist system and our sovereignty and a flagrant interference in our internal affair as it utterly distorted the reality of the DPRK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As everybody knows, all citizens of the DPRK enjoy a life as true masters of the state and the society and human rights are legally guaranteed.   The Worker's Party and the government of Korea are pursuing the policy of respecting human rights to the utmost, whereby political rights and freedom are guaranteed to all people.   Therefore, \"human rights problem\" does not exist in the DPRK at all.   The U.S. hue and cry over the \"human rights problem in North Korea\" is nothing but a foolish attempt to tarnish the image of the DPRK and undermine its single-hearted unity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In actuality, the United States is not in a position to slander others over the \"human rights issue\".   Tens of millions of unemployed and beggars are wandering about streets overlooked by the \"statue of liberty\", the so-called symbol of \"liberty,\" and murderers, robbers and terrorists are strutting about everywhere in the United States.   Before talking about the \"human rights issue\" in other country the United States should feel shame before the world for the fact that there were two attempts to assassinate the incumbent U.S. President.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Today the American \"human rights standard\", that reverses black and white, can not go down with anybody. Moreover, the U.S. view on human rights, which it considers to be a cure for all,  cannot but be the target of unanimous denunciation by the world public.   Before styling itself a \"judge of human rights\", the United States is well advised to pay primary attention to solving its own human rights problem. \r\n\r\n"
