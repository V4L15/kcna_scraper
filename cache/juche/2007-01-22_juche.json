They should realize a great alliance against conservatism to resolutely foil the last-ditch efforts of the pro-U.S. anti-reunification traitorous forces to return to power and throw them overboard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans should fully support and defend the historic June 15 joint declaration, a landmark for independent reunification in the new century, and categorically reject the outsiders and their followers' moves to stem the trend of the era of \"By our nation itself.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans should fully support and uphold the Songun policy, lifeline of the nation, as they value national dignity and sovereignty and desire peace and reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement expressed the expectation that the political parties and politicians in south Korea and all other Koreans would positively respond to the patriotic appeal made by the DPRK to glorify the June 15 era of reunification by attaching importance to the nation, defending peace and achieving unity.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is said that this \"devilish war hardware\" remains there for over four months for the purpose of acquiring the operational capacity under the climatic conditions on the Korean Peninsula and take part in the large-scale U.S.-south Korea joint military maneuvers slated to take place in spring.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Saturday observes in a signed commentary in this regard: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a clear proof that the U.S. imperialists are busy preparing a war against the DPRK behind the scene of the six-party talks as the above-said arms buildup is a reckless military move challenging the desire and will of all the Koreans and the world progressives aspiring after peace and security on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialist warmongers claim that their introduction of the ill-famed fighter bombers into south Korea is \"part of the ordinary exercises\" and \"routine rotating deployment\" but this is nothing but an artifice to cover up their dangerous scenario. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present relations between the DPRK and the U.S. and the resultant tense situation prevailing on the Korean Peninsula require them to make options helpful to the solution to the issue. Unilateral and provocative actions would do both nothing good but deteriorate the situation. However, the U.S. is contemplating largest-ever military exercises targeted against the DPRK by mobilizing Stealth fighter bombers, while disturbing the peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue between the two sides under an unreasonable pretext. It is clear to everybody that this is a revelation of the U.S. sinister intention to torpedo the six-party talks and do harm to the DPRK through preemptive attacks on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S would be well advised to face up to the reality. It had better pull at once war hardware including F-117 Stealth fighter bombers out of south Korea, halt its reckless war moves against the DPRK and withdraw its aggression forces from south Korea as early as possible.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They are making desperate efforts to win the \"elections\" slated to take place this year by calling back the departed soul of the fascist dictators in the past who killed many youths and students including Pak.

            "content": "Kim Jong Il Gives Field Guidance to Newly Built Thaechon Youth Power Station No. 4\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 21 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il gave field guidance to the newly built Thaechon Youth Power Station No. 4.\r\n After being briefed on the construction of the power station before a huge painting showing its panoramic view, he went round its exterior and interior to acquaint himself in detail with its construction and electricity production. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Making the rounds of the gigantic dam that has appeared across the wide River Taeryong, a large man-made lake, a generator room and a power distribution room, he was greatly satisfied to learn that the builders have successfully built a great structure to be handed to posterity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said that this astonishing miracle is a striking demonstration of the might of the unbreakable unity and cohesion of the army and the people of the DPRK who formed a harmonious whole with the Party and the leader and the tremendous potential of the independent national economy and one more great victory won by the Korean people in their struggle to valiantly shatter the moves of the imperialists to isolate and stifle the DPRK and add brilliance to Korean-style socialism centred on the popular masses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He heard a lot of beautiful stories told about young people in the course of the construction, while looking at a collection of works created by members of the youth shock brigade titled \"The River Taeryong Tells.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The monumental edifices of eternal value in the country are associated with the precious blood and sweat of the young people in the era of the Workers' Party, he noted, adding that the cause of the Korean revolution pioneered by the forerunners is given steady continuity as the large contingent of the youngsters, the most viable combat unit, is playing a leading role in the defence of the country and socialist construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He put forward the tasks to be tackled to boost the nation's electricity production, saying that it is one of the most important issues in making a leaping advance in the national economy to give definite precedence to the electricity production. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Building hydro-power stations on a large scale is the short cut to satisfactorily meeting the growing need for electricity in the country which has many rivers and streams rich in water resources, he said, stressing the need to continue focusing efforts on this in the future, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to keep the electricity production going at a high rate now that many power stations have sprung up in different parts of the country in recent years, it is necessary to steadily improve the management of the equipment and technological control and, at the same time, widely introduce advanced technology, he noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that it is important to put an end to the waste of electricity while increasing the electricity production, he underlined the need to raise the efficiency of the power transmission system and do away with the loss of electricity in transmission. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He called upon the officials in the field of power industry to minutely organize economic work, bearing deep in mind the heavy responsibility they should fulfil to build an economic power, and thus decisively settle the acute problem of electricity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by Kim Phyong Hae, chief secretary of the North Phyongan Provincial Committee of the WPK, and Pak Nam Gi, department director of the C.C., WPK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
