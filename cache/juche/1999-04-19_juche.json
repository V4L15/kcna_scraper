He went on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   The popular uprising in April 1960 was the first victory of the South Korean people in the struggle against the U.S. and their stooges.

But, the freedom, liberation, a new politics and new society aspired after by the uprising have not yet been realised in the south.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe grim situation in South Korea without independence and democracy and the danger of war daily increasing in the Korean peninsula are aggravating because the Kim Dae Jung group is pursuing the worst policy of dependence on outsiders and flunkeyist treacheries, while    persisting in \"cooperation\" with the U.S. and Japanese aggressor forces.   The moves of the U.S. and Japanese aggressors and the Kim Dae Jung group are the most vicious challenge to independence, democracy, peace and reunification.  They should not be tolerated as they go against the current of the times and the development of history.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries should ponder over the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by the policy of domination over South Korea, anti-north confrontation and war rackets, and stop rash acts, domination and interference in South Korea. The Kim Dae Jung group should draw a lesson from the disgraceful end of its predecessors that were engaged in  dependence on outsiders and flunkeyist treacheries and promptly put a stop to the treacheries and step down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The NDFSK and patriotic people of all social standings will closely unite to decisively frustrate any vicious challenge of the colonial fascist forces and struggle vigorously for independence, democracy and reunification.  \r\n\r\n"

The credit for this goes to General Secretary Kim Jong Il who, guided by noble political ethics, has devotedly worked for the immortality of the President.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the last 5 years Kim Jong Il put forward the slogan \"Let us arm ourselves more firmly with the revolutionary ideas of the great leader comrade  Kim Il Sung \" and published \"the Worker's Party of Korea is the Party of the Great Leader Comrade  Kim Il Sung\" (October 2, 1995), \"Let Us Exalt the Brilliance of Comrade  Kim Il Sung's Idea on the Youth Movement and the Achievements Made under His Leadership\" (August 24, 1996), \"Let Us Carry Out the Great Leader Comrade  Kim Il Sung's Instructions for National Reunification\" (August 4, 1997) and other famous works so as to defend the President's revolutionary ideas and exploits in their entirety.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRepresenting the desire and will of the Korean people, Kim Jong Il, the incarnation of loyalty and filial piety towards the preceding leader, built the Kumsusan Assembly Hall where the President worked until the last period of his life into the Kumsusan Memorial Palace, the sacred Temple of Juche, to preserve him in state.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    It was 3 years after the President's demise that  Kim Jong Il instituted the Juche era and Sun' s Day in order to exalt the brilliance of the President's revolutionary life and great achievements for all ages.
