To this end, the U.S. has steadily shipped its weapons into south Korea, keeping its aggressor troops there for more than half a century. South Korea is recognized as the biggest advanced nuclear base of the U.S. in the Far East.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is often trumpeting about the non-existent \"security threat\" in a bid to cover up its aggressive design.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, it is nonsensical to claim that the U.S. national interests are encroached on by the far-off DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is no more than sophism to talk about its plan to sell missiles to south Korea under the pretext of \"transfer of the right to control wartime operations.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is mulling raking up huge profits through the sale of missiles under the pretext of this transfer of the right.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a daydream for the U.S. to realize its ambition for aggression by instigating the south Korean war-thirsty forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. had better roll back its anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK."
