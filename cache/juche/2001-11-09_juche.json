            "content": "Abolition of S. Korean \"Security Law\" called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 9 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article calls for the repeal of the South Korean \"Security Law\" (SL) which defines the fellow countrymen in the north as the enemy, suppresses and punishes any South Korean desirous of reunification on the charge of being \"elements benefiting the enemy\" and obstructs the implementation of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration.\r\n As long as this law remains in force in South Korea, it is absolutely impossible to achieve national reconciliation and unity nor is it possible to make contacts and exchange between the north and the south successful in conformity with the nation's desire for reunification, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The repeal of the SL is urgently required by the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The era of independence and reunification calls upon the Korean nation to reject foreign domination and interference and work for reunifying the country independently and peacefully by its concerted efforts in the spirit of the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The SL has been rebuffed and condemned not only by the Korean nation but the world progressive people and has no justification to remain in force as it is an anti-national, anti-reunification law going against such trend of the times and the nation's desire for independent reunification. The SL is a stumbling block lying in the way of implementing the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is because of this law that those people in South Korea who long for the north and aspire after the independent reunification are treated as \"criminals\" and taken to prison. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean authorities are clamping down upon pro-reunification patriots by invoking the SL and are frantically stepping up arms buildup and war exercises against the fellow countrymen in the north on the strength of this law. This is, in essence, a perfidy to the north, the other party of the dialogue for reunification, and a treachery negating the spirit of the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The SL is a symbol of confrontation with the north and anti-reunification acts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean authorities should abolish the ill-famed SL. This is the way for them to shake off the disgrace of being an anti-reunification separatist group and escape from the nation's curse and condemnation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should opt to immediately scrap the anti-national, fascist and anti-reunification SL as demanded by the era and the nation.    \r\n\r\n"

All these funds are reportedly used mainly for the transport of U.S. military equipment in South Korea and the payment to U.S. technical personnel.    \r\n\r\n"
