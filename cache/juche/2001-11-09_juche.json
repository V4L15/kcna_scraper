            "content": "Japan's moves for militarist expansion under fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 9 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the National Democratic Front of South Korea (NDFSK) issued a statement on Nov. 7 denouncing Japan's daily escalating moves for overseas aggression, according to the Seoul-based radio voice of national salvation.\r\n Referring to the fact that Japan recently rigged up the \"anti-terrorism special law\" under the pretext of \"assisting the U.S. in its retaliatory war against terrorism\" despite strong opposition at home and abroad, the statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This goes to prove that Japan has entered the stage of realizing the ambition for overseas aggression which it has persistently pursued over the last 50 odd years since its defeat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The  NDFSK condemns the adoption of this law as a vicious challenge and an unpardonable crime against all Koreans who have demanded Japan make an apology and compensation for its past crimes and opposed its overseas expansion and strongly demands it nullify the law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is well advised to face up to the trend of the times, properly understand our people's strong will against Japan, drop its design for overseas aggression and make a sincere apology and compensation for its crimes committed against our nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The whole nation should foil the Japanese reactionaries' reinvasion through a nation-wide anti-Japanese resistance and force them to pay for their crimes in order to give vent to its grudge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The NDFSK will join all the people and the world peace-loving people in the anti-Japanese resistance and decisively smash Japan's ambition for reinvasion.     \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Abolition of S. Korean \"Security Law\" called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 9 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article calls for the repeal of the South Korean \"Security Law\" (SL) which defines the fellow countrymen in the north as the enemy, suppresses and punishes any South Korean desirous of reunification on the charge of being \"elements benefiting the enemy\" and obstructs the implementation of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration.\r\n As long as this law remains in force in South Korea, it is absolutely impossible to achieve national reconciliation and unity nor is it possible to make contacts and exchange between the north and the south successful in conformity with the nation's desire for reunification, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The repeal of the SL is urgently required by the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The era of independence and reunification calls upon the Korean nation to reject foreign domination and interference and work for reunifying the country independently and peacefully by its concerted efforts in the spirit of the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The SL has been rebuffed and condemned not only by the Korean nation but the world progressive people and has no justification to remain in force as it is an anti-national, anti-reunification law going against such trend of the times and the nation's desire for independent reunification. The SL is a stumbling block lying in the way of implementing the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is because of this law that those people in South Korea who long for the north and aspire after the independent reunification are treated as \"criminals\" and taken to prison. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean authorities are clamping down upon pro-reunification patriots by invoking the SL and are frantically stepping up arms buildup and war exercises against the fellow countrymen in the north on the strength of this law. This is, in essence, a perfidy to the north, the other party of the dialogue for reunification, and a treachery negating the spirit of the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The SL is a symbol of confrontation with the north and anti-reunification acts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean authorities should abolish the ill-famed SL. This is the way for them to shake off the disgrace of being an anti-reunification separatist group and escape from the nation's curse and condemnation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should opt to immediately scrap the anti-national, fascist and anti-reunification SL as demanded by the era and the nation.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "6th inter-Korean ministerial talks open \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kosong, November 9 (KCNA) -- The 6th inter-Korean ministerial talks for implementing the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration were opened at Mt. Kumgang Hotel today.\r\n Present at the talks on the north side were the members of the delegation led by Kim Ryong Song, chief councillor of the DPRK cabinet, and its suite members and on the south side were the members of the delegation with Hong Sun Yong, minister of unification, as chief delegate and its suite members. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the talks the head of the north side delegation made a keynote speech first. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the basic spirit of the joint declaration to settle the issue of the country's reunification independently by the concerted efforts of the nation and it is a specially important issue at present to respect and encourage this spirit, he said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was in that spirit and from the stand of trusting the south side that the north side has had consultations to resume the ministerial talks and develop cooperation and exchange under the complicated situation around Korea and made every possible effort to implement the points which were agreed upon at the 5th ministerial talks including the exchange of the visiting groups of separated families and relatives and Taekwon-do exhibition teams. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In spite of such positive stand and efforts on the part of the north side, the south side created an unexpected dangerous situation by seriously provoking its dialogue partner and placing \"cooperation\" with outside forces above that between compatriots.     This made it impossible to implement the points agreed upon by both sides. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such developments were attributable to the U.S.-toeing policy of the south side bereft of an independent stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This policy followed by the south side, rendering it impossible to implement the points agreed upon at the 5th ministerial talks is little short of totally negating the basic spirit of the joint declaration the keynote of which is independent national reunification and ignoring the common interests of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no change in the south side's stand though nearly one year and a half has passed since the adoption of the joint declaration. Regarding the north as its \"principal enemy,\" the south side has taken dangerous military steps and committed provocations against it, straining the situation. Moreover, it is arresting, detaining and persecuting members of pro-reunification movement organizations and patriotic figures on charges of being \"elements benefiting the enemy.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A particular mention should be made of the fact that the south side sent its delegation abroad on a mission to ask someone to lead the north to \"reform\" and \"opening\". This is an intolerable grave challenge to the north as this behaviour totally ignores the joint declaration which calls for recognizing the systems in the north and the south and working for reunification on the basis of the co-existence of the systems and defames the dignity of the north and its system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these facts compel the north side to express serious worry about the destiny of the joint declaration rather than about the issue of implementing the points agreed upon at the 5th ministerial talks, the head of the north side said, demanding the south side make clear its stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no change in the stand of the north side to respect the joint declaration, implement the agreed points of both sides at an early date and settle the issues through dialogue, he said, calling upon the south side to positively respond to the north side's call for steps to defuse the present tense situation and atmosphere including the lifting of the \"emergency alert\", first of all, and set again the timetable for the implementation of the agreed points now at a stalemate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The chief delegate of the south side spoke next at the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The talks continue.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
