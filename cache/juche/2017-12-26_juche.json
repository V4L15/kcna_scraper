The reason is because the U.S. is holding the post of a permanent member and committing high-handed and arbitrary practices.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. call for UN reform is not to opt for the reform of the UNSC as wished by the majority of countries around the world but to reduce the organization into a body serving it better for realizing its ambition for world domination.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In disregard of the demand and interests of the UN member nations, the U.S. is going to abuse the issue of the UN reform for establishing its domination.

It has also put in place the pretext and military conditions for intervening in case of emergency on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently it is calling for possessing 1,000-5,000 km medium range missile which has central China and Russia within the firing range while getting keen on the access to \"capabilities for attacking enemy positions\" and introduction of \"Aegis Usher\", interceptor missile system for ground deployment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters here is the reason why Japan is modifying the \"defense guidelines\" earlier than schedule which it had originally planned to be 10 year-term defense guidelines.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The fact that the focus of the reexamination would include tolerance of the exercise of \"right to collective self-defense\" and increased purchase of American arms and Japan-U.S. cooperation clearly proves the intention sought by Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This amounts to a declaration that Japan would step up the preparations for aggression by citing the DPRK and neighboring countries as pretexts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The rhetoric about \"threat from surrounding areas\" oft-repeated by Japan is little short of a prelude to an reinvasion aimed to paint their criminal nature of rushing headlong into turning the country into a military giant as \"legitimate\" and openly come out for overseas expansion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The past history shows that loud rhetoric about \"threat from surrounding areas\" heard from the Japanese archipelago made the country rapidly lurch toward right and militarist and heated up the zeal for reinvasion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The international community is required to approach with vigilance the moves of Japan whetting the sword of reinvasion by faulting others."
