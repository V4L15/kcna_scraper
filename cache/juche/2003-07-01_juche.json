Kim Jong Il's wise leadership found a vivid manifestation in that he has remarkably strengthened the driving force of revolution as required by a new era and brought about a new turn in the developing revolution in reliance upon its might. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK increased the driving force of the revolution in every way and built a powerful socialist nation of independence, self-sustenance and self-defence on this land with its might. This is the immortal feat performed by the president. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The whole party and the entire army and all the people should uphold Kim Jong Il's idea and leadership in a do-or-die spirit, displaying the spirit of devotedly defending the leader and devotedly carrying out his instructions. This single-hearted unity serves as a sure guarantee for the victory in the struggle to smash the imperialist's moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK and in the drive to build a great prosperous powerful nation in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The wise leadership of Kim Jong Il, who has led the Korean revolution along the road of Juche, is clearly demonstrated by the fact that he has built up the military power strong enough to accomplish the president's cause. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In recent years Kim Jong Il has strengthened the Korean People's Army into invincible forces, consolidated our national defence industry and built up the military power strong enough to beat back any imperialist aggression by providing dynamic Songun revolutionary leadership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is thanks to the invincible self-defensive military power and the strong military deterrent force built up under the leadership of Kim Jong Il that the DPRK has vigorously advanced along the road of Juche chosen by its people themselves while defending the sovereignty of the nation and its vital rights even under the present situation where the imperialists are engrossed in high-handed practices and aggression and wantonly violating the sovereignty of countries and nations.    \r\n\r\n"

The U.S. is keen to refer the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula to the UNSC in a bid to have its president's statement adopted for increased pressure upon the DPRK.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday dismisses this as a wanton violation of the purpose of the forum and its principles adopted at the second ministerial meeting of the forum held in August 1995. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. misused the forum for forcibly adopting the statement that reflects its unreasonable assertion calling for interference in the internal affairs of the DPRK and pressure upon it. This was prompted by its sinister intention to increase international pressure upon the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is preposterous and unreasonable for the U.S. to try to bring the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula up for discussion at the UNSC and force it to take stronger measures. This is a very insolent, provocative and dangerous move. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The UN is by no means a body that should allow a big country to control and pressurize small countries to meet its interests and aim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The UN should not be misused to serve the purpose of the U.S. policy of pressurizing the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the UNSC is to deal with the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, it should blame the U.S. for having spawned the issue and escalated the tensions on the principle of impartiality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is none other than the U.S. which openly listed non-signatories to the NPT as targets of its preemptive nuclear attacks, unilaterally scrapped the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework and the DPRK-U.S. Joint Statement and wantonly violated the NPT and all other international agreements. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The UNSC should strongly blame the U.S. for those criminal responsibilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. intention to use the un as means of putting pressure upon the DPRK over its nuclear issue and secure a justification for provoking a new Korean war would only create an uncontrollable situation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
