            "content": "U.S. urged to compensate for DPRK's loss of electricity \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 6 (KCNA) -- The construction of light-water reactors (LWRS) with a total generating capacity of 2,000 mw(e) which the United States committed itself to provide to the DPRK by 2003 under the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework (AF) is too much delayed and thus the implementation of the agreement has reached a serious pass.\r\n Though 7 years have passed since the adoption of the agreement the site preparation has not yet been completed, to say nothing of the start of the ground work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the U.S. has taken a number of opportunities such as the recent Honolulu meeting to spread the theory of \"early inspection\" of the \"nuclear-related facilities\" of the DPRK instead of taking measures to compensate for the resultant loss of electricity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK-U.S. agreed framework stipulates that negotiations should be held with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) after the most of the lwr project has been carried out and before the delivery of the major nuclear-related parts and, accordingly, the agreement on assurances should be implemented. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S., turning aside from the present situation where the date for the completion of the LWRS can not be predicted, has come out with sophism that it is necessary to conduct an early special inspection in order to complete the lwr project as early as possible because this inspection to be made before the delivery of the key parts will take a considerable time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The inspection is unthinkable before a great deal of the LWR project has been carried out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. talk about the \"early inspection\" before fulfilling its commitment is a trick to backpedal all its commitments under the AF and raise issues which have nothing to do with the AF in a bid to evade its responsibility for the delay in the LWR project and compensation for the loss of electricity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is preposterous for the U.S. to unilaterally pull up the DPRK without implementing the AF. \r\n As far as the implementation of the AF is concerned, the DPRK had completely frozen the graphite-moderated reactors and their related facilities within one month, allowed the IAEA's inspection of them and completed the safe storage of spent-fuel rods. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the U.S. has taken no measures to settle the issue of the indefinite delay in the construction of LWRS it committed itself to provide to the DPRK in return for the DPRK's nuclear freeze. Yet, the U.S. demanded the DPRK take \"necessary measures for the successful implementation of the AF.\" This is like a thief crying \"stop the thief \". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the DPRK repeatedly clarified, the demand for compensation for the loss of electricity is not a tactic but a crucial issue related to the right to existence. if this issue is not solved, the DPRK will be left with no option but to restart the construction of graphite-moderated reactors for its existence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has suffered a huge loss of electricity due to its freeze of the nuclear power industry under the agreed framework. If it had gone ahead with the construction of the graphite-moderated reactors as scheduled it would have already completed them, created a total generating capacity of over 1 million kw and produced a lot of electricity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK can not sit idle for an indefinite period while leaving the issue of electricity vital to the state to be settled by others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It will be a serious mistake if the U.S. considers the DPRK's demand for the compensation for the loss of electricity as a lever for putting a sort of \"pressure\" or reigning over \"negotiations.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Before the adoption of the AF the DPRK made a political concession to sacrifice its independent nuclear power industry out of its good intention to clear the U.S. of its \"nuclear suspicion\" and promote global peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But now we do not feel any need to abide by the AF allowing its right to existence to be infringed upon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the deserved right and option for the DPRK to restart the construction of graphite-moderated reactors for its right to existence unless compensation is made for the electricity loss resulting from the heavy delay in the lwr project which makes its prospect gloomy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. truly wants to save the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework it should meet the DPRK's demand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. fails to meet the demand for the compensation for the loss of electricity, it will be hard to save the AF from its collapse and the DPRK will find no option but to go its own way.    \r\n\r\n"
