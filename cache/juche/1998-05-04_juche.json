The noble spirit of the revolutionary forerunners should be implanted in the mind of the servicemen of the rising generation and the reactionary nature of the imperialist aggressors and class enemies should be brought home to them, so that they may defend the socialist system centred on the popular masses, the precious gains of the Korean people, at the risk of their lives with burning hatred for the enemy, he stressed.\r\n   He called at the operation command room to learn about how the unit was discharging its combat duty.\r\n   He said that the revolutionary armed forces should be further strengthened to cope with the ever intensified new war manoeuvres of the imperialists and their stooges against the DPRK.\r\n   He set forth highly important tasks which serve as guidelines in increasing the combat power of the unit in every way.\r\n   He went round the cultural education facilities and compound of the unit. He noted that the construction of minor power stations now under way should be completed fast to electrify all the supply service facilities of the unit.\r\n   He further said that the army should be a model in the land management including the forests, roads, rivers and streams around the unit.\r\n   He posed for a souvenir photograph with the officers and nen of the unit.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The fascists mobilized 34  police companies more than 4,500 strong and helicopters on April 9 and reinforced the repressive forces at  over 7,000 the next day, the opening day of the meeting.\r\n   After they frustrated the meeting, they issued a repressive order to arrest the interim chairman, deputies and all other hardcore members of the organisation and sent the police across South Korea the list of 400-500 persons to be arrested.\r\n   They plan to upgrade police tools in Kwangju, Taejon and Ulsan to local police agencies and form detached  police forces and gave even park caretakers the judicial police power, expanding repressive tools and forces. And they are mercilessly cracking down on the people's aspiration for reunification and their progressive activities. \r\n   All facts show that the present rulers are suppressors little different from the preceding civilian-veiled fascist clique.    \r\n\r\n"

Their act proves to be shameless.\r\n   By screening the film the Japanese reactionaries seek to eradicate the guilty conscience of the past and implant the pride of the past in the minds of the Japanese.\r\n   Their scheming to incite what they call pride and militarism among the people through such a propaganda medium as film clearly proves that the moves to revive militarism and stage a comeback have already reached a dangerous phase.\r\n   Now the Asian people are not what they were in the past.\r\n   If the Japanese reactionaries dare repeat the past, ignoring the trend of the time, they will certainly meet nothing but a thousandfold revenge and defeat.    \r\n   \r\n"
