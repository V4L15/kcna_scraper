Korean Confrontational Maniacs' Wild Rumor Dismissed\r\n Pyongyang, October 24 (KCNA) -- A few days ago, riff-raffs under the mask of \"scholar\" floated a wild rumor about what they called \"organized abduction of civilians\" by the north in the period of the June 25 war and the like at the prodding of the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors. This comes under fire by signed commentaries of leading newspapers today. \n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said diatribe is nothing but a despicable plot of those keen to seek a pretext for steadily bedeviling the inter-Korean relations out of bitterness towards fellow countrymen as it is the renewed unbearable insult and provocation to the DPRK, they observe. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe aim sought by the Lee group in floating groundless rumor is to push the deadlocked inter-Korean relations to an extreme phase and, at the same time, stoke hostility and distrust in fellow countrymen in the south Korean society and totally hamstring the implementation of the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration, notes Rodong Sinmun. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group is becoming vociferous in the row to distort history under the pretext of putting an end to the so-called \"leftist tendency,\" asserting without hesitation that \"history can be rewritten if a regime is replaced by a new one.\" Consequently, the people's just struggle against injustice and dictatorship is branded as \"rebellion of leftist forces\" and such crimes committed by traitor Syngman Rhee, puppet of the U.S., against humanity as killing tens of thousands of fellow countrymen during his tenure of office including the period of past war and others are whitewashed to an intolerable extent. It is crystal clear that this is a revelation of the black-hearted intention of the said group to escalate the confrontation with the DPRK by rewriting history to serve the ultra-right conservative purpose and recklessly fabricating any case. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is part of the above-said scenario that the nonsensical story about \"abduction of civilians\" was faked up and the funny anti-DPRK burlesque is going on in south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said ruckus is as foolish an act as the desperate effort made by those who find themselves in a dilemma to seek a way out of it. The regime of traitors in the grip of the worst ruling crisis is trying hard to find a way out in kicking up a racket of confrontation with the DPRK as the last resort but this will get them nowhere.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson urges the Lee group to bear this in mind and immediately stop the reckless anti-DPRK smear campaign."

This clearly proves that the group of traitors approaches the issue of the inter-Korean relations from a conservative viewpoint, i.e. from the viewpoint dating back to the past era of confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is evidenced by the fact that the above-said group is justifying its traitorous \"policy towards the north,\" defaming the idea of \"By our nation itself\" as \"narrow-minded nationalism,\" brutally suppressing the forces supporting the June 15 declaration on the charge of violation of the \"National Security Law\" under the motto of \"eliminating the left-wing forces\" and escalating the military tension on the Korean Peninsula in collusion with foreign forces, posing the greatest danger of a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The moves of the Lee group are, in essence, rash acts against the nation and times as they are designed to render the inter-Korean relations extremely tense, block the movement of the south Korean people for achieving reunification through alliance with the north, intensify the crackdown upon the progressive organizations for the reunification movement and personages and bring back the June 15 era of reunification to those of the past era of confrontation in a bid to turn back the clock of history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe reality clearly indicates that the moves of the Lee group to do harm to the DPRK have reached an unbearable phase and when this is overlooked, a war is bound to break out on the peninsula and all the compatriots will have to suffer a nuclear war disaster. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is beyond doubt that if the moves of the ultra-right conservative forces were not frustrated, the independent and democratic development of the south Korean society and national reunification would be unthinkable and a war would break out on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is necessary to decisively check the above-said moves going against the trend of the times in south Korea in order to realize the desire of the south Korean people for new politics, a new life and accomplish the nation's historic cause of independent reunification and peace and prosperity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the vital demand of the Korean nation and the call of history to smash the moves of the ultra-right conservative forces and continue dynamically advancing the June 15 era of reunification."

            "content": "Lee Fascist Clique's Rackets of Confrontation and Suppression Assailed\r\n Pyongyang, October 24 (KCNA) -- Kim Sun Gum, secretary general of the Central Association of Korean Nationals in Russia on Oct. 20 issued a statement titled \"Lee Myung Bak fascist clique, immediately halt the racket of confrontation with compatriots and fascist crackdown.\"\n\t\t\t\t\tThe statement denounced the Lee Myung Bak fascist clique for cracking down upon the progressive pro-reunification movement organizations and personages on charges of violation of the \"National Security Law (NSL),\" talking about the \"lost decade\" and challenging the June 15 era of reunification, and thereby creating a terror-ridden atmosphere under the pretext of \"security.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee Myung Bak hell-bent on sycophancy towards the U.S. and confrontation with compatriots totally barred the inter-Korean relations from favorably developing under the banner of \"By our nation itself\" and is now working hard to bring the dark clouds of a war to the Korean Peninsula in collusion with outside forces, it charged.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement accused Lee of labeling even candlelight demonstrations of south Korean people in protest against the import of American beef \"rowdyism of leftist forces wire-pulled by the north behind the scene\" and cracking down upon a pro-reunification movement organization by labeling it an \"organization benefiting the enemy.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group's campaign to stamp out and eliminate the above-said organizations and personages calling for reunification is aimed at tiding over its ruling crisis, held the statement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement noted that the association would extend full support and solidarity to the anti-Lee Myung Bak struggle of the south Korean people and join them in remaining true to the idea of \"By our nation itself.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It urged the Lee fascist clique to immediately stop the racket of confrontation with compatriots and the brutal suppression of the progressive forces if they do not want to face stronger resistance of the people and meet the same miserable end as what the successive dictators did."
