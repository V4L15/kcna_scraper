In particular, those of Phyongan Province centering on Pyongyang achieved fame at that time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri Dynasty produced not a small number of famous archers, too. According to records, there was a story that Hwang Jin, an archer of renown in the closing years of the 16th century, shot arrows supplied by three to four assistants without missing enemy soldiers during the Imjin Patriotic War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The archery clearly shows the history and tradition of the resourceful and courageous Korean nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S. Defense Department requested Congress to approve a proposal for spending 88 million dollars for the purchase of \"Bunker Buster.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These moves come under fire by a signed commentary of Rodong Sinmun Tuesday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a clear indication that the U.S. warmongers' ambition for military supremacy remains unchanged and they have become evermore undisguised in their moves to realize it, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' frantic moves to modernize nukes and establish the missile defence system (MD) are not aimed at ensuring the \"security\" and \"peace\" of their allies but at realizing their criminal ambition to dominate the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the criminal goal of the U.S. bellicose forces to hold a military edge in the Asia-Pacific region with south Korea and Japan as strategic strongholds. It was by no means fortuitous that they carried out the above-mentioned test in Hawaii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. decision to spend a stupendous amount of money for the purchase of the above-said bomb was prompted by its design to make surprise strikes at the military strongholds in what it called \"rogue states\" and realize its scenario for aggression with ease. This once again saliently revealed the true colors of the U.S. as an arch criminal escalating the tension and threatening peace in the Asia-Pacific region including the Korean Peninsula and other parts of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. reckless moves to realize its wild ambition for military supremacy is as foolish an act as putting its own security at peril. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson in a commentary says the U.S. confrontational policy of strength is only throwing itself into a bottomless political pitfall, urging the U.S. to properly see the world from a new viewpoint and make efforts to swim with the trend of the times.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, November 13 (KCNA) -- U.S. forces' presence in south Korea is a main stumbling block lying in the way of achieving the sovereignty of the Korean nation and reunification of Korea as it is a brigandish infringement upon its sovereignty and hideous terrorism against its sovereignty. Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists have long worked hard to invade Korea with a wild ambition to dominate the whole of Korea. They landed in south Korea under the pretext of \"disarming\" the defeated Imperial Japanese Army right after the liberation of Korea. Their occupation of south Korea was robber-like and illegal aggression as it was prompted by their criminal design to turn south Korea into their colony and use it as a springboard from which to launch aggression against the whole of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As soon as the U.S. imperialists set foot on south Korea, they enforced a harsh \"military rule\" and set up a pro-American regime there. The U.S. deeply interfered even in the regime change and policy-making in south Korea, lording it over there for the past several decades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. forces in south Korea are chiefly to blame for the division of Korea. They are a main stumbling block in the way of unity and reunification of the Korean nation. Whenever the desire for unity and reunification grew strong among south Koreans and a phase of reconciliation opened between the north and south of Korea, they instigated the anti-reunification forces and committed war exercises and escalated confrontation in a bid to strain the situation and stem the trend toward reunification. The difficult progress of the June 15 era of reunification brought into bolder relief the U.S. nature as disturber of national reconciliation and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans are called upon to wage a more dynamic nationwide struggle to put an end to the U.S. presence in south Korea and thus achieve the sovereignty of the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
