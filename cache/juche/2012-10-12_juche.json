The bulletin said:\n\t\t\t\t\t Traitor Lee Myung Bak of south Korea is now being cursed and censured at home and abroad for going reckless, letting loose a spate of malignant invectives against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In a \"policy speech made at the National Assembly,\" the last one, on Oct. 4 Lee blustered that \"the north's nuclear and missile development is unpardonable and south Korea is ready to cope with enemy's provocation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On Oct. 8 Lee invited riff-raffs of the ultra-rightist Association of Reservists to a party in Chongwadae at which he slandered the DPRK as a \"belligerent rival\". He went the lengths of blaring that \"a new wind of opening\" has reached somewhere. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His reckless remarks are nothing but the last hysteria of confrontation maniac steeped in bitterness towards the DPRK and a jargon of an old man more dead than alive fated to meet a miserable doom.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee is condemned by all the fellow countrymen for having committed all sorts of worst evils in the whole period of his office. He, however, dared slander the DPRK, not knowing where he stands. This provokes side-splitting laughter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What he has done during his office is that he blocked the advance of the June 15 era through his frantic moves to escalate the confrontation with the DPRK, brought the inter-Korean relations to a collapse though they had favorably developed, and intensified maneuvers for a war in league with foreign forces, disturbing peace on the Korean Peninsula and driving the situation to the brink of a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group's announcement of \"the missile guidance agreement\" aimed at mounting a preemptive attack on the DPRK some days ago, in particular, clearly proves that the group's moves for invading the north have gone beyond a danger line. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, he asserted he \"stands for south-north relations of co-existence and co-prosperity\" while talking about someone's \"provocation\". This is the height of shamelessness.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Worse still, he turned south Korea into a tundra of human rights and democracy through his unprecedented fascist repression and unpopular rule and threw people's living into destitution. He, however, dared talk about someone's \"opening\". This fully revealed symptoms of doom of a psychopath. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The desperate accusations made by Lee against the DPRK are nothing but his last attempt to give vent to his indignation at the bottomless quagmire into which he has been thrown, standing isolated at home and abroad for the total failure of his policy for confrontation with the DPRK and unprecedentedly unpopular rule. This is, at the same time, a foolish attempt to save his face through confrontation hysteria as he has become a target of the special prosecution's investigation into the scandals disclosed in the last period of his office though he talked a lot about \"moral regime\" from the outset of his office.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now he is running the whole gamut of base intrigues to incite confrontation with fellow countrymen with the \"presidential election\" just at hand in a bid to stimulate the morale of the conservative forces on the wane and help the \"Saenuri Party\" stay in power and thus escape a prison life after his ouster.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the fellow countrymen have already passed a death sentence on Lee, the fascist dictator, confrontation maniac and traitor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The more desperately Lee is resorting to confrontation with the DPRK to prolong his dirty remaining days, the stronger their hatred and resistance will grow and the more merciless judgment history will mete out to him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is no room for Lee to stay on this land."
