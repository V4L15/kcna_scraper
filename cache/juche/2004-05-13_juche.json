            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on U.S. Persistent Anti-DPRK Moves  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- The U.S. is working hard to defame the authority and image of the DPRK by attaching the label of \"terrorist sponsor\" to it, while persistently pursuing a hostile policy toward it. This is as foolish an act as lifting an axe only to drop it on one's own feet.\r\n Rodong Sinmun says this in a commentary Wednesday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The news analyst continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. Department of State recently released an \"2003 annual report on terrorism\", in which it listed again some countries including the DPRK as \"sponsors of terrorism\" and even brought forward the \"issue of abducted Japanese\" to obtain a lever to put pressure upon the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"issue of kidnapped Japanese\" over which the U.S. is making quite a noise is the one between the DPRK and Japan which was already solved through the publication of the Pyongyang declaration between the two countries and, therefore, it is none of its business. Nevertheless, the U.S. is trying to internationalize it and egging Japan, a junior ally, on to continue to kick up dust over the \"abduction issue\" to gain greater effect. This proves that as long as the U.S. pursues the hostile policy toward the DPRK, it would cook up other case than the \"abduction issue\" to attach the label of terrorism to the DPRK and justify its moves to internationally isolate the latter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It reminds us of a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\" that the U.S., the world's biggest terrorist sponsor and the kingpin of terrorism, groundlessly brands the innocent DPRK as a \"sponsor of terrorism.\" It aims to intensify the moves to stifle the DPRK in keeping the latter on the list of \"sponsors of terrorism.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. remains obstinate in branding the DPRK as a \"sponsor of terrorism\", it will only throw a more glaring light on its robber-like nature, impudence and baseness as the hotbed and root cause of terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe U.S. would be well advised to mind its own business.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Unavoidable is the confrontation between the Koreans in the north and the south, who are advancing along the road of peace and peaceful reunification, and the U.S. which is working to block it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. military occupation of south Korea has caused unaccountable misfortunes and disasters. It is a false propaganda to claim that the U.S. is a \"friendly country\" and an \"ally\" of south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, the U.S. has brought disgrace, humiliation and disaster to south Korea. And one of the causes of the economic difficulties the DPRK is now undergoing is attributable to the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK and its moves to isolate and stifle the latter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The key to consolidating peace, removing the difficulties in the way of reunification and achieving continued progress and victory lies in practically building a structure of the Korean nation's confrontation with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The whole Korean nation should hold ever higher the banner of national independence set forth in the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration to form a nation-wide front of anti-U.S. joint struggle and raise a storm of the anti-U.S. struggle and thus discharge its responsibility for the history and the generations to come.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Branding this as an unpardonable crime of those captive to the idea hostile to the DPRK and national chauvinism, the news analyst says:\r\n  Japan's ultra-right gangsters dare slander Chongryon, an inviolable overseas citizens' organization of the DPRK, and commit violence against Koreans in Japan, posing a serious threat to their personal safety: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From April 9 to 17 alone, Japan's ultra-right gangsters committed four cases of grave violence, in which they tore chima and jogori of Korean girl students in tram cars and pushed them to roll down station stairs, inflicting wounds on them in Tokyo metropolis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An unbroken chain of violence against Koreans in Japan cannot be regarded otherwise than grave political provocations committed with the connivance and patronage of the Japanese government and acts to intentionally worsen the hostile relations between the DPRK and Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japanese gangsters' violent crimes against Koreans in Japan are hostile acts against the DPRK which are committed on the extension line of the scheme to stage a comeback to Korea.  The times have changed, but the aggressive consciousness and ambition of the Japanese militarists to dominate Korea remain unchanged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japanese reactionary ruling quarters' visits to Yasukuni Shrine, their moves to retrogressively revise the constitution and rearrange \"emergency legislation,\" their arms buildup and scheme to send troops overseas bring into a bolder relief the revival of Japanese militarism and its danger. It is in no way good to Japan to stimulate the revengeful thought of the People's Army and people of the DPRK by piling up double and treble crimes in its crime-woven history of aggression through its frenzied hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japanese ruling quarters must not connive at and patronize the violence of the ultra-right gangsters against Chongryon organizations and Koreans in Japan but discontinue their reckless acts of driving the hostile relations with the DPRK to extremes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
