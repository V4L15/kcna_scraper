This well shows how contradictory, one-sided and unjustifiable is the double standards of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is self-evident that the DPRK can never drop its nuclear program when the U.S. is trying to cover up the secret nuclear activities of south Korea by applying the double standards to the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The cases of secret nuclear experiments made under a scrupulous plan in south Korea under the manipulation of the U.S. prove that the U.S. from the very beginning intended to use the six-party talks for disarming the DPRK, not for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. That was why it totally demolished the basis of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula when there were some signs of positive movement toward it at the third round of the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Absolutely just is the stand of the DPRK not to give up its nuclear program under the present situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If a nuclear race is to be prevented in Northeast Asia, the U.S. should come to the conference table for the substantial settlement of the nuclear issue with the will to practically renounce its hostile policy towards the DPRK, the root cause of the occurrence of the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will decide on our next action while closely watching the U.S. moves with regard to its double standards in the nuclear issue and the correction of its hostile policy toward the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "GNP's Traitorous Nature Disclosed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 20 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Monday carries a commentator's article disclosing the crime-woven history of the Grand National Party as it is making desperate efforts to scuttle the probe into the past crimes, an issue that has sparked off an acute political confrontation in south Korea.\r\n The article cites concrete facts to prove that the GNP of south Korea has stood against the probe into the past crimes, afraid of the possible full disclosure of its pro-Japanese treachery, pro-U.S. flunkeyism, fascist dictatorship, corruption and irregularities and crimes it committed against the nation by inciting confrontation with its fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In its more than 50 year-long history the GNP has been preceded by the Liberal Party of traitor Syngman Rhee, the Democratic Republican Party of the Yushin dictator, the Democratic Justice Party during the fifth republic, the Democratic Liberal Party during the sixth republic, the New Korea Party of traitor Kim Young Sam. Despite the passage of this long time its traitorous nature remains unchanged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pro-Japanese treachery is GNP's characteristic feature which has been inherited since the very beginning of its history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Major posts of the GNP and its forerunners are held by those who served the Imperial Japanese Army or institutions run by the Japanese imperialists in the past and their descendents. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The coteries of the Democratic Republican Party were pro-Japanese traitors who signed the south Korea-Japan Treaty without batting an eyelid, though its conclusion had been blocked by the strong opposition of south Koreans and conflicting views on both sides. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They introduced carnal and corrupt Japanese culture, thus poisoning the nation's soul and converting south Korea into a garbage ground of national culture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP and its predecessors are a group of special class pro-U.S. stooges. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as those who created and led the GNP and its predecessors are concerned, they were bosses of special class traitors who took the lead in pro-U.S. treacherous acts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They signed the south Korea-U.S. \"mutual defence treaty\" and \"status of forces agreement\", providing funds needed for the presence of the U.S. troops in south Korea, granting them extraterritorial privileges while imposing submission, disgrace and misfortune upon the south Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP is the general headquarters of fascists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The predecessors of the GNP were the fascist ruling juntas unprecedented in history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The dictatorship enforced by the Liberal Party and the Democratic Republican Party was succeeded to by the dictators of the fifth and the sixth republics which quelled the \"spring of democracy\" through the May 17 fascist suppression and committed the Kwangju massacre unprecedented in history and then by the notorious \"civilian\" fascists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP has prolonged its remaining days by the force of the Security Law (SL), a fascist evil law, as it used the SL as a means for maintaining its dictatorship and a leverage for fascist suppression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its desperate efforts to keep it in force were prompted by a sinister intention to revive fascist dictatorship as they are nothing but the last-ditch efforts of those on their deathbeds. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The most vicious and inveterate traitorous habit of the GNP finds its expression in its confrontation with fellow countrymen and anti-reunification acts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Its predecessors had ceaselessly been hell bent on the moves for confrontation and war against the north where fellow countrymen live, backed by the outsiders for the past scores of years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP's moves for confrontation with the north and anti-reunification acts have reached an extreme phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration was published the GNP opposed it, saying that its first paragraph may result in the withdrawal of the U.S. forces and the collapse of the \"alliance\" with the U.S. and its second paragraph calls for giving up the liberal democratic system and accepting the north-proposed federal system of Koryo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The party has also hamstrung every effort to implement the joint declaration, finding fault with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was none other than the GNP treacherous group which in its \"policy statement\" branded the north as a \"sponsor of terrorism\" and \"principal enemy\" even in this era after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration when the reconciliation and cooperation between the north and the south and independent reunification have become a trend of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The probe into the truth behind the past history in south Korea should be aimed at judging and punishing the crime-woven past of the GNP. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no justification for the criminal and treacherous group like the GNP to stay any longer today when the liquidation of the crime-woven past is high on agenda and has become a trend of the times.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
