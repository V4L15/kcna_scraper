Korean Police Suppression of KCTU under Fire\r\n Pyongyang, December 27 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea Friday made public a statement accusing the south Korean conservative group of mobilizing puppet police forces to storm the headquarters of the south Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and brutally suppress workers. \n\t\t\t\t\t As already known, on Dec. 22 the south Korean puppet conservative authorities hurled more than 5 000 policemen into the operation to arrest leading members of the Railway Trade Union on strike against the privatization of the railway service. They took such fascist action as destroying the front door with a hammer, firing tear liquid and walking off at least 130. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said bloody suppression perpetrated by the police forces against bare-handed workers are reminiscent of the unprecedented massacre committed by the successive military fascist gangsters, the statement said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the barbarous acts which could be committed only by the descendants of the inhumane \"yusin\" dictators, who hell-bent on harsh fascist dictatorship, regard tens of millions of toiling masses as slaves of the fascist rule and enemy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea bitterly denounces the fascist action taken by the puppet conservative group to mercilessly trample down the just demand of the south Korean workers for elementary vital rights and democratic rights and brutally crack down on them on behalf of all workers in the north. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The general strike of toiling masses sweeping across south Korea is an inevitable product of the unpopular labor policy of the puppet group and the moves to revive \"yusin\" dictatorship. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korean people from all walks of life are now turning out in the actions of cursing the ruling quarters who make desperate efforts to pursue the pro-plutocracy policy for privatization, unhesitatingly reneging on election commitments to bring profits to a tiny handful of comprador and monopoly plutocrats in disregard of existence of toiling masses who account for an overwhelming majority of the population. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those forsaken by the working masses, the master of history, are destined to face disgraceful destruction. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All Koreans will invariably voice full support to the toiling masses of south Korea in their indomitable actions for justice and truth."
