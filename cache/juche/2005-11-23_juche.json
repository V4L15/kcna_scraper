They have not hesitated to suppress and kill foreign religionists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States has dared slander the DPRK and list it as a \"state suppressing religion\" from its self-righteous and hostile point of view. This is an open interference in the internal affairs of the DPRK and a political provocation to it. This is, at the same time, a violation of the joint statement adopted at the fourth six-way talks that calls for respect for sovereignty and peaceful co-existence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since the publication of the joint statement the U.S. administration has increased its pressure upon its dialogue partner as evidenced by its steps to apply sanctions against the DPRK such as financial sanctions in contravention of the spirit and requirements of the statement. Meanwhile, a whole string of remarks intended to interfere in the internal affairs of the DPRK is heard from among senior U.S. officials, a serious provocation to it. The U.S. diatribe against the DPRK over its \"religious issue\" is an extension of its smear campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These facts prompt the DPRK to judge that the U.S. administration feels very uncomfortable with the joint statement and deliberately lay obstacles to its implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. truly wants the implementation of the joint statement for denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula it should stop its hostile sanctions and pressure campaign against the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Any delay in Japan's liquidation of its past would only add to its crimes.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Tuesday warns this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should honestly reflect on its crime-woven past for its own sake, not for others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The atrocities committed by the Japanese imperialists in the past are unpardonable in view of the human ethics and morality and international law.\r\n But the Japanese government is working hard to evade the responsibility for these crimes that went beyond the imagination of the world people and insisting that Japan did nothing wrong in the past in a bid to deceive the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is now standing isolated and rejected by them for trying to shun its responsibility to liquidate its past. The anti-Japan protest actions that have taken place in Asian countries in recent years are a clear message to Japan keen to distort and cover up its past crimes and evade its responsibility for them.\r\n It is due to the despicable and wicked stand of Japan to go without settling its past crimes that the conflict between the DPRK and Japan is steadily aggravating. Japan's liquidation of its past is the best way for terminating the hostile relations between the DPRK and Japan and normalizing the bilateral ties. Without it, it is hard to expect an end to the hostile relations and the normalization of the ties between the two countries.\r\n Japan would be well advised to face up to the trend of the times and make a bold decision to redress its past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The development and prospect of Japan do not hinge upon its militarization or reinvasion but lie in breaking with its past and take the road of peace. This is the only way for Japan to survive and win international confidence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to behave with discretion.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The meeting will give further momentum to the dynamic social movement for learning from them and help bring about a fresh turn in the education of the younger generation and markedly raise the role of the women as a mighty force for building a great prosperous powerful nation. \r\n The opening of the meeting is a clear proof of the great policy followed by the WPK to put the dignity of the mothers and other women on the highest level and take care of their destiny and future in a responsible manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The editorial calls upon all mothers and other women to remain true to the Songun idea and policy, firmly uphold and thoroughly implement them and eternally glorify the country as a big harmonious family, its society as a society where the benevolent policy of leader Kim Jong Il is in full bloom.\r\n Minju Joson editorially calls upon all mothers and other women to bear their duties they have assumed before the revolution and times in mind and remain true to the Songun idea and leadership of Kim Jong Il and thus strikingly demonstrate the Korean women's wisdom and revolutionary stamina to the whole world.     \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"

So it is none of the business of the U.S. or the EU.\r\n Human rights would be nothing but rhetoric if they are not guaranteed by state sovereignty. If human rights are to be protected one should have national power and, accordingly, have powerful deterrent to defend it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Man-centered Korean-style socialism is, in essence, genuine popular socialism which was chosen by the Koreans themselves and which enjoys absolute trust and support from them. Herein lie the stability and invincibility of Korean-style socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Korean-style socialism remains unfazed despite whatever storm and stress as it is protected by powerful deterrent for self-defence.\r\n What matters here is that specific countries are excluded from discussing human rights issues in the UN and that only those developing countries incurring the U.S. displeasure are selected as targets of its human rights offensive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Moreover, those countries that sponsored the \"resolution\" are most hideous human rights abusers such as the U.S., Britain and Japan which have refused to apologize and compensate for the crimes they have committed against humanity after launching wars of aggression and murder against other countries for a whole century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite illogical for such countries to talk about \"poor human rights record\" in other countries in the international arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is funny enough for Britain and some other EU countries to take issue with some countries' \"human rights record\" just to please the U.S., while allowing their political image to be damaged in the international arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent resolution cannot be construed otherwise than a politically-motivated document to please the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-DPRK smear campaign over its \"human rights issue\" should, therefore, be halted at once.      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
