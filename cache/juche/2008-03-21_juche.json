This is clearly evidenced by what has been done by the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. military is now busy reorganizing its aggressor forces present in south Korea as required by a new war strategy under the signboard of \"strategic flexibility.\" They are getting frantic with the moves to transfer and expand its military bases in various parts of south Korea, pursuant to the strategy. The U.S. ground forces are being relocated to the area south of the River Han for the purpose of mounting a preemptive attack on the DPRK and naval and air forces bolstered to be capable of preempting precision strikes at it. They have become evermore undisguised in their moves to perpetuate their presence in south Korea, getting increasingly vociferous in justifying it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialist aggressor forces are field executors of the U.S. anti-DPRK policy. The situation always remains unstable on the Korean Peninsula and the building of a solid peace-keeping mechanism, the unanimous desire of the Korean nation, has been delayed because the U.S. has frantically driven the U.S. forces present in south Korea into escalating the moves to start a war of aggression against the DPRK, desperately pursuing its hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. persistent pursuance of its hostile policy towards the DPRK quite contrary to the trend of the times is an intolerable challenge to the DPRK and all Koreans at home and abroad vigorously struggling to build the above-mentioned mechanism on the Korean Peninsula as early as possible and fling open the gate to achieving independent reunification, peace and prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no ground whatsoever for the U.S. to stick to its hostile policy toward the DPRK at a time when the general situation on the peninsula requires dialogue, peace and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to roll back its hostile policy for aggression and war against the DPRK and respond to the proposal for building the above-said mechanism on the peninsula.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan Urged to Send Remains of Koreans to Their Bereaved Families\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 20 (KCNA) -- The U.S. forces made a large-scale air raid on Tokyo in March 1945, burning one third of the city and killing more than 100,000 innocent citizens there. Remains of unidentified and unclaimed dead bodies are still left in the Tokyo metropolitan shrine. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Among them are those of a great many Koreans. This fact has not been known for the last six decades. But it was in 2005 that the Tokyo fact-finding group for probing the truth behind the forcible drafting of Koreans succeeded in finding out names of Koreans on the list of the dead and on the boxes of remains kept in the shrine. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At least 10,000 Koreans are believed to be killed during the air-raid but their names still remain unknown. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A memorial service for the Korean victims was held in Tokyo on March 8, 63 years since the U.S. forces' air-raid on Tokyo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present there were Ko Tok U, vice-chairman of the Central Standing Committee of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) who is also chairman of the Committee for Rights and Welfare of Chongryon, Pak Chang Gil, chairman of the Tokyo metropolitan headquarters of Chongryon, and other Chongryon officials and Koreans in Japan and Japanese figures. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The participants paid silent tribute to the victims. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Memorial addresses sent by the DPRK Measure Committee for Demanding Compensation to \"Comfort Women\" for the Imperial Japanese Army and the Victims of Forcible Drafting, the Association of Korean Victims of Forcible Drafting and Their Bereaved Families, the south Korean Committee for Probing the Truth into Damage Done to Forcible Draftees under the Japanese Imperialists' Occupation were read out there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Chol, Korean delegate of the Tokyo fact-finding group, Kiyoshi Nishizawa, Japanese delegate of the group, and Akihiro Hatsushiga, member of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly, in their speeches confirmed the fact about the death of Koreans and called for sending the remains to their bereaved families.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
