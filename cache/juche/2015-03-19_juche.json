Korean Unification Minister's Anti-DPRK Remarks\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, March 19 (KCNA) -- Hong Yong Phyo, newly-appointed minister of Unification of south Korea, in his inaugural speech on Mar. 16 pulled up the DPRK, talking about \"nuclear development\", \"military and verbal provocation\" and \"preconditions for dialogue.\" He even shielded the \"Committee for Preparations for Unification\", a plot-breeding body for \"unification by absorption\", stating that the ministry of Unification would closely cooperate with it.\n\t\t\t\t\t At a confirmation hearing on Mar. 11 he blustered that the \"the May 24 step is still needed to force the north to take a responsible measure\", \"it is the basic stand of the 'government' neither to tolerate the nukes of the north nor to recognize it as a nuclear weapons state\", and \"it is necessary to cope with possibilities of contingency in the north.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) Wednesday gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hong Yong Phyo's remarks fully revealed the south Korean regime's foul intention to intensify its scheme for \"unification of social systems\" and \"unification by absorption\" while persisting in the vicious policy of confrontation with the fellow countrymen that pushed the north-south relations into a catastrophe.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hong is an anti-reunification and confrontation maniac as he invented the \"policy toward the north\" of the present regime such as \"confidence-building process on the Korean Peninsula\", dancing to the tune of the chief of Chongwadae.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He, known as a \"confidant of President Park Geun Hye\", is now promoted to the head of the ministry of Unification, censured as \"ministry for confrontation with fellow countrymen\" and \"ministry against reunification.\" So, it goes without saying that the ministry of Unification will be reduced to a more faithful mouthpiece of Chongwadae.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is as clear as noonday that Hong, if he fails to keep controlling his tongue, unaware of his position, will face a more miserable end than his predecessors who had been ridiculed as they got hell-bent only on confrontation, parroting the chief executive's remarks, and consequently failed to have any dialogue with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had better learn how to control his tongue before anything else, if he does not want to follow in the wake of his disgraceful predecessors."

It openly revealed its brigandish wild ambition not to tolerate the ideology and social system of the DPRK, crying out for carrying out the \"strategy for positively ratcheting up pressure on it,\" \"executing a limited war and mapping out a plan for it\" and the like.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the beginning of the year, Obama declared \"additional sanctions\" against the DPRK as a \"presidential executive order\" and cried out for \"toppling\" the DPRK as early as possible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. administration made it a policy to carry out the strategy seeking \"collapse\" of the DPRK, which is aimed to stamp out the ideology, system and sovereignty of the latter by using all levers such as \"nukes,\" \"human rights campaign,\" \"cyber attack\" and \"freedom of expression.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Heavyweights of the U.S. political camp and its military bosses are getting desperate in the moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK, ballyhooing about re-listing the DPRK as \"a sponsor of terrorism\" and slapping \"toughest additional sanctions\" against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and south Korea are staging Foal Eagle war games throughout south Korea in the wake of Key Resolve aimed at \"occupying Pyongyang.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All north-targeted war scenarios worked out by the U.S. and the south Korean puppet warmongers such as the plan for jointly coping with local war and tailored deterrence strategy have been applied to the war drills.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What the U.S. seeks in its war exercises for invading the DPRK is to put the whole of the Korean peninsula, a strategically important region, under its control and thus dominate the world, no matter what codename and pretext it uses for staging them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. aggressive strategy for dominating Asia-Pacific can never work on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The national power and military muscle of the DPRK, a guardian of the Korean nation and peace on the Korean peninsula, can never be compared with those in the 1950s.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will never pardon the desperate war moves of the U.S. seeking to turn the peninsula into a theater for power scramble and a theatre of war which will cause the extermination of the Korean nation but will fight a final decisive battle in the showdown with the U.S. in the 21st century, not on the peninsula but in the U.S. mainland.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If any form of war, whether it is a local war or total war or a nuclear war, breaks out due to the arrogant and misjudged scenario of the White House to ignite a new world war on the Korean peninsula, the DPRK will never miss the chance and lead it to a great war for national reunification to put an end to the U.S. history of aggression."
