This reality tells that Japan's start of war for overseas aggression may happen in the near future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now is the time to closely follow Japan's moves to emerge a military power and realize overseas expansion and heighten vigilance against them.\r\n The army and people of the DPRK are getting fully ready to counter the Japanese reactionaries' aggression, maintaining the highest vigilance against them as they are revealing their true colors step by step. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries had better stop acting rashly, bearing deep in mind that their overseas expansion will lead to their final destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They embody the noble love for the country and the nation with which to achieve the inter-Korean reconciliation and the great unity of the whole nation and peacefully reunify the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter which the wind may blow the Koreans should accomplish the cause of national reunification on the basis of the three charters for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans who support the joint declaration and implement it are patriots and those going against the declaration are traitors. Neutrality can not exist in the attitude towards the joint declaration and the people in the north and the south of Korea and overseas including the authorities should turn out in the implementation of the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The viewpoint and stand that the nation is responsible for reunification and the principle of national independence should be maintained and carried into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The efforts should be made to bring about the whirlwind of the independent reunification against the U.S. under the uplifted banner of the cooperation for national independence and peace against war and reunification and patriotism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All legal and institutional mechanisms lying in the way of the national reconciliation and unity, the root cause of the institutional and ideological confrontation between the north and the south of Korea, should be removed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only victory will be in store for the Korean nation who turn out as one in the sacred struggle for building the independent and prosperous reunified power on the land of three thousand-ri under the banner of \"By our nation itself\".    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Our party has taken on a genuine appearance as a revolutionary party in the era of independence by fully applying the President's Juche-oriented idea, theory and method of party building.\r\n Kim Jong Il laid down the policy of modeling the whole Party on the Juche idea as early as in the 1970s. This marked an event of special mention in glorifying the WPK as an eternal party of the President and increasing its militancy and leadership role in every way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il put forward the unique Songun revolutionary line, putting the cause of the Juche-oriented party building on a new height.\r\n The six decades covered by the WPK during which it has traversed a unique road of building a revolutionary party in the era of independence is a shining history in which it has emerged an experienced and seasoned party leading the revolution and construction to one victory after another in any storm and stress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our party has advanced under the unprecedentedly complicated situation and in the crucible of arduous struggle ever since its foundation. It successfully carried out the social revolutions at two stages and the two rounds of reconstruction. It has built man-centered socialism and glorified Korean style socialism, firmly defending the sovereignty and revolutionary gains. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The conditions and environment of the revolution may change, but not the slightest departure from the principle of Songun is allowed. Songun is the key to all victories in the popular masses' cause of independence, the cause of socialism. It is the WPK's revolutionary stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The six decade-long history of the WPK is an immortal history in which the party has been built under a long-term plan to confidently carry forward the revolutionary cause from generation to generation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The wise leadership provided by Kim Il Sung over the work to consolidate the organizational and ideological foundation and the leadership system of the Party for accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche after clearly indicating the way for the party and revolution to follow long ago enabled it to have tremendous might and militancy to materialize the President's idea and accomplish his cause without the slightest vacillation no matter how the situation may change and no matter which way the wind may blow. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is thanks to the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il that the WPK has demonstrated its might as a mighty political staff providing a sure guarantee for winning a final victory of the revolutionary cause of Juche that started in the forests of Mt. Paektu.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
