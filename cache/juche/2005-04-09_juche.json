The textbooks did not mention at all the crimes related to the sexual slavery for the imperial Japanese army and the forcible conscription enforced by the Japanese imperialists, they added.\r\n What is more serious is that the ministry instructed the publishers of history textbooks to describe Tok Islet as part of the Japanese territory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This has lashed different circles in south Korea into great fury. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A spokesman for the Uri Party of south Korea in a commentary charged that the \"claim\" to Tok Islet raised by Japan in its history textbooks is a move to call back the departed soul of the militarist ghost and its distortion of history in the textbooks is not only an issue between south Korea and Japan but a grave challenge to the peace of Asia.\r\n Meanwhile, a spokesman for the south Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade in a statement said that the \"claim\" to Tok Islet made by Japan in its history textbooks is little short of justifying its colonial plunder in the past and denying history of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The government will take responsibility for the issue of Tok Islet and strongly react to it in the future, the statement noted, demanding the Japanese government fundamentally correct its distorted history.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
