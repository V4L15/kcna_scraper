He extended a warm salute to the workers of the complex working hard to produce and supply quality clothing materials to people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The February 8 Vinalon Complex has a very important duty and role to perform as it is directly related to the people's living, he said, setting forth important tasks before it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The next leg of his guidance was the Ryongsong Machine Complex.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The complex intended to import some equipment necessary for gas adsorption and compressors for compounding ammonia from a foreign country so as to wind up the project for gasification as early as possible but it refused to provide them under the pretext that they are products for dual use. Its officials, workers and technicians, however, successfully manufactured them by themselves in a brief span of time by fully displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, thus demonstrating once again the indomitable creative power of the heroic Korean working class.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After exchanging a salute with the officials present to greet him, he went round different places including the compressor shop and large machine shop to acquaint himself in detail with production there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching giant equipment at work including the ammonia compounding tower, the concentration and separating tower and hydrogen refining tower for hours, he was greatly pleased to learn that the workers of the complex successfully manufactured modern equipment for Korean-style gasification by their own  efforts and with their own technology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The successful manufacture of equipment for gasification is the precious fruition of the mental power displayed by the workers of Ryongsong in the spirit of self-reliance, he said, praising the officials, workers and technicians of the complex for performing the great feats to go down in history along with the Songun era by devoting ardent patriotic enthusiasm and all their wisdom and energies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He set forth tasks to be fulfilled by the complex, noting that the complex, one of the nation's giant custom-built equipment producers, has a very important role to play in accomplishing the party's cause of building a thriving nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The last leg of his guidance was the Hungnam Fertilizer Complex, one of the nation's large fertilizer producers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He first visited the construction site of the gasification process.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After being briefed on the construction before a huge map showing the gasification process, he looked round the construction site to acquaint himself in detail with the progress made in the project.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that when the gasification process is completed, it will be possible to establish a more solid Juche-oriented fertilizer production system based on the locally available raw materials and bring about a decisive turn in solving the food problem.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He made the rounds of various production processes including the water electrolysis shop to learn in detail about the technological updating and production there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the complex's position and role are very important for bringing the agricultural production to a high level, he advanced important tasks to be fulfilled by the complex.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHamhung City has an important role to play in the nation's economic development as it has a lot of big factories which are important for solving the issues of clothing, food and housing, he noted, underscoring the need for the city to play a vanguard role in improving the standard of people's living and building a thriving nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Kim Ki Nam and Hong Sok Hyong,  members of the Political Bureau and secretaries of the C.C., the WPK,  Kim Kyong Hui, member of the Political Bureau and department director of the C.C., the WPK, Thae Jong Su, alternate member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the C.C., the WPK, Ju Kyu Chang, alternate member of the Political Bureau and department director of the C.C., the WPK, and Kwak Pom Gi, chief secretary of the South Hamgyong Provincial Committee of the WPK."
