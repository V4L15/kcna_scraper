This is a lesson taught by the past history of the reunification movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and the south Korean conservative forces including the Grand National Party have persistently worked to block reconciliation, cooperation and exchange between the north and the south even after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean \"government\" authorities are talking about south-north reconciliation and cooperation before the north side but are getting busy with joint war maneuvers with the U.S. targeted against it behind the scene. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There occur in an unbroken chain such abnormal cases in which progressive figures, youths and students are being taken away to prisons and Internet sites related to the DPRK are being disconnected on charges of violation of the \"National Security Law\", which defines the DPRK as \"the enemy\", in south Korea today when the nation lives in the June 15 era of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary called for intensifying the actions to realize national cooperation against foreign forces under the uplifted banner of \"By our nation itself\" in south Korea in order to put an end to such tragedy at an early date and achieve the reunification of the country.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Contrary to this public atmosphere, Bush accorded cordial hospitality to Abe who recently visited the U.S. He praised Abe's window-dressing \"apology\" for the \"comfort women\" issue and expressed the U.S. official support for Japan's stand on the \"abduction issue\", the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bush's cordial hospitality accorded to Abe was prompted by the U.S. sinister intention to draw Japan nearer to it and effectively use Japan for carrying out its strategic purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a calculation of the U.S. that if Japan, its junior ally and henchman, is coaxed, it can be effectively used to realize the U.S. military strategic purpose anytime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Particularly, the U.S. seeks to use Japan as a shock brigade in realizing its strategy of aggression on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan, too, intended to garner greater trust from its master, through Abe's recent visit to the U.S., and create favorable circumstance for realizing its militarist policy under the zealous backing of the U.S. Out of this stand, Japan enforced a policy of coming nearer to the U.S. with the visit as a momentum.  The U.S. favored Japan's distortion of history, bringing into bolder relief its ugly colors as an aggressor and wrecker of world peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and Japan are aggression forces that do not hesitate to have any heinous conspiracy to attain their criminal aims. The criminal nature and danger of such U.S.-Japan conspiracy for aggression can never be concealed.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
