It is generalissimo Kim Il Sung who led this war to victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the time of the ship \"Pueblo\" incident, too, the U.S. imperialists knelt down. standing in the van of the heroic Korean people was marshal Kim Jong Il, a young general in the twenties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. moves to stifle socialism after designating Korea as part of an \"axis of evil\" and a \"terrorism-supporting state\" are going beyond the limit. But under the Songun leadership of  Kim Jong Il the Korean people will surely triumph in the confrontation with the U.S. and achieve the cause of the country's reunification.    \r\n\r\n"

The injection remarkably decreases hepatocarcinoma. It also reduces ehrlich-ascites carcinoma. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The injection had been applied to hepatocarcinoma patients from February 1997 to July 2001. The result shows that it begins to prove efficacious 3 days after the application of the injection and neoplasm decreases 80 percent after 3 months. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the result of an experimental treatment of tumor by three local injections of acorin, the rate of neoplasm decrease is 95.6 percent in case of solid tumor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The injection can also treat 5 or 10 centimeter-long hepatocarcinoma. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And it prevents stomachache, poor appetite and weight loss of hepatocarcinoma patients. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has neither side-effect nor toxicosis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The acorin injection was highly appreciated at the 2nd national exhibition of achievements of universities in scientific researches held in Juche 91 (2002).    \r\n\r\n"

The U.S. troops in south Korea have staged madcap war gambles targeted against the north, while chilling the atmosphere of inter-Korean dialogue. GIs' murder does not cease. These facts clearly show that the U.S. forces' presence in south Korea is a crime against the Korean nation, peace and reunification as it blocks the reconciliation and reunification of the Korean nation and is intended to realize the U.S. ambition for aggression of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose forces' assertion that the DPRK is a threat to the U.S. \"security\" is none other than an absurd subterfuge to invent a pretext for justifying the U.S. forces' presence in south Korea and hostile moves against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States should clearly know that its aim to stifle the DPRK by force can never be achieved, give up its aggressive policy of occupation of south Korea and stop its moves to start a new war and pull its troops out of it at once. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis would do the U.S. good as it would save many U.S. soldiers from miserable death and catastrophic disasters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The withdrawal of the U.S. troops from south Korea would lead to the peace of Korea, the security of the Korean nation and its independent reunification.    \r\n\r\n"

This leaves us skeptical about the U.S. willingness to discard its hostile policy toward the DPRK and make a policy switchover. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States should behave itself with discretion, pondering over the consequences of its reckless moves getting on the nerves of its dialogue counterpart.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
