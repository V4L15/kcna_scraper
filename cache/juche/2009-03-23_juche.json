This is the core of the spirit of \"By our nation itself\" clarified in the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All Koreans should have transparent awareness of national independence that they should independently solve the issue of national reunification related to the destiny of the nation by their concerted efforts. This is the key to rejecting foreign aggression and interference and flunkeyism and dependence on foreign forces and reenergizing the movement for national reunification. Despite the vicious obstructions of the U.S. and the Lee Myung Bak group the driving force for national reunification has grown strong, the movement for national reunification dynamic and national reconciliation and unity and independent reunification have become an irresistible trend of the times.

Zhirinovsky, vice-chairman of the State Duma of Russia and chairman of the said party, referred to the recent situation of the Korean Peninsula growing extremely tense.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is not the DPRK but the U.S. and the south Korean bellicose forces that are rendering the situation of the peninsula strained, he said, adding that the DPRK's satellite launch will be an exercise of legitimate right by a sovereign state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He held that all sorts of military exercises should be stopped in south Korea to prevent a war on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The behavior of the new U.S. administration fully proves the real intention of the U.S. ruling quarters keen on lies and hypocrisy, he pointed out.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The participants in the meeting strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppets for having aggravated the situation of the peninsula through their adventurous large-scale war maneuvers, chanting such slogans as \"No war!\" and \"We oppose the military saber rattling in south Korea!\"."
