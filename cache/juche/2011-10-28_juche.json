As a result, the north and the south of Korea faced extreme mistrust and military confrontation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The three years of the conservative group in power were rife with crimes it committed by enforcing the policy in favor of the rich and plutocrats and exploiting people to meet their own greedy interests. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The GNP has pursued unpopular economic policy representing the interests of only a handful of the privileged despite its lip-service for \"pro-common people policy\". This has worsened the social evil of \"the rich getting ever richer and the poor ever poorer\" and deteriorated the people's livelihood. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The unemployed flood the streets and toiling masses are suffering from sky-rocketing prices of goods, taxes and registration fees. A lot of hopeless people commit suicides and the south Korean society is going rotten with all sorts of crimes, illegality and corruption pervading it. This is the reality brought about by the GNP which committed to \"policy bringing hope to people\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now south Koreans deplore the difficult living conditions, saying \"everyday is like living in the hell,\" \"everything has become worse,\" \"it has become more difficult to live,\" \"the hands of clock of democratization has gone back to that in the 1980s\". This reflects their mindset. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korean media describe the defeat of the conservative group and victory of the democratic forces as super political storm. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The table has tilted in disfavor of the traitorous regime."

Esos vinculos, que se desarrollaban favorablemente despues de publicada la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio, han sido congelados de repente cuando tomo el \"poder\" el \"GPN\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Partiendo de la intencion de aplastar militarmente a la RPDC, libraron de modo sucesivo los entrenamientos militares conjuntos con las fuerzas extranjeras e inventaron graves incidentes de provocacion, llevando la situacion al umbral de guerra. Por eso, lo unico que queda entre ambas partes coreanas es la desconfianza extremada y agudo enfrentamiento militar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　3 anos de mandato de las fuerzas conservadoras surcoreanas son de crimenes cometidos practicando las politicas para los ricos y oligarcas y persiguiendo sus insaciables intereses a cambio del sudor y sangre del pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Debido a la politica economica del \"GPN\" de caracter antipopular, que representa los intereses de la minoria de privilegiados hablando hipocritamente de \"estar a favor de humildes\", se ha agravado el mal social de \"los ricos se hacen cada vez mas ricos y los pobres cada vez mas pobres\" y la vida del pueblo fue arruinada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　\"Vivimos en el infierno\", \"Todo ha sido empeorado\", \"La vida se hizo mas dura\", \"La democracia dio marcha atras hacia la decada de 1980\" y otros lamentos reflejan correctamente la opinion publica del Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Los medios de prensa del Sur de Corea describen como tormenta politica supergrande la derrota sufrida en las recientes elecciones por la banda de conservadores y la victoria de las fuerzas democraticas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Ya entro en decadencia el regimen traidor del Sur de Corea."
