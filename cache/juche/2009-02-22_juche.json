His \"policy towards the north\" is not based on any principle. It is nothing but a treacherous and anti-reunification policy as it brought the inter-Korean relations to stalemate and bedeviled them though they had favorably developed since the adoption of the June 15 joint declaration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLee's loud-mouthed \"cooperation\" is nothing but sophism to deceive the public at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe relations between the north and the south are bound to go from bad to worse as traitor Lee replaced members of the above-said \"council\" and mechanisms handling issues of inter-Korean relations with confrontation maniacs. All Koreans will not be able to escape the holocaust of a new war, a nuclear war, should Lee keep pursuing confrontation, further bedeviling the said relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn order to prevent this national disaster it is necessary for all the Koreans to wage an anti-Lee Myung Bak nationwide struggle.
