            "content": "Demolition of concrete wall demanded \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 29 (KCNA) -- In order to properly solve the issue of national reunification, the nation's cherished desire, the north and south of Korea should defuse political and military confrontation and tensions and remove all sorts of hurdles including the concrete wall lying in the way of reunification, says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article. \r\n The existence of the concrete wall is in contravention of the basic spirit of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration in which they vowed to independently reunify the country by the concerted efforts of the nation, the article says, and goes on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As early as in the 1970s at the instigation of the U.S. imperialists the former South Korean military dictators built a concrete wall extending 240 kms from the east to the west in the area of the south side along the military demarcation line. This wall is symbolic of national division and confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This cancer-like existence blocks national reconciliation and cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean authorities' intention to keep the concrete wall defying the unanimous demand of the entire nation for its removal means opposing national reconciliation, unity and reunification and revealing a criminal attempt to seek a way out in their showdown, and war against the DPRK like former military dictators. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are more than 200 countries in the world. But Korea is the only country where there is a concrete wall besecting the homogeneous nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An attitude towards this issue is a touchstone which distinguishes between a stand towards reunification and a stand towards division and between an attitude towards dialogue and an attitude towards confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Just talking about reconciliation, unity and cooperation between the north and the south of the country while trying to keep this wall is an empty talk and a mockery of the nation desirous of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an unevadable responsibility for the South Korean authorities to pull down the concrete wall. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the South Korean authorities are truly willing to reunify the country independently through reconciliation and cooperation with the north in the spirit of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, they should pull down the wall without delay.    \r\n\r\n"
