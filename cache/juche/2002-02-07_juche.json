As they put it, this disturbing development reflects the dangerous war hysteria of the hard-line conservatives of the U.S. who have become extremely arrogant through its \"war against terrorism\" in Afghanistan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The extremely reckless remarks made by bush about the \"axis of evil\" and the war hysteria of the cold war-minded conservative hard-liners instigating him to go on with the war clearly indicate that the U.S. is chiefly responsible for disturbing the peace and security of humankind and the stability and equality of the international community in the 21st century and posing a real threat to the future of the century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation where the U.S. hard-line conservatives came out to threaten the DPRK with outcries little short of a declaration of war and are now vociferating about even a \"preemptive attack\" compels the Korean people and self-defensive revolutionary armed forces, who value independence and dignity more than their lives, to renew their firm determination to punish the provocateurs, aggressors with an option to exercise their inviolable sovereign right, the right for self-defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to face up to the history and reality if it wishes to distinguish between good and evil and properly cope with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. conservative hard-liners had better not to forget the bitter historical lessons drawn from the Washington-provoked Korean War and the subsequent incidents.    \r\n\r\n"

He did not bother to threaten to invade the DPRK, a sovereign and independent state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is well known to the world that to conquer the DPRK by force of arms is the U.S. strategic policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose elements consider that if tensions on the Korean peninsula are defused, their policy of military presence in South Korea as well as their Asia-Pacific strategy will go busted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That is why they have left no stone unturned to wreck peace on the peninsula whenever an atmosphere is created in their favor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is working harder to round off its war preparations, reinforcing its aggression forces in and around South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was against this backdrop that bush recently betrayed his reckless intention to seize the DPRK by force of arms. As a matter of fact, this is little short of a declaration of war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The option to \"strike\" is not the U.S. monopoly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should be clearly mindful that the DPRK does not say empty words.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
