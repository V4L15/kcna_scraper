It is left with no means untried to block them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over the last five years a dark cloud of nuclear war has been constantly hanging over the Korean peninsula due to the U.S. imperialist moves. And more than once multifaceted dialogues between the north and the south have been suspended and cooperation and exchange between them undergone difficulties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to clearly understand that no matter how viciously the outside forces may pose a war threat, the Korean nation will successfully hold the grand festival for reunification and continue to dynamically advance the movement for independent reunification under the uplifted banner of the June 15 joint declaration.    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n"

This can not be interpreted otherwise than an attempt to quell the spirit of the declaration, put the brake on its implementation and chill the Korean nation's growing desire for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. was keen on anti-peace and anti-reunification actions whenever inter-Korean contacts were made and the nation's desire for reunification surged. Since the publication of the declaration, in particular, it has conducted those acts with added arrogance and ferocity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has worked hard overtly and covertly to stem the trend towards national reconciliation and reunification, displeased with the inter-Korean relations that have improved in the spirit of the joint declaration. This is an unpardonable criminal act.\r\n No one is entitled to say this or that about the joint declaration reflecting the Korean nation's will and desire for reunification and interfere in the issue of Korea's reunification, its internal issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should face up to the trend of the times, refrain from doing acts obstructive to the Koreans' efforts to achieve independent reunification and improve the north-south relations and stop its moves against peace and reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The reality proves that the joint declaration serves as a banner for protecting peace from a war as it ensures peace on the Korean Peninsula and promotes reconciliation and peaceful reunification of the north and the south, while helping check the provocative moves of foreign forces for a war of aggression.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Sunday observes this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint declaration set out the most correct principle for the realization of the peaceful reunification and indicated ways common to the Korean nation to achieve peaceful reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint declaration made it clear that the issue of the reunification of the country should be solved by the Koreans responsible for it independently through their concerted efforts, thus laying down \"By our nation itself\" as the common idea of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea of \"By our nation itself\" guides the Koreans to reject the foreign forces' attempt at confrontation and war, pool their strength and realize cooperation in their efforts to achieve peace and peaceful reunification and thus makes it possible to prevent a war on the peninsula and achieve lasting peace and peaceful reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint declaration also stated that the north and the south would achieve the balanced development of the national economy through economic cooperation and revitalize cooperation and exchange in social, cultural, sports, health, environmental and other fields to deepen mutual confidence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt thus converted the inter-Korean relations of confrontation and hostility into those of reconciliation and cooperation and laid a common groundwork for accelerating the process of the peaceful reunification of the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a vital task of the Korean nation for defending peace on the Korean Peninsula and achieving the peaceful reunification to remain true to the June 15 joint declaration and implement it to the letter.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And they also commit them to making every possible effort to prevent a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. has openly pursued the policy of nuclear blackmail in disregard of the requirements and commitments under the NPT. The U.S. bellicose forces' adoption of preemptive nuclear attack as a state policy is the height of their strategy for hegemony and nuclear strategy based on the nuclear-almighty doctrine. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is loudly calling for \"non-proliferation\" but, in actuality, encourages proliferation. It has conducted nuclear tests more than 20 times since 1997, refusing to ratify the CTBT. It is again the U.S. that has connived at, protected and encouraged its allies' access to nukes. Yet, the U.S. claims that it remains \"faithful\" to the NPT. How preposterous it is. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world remains vigilant. It is becoming increasingly critical of the U.S., a nuclear criminal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should lend an ear to the voices of the times.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
