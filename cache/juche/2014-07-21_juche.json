            "content": "U.S. and S. Korean Authorities Warned of Their Reckless Acts\r\nPyongyang, July 21 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Policy Department of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK on July 20 issued a statement condemning the U.S. and its followers for kicking up a campaign over the DPRK's legitimate measures to bolster up its capability for self-defence.\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Strategic force units and other units of the ground, naval and air and anti-air forces of the Korean People's Army have recently conducted a series of drills with various missions under the simulated conditions of an actual war to bolster up the capability for self-defence such as the ones for ultra-precision tactical rocket firing and firing drills of diverse artillery pieces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The service personnel and the people of the DPRK are greatly encouraged by the signal successes made in these drills of KPA units.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The peace- and justice-loving people in the world are expressing admiration at the shining successes of the service personnel and the people of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is against this backdrop that only the U.S. and its ally the Park Geun Hye group and some other undesirable forces are behaving mischievously, revealing their sinister intentions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. grumbled as if tactical rockets of the KPA had gone into actions to strike its mainland, claiming \"north Korea is posing an unusual and special threat to the U.S.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is terming the routine drills of the KPA a politically-motivated low-profile provocation and successive military threats to the allies in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities are echoing the U.S. claim by asserting the tactical rocket firing and firing drills of artillery pieces by the KPA are a retaliation against their refusal of the DPRK's special proposal and its government's statement, a dangerous provocation to escalate the military tensions and a deliberate threat to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They went the lengths of letting the UN Security Council, a mechanism which has lost its impartiality long ago, kick up much fuss in a bid to mislead public opinion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some weak-willed countries are blindly joining in such odd charade. Clinging to the malodorous coattails of the U.S., they are going so reckless as to vie with each other to hug poor-looking Park Geun Hye.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In view of all these ridiculous ruckuses being staged by making profound confusion of right and wrong, the Policy Department of the NDC of the DPRK once again serves a strong warning to the U.S. and the south Korean authorities, their prime movers, reflecting the voices of the service personnel and the people of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the south Korean authorities should properly know what words \"provocation\" and \"threat\" mean before wagging their tongues.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the tactical rocket firing of the KPA is a \"provocation\" to the U.S. and a threat to regional stability and peace, then what should be said of the countless number of strategic missiles launched by the U.S. and the DPRK-targeted war drills frequently staged by it together with the south Korean military gangsters after bringing its forces to other country?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The real provocations and threats made to the Korean peninsula are the whole gamut of political and military moves being pushed forward by the U.S., pursuant to its hostile policy toward the DPRK and its belligerent military strategy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In other words, the reckless intrusions into the waters of the DPRK side perpetrated by the warmongers of the south Korean military almost every day at the instigation of the U.S. are typical provocations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the south Korean authorities should not resort to brazen-faced brigandish acts reminiscent of a thief brandishing a club.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., an arch criminal making provocations and threats, is kicking up high-intensity war drills for aggression every day in the land, waters and sky of other country. The U.S. and the south Korean authorities who are hell-bent on confrontation with the compatriots in the north at the former's beck and call are terming the military drills for self-defence conducted by the DPRK in its own land, waters and sky a \"provocation\" and a \"threat.\" What are suitable words to accuse such impudent and brigandish behavior?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is nothing but a shameless act of a burglar rudely behaving in face of the master of a house trying to protect his house by himself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such hooliganism may work somewhere else but can never work in this land being safeguarded by the service personnel and people of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The more desperately the U.S. and the south Korean authorities resort to gangster-like hostile acts, the more deadly retaliatory actions of Korean style they will face. This will be like a bolt from the blue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has already done everything it could to mend the north-south relations and achieve the reunification, peace and prosperity of the country through its crucial proposal and open letter in January, special proposal in June and government statement in July.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What remains to be done at present is to make a final choice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the south Korean authorities should no longer behave recklessly, daring talk about \"provocation\" and \"threat\" from someone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If they persist in doing so, all the self-defensive deterrent forces of the DPRK will keep themselves fully ready to punish all undesirable forces in the world, strikingly demonstrate its invincible might and strongly counter their moves through its practical retaliatory actions of justice."

Korean Puppet Group's Reckless Moves to Stifle DPRK under Fire\r\nPyongyang, July 21 (KCNA) -- Units of the Korean People's Army recently conducted tactical rocket firing and artillery shelling drills.\n\t\t\t\t\t As regards this, the south Korean puppet group some days ago sent a letter to a committee of the UN requesting it to deal with the issue of the DPRK's missile launch, terming it a \"violation of the resolutions\". Meanwhile, a spokesman for the puppet Ministry of Defense blustered that the south Korean army would \"unhesitatingly retaliate against the KPA\" if it fires shells into waters south of the \"northern limit line,\" talking about a very serious threat and describing the above-said issue as a grave case. Even the chief executive strongly urged the military group to strongly react against any provocation of the north at its initial stage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Monday observes in a commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a deliberate far-fetched assertion as it serves as a premeditated provocation to bedevil the inter-Korean relations and escalate the confrontation on the Korean peninsula and realize its scenario to stifle the DPRK through cooperation with foreign forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how fair-minded and just one may be, one is bound to be a plaything of the strong if one is weak and a precious history which has been carried forward at the cost of blood is bound to lose its shine in a moment. This is not only a lesson taught by history but a hard reality today.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK would like to clarify once again it will not step back even an inch from the road of bolstering up the capability for self-defence, no matter what others may say.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK remains unchanged in its stand to contain the reckless confrontation racket of the warmongers at home and abroad to stifle the DPRK by force at any cost by dint of its powerful military deterrence and defend the security of the nation and peace of the country as firm as an iron wall.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities would be well advised to stop such foolish act of wasting energy for useless backbiting and take actions to defuse the tensions and improve the inter-Korean relations."

Y describe los ejercicios rutinarios del EPC como \"provocacion de baja intensidad con fines politicos\" y \"sucesiva amenaza militar contra los paises aliados de la region\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas tambien dicen que los lanzamientos de cohetes tacticos y los ejercicios de artilleria del EPC son una \"reaccion a la negativa a la propuesta especial y la declaracion del gobierno (de la RPDC)\", \"provocacion peligrosa que exacerba la tension militar\" y \"amenaza intencional\" a si mismas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, arman escandalo por conducto del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU, que hace mucho tiempo perdio la imparcialidad, para inducir en error la opinion publica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe suman a esa payasada algunos paises flojos que siendo complices de EE.UU., tratan de abrazar a Park Geun-hye actualmente en la situacion miserable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn cuanto a esa campana absurda que se libra invirtiendo la verdad, el Departamento de Politica del CDN vuelve a advertir a EE.UU. y las autoridades surcoreanas recogiendo la opinion del ejercito y el pueblo de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. EE.UU. y las autoridades surcoreanas deben hablar conociendo bien primero la concepcion de \"provocacion\" y \"amenaza\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t?Si el lanzamiento de cohetes tacticos de la RPDC constituye la \"provocacion\" contra EE.UU. y la \"amenaza\" a la estabilidad y la paz de la region, como se debe decir de los incontables lanzamientos de misiles estrategicos de EE.UU. y los ejercicios militares contra la RPDC que realiza a menudo el imperio en la tierra ajena con los gangsteres de la capa militar del Sur de Corea?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas provocaciones y la amenaza de verdad en la Peninsula Coreana son las maniobras politicas y militares que se promueven segun la politica hostil contra la RPDC y la belicosa estrategia militar de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa provocacion tipica es la imprudente intrusion en las aguas jurisdiccionales de la RPDC que cometen casi todos los dias los belicistas surcoreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. EE.UU. y las autoridades del Sur de Corea no deben incurrir mas en el descarado acto de bandido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t?Como se puede describir el acto bandidesco de EE.UU., fautor de provocacion y amenaza, que desarrolla casi todos los dias en otro pais los ejercicios de agresion y guerra, y de las autoridades surcoreanas enloquecidas por la confrontacion fratricida que tildan de \"provocacion\" y \"amenaza\" los ejercicios militares autodefensivos de la RPDC que se realizan en la tierra, mar y cielo propios?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs un procedimiento de bandido que ultraja al dueno que quiere defender su casa con fuerzas propias.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTal vez salga con la suya en otras partes ese acto de bandido, pero nunca sera aceptado en esta tierra defendida por el ejercito y el pueblo de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Cuanto mas recurran a las hostilidades gangsteriles, EE.UU. y las autoridades surcoreanas tanto mas enfrentaran la represalia inimaginablemente fuerte de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA traves de la propuesta importante y el mensaje abierto de enero pasado, la propuesta especial de junio y la declaracion del gobierno de julio, la RPDC hizo todo lo posible por mejorar las relaciones intercoreanas y lograr la reunificacion, la paz y la prosperidad del pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo unico que falta es la opcion final.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. y las autoridades surcoreanas no deben actuar con imprudencia hablando de la \"provocacion\" y \"amenaza\" de alguien.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor el contrario, todas las fuerzas disuasivas de la RPDC para la autodefensa se mantendran en la disposicion perfecta para castigar todas las fuerzas malsanas de este mundo, manifestaran su poderio sin rival y responderan con las justas acciones de venganza."
