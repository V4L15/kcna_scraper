Wangjae in Onsong County of North Hamgyong Province and on the shore of Lake Samji in Ryanggang Province on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the WPK and the 40th anniversary of the victory in the Musan area battle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In those days Kim Jong Il chose the sites for the erection of the statues of the President on the spots, examined the layouts and model boards for the projects and gave hundreds of important instructions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe 1980s witnessed the erection of the Tower of the Juche Idea and the Arch of Triumph as enduring edifices at the highest level to hand down the Juche idea founded by the President and his revolutionary exploits to posterity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And the 1990s saw the erection of the Monument to Victory in the Fatherland Liberation War representing the President's feats performed for the victory in the war and the heroic exploits of the servicepersons of the People's Army and the people on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the victory in the war and the Monument to the Three Revolutions demonstrating the spirit of Korea of Juche advancing under the uplifted banner of the three revolutions, ideological, technical and cultural, the WPK's general line of socialist construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il who made a new history of the cause of perpetuating the memory of the President saw to it that the Monument to Party Founding was built in a matter of one year in order to hand down the feats of the President in founding the Party and the glorious revolutionary history of the WPK to posterity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe Tower to the Immortality was erected at the entrance of Kumsong Street in a peculiar style, the first of its kind in history, in perfect harmony with the Kumsusan Memorial Palace, the sacred temple of Juche. This reflects the unanimous desire of the Korean people to hold the President in high esteem for all ages. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Monument to the Victory in the Musan Area Battle was newly erected in the 2000s in the place where a battle was fought during the anti-Japanese war thanks to the fixed faith and far-sighted plan of Kim Jong Il to accomplish the Korean revolution with arms as required by the Songun era and build a great prosperous powerful socialist nation on this land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And the Monument to the Three Charters for National Reunification was erected at the southern gateway to the capital. It represents the faith and will of the Korean people to convey the feats performed by the President for the country's reunification to posterity and bring earlier the day of national reunification       \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

As a result, a rapid development has been made in all fields of literature and art including music, dance, art and acrobatics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this period, he made public famous works such as \"On the Art of Cinema\", \"On the Art of Opera\", \"On the Art of Dance\", \"On the Art of Drama\", \"On the Art of Music\", \"On Fine Art\" and \"On the Art of Juche-oriented Literature\" to give clear answers to the theoretical and practical questions arising in the development of Juche-oriented literature and art.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

His ideas and theories based on the Songun idea of Juche are shedding bright rays as a banner for winning a sure victory in the Juche-oriented revolution in the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter called on the entire Party and the army and all the people to strengthen the Party organizationally and ideologically under the uplifted banner of the great Songun in order to pave a wide avenue for winning a new victory in the struggle to build a great prosperous powerful socialist nation, bring earlier the independent reunification of the country and accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
