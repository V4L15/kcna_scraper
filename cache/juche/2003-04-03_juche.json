            "content": "KCNA flails decision of Japanese Supreme Court \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 2 (KCNA) -- The Supreme Court of Japan on March 25 ruled that there is no need for the Japanese government to compensate the former comfort women, thus turning down the 1998 Simonoseki suit which admitted Japan's state responsibility and compensation for them.\r\n By rejecting the suit which had been left unsettled for 5 years, Japan laid bare before the international community its true colors as a hideous criminal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan forced more than 200,000 Korean women into sexual slavery for the Japanese imperial army in the past. This was the most despicable, merciless and hideous crime in human history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The supreme court which claims to represent the state called Japan by law went so shameless and irresponsible that it asserted before the international community that there is no need to compensate the former comfort women. This only betrays the moral vulgarity of Japan and the mean nature of Japanese politics in the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the past half a century since the end of the pacific war Japan has made neither apology nor compensation to the Korean women in the north and the south, the biggest victims. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We can not but express our bitterest indignation and wrath against the Japanese court which made such a shameless decision. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a well-known fact that the un and various other international organizations convicted Japan of violating international law, terming the sexual slavery committed by imperial Japan as a state-sponsored organized rape and asserted the Japanese government's responsibility to make compensation for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, Japan has not responded to those just demands and advices but gone to the lengths of dismissing the suit, thus adding to the crimes it committed by violating the rights and dignity of sexual slaves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality goes to clearly prove that Japan has no willingness to redress its crime-ridden past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is well advised to properly handle the issue of the comfort women for the Japanese imperial army, clearly understanding that it can not become a full-fledged member of the international community unless it redeems its past crimes.  \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Unreasonable involvement in U.S. anti-DPRK campaign assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 2 (KCNA) -- Some forces of the international community are joining the U.S. in its moves to increase its pressure upon the DPRK over its nuclear issue. \r\nClaiming that North Korea is the next target of the U.S. attack when its Iraqi war is over, they described the just measures taken by the DPRK as regards the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula as a violation of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and urged it to accept inspection. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK pulled out of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty as a legitimate self-defensive measure under the situation where the supreme interests of the state were seriously threatened. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was a very just measure for the DPRK which values its sovereignty as its life and soul to react to the U.S. brigandish demands with the toughest stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is now insisting on the multilateral talks and pressurizing upon the DPRK to accept inspection, doggedly opposing its constructive proposal for the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those assertions of the dishonest forces of the international community are little short of giving a shot in the arm of the U.S. keen to unleash a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those with a cool-headed and lucid view on the developments should carefully approach the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and exercise their influence on the U.S. to make a political decision to opt for the DPRK-U.S. direct negotiations and the conclusion of the non-aggression treaty as early as possible.    \r\n\r\n"

They are an all-round test military operation to mount a preemptive attack on the DPRK and a dangerous play with fire aimed at the second Korean war.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The danger of these war exercises is increasing as they are under way at a time when the DPRK and the U.S. are standing in an acute confrontation over the nuclear issue and the bush group is kicking up an unprecedented nuclear racket against the DPRK after sparking the second nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The current joint war maneuvers are a preliminary military operation, a test war to shift the theatre of a \"war against terrorism\" to the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. intends to ignite the second Korean war and make it a most destructive and disastrous war. This is clearly evidenced by the number of operational equipment and combat capacity involved in the maneuvers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. massed its armed forces of aggression around the Korean Peninsula, claiming that North Korea should not be allowed to have access to nukes and the military option is the best. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose forces have pushed ahead with the manufacture of smaller nuclear weapons under a plan to turn the Korean war into a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A special operation group of the CIA went to the lengths of conducting a secret training to destroy the DPRK's nuclear facilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There should be no compromise with the U.S. imperialists but it is imperative to fight them out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and the people of the DPRK will mercilessly wipe them out if they unleash a new war of aggression against it.    \r\n\r\n"
