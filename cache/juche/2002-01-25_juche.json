It speaks for the common will of Koreans in the north and south of Korea and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over the last ten odd years from its formation the pomminryon north headquarters has fully discharged its duty and responsibility in encouraging the fellow countrymen in the movement for the independent reunification of the nation and achieving solidarity with broad segments of pro-reunification movement organisations at home and abroad, true to the three charters for national reunification. In particular, it devotedly worked for the successful holding of the pan-national rally and various forms of pro-reunification festivals with august 15 as an occasion to greatly help strengthen solidarity among the Koreans in the north and south of Korea and abroad, give a strong impetus to the desire and will of the fellow countrymen for the reunification of the country and develop the movement for the reunification of the country into a nationwide one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun in a signed article says today the movement of the Korean people for national reunification is confidently advancing along the orbit of independent reunification under the banner of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pomminryon should hold higher the banner of national independence, decisively smash all the attempts to ditch the joint declaration and encourage all the Koreans to the struggle to this end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It should work hard to carry out the three tasks to implement the joint declaration, improve the inter-Korean relations, give momentum to the pro-reunification movement and remove a threat to peace and obstacles to reunification in hearty response to the three appeals and three proposals made at the recent joint meeting of the DPRK government, political parties and organisations. By doing so, it should make great contributions to glorifying this year as a \"year of promoting the unity and reunification of the Korean nation by itself.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Just is the patriotic pro-reunification movement of Pomminryon that is working hard to achieve national independence and great unity, guided by the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson expresses the expectation that the north headquarters of Pomminryon will creditably discharge its mission and duty in opening a decisive phase for national reunification under the banner of national independence.    \r\n\r\n"
