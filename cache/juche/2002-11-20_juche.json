There is no reason for it to talk about what it called \"permit\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Delegations to the inter-Korean ministerial talks have visited Pyongyang and Seoul several times but they have never received a permit to make a trip. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Clear is an aim sought by the U.S. in raising such an issue of \"permit\" for the first time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It seeks to stymie the projects of reconnecting inter-Korean rail links welcomed by the whole Korean nation and the world and, furthermore, torpedo the construction of the railroad linking Asia and Europe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a more serious attention is that such moves of the U.S. are timed to coincide with its \"nuclear racket\" intended to infringe upon the Korean nation's right to existence and sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement expressed belief that the South Koreans, the countries concerned and the world peace-loving people who are interested in the reconnection of the inter-Korean rail and road links would turn out in a struggle to frustrate the U.S. unreasonable interference and meet its challenge.    \r\n\r\n"

He is keen to hamstring the efforts of the two countries to implement the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang declaration, bending down to the high-handed demand of the U.S. by doing so, he seeks to torpedo the process of improving the abnormal DPRK-Japan relations and push the situation to confrontation. That was why he was so vociferous about the need to establish the Japan-U.S. joint MD. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This move of the Japanese bellicose forces to step up the joint MD under the pretext of the \"missile threat\" from the DPRK compels it to heighten the vigilance against them. This also prompts the DPRK to take a corresponding measure as it is a new dangerous move to attack and stifle the DPRK by force of arms. \r\n\r\n"

And the matters arising in the north-south managing districts are to be consulted and dealt with between the north and the south according to an agreement by the military of the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Therefore, there is no need nor justification for the U.S. Forces side to interfere in the issue of project-related personnel going in and out the Demilitarized Zone. It is a shameless burglary act that however, the U.S. Forces side is now poking its nose into the matter of the Korean nation in defiance of the contents of the agreement it signed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Although the U.S. is vociferating about \"anti-terrorism\" under the signboard of \"peace\" and \"security,\" its hindrance to the inter-Korean project symbolic of peace and patriotism is a terrorist act against the security and reunification of the Korean nation and world peace.    \r\n\r\n"

This once again disappointed the peoples of the DPRK and Japan and the unbiased world public desirous of peace and stability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is that Japan has not yet sent back five Japanese related to the issue of kidnapping who had gone to Japan to visit their hometowns, in violation of an inter-governmental agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry clarified in an answer given to a question put by KCNA, the DPRK side allowed those five Japanese to visit their hometowns for the first time as desired by them from a humanitarian stand and it was its intention to let them return home together with their families for permanent residence while providing best conveniences to them if they wish. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, Japan was so brazen-faced as to break its promise all of a sudden, talking about the origin of the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nothing can be achieved without building confidence. The chief executive of Japan is also reported to have cited this as a maxim quite often. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes without saying that mutual confidence should be built before anything else if the two countries are to normalize their ties and become close and friendly countries, not close yet distant countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But, Japan has backpedalled its first promise made to the DPRK, deliberately creating such a serious situation where the prospect of such an important event as security talks looks very gloomy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan cannot see the city for the houses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the time the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang declaration was adopted the DPRK took a really difficult step in order to establish new DPRK-Japan relations based on confidence from a broad perspective, believing in Japan's commitments to make apology for its past crimes and render economic cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In Korea there is practically not a single Korean family that was not affected by such crimes of the Japanese imperialists as forcible drafting of millions of Koreans, the crime of forcing over 200,000 Korean women into sexual slavery for the Japanese imperial army and unlimited plunder and exploitation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan talked about the \"origin of the issue\", while detaining those Japanese. But the issue originated from Japan's colonial rule and its hostile policy toward the DPRK that has lasted for over half a century since the end of the Second World War and the resultant abnormal relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is short-sighted and illogical for Japan to insist on its assertion about \"origin,\" failing to find the true origin. This only reveals Japan's shamelessness and moral vulgarity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is seriously mistaken if it thinks that the DPRK will tolerate its behaviour of breaking the promise at the beck and call of some forces at home and outside forces, displeased with the DPRK-Japan normalization process. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Perfidy will only produce mistrust and, furthermore, more serious consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should send back those detained and properly behave at the very beginning of the process of normalizing bilateral ties, mindful that there is a limit to the DPRK's sincerity and patience. \r\n\r\n"
