            "content": "Rodong Sinmun condena palabras antinacionales de Lee Myung Bak\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPyongyang, 19 de agosto (ATCC) -- El llamado \"discurso conmemorativo\" pronunciado hace poco por el traidor Lee Myung Bak resulta el disparate antinacional y anti-reunificacion penetrado de punta a cabo de egolatria, excusa, engano al pueblo y chismes en busca de confrontacion fratricida.\n\t\t\t\t\t  Asi senala el periodico Rodong Sinmun en un comentario individual del dia 19 y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Al volver a cuestionar el caso de hundimiento del buque de guerra surcoreano, el lo califico de \"provocacion\" de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea y se atrevio a dar instrucciones hablando del supuesto \"cambio\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esto deviene intolerable provocacion y desafio a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Lo que causa mas indignacion es que el presento el \"proyecto de reunificacion por tres etapas\" de caracter anti-reunificacion, o sea, a traves de la \"comunidad en paz\", la \"comunidad economica\" y la \"comunidad nacional\", planteando como premisa la \"renuncia nuclear de la RPDC\". Para colmo, propuso absurdamente instituir el \"impuesto de la reunificacion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esto deviene la muestra de su criminal ambicion de la \"reunificacion de regimenes\" segun el proyecto de la \"desnuclearizacion, la apertura y 3 mil dolares\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Resulta muy ilogico hablar la \"comunidad en paz\" librando casi todos los dias con EE.UU. los ejercicios de guerra contra la connacional RPDC, abogar por la \"comunidad economica\" sofocando todos los proyectos de cooperacion N-S y demandar la \"comunidad nacional\" negando las declaraciones Norte-Sur e impidiendo la reunificacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El traidor Lee planteo esta vez el \"impuesto de la reunificacion\" en su siniestro intento de alcanzar la \"reunificacion mediante la fusion de regimenes\" como el caso de Alemania suponiendo la \"situacion de emergencia del Norte\", sin hacer caso del deseo unanime de todos los coreanos sobre la reunificacion independiente y pacifica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El \"impuesto de la reunificacion\" deviene el tributo de enfrentamiento y guerra para malgastar los impuestos recaudados a los habitantes surcoreanos en la campana de confrontacion fratricida, la preparacion de la guerra y la realizacion de la ambicion de la \"reunificacion de regimenes\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La banda del traidor Lee Myung Bak pagara caro su disparate de ese impuesto burlandose de la nacion coreana deseosa de reunificar el pais."
