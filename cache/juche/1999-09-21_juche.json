The Japanese government armed the ship with weapons of firing power stronger than ever before for the shipment of nuclear materials into Japan. The Maritime Safety Agency is mobilizing even planes for the pursuit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This shows that Japan which gets mad over the policy for nuclear armament and a military power acts rashly for the shipment of a large quantity of nuclear materials into Japan following in the wake of the U.S. in the international arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   After the Cold War, the U.S., styling itself the only superpower, has been engaged in high-handed practices like an international gendarme in dealing with a problem of the world peace and security, ignoring the position and authority of the United Nations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Typical of this are criminal air-raids on Yugoslavia over the Kosovo problem. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Following in the wake of the U.S., Japan is nowadays stockpiling a large quantity of nuclear materials by shipping them from European countries in disregard of the international laws and public opinion. Worse still, today, it is trying hard to control the peaceful activities of the Green Peace by force of arms as it seeks to prevent disclosure of its nuclear armament in the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such astonishing arbitrariness and outrages of Japan going against the desire of humankind aspiring after a new era of peace are an outright defiance to peace and future of humankind. They will never be tolerated. \r\n\r\n"

They say that Korea was divided under an \"international agreement\", not by outside forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun today says Korea was divided by outside forces, not under the \"agreement.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The commentary cites historical facts to prove that there were discussions between big powers about helping Korea to build an independent and sovereign state after World War II but there were no discussions about division of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States is chiefly responsible for the division of Korea. If it had not occupied South Korea by force of arms in place of Japanese imperialists following their defeat, Korea would not have been divided at all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The division of Korea began with the U.S. occupation of South Korea. It still continues as a result of the U.S. base intrigues and brigandish frauds for permanent division of the Korean peninsula. Nothing can deny or distort the stark historical facts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Even so, some countries, ignoring this, take a wrong attitude and stand. This is an act of defying the national interests and sovereignty of other countries for their own interests, only to give rise to serious apprehension. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK government will never remain a passive onlooker to the unfounded rumours about its sovereignty and national dignity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Those that deny and distort the stark historical facts on the background of Korea's division should ponder over the consequences to be entailed by their misbehaviour. \r\n\r\n"

Paektu, thus laying a solid foundation for inheriting the revolutionary cause of Juche and providing humankind with a great fortune of having the sun of the 21st century. \r\n\r\n"
