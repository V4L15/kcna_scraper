The U.S. is posing a nuclear threat to the Korean Peninsula, while trying to mislead the public opinion with much ado about \"nuclear weapons program\" of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind their moves is a sinister intention to disarm the DPRK and deprive it of its vital rights so as to enslave all the Koreans. Once they trigger a war against the DPRK, South Korea will not go safe. If a nuclear war breaks out in the small Korean Peninsula, all the Koreans in the north and south will suffer from it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From a logical viewpoint, the DPRK's army-based policy is the most independent and just patriotic policy to foil the U.S. imperialists' moves for aggression and protect the dignity and interests of the whole nation including South Koreans.    \r\n   \r\n"

Harrison, senior scholar and director of the Asia Program Centre for International Policy in the U.S., in an article carried in the October 22 issue of the U.S. newspaper USA Today.\r\n The Bush administration refused to accept the proposal on the grounds that the \"nuclear program of North Korea\" is in violation of the 1994 nuclear agreement, he noted. The agreement is related only to the plutonium related facilities that existed in those days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. violated the process of the normalization of relations, the key point of the nuclear agreement, and the agreement on giving formal assurances to North Korea against the threat or use of nuclear weapons by the U.S., he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It recalled that the new security strategy of the bush administration violated the major points of the nuclear agreement with North Korea by claiming that it is entitled to  make a preemptive strike including the use of nuclear weapons, if necessary, against those countries that are regarded as threats to \"peace.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He stressed that the U.S. is urgently required to have negotiations with Pyongyang to keep the 1994 nuclear agreement alive and finally settle the \"nuclear issue\" of North Korea.\r\n\r\n"

Paektu, is successfully carrying forward the revolutionary traditions of Mt. Paektu, says Rodong Sinmun Sunday in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His unshakable will to carry forward the traditions found its clear manifestation in the fact that he energetically led the work to spruce up the revolutionary battle sites in the area of Mt. Paektu after unrolling a gigantic plan for it. His will is also clearly manifested in the efforts he exerted to lead the army and the people to dynamically step up the building of a powerful nation in the spirit of the red flag of Mt. Paektu and value and project the revolutionary forerunners. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has long made great efforts to build the revolutionary battle sites in the area of Mt. Paektu to be handed down to posterity. As a result, the area turned into an eternal fountainhead of the Korean revolution and a centre for education in the revolutionary traditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was in the revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu that the people in Jagang Province displayed the Kanggye Spirit in the period of the \"arduous march\" and the workers in Ranam kindled a torch to make a revolutionary advance in the new century, learning from the indefatigable fighting spirit displayed during the anti-Japanese struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The noble trait of respecting the revolutionary forerunners is prevailing in the DPRK which is a manifestation of the noble desire of its army and people to successfully carry forward the revolutionary traditions of Mt. Paektu and accomplish the cause of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to the Mt. Paektu traditions and the spirit of the red flag the cause of building a powerful nation will make more dynamic progress and the desire of the revolutionary forerunners is sure to come true on this land.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
