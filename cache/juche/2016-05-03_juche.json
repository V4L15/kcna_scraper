Feeling a critical situation, she told the others to escape from the spot.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After all, the abductors ran away in a great hurry on the bus with employees already aboard.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Before putting their plot into practice, the IS agents gathered passports of the employees in advance for exit formalities and cleared all formalities for their departure with already prepared south Korean passports. And they took the abductees on an airplane for Seoul.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the abductees noticed after boarding that they were destined for south Korea and had a row to get off the plane, the agents and the chief deceived them by telling they were on a \"special mission\" to be carried out in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then, questions were put by reporters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Choe Rye Yong, Ri Mi Song, Sin Song A and Kim Yun Hui told reporters that the south Korean regime's assertion about \"group defection from the north at free will\" is a sheer fabrication. And they stressed that Jon Ok Hyang, Ryu Song Yong and all other fellows were taken in by the south Korean puppet group and they have had strong feelings of love for their parents and brothers and sisters and socialist homeland.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They went on to say:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those abductees have been reportedly staging a hunger strike in demand of their immediate repatriation, despite the persistently forced \"allegiance\", and some of them are in a critical condition after falling in a faint. We are eager to cut the south Korean puppet group to pieces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nobody will go for oneself to cursed south Korea where gangsters run amuck, firing tear gas and water cannon at the families of victims to the Ferry Sewol disaster demanding a probe into the accident.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then, statements were made by mothers of abductees Ri Ji Ye, Jon Ok Hyang, Pak Ok Byol, Ri Pom and Han Haeng Bok.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Expressing their surging wrath at the Park Geun Hye's group of traitors, they said: Our daughters have grown up in happiness with nothing to envy under the loving care of the DPRK, that's why, we say it is a whopping lie that they \"yearned after\" south Korea, a living hell.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet group is forcing \"defection\" on them kept in solitary rooms, the mothers pointed out, urging it to allow them to meet their beloved daughters at once.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The families of abductees and witnesses contended that the case of \"group defection from the north\" is aimed to divert elsewhere the sentiment of the south Korean public critical of the \"government\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Refuting the south Korean regime's assertion that parents of abductees belong to the \"high-ranking\" stratum and enjoy \"special treatment\", they said that all occupations are equally honorable in the DPRK and that the puppet group is turning black into white for confrontation with fellow countrymen and plot-breeding.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group is going foolish in a bid to break the single-minded unity of the DPRK through such base and crude farce, the speakers said, adding they will struggle for the return of those abductees.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They condemned the south Korean regime's hideous unethical act and urged it to unconditionally accept the parents' just demand for reunion with their abducted daughters. And they ardently called upon all those present at the conference to join in their struggle. S"
