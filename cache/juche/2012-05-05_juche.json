It is ridiculous to speak ill of these people over \"human rights issue\", \"heredity\" and \"seclusion.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The loud shouts of \"Hurrah!\" that shook the square was enough to prove that the attempts of those letting loose deliberate and malignant invectives against the north to do harm to the DPRK are futile."
