This is the jungle logic that runs through the \"resolutions\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOn October 14, 2006, the UNSC at the prodding of the U.S. fabricated the \"resolution\" 1718 on \"sanctions\" against the DPRK allegedly to cope with its development of nuclear, missiles, etc., asserting that the first nuclear test of the DPRK posed \"threat to the international peace\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tScientists and technicians of the DPRK successfully launched satellite Kwangmyongsong 2 by their own efforts and their own technology and wisdom on April 5, 2009 despite persistent political and military pressure, threats and blockade of the imperialist allied forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe hostile forces, however, made public on April 14, 2009, a \"presidential statement\" of the UNSC, taking issue with the DPRK's satellite launch, hurting the dignity of the Korean people and blatantly violating the sovereignty of the DPRK. On June 12, they cooked up another anti-DPRK \"resolution\" 1874, finding fault with its second nuclear test conducted as part of self-defence steps. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is nothing new that the UNSC played into the hands of the U.S. in enforcing a hostile policy towards the DPRK, pressurized by its highhanded and arbitrary practices. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was due to the U.S. that at any meeting of the UN Security Council its members could not have sincere dialogue and negotiations to find a fair solution to issues but used to allow the fabrication of unjust \"resolutions\" calling for unilateral sanctions, pressure and blockade against the DPRK, pursuant to the scenario of the U.S. characterized by the application of double standards.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. claimed that tightened sanctions alone can solve the Korean issue. It has systematically used the UN as a means for internationalizing the hostile conception and policy that the DPRK should be banned from using nuclear energy and developing space because they can lead to the bolstering up of its military capability, threat to the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe recent racket for \"sanctions\" against the DPRK is part of above-said impudent scenario of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe prevailing situation goes to prove that the principle of equal sovereignty clarified in the UN Charter remains only in name and justice should be protected by every nation's own efforts and it is necessary to cope with the U.S. hostile policy by force, not by word. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt also proves that the road of independence, Songun and socialism chosen by the DPRK is the just one.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEven though the UNSC comes out with any \"presidential statement\" and \"resolution\" or with something tougher than them, the DPRK will never tolerate them but vehemently denounce them if they violate the just sovereign rights of the DPRK even a bit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe UNSC should make an apology for the crimes it committed by seriously violating the sovereignty of an independent state as a marionette of the U.S. and withdraw all its unjust \"resolutions\" against the DPRK."

            "content": "Naturaleza criminal de resoluciones no.1718 y no.1874 de CS de la ONU\r\nPyongyang, 1 de febrero (ACNC) -- El 22 de enero pasado, el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU aprobo a instigacion de Estados Unidos la \"resolucion de sancion\" anti-Republica Popular Democratica de Corea acusandola de lanzamiento de su satelite con fines pacificos con el objetivo de frenar el fortalecimiento de la capacidad de defensa nacional y el desarrollo economico de esta y privarle del derecho al lanzamiento del satelite con fines pacificos. \n\t\t\t\t\tEsta vez, Estados Unidos y sus seguidores cuestionaron el lanzamiento de satelite de la RPDC en virtud de las \"resoluciones\" no. 1718 y no. 1874 del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC no reconocio ni una vez esos productos de la ofensiva de presion internacional auspiciada por EE.UU. cuyo objetivo reside en derrocar la ideologia y el regimen optados por el pueblo coreano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas \"resoluciones\" mencionadas se caracterizan por la doctrina gangsteril de impedir a los paises que no agradan a EE.UU. el fortalecimiento de la capacidad de defensa nacional y hasta el derecho al uso del cosmos con fines pacificos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 14 de octubre de 2006, el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU, a instigacion de EE.UU., aprobo la \"resolucion\" no.1718 que permite ejercer la \"sancion\" a la RPDC en los dominios relacionados con las armas nucleares, misiles y otros calificando la primera prueba nuclear de la RPDC de \"amenaza a la paz internacional\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAun en medio de las persistentes presiones politicas y militares, la amenaza y el bloqueo de las fuerzas imperialistas aliadas, los cientificos y tecnicos coreanos lanzaron exitosamente el 5 de abril de 2009 el satelite \"Kwangmyongsong-2\" fabricado con su propia fuerza, tecnologia e inteligencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, las fuerzas hostiles publicaron el 14 de abril la \"declaracion del presidente\" del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU que insulta la dignidad del pueblo coreano e infringe flagrantemente la soberania de la RPDC cuestionando el lanzamiento del satelite. Y el 12 de junio, volvieron a fabricar la \"resolucion\" anti-RPDC no. 1874 so pretexto de de la segunda prueba nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo es la primera vez que el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU fue utilizado en la maniobra de hostilidad a la RPDC de EE.UU. por haberse rendido ante su despotismo y sus arbitrariedades. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido al imperio, en las reuniones del Consejo de Seguridad no se han realizado ninguna vez el dialogo y negociaciones sinceros para buscar la via imparcial de la solucion del problema y se fabricaban segun el guion de EE.UU. las injustas \"resoluciones\" que imponen unilateralmente a la RPDC la \"sancion\", la presion y el bloqueo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tConsiderando como si la \"sancion\" intransigente fuera el \"unico remedio\" de la solucion del problema coreano, EE.UU. vino abusando sistematicamente de la ONU para internacionalizar su concepcion y politica hostiles, segun la cual se debe impedir el uso de energia nuclear y el desarrollo del cosmos de la RPDC que serviran para el fortalecimiento de la capacidad militar para amenazar al imperio. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa presente campana de \"sancion\" tambien es la continuacion de estas maniobras tan cinicas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa situacion de hoy muestra que el principio de igualdad de la soberania anotado en la Carta de la ONU no pasa de ser letras vacias y que los paises deben defender la justicia solo con su propia fuerza y hacer frente a la politica hostil de EE.UU. no con la palabra sino con las fuerzas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY evidencia que es justo el camino de la independencia, el Songun y el socialismo, optado por la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC no tolerara jamas la \"declaracion del presidente\" ni la \"resolucion\" del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU que denigran aun en lo minimo el derecho independiente de si misma. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU debe pedir disculpas por su acto criminal de haber infringido gravemente la soberania de un Estado soberano actuando como titere de EE.UU. y revocar todas las injustas \"resoluciones\" anti-RPDC."

He aqui la gravedad y la peligrosidad de las persistentes y siniestras maniobras de los reaccionarios japoneses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCada vez que ellos niegan sus delitos del pasado y actuan vilmente para liberarse de su responsabilidad, centuplicaran sus crimenes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades japonesas deben reconocer sinceramente sobre sus delitos del pasado conforme a la demanda de la sociedad internacional, pedir disculpa y tomar las medidas cabales para indemnizarlos."
