            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on Three Principles of National Reunification \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 3 (KCNA) -- 33 years ago, President Kim Il Sung met with the south side's delegate who came here to attend the High-Level Political Talks between North and South of Korea and clarified the three principles of national reunification, the cornerstone for the accomplishment of the cause of national reunification.\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun today carries a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The three principles of national reunification are the most just and reasonable programme for reunification as they indicate the principles and ways of smoothly achieving the reunification of the country by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation without any deviation in view of its demand for independence and interests, the essence and nature of the issue of national reunification and the reality of the divided country.\r\n The principle that national reunification should be achieved independently without reliance on outside forces and free from their interference is a fundamental principle, the lifeline of the cause of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The three principles of national reunification turn the cause of national reunification into the Koreans' cause of independence both in name and reality and provide a sure guarantee for its victorious accomplishment as they regard the principle of independence as a fundamental stand and principle to be adhered to in the struggle for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle that national reunification should be achieved by peaceful means without resorting to arms is one which indicates a basic way of settling the issue of national reunification in the common interests of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is only the Korean nation that will suffer from a fratricidal war and this will only give foreign forces a chance to fish in troubled waters. The Korean nation stands for peace and peaceful reunification. The principle of peaceful reunification is, indeed, the most just way of national reunification which fully accords with the will and interests of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle that great national unity should be promoted by transcending the differences in ideology, ideal and social system is a sure guarantee for achieving the independent and peaceful reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The three principles of national reunification are highly important guidelines to be held high by all the Koreans desirous of the reunification of the country and a charter for reunification to be invariably maintained and implemented by them till the country is reunified no matter how the situation and circumstances may change.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It has turned its face away from the elementary rights of those who underwent all sorts of misfortune and sufferings due to its past policy of aggression and their descendants. This is the \"conscience\" of Japan at present. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We are strongly opposed to Japan's impudent bid for a permanent membership of the UNSC on behalf of all the Asians who fell victim to the Japanese imperialist aggression in the past, in solidarity not only with the forces of conscience in Japan but with the forces around the world aspiring after lasting peace in Asia.    \r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The DPRK has made it clear more than once that its peaceful missile program can never be a threat to those countries which are not hostile toward it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the Japanese reactionaries are hastening the establishment of a triangular missile defense system with the U.S. and south Korea. They are seeking a preemptive attack on the DPRK, instigated by the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Capitalizing on the U.S. imperialists' policy of stifling the DPRK, they are speeding up preparations for a preemptive strike at the DPRK and, at the same time, getting overheated in their maneuvers to grab Tok Islet and introduce sanctions against it, thus driving the DPRK-Japan relations to the worst phase and rendering the regional situation strained. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the invariable intention of the Japanese reactionaries to realize their reinvasion scheme without difficulty with the backing of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they opt for an adventurous preemptive attack, the army and people of the DPRK will deal an annihilating blow to them by every possible means.    \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Take Germany for example. It has honestly reflected on history and shown zeal in settling its past crimes, thus winning the confidence of the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But Japan has taken a road quite contrary to this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The intention and reactionary scheme behind the distortion of history make the international community draw without difficulty the conclusion that Japan is pursuing a war, not peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the present look of Japan that the whole state is rapidly stepping into militarism, fascism and rightist reaction for a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This must be checked at any cost as it is a very dangerous development from the viewpoint of peace in Asia and the rest of the world.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And a servicewoman leashed the neck of a naked Iraqi detainee to drag him like a dog. Such inhuman abuses committed by American soldiers in Iraq have still enraged people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The criminal acts, perpetrated under the patronage of the U.S. administration and upper echelons of the military, are not an issue limited only to the Iraqis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Human dignity is trampled down ruthlessly everywhere the U.S. aggression forces reach. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The 60-year-long occupation of south Korea by the U.S. imperialists is a crime-woven history full of brutal rape, gang-rape, violence and human-slaughter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Innumerable are such crimes U.S. troops have committed in south Korea as the murder of Yun Kum I and close haircutting of a woman in Tongduchon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Famous writer of Korea Paek In Jun, in his satire \"Naked America\" written in the early 1960s, said GIs stripped a south Korean woman naked and painted her body before driving her out in street, but it is the American imperialists who are naked before human conscience, fully revealing their true colors as beasts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the United States, which does not feel shame at being naked under the eyes of humankind, has done only shows that \"justice\", \"freedom\" and \"defence of human rights\" on its lips are all hypocrisy.    \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"
