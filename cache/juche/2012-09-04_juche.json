            "content": "Kim Jong Un Visits Families of Working People Who Moved to New Flats in Changjon Street\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPyongyang, September 4 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, first chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, together with his wife Ri Sol Ju, visited families of working people who moved to new flats in Changjon Street.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe first leg of his visit was the family of Sim Tong Su, teacher at Pyongyang University of Mechanical Engineering who lives in flat no. 1 on the second floor from the first entrance of Neighborhood Unit 1 of Jongro-dong in Changjon Street.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe new apartment houses in Changjon Street are the ones to which leader Kim Jong Il paid deep attention from sites to designing and building, he said, adding if he were alive, he would visit them before any others.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter looking round every room, he sat down on the floor of the room unreservedly and had a talk with family members. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe kindly asked them if they liked the new flat, saying he wished to visit apartment houses after being told by senior officials that all settlers liked their new flats and at last spared time to come there. He said he was pleased to hear the family members like everything not only the structure of the flat but its furniture.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSaying that it is a custom of Koreans to visit a new house with a box of matches, he added he brought with him household articles as he could not come there with a match box alone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tI have brought with me \"Collections of World Famous Juvenile Stories\", he said, asking them to keep them well and hand them over to grandsons to be born. It is not good for eyes if one watches a wide-screen TV from a short distance, he noted. He cheerfully laughed when watching the family members pleased to see a set of vessels.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen he asked them if they have only daughters, he was pleased to hear that a son is now serving in the Korean People's Army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLearning that the wife is a teacher at a secondary school and all her daughters are teachers, he said with satisfaction that they are a family of educationists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDevotion and sincerity of teachers are not to be seen now just as the roots of a big tree are not seen but they will find their manifestation when their students will contribute to the prosperity of the country when grown up, he said, noting this family is a patriotic one devoting itself to bringing up the rising generation of the country. This is a worthwhile visit, he added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWishing the family members success in their future work, he offered a toast to them with his loving care before having a photo taken with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe next leg of his visit was the family of Pak Sung Il, a worker of the City Beautification Office in Central District, who is residing in Flat No. 2 on the second floor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTaking hands of the family members greeting him with great excitement, he asked them about their jobs. He entered the room, pleased to hear that all of the family members are workers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe took deep care of their living down to all details as their real father would do. He unreservedly sat down with them who settled in a modern flat with all amenities and had a talk with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTaking on his lap the second son of Pak Sung Il and patting him on his cheek, he asked him to which school he goes, how old he is and asked Pak if he had only one son.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe said it was pity to hear that his first son, a third-year student of a secondary school, had not yet come back from school.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe entered a living room and a study room for children. When seeing a painting drawn by the second son, he kindly taught what should be done to finish the painting.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPak said he could not believe after moving to the flat that it was their flat as they had lived in a single-room flat in the past and now they have a five-room flat. Hearing that the flat is very nice as it is furnished with all kinds of high quality furniture, Kim Jong Un said he was pleased that the masters of the flat liked it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is the socialist system in the DPRK that the interests of the people are placed above everything else and all the policies of the party and the state are enforced to serve the people, he said, adding with deep emotion how greatly Kim Jong Il would be pleased if he had seen this reality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter receiving greetings offered by the first son back home very late, he was very glad to see him and kindly asked him where he had been to.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBeing told by him that he came back from a football group training, he heard about his determination to become a football player in the future and hoped his wish would come true.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Jong Un and his wife Ri Sol Ju also offered toasts to Pak Sung Il and his wife and presented them with gifts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRi Sol Ju presented the dishes personally cooked by her and let the children taste them and kindly taught how to prepare them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Jong Un had a picture taken with Pak Sung Il-Jang Sun Nyo family, wishing them happiness in the new flat.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe visited the newly wed family of labor hero Mun Kang Sun, a worker of the Kim Jong Suk Pyongyang Textile Mill, residing in flat No. 1 on the first floor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter being told that they had a wedding ceremony in May last and received a new flat two months later, he asked with smile if they are happy and how many babies they wish to have in the future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe laughed a hearty laugh, hearing their wishes to get a son and a daughter who will resemble her mother, hero weaver. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHearing the workers' family say words fail to describe how nice their new flat is, he said, adding he feels easy about at the apartment houses in Changjon Street as all people like them so much.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe offered toasts to the newly wed couple, had a picture taken with them and gave them household articles as souvenirs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBefore leaving the flat, he kindly took the hands of the couple with tears rolling down their cheeks, he wished them happiness, adding that he would come to see a baby any time when he passes Changjon Street."

            "content": "Politica hostil de EE.UU. es escollo principal al problema nuclear (III)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPyongyang, 4 de septiembre (ACNC) -- La Agencia Central de Noticias de Corea (ACNC) transmite abajo la tercera parte \"La renuncia de la politica hostil es el requisito de la solucion del problema nuclear\" del memorando \"La politica hostil a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea de Estados Unidos es el escollo principal para la solucion del problema nuclear de la Peninsula Coreana\" publicado el 31 de agosto por el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de la RPDC:\n\t\t\t\t\tSe hace cada dia mas dificil la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana debido a la politica hostil de EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY en la etapa actual no es radiante la perspectiva de ser renunciada esa politica norteamericana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA diferencia de las palabras de las autoridades de la administracion norteamericana de \"no tener intencion hostil\" a la RPDC, las acciones de EE.UU. con respecto a esta se tornan cada dia mas hostiles. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn abril pasado, EE.UU. violo flagrantemente los derechos independientes de la RPDC, Estado soberano, acusandole injustamente del lanzamiento de satelite con fines pacificos. Y las tropas norteamericanas estacionadas en el Sur de Corea realizaron los ejercicios de tiro de gran dimension tomando por blanco la bandera de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn seguida, el organo intrigante de inteligencia del Sur de Corea trazo la conspiracion de destruir las estatuas de bronce de los grandes hombres del monte Paektu bajo el mando del organo de inteligencia de EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl mismo tiempo, en la Peninsula Coreana y su contorno se aumentan los ejercicios belicos bilaterales o trilaterales entre EE.UU. y sus lacayos, se hace cada dia mas evidente su caracter ofensivo y se amplia su esfera. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los hechos muestran que se intensifica de modo escalonado el grado de hostilidad a la RPDC de EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto esta relacionado con la nueva estrategia de defensa nacional de EE.UU., publicada el 5 de enero de 2012 por la administracion Obama. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa nueva estrategia plantea trasladar hasta 2020 de Europa a la region de Asia-Pacifico el 10 por ciento de las fuerzas armadas norteamericanas estacionadas en ultramar para que en esa region se concentre el 60 por ciento de tales efectivos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn general, el aumento armamentista requiere el pretexto de la \"existencia o la amenaza del enemigo\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn este sentido, en el Nordeste Asiatico la RPDC es la unica enemiga de EE.UU. Las potencias estan acostumbradas a abstenerse de describir publicamente como enemiga a otra potencia. Pues,  EE.UU. quiere mantener a la RPDC como enemiga en muchos anos futuros, hasta que se cumpla su nueva estrategia de defensa, para justificar el aumento de sus fuerzas armadas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, la nueva estrategia no da ninguna garantia de que EE.UU. no atacaria a la RPDC para apretar el cerco militar sobre las potencias de Eurasia al ocupar toda la Peninsula Coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa situacion creada urge a la RPDC detener de todos modos el estallido de nueva guerra en la Peninsula Coreana y hacer los preparativos perfectos para trasladar a la batalla por la reunificacion de la patria cuando se desate la guerra. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto es el motivo y la situacion de fondo que obligaron a la RPDC a revisar generalmente el problema nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. tiene dos opciones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa primera es cambiar valiente y radicalmente su modo de pensar del periodo de la Guerra Fria y renunciar su anacronica politica hostil a la RPDC para contribuir a la paz y seguridad de la Peninsula Coreana y afianzar la seguridad nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi EE.UU. muestra con sus acciones la voluntad de hacerlo, la RPDC esta lista a responderle en cualquier momento. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl gran Dirigente Kim Jong Il dijo el 4 de agosto de 1997 que no consideramos a EE.UU. como enemigo jurado sino deseamos la normalizacion de las relaciones RPDC-EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Mariscal Kim Jong Un desea abrir una nueva coyuntura de desarrollo de las relaciones con todos los paises que nos tratan con amabilidad, sin hacer caso de las relaciones del pasado. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa otra via es seguir manteniendo como ahora la politica hostil, frente a la cual la RPDC aumentaria constantemente su arsenal nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi EE.UU. se obstina en sacar sus provechos sacrificando los intereses de la RPDC, esta se vera obligada a enfrentarle con intransigencia hasta el final.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC ya es el digno pais con armas nucleares y ya paso completamente la era en que EE.UU. la amenazaba con bombas atomicas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo observaremos solo con brazos cruzados las crecientes maniobras hostiles de EE.UU. sino haremos todo lo posible por defender el destino del pais y nacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSeria una gran equivocacion considerar como una tactica la posicion intransigente de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHemos poseido las armas nucleares no para hacer negocios con EE.UU. sino para hacer frente a ese mayor poseedor de armas nucleares del mundo que intenta a atacarnos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl disuasivo nuclear de autodefensa de la RPDC es el remedio omnipotente para prevenir la guerra y defender fidedignamente la paz y la estabilidad en la Peninsula Coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el caso de que EE.UU. no tome la opcion correcta, sera prolongada inevitablemente la tenencia de armas nucleares por la RPDC y el disuasivo nuclear de esta se tornara modernizado y ampliado en un nivel fuera de la imaginacion del primero."
