Yet, they are justifying their violent action, taking issue with other kind of cargo aboard the ship.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This cargo is nothing but aging weapons which are to send back to Cuba after overhauling them according to a legitimate contract.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Panamanian authorities should take a step to let the apprehended crewmen and ship leave without delay."

According to the plan touted by the U.S., the region should have already been brought under control. But the situation turned out to be different.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Mid-east region placed the U.S. in an awkward position.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Iran's peaceful nuclear activities have been strengthened and war \"against terrorism\" started by the U.S. has triggered off the vicious cycle of terror and retaliation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Israel carried out an air raid on Syria and has continuously expanded the construction of Jewish settlements in the land of Palestine in a provocative way, deteriorating the regional situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is clear reason that the U.S. pays deep attention to the issue of the Mid-east region this year. Israel used to disturb the stability of the region at the instigation of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. fails to check Israel, the situation in the Mid-east region will lead to a catastrophe phase, provoking a backlash to the U.S. which patronized Israel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is persistently interfering in the Mid-east issue and steadily inciting Israel while working hard to realize the strategy to dominate the Asia-Pacific region. This indicates Washington's internal trouble.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Endless is the U.S. greed for hegemony."
