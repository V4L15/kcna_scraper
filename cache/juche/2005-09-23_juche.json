This contradictory arrogant attitude is a typical example of double-dealing tactics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Washington might know well what sort of fate the NPT would face and what serious situation could be created in the world should it pursue its ambition to launch a nuclear war and its policy of threatening other countries with nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. truly opts for this, it may go its own way while allowing others to go their own ways. But there is one thing the U.S. should bear in mind. In that case the U.S. will be entirely accountable for the breach of the world non-proliferation regime.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
