This is nothing but a sinister design to put the DPRK in an international siege. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the only best solution to the nuclear issue for the DPRK and the U.S. to have direct talks on an equal footing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These talks alone will help settle the hostile relations between the two countries and peacefully and fairly solve the nuclear issue in the interests of the two peoples in conformity with the trend of the development of international relations.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In this regard a spokesman for the DPRK General Department of Atomic Energy released a statement on Friday.\r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n 206kg of plutonium reported to be missing is enough to make 25 nuclear bombs.\r\n As regards this incident the Japanese authorities have not yet clarified the cause of their missing and whereabouts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities which claim that they have honestly received nuclear inspection have nothing to say except asserting that such a large amount of plutonium went \"missing all of a sudden.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This does not stand to reason. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is not understandable, given the fact that the \"supplementary protocol to follow up the safeguards agreement\" which calls for reinforcing the inspection regulations of the past has been in force in Japan since December of 1999. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This incident reminds one of the abnormal incident in which 70kg of plutonium which had not been reported to the IAEA was discovered at the Tokai Nuclear Fuel Factory in Japan, 1994, stunning the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The frequent cases of concealing plutonium in Japan go to prove what a dangerous phase Japan's nuclear weaponization, a matter of serious concern of the international community for many years, has reached. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is arousing suspicion surrounding this incident is the attitude of the United States and the IAEA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and the IAEA which have been so vociferous about the nuclear activity of the DPRK for peaceful purposes are moving heaven and earth to calm down the international criticism and concern over the disclosed case of concealing plutonium in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even the director general of the IAEA has come out to defend Japan for no reason over this incident, saying that it thinks the nuclear substance has not flown from the factory to elsewhere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts go to clearly prove that the U.S. and the IAEA are applying double standards in handling the nuclear issue to achieve their political purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula now getting serious day by day is a product of the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK and the double standards and partial attitude of the IAEA, its cat's paw. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The double standards applied by the U.S. and the IAEA in dealing with the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and the nuclear issue of Japan only make the settlement of the issues more difficult. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
