It is a strange farce that they began trumpeting about \"victory\" in the Korean war all of a sudden.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t How will the U.S. explain the surrender document signed by Clark, the then commander of the \"UN forces\" on display in the hall in Panmunjom where the armistice agreement was signed?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Afterwards, Clark deplored that what he earned while executing the orders of his government was an unworthy fame as the first commander of the U.S. forces who signed the armistice agreement without any victory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and south Korean puppet forces are talking about \"day of victory in the war\" in disregard of the historical facts, a poor political cartoon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Entering the 21st century, the U.S., oblivious of the lesson taught by its defeat in the Korean war, is persisting in its moves for a war of aggression to dominate the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is staging ceaseless war maneuvers on the Korean peninsula.

Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK won a historic victory in the war against the armed invasion by the U.S. imperialists. They also won one victory after another in the ceaseless stand-off with the imperialist allied forces. This was ascribable to the outstanding leadership of President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Il Sung defeated two formidable imperialist forces and exalted the dignity and honor of the country and the people with his Juche-oriented military idea and distinguished stratagem.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. mobilized more than two million forces in the Korean war and applied the most barbarous war methods and means to nip the DPRK in the bud.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK led by the President always took initiative in the whole course of the war, inflicting an ignominious defeat on the U.S. imperialists and demonstrating the stamina of heroic Korea before the whole world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The President advanced unique strategies and tactics and war methods unprecedented in the world history of wars in each period and at each stage of the war, thus making sure that the numerical and technical superiorities of the enemies were defeated by means of political, ideological, strategic and tactical ones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By leading the war to victory, the President brought about the beginning of a downhill turn for the U.S. imperialist aggressors and made an immortal contribution to accomplishing the cause of global independence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The history of Kim Jong Il's outstanding and tested Songun leadership occupies brilliant pages in the DPRK's history of victory in the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il achieved a victory in the fierce confrontation with the imperialists and the U.S. by providing his unique Songun revolutionary leadership.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even after the ceasefire, there continued fierce confrontation with the U.S.-led imperialists and the forces hostile to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Entering the new century, the U.S. imperialists have gone to extremes in their moves to wantonly violate the sovereignty of other countries and invade and seize strategic strongholds.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. plunged the world into the whirlwind of a \"war on terror\" with the September 11 incident as an occasion, thus cruelly dampening the human desire for peace and stretching its tentacles of aggression and interference to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The struggle to foil the U.S. imperialists' moves to ignite a new war on the Korean peninsula at any cost was an unprecedented war without a gun report as fierce as the last Korean war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il foiled every move of the imperialist allied forces for a war and their nuclear threat and blackmail with his Songun revolutionary leadership and won a sure victory in the struggle to defend socialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's great tradition of winning a great victory in the war is given steady continuity under the leadership of Kim Jong Un, illustrious commander of Mt. Paektu."
