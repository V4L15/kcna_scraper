            "content": "Japan's ambition for overseas aggression under fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 23 (KCNA) -- The director general of the Defence Agency of Japan in a recent interview with the Japanese Sekaishuho (world affairs weekly) fully disclosed the ulterior aim sought by Japan in seeking an independent missile defence system after he clamoured about the plan at the talks held between the military authorities of the U.S. and Japan in late June.\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Although the Japanese reactionary ruling quarters are describing the projected system as one for \"defence\" in a bid to justify their moves, their ambition for overseas aggression lurking behind this plan can never be covered up, just as a gimlet in the bulging bag is bound to protrude. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan seeks to establish military domination over East Asia through the establishment of its independent Missile Defence system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also intends to consolidate its military foundation for overseas aggression through the establishment of the system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no need for Japan to set up such a system as its security is guaranteed by the U.S. under the \"U.S.-Japan security pact.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, there is no country attempting to make a missile strike at Japan or invade it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Yet, Japan is working hard to establish this system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ulterior intention of the Japanese reactionary ruling quarters is to revise the present constitution for paving the way for overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is keen on the development of the independent Missile Defence system, although it is aware that the U.S. MD program is almost infeasible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the Japanese reactionaries seek in this is to completely abandon the principle of \"exclusive defence.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the calculation of Japan that it will hold an unchallenged military position by establishing the independent Missile Defence system and invade other Asian countries with ease. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is grossly mistaken if it thinks it can have its security guaranteed and invade other countries as it pleases with the help of this system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are well advised to behave themselves.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Independent national reunification called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 23 (KCNA) -- The DPRK-Russia Moscow declaration made it clear that supporting the Korean people's efforts to settle the issue of national reunification independently and peacefully by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation according to the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration is helpful to the settlement of the issue and that any outside interference in this process should not be allowed, says. Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article.\r\n It continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a clarification of the stand that the issue of Korea's reunification should be settled independently and peacefully by its people's concerted efforts free from any foreign interference and a clear proof of the justice of the Korean people's cause of independent and peaceful reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people's cause of independent and peaceful reunification is a national issue which should be settled by the efforts of the Koreans, the master of the country, in conformity with their will, requirements and interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the Koreans who sincerely wish national reunification with vital interests in it and who are capable of accomplishing its cause. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As national reunification is an issue belonging to the sovereignty of the Korean nation, the nation should resolve the issue by its own efforts as a master according to its independent will, requirements and interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The cause of independent and peaceful national reunification is a nationwide cause, which can be achieved only when the Korean nation thoroughly rejects outside aggression and interference and pools its efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists have kept South Korea under their military occupation for over half a century with a wild ambition to occupy the whole of Korea with South Korea as a springboard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Realities prove that it is impossible to solve the issue of Korea's reunification and the Korean nation cannot be free from disasters of a nuclear war to be ignited by outside forces as long as South Korea remains under the u.s. imperialists' military occupation and their moves for a new war go on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Korea's independent and peaceful reunification is to be achieved, the U.S. imperialist aggression troops, the author of national division and the foe of its reunification, should withdraw from south Korea, first of all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people's just cause of independent reunification is sure to triumph.     \r\n\r\n"
