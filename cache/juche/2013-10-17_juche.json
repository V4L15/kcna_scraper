He even staged the farce of \"testifying to such facts\" as \"test of propeller of a long-range missile\", \"replacement of over 44 percent of officers above army corps commander level\" and \"forward deployment of new-type multiple launch rocket system\", giving impression that he got inside information about the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t The IS, in the meantime, spread a groundless story about \"conditions in the concentration camps\" with the use of human scum in a bid to tarnish the image of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) in information bulletin No. 1046 Thursday said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is aimed to highlight the IS's existence as an anti-DPRK plot-breeding organization, put down increasing public demand of the disbandment of the IS, tide over the puppet ruling crisis, escalate north-south confrontation and push the situation on the Korean Peninsula to the extremes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea has now gone back to the days of the \"yusin\" regime when the \"Central Intelligence Agency\" was active.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The IS openly interferes in the puppet presidential elections, fakes up election results and commits such a bullying act as opening to the public the minutes of the north-south summit while getting hell-bent on clamping down on south Koreans including those calling for achieving reunification through alliance with the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nam has taken the lead in these smear campaigns.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was an ill-famed confrontation maniac who served Park Chung Hee's \"yusin regime\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He is partly to blame for turning south Korea into the theatre of shambles and making the mess of the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Hye is now having a hard time due to the last-ditch efforts of the IS coteries to maintain their existence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The IS, which was fabricated to keep the dictatorial regime, has become a root cause of bringing misfortune to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The most typical example of this is the miserable end of the former \"yusin regime\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is a saying \"Better to be alone than to have bad company.\" Park should fire Nam and disband the IS that has lived out its days, as demanded by the south Koreans before they bring bigger misfortune if she is really set to tide over the worsening political crisis and evade criticism at home and abroad  for deteriorating north-south ties. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The unbiased public at home and abroad should look through the nature of the anti-DPRK racket kicked up by the present puppet regime and should not damage their own face by thoughtlessly echoing the anti-DPRK stories spread by the IS but lend an ear to the south Koreans calling for the disorganization of the IS and render active support to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The IS is bound to meet the most shameful end in the face of unanimous censure and denunciation by the south Korean people and the public at home and abroad."

            "content": "KCNA Commentary Slams Park Geun Hye Group's Red Herring\r\n Pyongyang, October 17 (KCNA) -- The Park Geun Hye group of south Korea is running the whole gamut of red herrings, feeling guilty conscience after the publication of the statement of the spokesman for the Policy Department of the National Defence Commission (NDC) of the DPRK in denunciation of its acts of treachery. \n\t\t\t\t\t The spokesman for the puppet Ministry of Unification of south Korea, conservative politicians and reptile papers vied with each other to claim that their \"sincere efforts\" for confidence-building between the south and north were seriously hamstrung and they did nothing wrong. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is nothing but a poor excuse of those traitors who have nothing to complain about the north's just position and warnings as the statement hit the nail on their heads. But we cannot but question them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Does the Park group have the face to talk about \"confidence?\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than the Park's group which has gone mad with the moves to stifle fellow countrymen in collusion with outside forces in violation of the basic principle and idea of reconciliation and peaceful reunification which were agreed upon by the north and the south and fully supported and approved by all Koreans. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was Park Geun Hye who was more vocal about \"confidence\" and \"principle\" than anybody else. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During the \"election campaign\" late in December last year she let loose a whole string of rhetoric that the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration should be respected and confidence could not be built without it, claiming that she was \"different\" from the preceding regime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As soon as she came to power, however, she fostered distrust, confrontation and extreme danger of war on the basis of self-righteousness and hypocrisy, far from adhering to the principle of confidence and respect. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through the \"principal plan for the development of south-north relations\" she declared the abrogation of the joint declarations of the nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She launched large-scale war exercises in the wake of the formal confirmation of the \"tailored deterrence strategy\" aiming at a preemptive nuclear attack on fellow countrymen in collusion with outside forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Her group's mud-slinging at the dignity of the supreme leadership as dear as the life and soul of the Korean people and the social system in the DPRK is something unprecedented. Accordingly, the world people are stunned by this backbiting. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This amounts to the self-admission of the fact that Park's oft-repeated \"confidence\" and \"principle\" are nothing but hypocrisy and an empty talk and they are aimed at \"the change of the social system\" in the DPRK and \"its collapse.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A politician should be trustworthy and consistent in behavior among other things. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Who will believe the \"head of state\" whose demeanor changes just a few months later? \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a matter of fact, Park has around her only despicable politicians who are little short of migratory birds and parasites who behave depending on the situation so as to serve those in power. She has neither force nor people whom she can truly trust and count on. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is long since the people of south Korea turned their backs on the Park group which has met its own interests through such illegal actions as the \"Intelligence Service's interference in the presidential election\" and hypocritical commitments. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even her confidants are breaking with her one after another in protest against her unpredictable caprice and perfidy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As people of various circles in south Korea comment, the present regime finds itself in the worst political crisis. An opposition party said that it is an \"extreme political chaos\" produced by Chongwadae's inability, self-righteousness and acts of reneging on commitments, adding Park Geun Hye is to blame for it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Gloomy is the future of the turkey-like politician. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park would be well advised to properly know that she will be disqualified to remain as a member of the nation, far from being a politician, if she persistently fools public and mocks at the nation."
