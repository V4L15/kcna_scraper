He persistently asked his American master to extend OPCON under the pretext of the warship case, finally getting it postponed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The criminal nexus between the U.S. and the puppet group of south Korea fully discloses the true colors of the puppet group as sycophants and traitors serving the U.S. as it prolongs its remaining days at the sacrifice of the dignity and interests of the nation, kowtowing to Washington.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The true nature of the warship sinking case cooked up by traitor Lee together with the U.S. was also brought to daylight.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The stark facts irrefutably prove that the warship case was a hideous charade orchestrated by the U.S. to shun Japan's demand for the transfer of the Futenma U.S. military base and meet the south Korean puppet group's request for the extension of OPCON.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The extension of OPCON put south Korea in such a miserable position that it is left with no option but to comply with the U.S. demands for the opening of south Korean markets, increasing of the share of upkeep for the U.S. forces, dispatch of more troops overseas, involvement in the building of a missile shield, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group is deprived of even military sovereignty, totally dependent on the U.S. politically and economically. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a political caricature provoking world people's laughter for the group to go busy with diplomacy, talking about \"an advanced state\" and \"national status.\""
