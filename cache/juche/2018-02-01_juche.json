La sociedad internacional lo aplaude mucho deseando que continue esta corriente hacia el alivio de la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, las autoridades estadounidenses inducen en error la opinion publica como si el dialogo Norte-Sur fuera el fruto de su inaudita sancion y presion anti-RPDC y agravan intencionalmente la situacion trasladando las flotillas de portaaviones nucleares y otras propiedades estrategicas a las zonas perifericas de la Peninsula Coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY anuncian en publico que libraran los ejercicios militares conjuntos anti-RPDC de gran envergadura despues de los Juegos Olimpicos Invernales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el futuro tambien, la RPDC realizara esfuerzos por la mejora de las relaciones Norte-Sur, pero no observara nunca con brazos cruzados los actos en contra de ello. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi se rompe el ambiente de la mejora de las relaciones intercoreanas y del alivio de la tension, preparado a duras penas, debido a EE.UU. que agrava la situacion introduciendo los pertrechos de guerra nuclear en la Peninsula Coreana y su contorno, este pais no puede eludir nunca la responsabilidad del respecto. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa ONU no debe guardar silencio ante los peligrosos movimientos de EE.UU. que pueden agravar la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana y su contorno e imponer a todo el mundo los desastres de guerra nuclear. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEspero que de acuerdo con su mision indicada en la Carta de la ONU, Vd. preste seria atencion al emplazamiento de armamentos nucleares y las maniobras de provocacion de guerra nuclear de EE.UU., que perjudican la mejora de relaciones intercoreanas y el alivio de tension, y haga esfuerzos por impedirlos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor inmediato, quisiera pedirle que aplauda el proceso de mejora de las relaciones entre ambas partes coreanas, ateniendose al articulo 6 del Capitulo II del Reglamento del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU, y someta a la consideracion del Consejo de Seguridad el tema de exigir a los paises vecinos que no cometan acciones obstaculizadoras."
