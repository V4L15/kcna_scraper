Its player No. 15 made a smart kick from the area 17 meters from the goalposts at around the 30th minute of the second half, scoring another goal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The April 25 Team, however, was not disappointed but countered its rival's attacks through nimble and fast passes and two and three men combination, equalizing the score in the referee's time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The two teams played an extra time game as they drew 2:2. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There were many chances of scoring goals but no team succeeded in doing so. So there were eleven meter penalty kicks. Five players from each team participated in the penalty kick but none of them proved to be winner. The continued penalty kick ended in 8:7 in favor of the Sonbong Team.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The spectators sent warm applause to the players who fully showcased high technique, mental power and staunch will. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the match was over, Kim Jong Un acknowledged the enthusiastic cheers of the players and spectators.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He invited the players and coaches of the Sonbong Team to come up to the tribune, congratulated them on their success and had a photo taken with them."
