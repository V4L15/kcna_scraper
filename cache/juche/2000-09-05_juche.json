He extended warm gratitude to all the people in the fatherland for the warm welcome accorded to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Left alone in my early years after losing my parents and two younger sisters in the south, I decided to come to the north as I found my mainstay in Kim Jong Il, the father of the nation, he said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The one year I spent with brothers in the north after joining the people's army as a volunteer during the war was the period in which I felt the greatest worth of living as I came to know about true love and the genuine cradle of life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nI could not forget even a moment the great care of the fatherly leader Kim Il Sung, who taught what is a true human life and provided it to me, nor could I betray it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    He said that representing the gratitude of all the unconverted long-term prisoners, he would like to make a deep bow to Kim Jong Il who bestowed upon them all love and trust he could,  concerned about them day and night. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Unconverted long-term prisoner U Yong Gak in his speech said that they could survive more than 40 years of hell-like prison life without vacillation, not yielding to persistent \"ideological conversion,\" because they had a mainstay of faith. It was none other than the great Generalissimo Kim Il Sung and the respected marshal Kim Jong Il, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There still remain a number of unconverted long-term prisoners in South Korea including Jong Sun Dok and Jong Sun Thaek who are eagerly looking forward to their return to the care of Kim Jong Il, he said adding that all the unconverted long-term prisoners desirous of coming to the north and their families should come under his loving care. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He evinced the firm determination of the unconverted long-term prisoners to firmly trust and follow Kim Jong Il only in the future, too and devote the rest of their lives to the victory of the cause of national reunification true to his intention. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Hong Son, daughter of unconverted long-term prisoner Hong Mun Go, speaking on behalf of the families of unconverted long-term prisoners said her father whom she thought would not be able to come back returned aboard a flower-decorated car after the lapse of scores of years. She thanked Kim Jong Il for enabling her to reunite with her father. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The families of the unconverted long-term prisoners will hold Kim Jong Il in high esteem with loyalty and stand in the van of the single-heartedly united ranks devotedly defending him, she declared. \r\n\r\n"
