And it is running at a canter on the steed to become an economically powerful state, performing great achievements in production and construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This reality shows the greatness and invincibility of the WPK with you as its General Secretary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The WPK's victory and achievements give great courage and unbreakable faith to the vanguard fighters and popular masses in the south and consistently invigorate the movement for independence, democracy and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We will accelerate the modeling of our ranks on the great Juche idea, holding its banner higher, and further enhance the organizational ability and militancy and leadership ability of the NDFSK so that it can fully discharge its mission as the patriotic vanguard in the national democratic movement for independence, democracy and reunification. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "DCRK founding proposal, platform of Korea's reunification\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 10 (KCNA) -- World opinion is growing that the Korean peninsula should be reunified according to the proposal of founding a confederal state, that is the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo (DCRK). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DCRK founding proposal was initiated by the President Kim Il Sung at the sixth congress of the Worker's Party of Korea in October Juche 69 (1980). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This proposal, together with the three principles of reunification and the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation, constitutes three pillars and charters of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Its basic idea is that the country should be reunified by founding a confederal republic through the establishment of a unified national government on the condition that the north and the south recognize and tolerate each other's ideas and social systems, a government in which the two sides are represented on an equal footing and under which they exercise regional autonomy with equal rights and duties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the most aboveboard, reasonable and realistic reunification proposal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   For over half a century different social systems have existed and different ideas have prevailed in the north and the south of Korea. Neither side gives in its own ideology and system. In these circumstances the best way of national reunification is to found a unified state of confederal formula based on one nation, one state, two systems and two governments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Taking the interests of the two sides into consideration on the most fair basis, the DCRK founding proposal comprehensively elucidates all problems arising in the establishment of the unified state and its operation -- the principle and way of forming a confederal state, mission of the confederal government and regional governments and their co-relations, and function, character and name of the confederal state. It defined the confederal state as an independent, neutral, peaceful and non-aligned state and its name as Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This proposal, based on the unique idea that different ideas and systems are allowed to exist in one country and the realistic possibility, is the great platform of reunification which makes it possible to solve the issue of Korea's reunification at the earliest possible date and in the  easiest and fairest way. That is why it has been warmly welcomed by all Koreans in the north and the south and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is also enjoying worldwide support. Functions for supporting the proposal take place in many countries every October. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This year, too, vigorous activities of solidarity have been launched on a worldwide scale. Party and state leaders of different countries sent solidarity messages to the great leader Kim Jong Il while political parties, public organizations and personages of different circles published statements supporting the proposal. \r\n\r\n"

Korean people's struggle supported\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 10 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today carries a commentary on the vigorous struggle of South Korean people for abolition of the \"security law\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Over 5,000 South Korean students on October 8 struggled for immediate abolition of the law  in different parts of Seoul and 120 civic and public organizations including the South Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and the \"National Alliance for Democracy and Reunification\" formed the \"National Council for Solidarity for the Abolition of the Security Law,\" and waged a struggle for the abolition of the evil law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Figures of over 40 religious  organisations held a religious meeting for the abolition of the \"security law.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is very just for the South Korean students and people to vigorously struggle for the immediate abolition of the \"security law,\" the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The \"security law\" is a fascist law  without an equal in the world which ignores  the nation, opposes reunification and  wantonly tramples down the political freedom and democratic rights of the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Under the law the Korean nation can not achieve reconciliation, unity and reunification forever and the South Korean society will remain a place of mediaeval human rights  abuses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities are now talking about the \"revision\" of some articles of the law. It is no more than a trick to deceive the people and keep the law as it is. \r\n\r\n"
