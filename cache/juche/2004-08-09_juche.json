It seeks to \"demonstrate\" the international cooperation targeted against the DPRK by staging this exercise in the waters close to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through the projected maneuver it also seeks to push forward the PSI system in real earnest and increase its maneuverability in a bid to focus it on the DPRK and escalate the policy to isolate and blockade it by drawing its neighboring countries into the exercise. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But it is a gross miscalculation for the U.S. to think that it can frighten the DPRK with such threat and blackmail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has already solemnly declared that it would regard any sanctions and blockade against the DPRK as a proclamation of a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present situation where the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK has reached a dangerous phase proves the justice of the measures taken by it to steadily bolster all the means for self-defence including the nuclear deterrent force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has now become clear that the U.S. seeks to solve the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. by force, not through dialogue and negotiations. This compels the DPRK to take corresponding counter-measures. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It cannot but take a serious view of the \"joint naval exercise\" the Japanese authorities plan to sponsor at the instigation of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's behavior diametrically runs counter to the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration in which both sides committed themselves not to take any action against each other's security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There can be no state relations without mutual confidence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Double-faced attitude of the Japanese authorities resorting to the anti-DPRK racket, toeing the U.S. line, while talking about the implementation of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration and the normalization of the relations between them only heighten the vigilance among servicepersons and the people of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An attitude towards the exercise will precisely mean an attitude towards the DPRK as this provocative maneuver is targeted against the DPRK.  The DPRK will closely watch the development of a situation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

If the U.S. imperialists unleash a war on this land, misjudging the DPRK, its army and people will not miss the opportunity but wipe out all the aggressors and provokers and eliminate the root cause of war in the world with the deterrent force of justice they have built up for scores of years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists and the south Korean warlike forces should stop running wild, properly understanding who their rival is, he warned.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
