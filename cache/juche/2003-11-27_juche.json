Paektu.\r\n Academician, Prof. and Dr. G. I. Korotkov, secretary general for academic studies of the Military History Institute, wrote the book \"Victors\" on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Korean people's victory in the Korean war, deeply moved by the outstanding military idea and tactics of President Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Sergei Lisitski, writer of the Russian Union of Writers, visited the DPRK and wrote the book \"Story of DPRK\", after avidly reading Kim Il Sung's Reminiscences \"With the Century\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Alexander Viktorvich Brezhnev, journalist of the Russian newspaper Zavtra, authored the book \"Red Korea\" in which he gave his impressions of the DPRK he visited in comparison with the realities of those countries where socialism collapsed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Javed Ansari, secretary general of the Society for the Study of Self-Reliance of Pakistan, wrote the book \"Country of Eternal Sun\". Printed in the book are a globe surrounded by 21 five-pointed stars and a photograph of leader Kim Jong Il in the centre of a star on top of the globe. By this he meant that Kim Jong Il is the sun of the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Among the books recently sent to the DPRK are the book \"Army of Korea\" written by Marwan Sudah, chairman of the Arab Committee for Solidarity with the Korean People and Support to Korea's Reunification in Jordan, and the book \"Korea, Beacon of the Times\" written by Yehia Zakaria Khairallah, secretary general of the Arab Association for Arts, Culture and Information of Egypt. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Takashi Nada, representative of the Japan, Ehime, Institute for Modern Korean Studies, wrote epic \"Land of Victory\" and Dipak Sharma, chairman of the Nepalese Young Poets' Forum, 5 poems including \"Defender of Nation, Father of People\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBangladeshi Journalist Shiraz Chowdry wrote the poem \"In Memory of Mother Kim Jong Suk\" praising the woman general of Mt.

Korea Denounced \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 26 (KCNA) -- Hubbard, U.S. ambassador in south Korea, a few days ago, stringed out the jargon that south Korea would set \"an example\", if it continued economic cooperation with north Korea while leaving the latter without restraining itself in the acts unacceptable to the U.S., and that \"economic cooperation\" should be done in a cautious manner to be \"bilateral cooperation beneficial to both.\"\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hubbard meddled in inter-Korean cooperation and talked this or that as if he were an \"inspector.\" This was an impudent behavior without discretion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His outbursts cannot be construed otherwise than an aggressive one interfering in other's internal affairs in pursuit of a very sinister purpose to throw a wet blanket over and totally spoil inter-Korean economic cooperation now running a smooth course, the commentary says, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His outcries for \"cautious\" economic cooperation with the north were, in fact, a certain pressure upon south Korea to stop it and go back to confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Inter-Korean economic cooperation is a patriotic undertaking for the north and the south to promote common interests of the Korean nation in the spirit of the June 15 joint declaration. But Hubbard put his nose into inter-Korean economic cooperation in an attempt to bar it, behaving himself as the \"governor general\" of a U.S. colony. This has touched off the towering rage of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to give up its unreasonable interference in the inter-Korean economic cooperation, well aware of the will and aspiration of the Korean nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan Urged to Compensate for Its Human Rights Abuses \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 26 (KCNA) -- Recently the list of 427,129 Korean victims who were forcibly drafted during the Japanese imperialists' military occupation of Korea was made public. In this regard, voices strongly demanding the Japanese authorities make apology and compensation to the victims and their bereaved families are growing louder day by day.\r\n \"We can never die before the punishment of the crimes of the Japanese imperialists before the world's conscience and thorough compensation from them and we will get the price of blood paid by Japan at any cost.\" This is the unshakable will of the victims and their kinsmen and friends. Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The forcible drafting and massacres committed by the Japanese imperialists were grave human rights abuses they openly committed as a state policy, disregarding international justice and morality and violating international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, the recently published list of the victims to forcible drafting is only the tip of the iceberg in light of the hideous crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists. The claim of the victims to human rights abuses and their bereaved families to compensation fully conforms with the universal definition of human rights and the principle of international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is too natural that the DPRK proposed to Japan to hold inter-governmental talks between the two countries at an early date to discuss the issue of compensation to the victims to human rights abuses who have been surveyed and confirmed so far as this reflects the trend of the times. \r\n The Japanese authorities should look straight into the trend of the times and, in consonance with it, respond as soon as possible to the inter-governmental talks for discussing the issue of compensation for the human rights abuses committed by the Japanese imperialists against the Korean people in the past.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
