He expressed the belief that the current international seminar on the Juche idea will actively contribute to proving the truth and validity of the Juche idea and to the struggle for global peace and independence.\r\n   Chief Vice-Chairman of Chongryon Central Standing Committee Ho Jong Man said that with his brilliant intelligence and energetic ideological and theoretical activities the great leader Marshal Kim Jong Il has further developed the Juche idea as a revolutionary philosophy, a political philosophy which illumines the way of shaping the destiny of man and building a new independent world.\r\n   The Juche idea is indeed a great doctrine guaranteeing a new independent world and a true man-centred, celebrated idea agreeable to the independent nature of man, he stated.\r\n   A joint congratulatory message the Workers' Party of Korea Central Committee and the Central People's Committee of the DPRK sent to the seminar  was conveyed by Secretary of the WPK Central Committee Hwang Jang Yop, who is leading a delegation of Korean social scientists.\r\n   And congratulatory messages from Juche idea study organisations and public organisations in different countries, the Tokyo and  Okinawa governors and other public and political activists of Japan were also introduced at the seminar.\r\n   Jose Francisco Aguilar Bulgarelli, General Secretary of the popular force organized in Costa Rica and Vice-Director General of the IIJI, made a report \"trend of historical development and development of outlook on value\".\r\n   The law governing the social and historical development has been comprehensively and profoundly expounded, with the popular masses, the driving force, put into main consideration, by the original principle indicated by the respected General Kim Jong Il, and thereby, a fundamental change has taken place in the outlook on social history, he said, stressing that his great feat in bringing about a radical turn in thinking and practice of humankind will be everlasting. He continued:\r\n   It is an urgent task for humankind to remould the old world of domination and subjugation into a new world in which independence, peace and friendship are prevalent, and it is the trend of the historical development at the present era that humankind is vigorously advancing for the building of an independent, peaceful and friendly new world, conscious of their being the master of the world, the master of their destiny.\r\n   The present era at a turning point needs a change also in the view on value.\r\n   This urgent need of the era has been met by the Juche idea. based on the philosophical principle that man is the master of everything and decides everything, the idea regards man as the most precious and valuable being in the world.\r\n   The value of man should not be estimated by power, money and economic privilege but by his ideological and cultural level, contributions to society and by love and trust he enjoys in society, and the value of material and cultural wealth, too, should be estimated by how one satisfies man's demand out of his social nature and how one contributes to social development.\r\n   The Juche idea also gives a comprehensive exposition of the value of life. If man, a social being, seeks only the demand for physical life, apart from the demand for socio-political integrity, such a life can be by no means a worthy life peculiar to the social being, even though he enjoys a rich material life.\r\n   His excellency Kim Jong Il has developed and enriched the Juche idea, provided humankind greeting the 21st century with a textbook of true life, the guidelines of struggle  and brightly indicated the road of the era of independence. \r\n   This is the most distinguished feat performed by him for history and the era and this great exploit will be immortal with human history.\r\n   Referring to questions in studying and disseminating the Juche idea, he continued:\r\n   We should first of all deeply study the works of President Kim Il Sung and his excellency Kim Jong Il, comprehensively grasp the Juche idea and explain it among the broad masses in various forms and ways.\r\n   It is also important to direct deep attention to making the people aspiring after independence  respect, love and cooperate with each other, as demanded by the Juche idea.\r\n   History will vigorously advance towards independence, peace and friendship under the banner of the Juche idea and the people's cause of independence will win victory without fail.\r\n    Kaoru Nakamaru, Director of the Institute for International Affairs, called for the building of a new world where humankind promote bonds as man and all develop and prosper, irrespective of religious belief, ideas, border and race. The seminar continues. \r\n\r\n"
