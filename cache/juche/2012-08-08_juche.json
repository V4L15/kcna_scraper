            "content": "Truth about US, S. Korean Abduction and Terrorism Disclosed\r\n Pyongyang, August 8 (KCNA) -- The National Reunification Institute Tuesday released a statement telling before the world the whole story about the allurement, abduction, plots, attempted terrorism, subversive and sabotage activities of the U.S. and the south Korean puppet regime.\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement said: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Finding it hard to stifle the DPRK through blockade, sanctions and military pressure for decades, the U.S. has conspired with the south Korean puppet regime in its desperate moves to destabilize and bring down the social system in the DPRK in recent years. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In April this year the south Korean diplomatic chief at a meet-the press openly admitted that the basic orientation of the \"policy towards the north\" followed by the U.S. and the south Korean authorities so far was to force it to dismantle its nukes and missiles but they decided to pursue \"a new method of access to the north\" focusing on \"bringing down the social system in the north in the days ahead.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They worked out a four-phase \"scenario for bringing down the social system.\" Its first phase is to lure and abduct its citizens and let them undergo training for terrorism and destructive activities as there are no organized dissident forces in the DPRK. Its second phase is to infiltrate them into the DPRK again to form dissident forces. Its third phase is to provide them with weapons so that they can carry out various forms of terrorism, destruction, sabotage and armed revolt. Its fourth phase calls on the U.S. to start military intervention under the pretext of \"contingency\" and \"protection of human rights\" in a bid to bring down the social system in the north. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has long prodded the \"National Foundation for Democracy\" under the veil of NGO into conducting luring and abducting operations against citizens of the DPRK in areas close to its northern border.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The foundation has carried on these operations, financing \"The Citizens Alliance for Human Rights in the North\", \"Network for Democracy in the North\", \"Turi Hana\" and other anti-DPRK conspiratorial organizations in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. provides at least 20 million U.S. dollars to those organizations every year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet regime does not conceal its premeditated and organized allurement and abduction operations, terming the acts of luring residents in areas near the northern border of the DPRK and taking them away to south Korea as \"planned operations for making them defect to south Korea.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak regime has spent so far 309.7 million U.S. dollars for the above-said operations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMore than 3,000 south Korean agents are going under the mask of missionaries in the Northeast area of China to lure and abduct residents of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Chon Ki Won disguised as a clergyman of the Missionary Society of \"Turi Hana\", confessed that he lured and abducted more than 900 citizens of the DPRK and took them away to south Korea from 1990 to 2009.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Wicked renegade Kim Yong Hwan, boss of an anti-DPRK conspiratorial organization, and other guys were arrested by the Chinese security authorities in March this year while conducting those operations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When they find it hard to take DPRK citizens to south Korea, they bring them to a third country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When agents of the U.S. and south Korea lure and abduct them, they employ such method as pressurizing all their families and relatives into \"defecting to south Korea\" in groups by holding them hostage. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Allurement and abduction operations are also conducted under the signboard of \"exchange of separated families through a third country.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the puppet regime are abducting even people of the DPRK aboard wrecked ships and taking them away to south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those who find no means of living in south Korea after being taken there get degenerated. They either choose to commit crimes or suicides or flee to a third country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean regime is conspiring with the U.S. in driving the defectors to south Korea and wicked renegades into hatching plots against the DPRK and subversive and sabotage activities against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There are at least 300 organizations engaged in such activities organized with those defectors to south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe puppet regime selects wicked renegades and take them to the U.S. so that they may get special education and training. They gather confidential information about the DPRK through the above-said organizations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are instigating the \"Federation of the Movement for Freedom in the North\" and other organizations of defectors to south Korea to hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and scatter leaflets and broadcast programs distorting and slandering the socialist system in the DPRK and its policies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tens of millions of leaflets have been scattered hundreds of times through those defectors and renegades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The then U.S. President Bush in September 2008 invited Pak Sang Hak, representative of the \"Federation of the Movement for Freedom in the North\" who took the lead in the leaflet scattering operations, to the White House. Bush told him not to lose courage, praising him for doing a tough job for the freedom of the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. let those wicked renegades appear at the White House, U.S. Congress and the UN to make what it called \"testimonies.\" It stages such charade as awarding \"human rights prize\" to those who succeeded in reading its scripts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet regime provides more than ten million U.S. dollars to the anti-DPRK human rights organizations every year in an attempt to release \"white paper on human rights record in the north\" and \"survey of human rights record in the north.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is distributing documents on \"human rights performance in the north\" based on \"false testimonies\" made by renegades. It is also busy trumpeting about \"human rights issue in the north\" every day, holding photo exhibitions and seminars.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Movies have been produced to make a wrong picture of the \"human rights record in the north\" under the patronage of the south Korean regime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the puppet regime are staging psychological warfare through \"Voice of Free North\", \"Broadcasting Service for Reforms in the North\", \"Voice of Free Korea\", \"Voice of Vast Plain\" and other anti-DPRK broadcasting services operated by defectors to south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. invited Kim Song Min, representative of \"Voice of Free North\" who has played the worst role in the anti-DPRK broadcasting programs, to the White House several times, encouraging him to \"implant liberalism into the minds of north Koreans.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the puppet regime formed a \"death-defying action corps\" with wicked defectors to south Korea and are hurling them into all forms of terrorism and subversive and sabotage activities against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Typical of them is the \"Front for the Liberation of North Koreans\" organized in September 2010. It specializes in gathering information about the north and destructive, sabotage and terrorist actions against major facilities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This organization is directly involved in the recently disclosed attempted hideous terrorism to blow up statues symbolic of the dignity of the supreme leadership and monuments in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Beside this front there are cruel terrorist groups in south Korea such as the \"Federation of Free Soldiers in the North\" and the \"Society for Demolition of Statues.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A defector to south Korea who is a member of the \"society\" confessed that he planned to destroy leader Kim Jong Il's birthplace in the Paektusan secret camp but gave up the plan because of strengthened guard and difficulty in smuggling explosives in the area of the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts go to prove that the U.S. and the Lee regime's operations to lure and abduct DPRK citizens and their conspiratorial and terrorist acts against it have reached a dangerous phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement warned: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They would be well advised to behave themselves, paying heed to the DPRK's warnings.  They should stop reckless crimes including hideous state-sponsored, politically-motivated terrorism."

It committed before the international community not to have the army as armed forces for aggression but abandon the right to war and confine military activities entirely to defense of the country. But the Japanese reactionaries are taking the road for overseas expansion in an undisguised way, throwing away the commitment like an old pair of shoes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Any \"international contribution\" touted by Japan is, in essence, a grave threat and provocation against world peace and security.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should stop at once the criminal act of seeking overseas expansion under the deceptive slogans of \"peace\" and \"security\"."

(Segun despachos del 2 de mayo de 2008 de Yonhap News)\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. y los titeres surcoreanos organizaron el \"cuerpo suicida\" incorporando a los peores fugitivos norcoreanos y lo empuja a diversos atentados terroristas y acciones de sabotaje y subversion anti-RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor ejemplo, el \"Frente por la Liberacion del Pueblo Norcoreano\", fundado en septiembre de 2010, toma por su mision la recogida de informaciones sobre el Norte, la destruccion de importantes instalaciones de ella, el terrorismo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEse frente esta involucrado directamente en el recien descubierto atentado terrorista para destruir las estatuas de bronce y los monumentos erigidos en la RPDC como simbolo de maxima dignidad de esta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, operan actualmente en el Sur de Corea otras bandas terroristas como la \"Alianza de militares para el Norte libre\" y la recien descubierta \"Sociedad para destruir las estatuas de bronce\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUn desertor norcoreano, que se habia incorporado a esa ultima entidad, confeso que habia trazado el plan de destruir la casa natal (del Dirigente        Kim Jong Il) en el campamento secreto del monte Paektu, pero lo desistio por el reforzamiento de vigilancia y la dificultad de introducir en la region del Norte los materiales explosivos. (Segun Dong-A Ilbo - el 21 de julio de 2012).\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos hechos comprueban que llegan a la etapa alarmante el secuestro de los norcoreanos por parte de EE.UU. y la banda del traidor Lee y su conspiracion y atentados terroristas anti-RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEllos deben actuar con prudencia teniendo presente la advertencia de la RPDC y suspender todos sus imprudentes actos criminales, inclusive el terrorismo politico de Estado de mayor magnitud."
