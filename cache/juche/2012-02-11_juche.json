Korean Paper\r\nPyongyang, February 11 (KCNA) -- The south Korean reptile paper Chosun Ilbo recently let loose a spate of invectives about the local performance tour made by the Unhasu Orchestra, the DPRK's renowned art troupe.\n\t\t\t\t\tHaving no elementary understanding of the mass-based art, this paper echoed what was aired by Radio Free Asia engaged in the anti-DPRK smear propaganda. It claimed that \"the performance was not received well by audience\" and \"it brought them burden rather than pleasure\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis was wicked elements' trumpeting aimed at doing harm to the single-minded unity of the party and people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHow can such human scum understand the people of the DPRK and its arts?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInspired by songs, the Korean people's 80 odd year-long just revolutionary struggle started, advanced and won victories. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Korean revolution and people held aloft the banner of \"Let's always be cheerful although our path is thorny!\", the banner of confidence and optimism, during the Arduous March, the forced march.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn this glorious course, songs and arts in the DPRK have served as valuable ideological and moral pabulum for the people making revolution that a large quantity of food can hardly substitute.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEven after the loss of the father whom the Korean people deeply trusted and followed, they drew a thousand-fold strength and courage from the songs presented by the orchestra after the start of the advance in the new year. It is setting the hearts of people afire with reverence for the leader in various parts of the country. Its performances evoked a lively response among audience as they helped consolidate the unity between the leader and the people and aroused among them ardent longing for him. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe service personnel and people of the DPRK joined the orchestra in singing songs in tears and rose up, inspired by them. What the above-said media asserted is nothing but a shriek of despair made by those taken aback by the might of the arts, the hot wind raised by the orchestra more powerful than a nuclear bomb. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe reptile paper, a mixture of the American style and Japanese way of life, can never understand the true character and value of the DPRK's arts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey were so displeased with its local performance tour that they claimed it was unprofitable, the absurd assertion of a merchant. This suffices to guess their level of knowledge about arts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe smear campaign made by Chosun Ilbo and Radio Free Asia was manipulated by the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors and the Intelligence Service.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo matter how desperately the Lee's group work to hurt the single-minded unity of the DPRK, it is as foolish an act as running its head against a wall.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMiserable, indeed, is the position of the Lee's group keen to prolong its remaining days as politicians through escalated confrontation with compatriots."

Paektu, not a cradle. From that day he suffered from cold and hunger, nostalgic of his homeland. He spent his childhood when the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle was at its height. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThen he underwent difficulties during the period of building a new country, the three year-war and the postwar rehabilitation and construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThen followed the 1970s and 1980s when he had to carry out the work to succeed to the revolutionary cause with his ability and will and which witnessed an era of prosperity thanks to the dramatic changes that took place as a result of the speed campaign. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThen came periods when he was compelled to battle to defend socialism and the whole nation mourned the passing of President Kim Il Sung in profound grief and had to make the Arduous March.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the subsequent period Kim Jong Il set about on long journeys of Songun and steered the country's stand-off with the U.S. over the nuclear issue and a war minus gunfire. Then he led the country to make a leap forward towards the world level and a drive to push back the frontiers of latest science and technology and so on.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFor the Korean people Kim Jong Il was a great man all his life, not merely a great leader or the supreme commander. He served them with pure conscience before considering it as his mission or ideal or obligation to do. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere was little that he received from the people and there was nothing that was left for himself. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe always thought of people. Day and night, rainy or snowy day, happy or unpleasant day, people were the uppermost in his mind. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe bestowed unbounded benevolence upon the people, but he was never content with it. He always took pain to do anything good for them and worked heart and soul for it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was the last day of his life that he was advised by doctors to take a rest for healthcare. But he set about a journey for field guidance early in the morning when people were in a deep sleep. He passed away of an unimaginable heart attack. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe smile of the strong man shines as a banner of victory and will be cherished in the hearts of people as an immortal soul.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHis life is not over but just a beginning as his desire is yet to come true and his running train that had stopped has to sound a louder whistle and all the service personnel and people should emerge more powerful and win greater victory as befitting his soldiers and disciples.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe the sons and daughters of Kim Jong Il can not merely weep over the father's boundless love shown for us.    \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe life of Kim Jong Il is enshrined in our hearts as a mirror of mind that makes us look back on what we did everyday and every hour and encourages us to go ahead and as blood and soul. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe are obliged to turn the snowstorm which Kim Jong Il weathered all his life into confetti and build a thriving nation, his life-long desire, so that he may rest in peace at the Kumsusan Memorial Palace. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThanks to the march of Juche made by all service personnel and people hand in hand and shoulder to shoulder, Korea of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, a powerful, highly civilized and prosperous country to be envied by the world, will make its appearance."
