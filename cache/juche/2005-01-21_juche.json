            "content": "KCNA Refutes U.S. Accusations against DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 20 (KCNA) -- The Human Rights Watch, which claims to be a U.S. non-governmental human rights organization,  in an \"annual report on human rights\" released on Jan. 13 dealing with human rights performances in\r\nat least 60 countries once again pulled up the DPRK over \"the issues of political offenders\" and \"defectors from the north\".\r\n This is nothing surprising to us as it used to let loose a string of trite vituperations against the DPRK as a tool serving the successive U.S. administrations in the implementation of their \"human rights policies.\" \r\n We term the Human Rights Watch's malignant mud-slinging at the DPRK over its human rights performance as sheer sophism fully representing the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is beyond doubt that it cannot act otherwise away from the U.S. stand as it came into being in America. But it would be well advised to take issue with human rights abuses in its own country before saying this or that about other countries as it put up the signboard of \"defense of human rights\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., styling itself a \"human rights judge\", has no right to talk about human rights as it is the graveyard of human rights and the worst human rights abuser in the world.\r\n The political freedom, democracy and vital rights of the popular masses are abridged in the U.S. legally and institutionally. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. election law restricts as strictly as possible the people's right to elect and bars the popular masses from freely taking part in the political life by putting up various preconditions such as sex, occupation, level of education, length of residence, property status, age, political view and religious belief. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n More than 10 intelligence institutions covering the whole area of the U.S. with a dense intelligence network are gathering specific information about the inhabitants who account for 90 percent of the population. On this basis they are encroaching upon the political activities and freedom of speech of the popular masses while gathering and analyzing the data about their political life and ideological trend by Internet and precision monitoring and wiretapping means. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The total number of the poor is more than 34.6 million, that of the jobless goes beyond 8.6 million and industrial barons earn 400 times as much as ordinary workers in the U.S. where people are denied vital rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The poor mental and cultural life is being institutionally encouraged there, driving many people into degeneration, despair and crimes. Ethnic and gender discrimination is growing more intolerable day by day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A total of 235 million weapons of various types are in use in the U.S., a cesspool of crimes. In consequence tens of thousands of people fall victim to gun-related crimes every year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is a wrecker of democracy as it ruthlessly infringes upon the sovereignty of other countries and human rights of their peoples for the mere reason that they are different from it in ideology, system and religious belief. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. invasion of Iraq in disregard of the United Nations and international law, its massacre of at least 100,000 civilians and use of depleted uranium bombs and abuses of prisoners go to clearly prove that it is the typical human rights abuser at present. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is preposterous, indeed, for the U.S. to take issue with other's human rights performance though it is censured for its poor human rights situation at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and the people in the DPRK regard their socialist system as their life and soul and boundlessly value and absolutely support it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter how desperately the U.S. may work to vilify the DPRK's system, man-centered socialism of Korean style remains stable.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is aimed to paint the assailant as a victim in a bid to evade at any cost its responsibility to redeem the crimes committed by it against humanity in the past and create an atmosphere favorable for the realization of the militarization, he stressed, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for Abe and Nakagawa, they are known to be standard-bearers of the right-wing forces. Acting as director general and representative of \"the society of young lawmakers contemplating the future and education in the history of Japan\", they devoted themselves to justifying and beautifying Japan's past crimes. They are still spearheading the anti-DPRK smear campaign over the issue of abduction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japanese media institutions, which claim to stand for neutrality and impartiality of the press, are taking the lead in tampering with the history and slandering the DPRK  as faithful mouthpieces of the right-wing forces, blinded by money-making. But Japanese right-wing forces and media are grossly miscalculating. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's desperate efforts to deny and embellish its past crimes would only prompt the international community to dig up more deeply its crime-woven past and redouble their international solidarity and pressure campaign demanding its settlement.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This was a sure guarantee for the steadfast defense of the socialist rural economic system of Korean style. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In recent years the U.S. imperialists have got more malicious in their schemes to isolate and stifle the DPRK. This has caused temporary difficulties in socialist economic construction, but the faith of the Korean people and all the agricultural workers in the advantages of Korean-style socialism and Korean-style rural economic system is growing stronger as the days go by. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the most precious fruit reaped by Kim Jong Il in the work for socialist rural construction that he has firmly upheld the revolutionary principle and stand under the uplifted banner of Songun and defended the banner of Juche, the banner of socialism in whatever adversity    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

To unleash a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula and make a preemptive strike at the DPRK is the U.S. policy and military strategy to stifle it.

He walked slowly towards the opposite side of the river singing quietly the Song of the River Amnok composed by someone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The song reflects the firm determination made by the river-crossing Koreans to fight for the independence of the nation and come back to the country, bearing in mind the serious lesson of the March First Popular Uprising (1919) against the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In his reminiscences \"With the Century\" the President writes: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"That day I underwent a truly painful psychological experience.

Walking quietly on the bank of the river and recollecting the day 66 years ago, he stopped before a monument on which the words of the song are inscribed and began singing the song. He was joined by officials accompanying him and lecturers in singing the song. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President always kept in his mind the song reflecting patriotism of the Korean people in the protracted anti-Japanese war for the liberation of the country, in the building of a new state, in the hard-fought Korean war and during his inspection tour for building a rich and strong country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the Korean people, singing the song, hardens their will to make shine the exploits performed by the President for the liberation of the country as well as the patriotic will not to repeat the bitter history of the ruined nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
