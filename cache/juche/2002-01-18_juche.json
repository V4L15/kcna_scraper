These songs are more powerful than any nuclear weapon which the imperialists describe as \"all-mighty.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are now struggling full of confidence, singing more loudly than ever before the revolutionary army songs vibrant with the idea of absolutely worshiping the leader and the spirit of devotedly defending the leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The appearance of our society where the revolutionary army songs are reverberating far and wide is clearly expressive of the revolutionary optimism of the Korean army and people who are confidently advancing toward a bright future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As long as there are the army-based leadership of Kim Jong Il and the army and people rallied around him in one mind, we are ready to make another \"arduous march\" and will always emerge victorious. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary army songs are marches in the era of the army-based policy vibrant with the vim of juche korea where they are struggling and advancing the way Kim Jong Il does. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea and spirit of these songs fully represent those of Kim Jong Il, and the mettle and might of these songs are completely identical to those of the brilliant commander of Mt. Paektu capable of defeating any huge enemy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should push forward the building of a powerful nation with the spirit of bold offensive, courage and stamina displayed by Kim Jong Il, commander of Mt. Paektu, and bring an era of prosperity to the sun's nation the way he does, loudly singing the revolutionary army songs as the eternal songs of advance in the era of the army-based policy.    \r\n\r\n"
