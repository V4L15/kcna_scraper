And they alleged that the fishing boat belongs to the \"Chongjin Fishermen's Cooperative\" and the patrol ship number is 679.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is another intolerable provocation to the DPRK, the statement said, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There happened no such collision, to say nothing of casualty or \"forcible immigration\".
