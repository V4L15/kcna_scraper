            "content": "KPA Mission Statement on US-S. Korea Joint Military Exercises\r\nPyongyang, February 27 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppet warmongers are finally launching the DPRK-targeted Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military maneuvers in disregard of the national agreement and the Armistice Agreement.\n\t\t\t\t\t In this regard, the Panmunjom mission of the Korean People's Army released the following statement on Sunday:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already planned, the huge armed forces of the U.S. imperialist aggressor army and the south Korean puppet army went into combat readiness against the DPRK. Nuclear aircraft carrier and other groups for naval operations were deployed in the waters around south Korea. Flying corps for attack including strategic bombers are on a standby to go into action according to their aggression war method mainly based on air warfare. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such dangerous military maneuvers pose a serious challenge to the demand and desire of all Koreans to defuse the tension on the Korean Peninsula and bring about a new turn for independent reunification, peace and prosperity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present situation clearly shows why the south Korean group of traitors intentionally brought to rupture the preliminary talks for north-south high-level military talks, provided with much efforts to ease the military tension on the Korean Peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under this situation, the Panmunjom mission of the KPA, upon authorization, clarifies the principled stand of the army and people of the DPRK:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Since they announced that Key Resolve and Foal Eagle are aimed to \"destroy\" the system of the DPRK in \"contingency\" its army and people will go into an all-out offensive to put an end to the U.S. imperialists' military occupation of south Korea and the anti-popular ruling system of the group of traitors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a daydream of a fool to hope for \"contingency\" and \"collapse\" of the Korean-style socialist system, chosen and built by our people themselves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such tragicomic fancy can be harbored only by the ignorant knowing nothing about our army and people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There will be only world-startling great changes and miracles in the DPRK which is dashing toward the eminence of a thriving nation by dint of single-minded unity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural for the army and people of the DPRK to go into an all-out offensive to finally destroy those daringly challenging its dignified socialist system. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  2. Now that it has been revealed that the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military maneuvers are to examine the practicability of the adventurous \"plan on local war\" against the DPRK, the army and people of the DPRK will respond to reckless provocation by the aggressors with an all-out war at any time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"plan on local war\" of the U.S. imperialists and the group of traitors is an anti-DPRK scenario worked out allegedly to cope with \"provocation of different types\" from someone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This plan is a product of the U.S. imperialists' cunning strategy to weaken and bring down their rival through continued military provocation and pressure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has the unbreakable unity of the army and people around the headquarters of the revolution. All its people, with the matchless revolutionary strong army of Mt. Paektu, are in full readiness to penetrate and destroy any provocation and aggression tactics at a stroke. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the aggressors launch provocation for a \"local war\" the world will witness unprecedented all-out counteraction on the part of the army and people of the DPRK. It will also see such merciless counteraction as engulfing Seoul in sea of flames, whereby to smash every move for confrontation with unimaginable strategy and tactics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 3. Since Key Resolve and Foal Eagle are aimed at removal of the DPRK's nuclear weapons and missile, its army and people will counter the nuclear blackmail by the aggressors with our own nuclear deterrent and their missile threat with our own missile striking method.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality proves that the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean group of traitors are the very one spoiling the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula as they hurl all sorts of nuclear attack means, including group of warships loaded with nukes and corps of strategic bombers, in south Korea and its vicinity under the pretext of the said joint military maneuvers to pose a nuclear threat to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It also fully reveals that the present U.S. administration's call for nuclear-free world is nothing but a showy signboard.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As been already declared, the army and people of the DPRK will return bolstered nuclear deterrent of our own style for the continued nuclear threat by the aggressors and our own missile striking action for their vicious attempt to eliminate our missiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Peace is of value to the DPRK. Detente is also what it steadily desires and needs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, its army and people will take resolute military counteractions now that the U.S. imperialists and the group of traitors responded to the DPRK-proposed wide-ranging dialogue and negotiations for peace and detente with military actions for aggression."

Korean Military for Psywar\r\n Pyongyang, February 27 (KCNA) -- The south Korean group of traitors are nowadays getting hell-bent on the anti-DPRK psychological warfare, driving the situation of the Korean Peninsula to overall confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t The group let 25 anti-DPRK conservative organizations, including the \"Federation of Movement for Freedom in the North\", scatter by big balloons hundreds of thousands of leaflets, USB and DVD containing corrupt animation files, foul pamphlets and one dollar notes in direction of the north side's area from the Rimjin Pavilion around the great holiday of the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the past the group used to assert that the authorities had nothing to do with such scattering by civilian conservative organizations. But, this time it made wicked lawmakers from the \"Grand National Party\" involved in the warfare, revealing that north-south confrontation is its \"state policy\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the meantime, the south Korean puppet military did not hesitate to commit such unpardonable crime as letting balloons carrying baskets of clothes, rotten videos and books fly to the areas of the DPRK side. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Anyhow, the group of traitors is seriously mistaken. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It seeks to undermine the socialist system in the DPRK, which displays its dignity by dint of single-minded unity and Songun, and waver its army and people's faith with mobilization of such human scum and foul things. But this is a foolish daydream that can never be realized. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group's more persistent psychological warfare is timed to coincide with Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military exercises to be staged by the U.S. imperialists and south Korea against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this regard the head of the north side delegation to the inter-Korean general-level military talks on Sunday pointed to the ongoing psychological warfare by the south Korean puppet military authorities and sent the following notice clarifying the Korean People's Army's principled stand: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The on-going psychological warfare by the puppet military in the frontline area is a treacherous deed and a wanton challenge to the demand of the times and desire of all the fellow countrymen to bring about a new phase of peaceful reunification and national prosperity through all-round dialogue and negotiations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We officially notify that our army will stage a direct fire at the Rimjin Pavilion and other sources of the anti-DPRK psychological warfare to destroy them on the principle of self-defence, if such actions last despite our repeated warning. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of traitors in south Korea must stop the anti-DPRK psychological warfare at once, squarely seeing the seriousness of prevailing situation."

            "content": "Japan Accused of Fabricating \"Kanghwa Island Treaty\" \r\n Pyongyang, February 27 (KCNA) -- The History Society of the DPRK Saturday released a statement disclosing the truth about the Japanese aggressors' fabrication of the criminal \"Kanghwa Island Treaty\" and its consequences 135 years since it was cooked up. \n\t\t\t\t\t According to the statement, the \"Unyo-maru\" incident in 1875 was used as a pretext for fabricating the treaty as it was a product of the \"theory of conquest of Korea by force of arms\" and the brigandish policy on \"diplomacy for the conquest of Korea\" advocated by the bellicose Japanese reactionary ruling quarters after Meiji Restoration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the middle of the 19th century, Japan adopted the policy on \"diplomacy for the conquest of Korea\" as soon as it embarked upon the road of efflorescence through \"Meiji Restoration\". It was the policy of aggression aimed to launch a provocation for aggression and armed invasion by imposing the sinister diplomatic document (Sogye) calling for new negotiations for \"the resumption of diplomatic relations\" between Korea and Japan upon the feudal government of the Ri Dynasty. Its objective was to conquer Korea and turn it into its colony.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pursuant to the above-said policy, the Japanese aggressors provoked the \"Unyo-maru\" incident in 1875.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japanese warship \"Unyo-maru\" illegally intruded into the waters off Chojijin of Kanghwa Island, the territorial waters of Korea, without any prior notice and the hoisting of the national flag of Japan under the pretext of obtaining drinking water during its voyage in September of 1875. It met shelling for self-defence by Korean soldiers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This was a premeditated conspiratorial case orchestrated by Japan to secure a pretext for armed invasion of Korea from its outset.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the truth behind the incident was known to the public and its criminal nature revealed, the Japanese government advanced a \"diplomatic policy for peaceful negotiations\", a version of the policy on \"diplomacy for the conquest of Korea by force of arms\", in November that year. It made a proposal for imposing the shackling \"Friendship Treaty of Trade\" upon the feudal government of the Ri Dynasty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The wild ambition of Japan to invade and dominate Korea by leaving no means and methods untried was more saliently revealed in the course of the negotiations with the Korean feudal government in the subsequent period.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"Kanghwa Island Treaty\" was an unequal one forced upon Korea by the Japanese aggressors through high-handed military threat and blackmail and cunning intrigues from A to Z.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was an entirely aggressive and shackling one as it granted the Japanese side every favorable condition and privilege for invading Korea while imposing on the Korean feudal government only subjugation and obligations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was also a criminal one that blocked the independent development of the Korean society and paved the way for the large-scale invasion of Korea by European and U.S. capitalist powers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The treaty was a criminal treaty as it hampered Korea's independent development and indicated a way favorable for the Japanese aggressors' colonial domination over it by deliberately stipulating a privileged position and rights to invade Korea in the future. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As shown by the contents of the treaty, it was an unequal one which granted the Japanese aggressors a unilateral privilege such as the right to free trade, the right to free navigation in coastal waters, the right to survey, extraterritorial rights, the right to consul presence, the right to conclude a supplementary treaty, etc.  while forcing only subjugation and obligations upon the Korean people.   \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By the strength of the \"Kanghwa Island Treaty\" the Japanese aggressors deprived the federal government of the Ri Dynasty of huge colonial concessions, laying a foundation for realizing their wild ambition for unchallenged domination over Korea. As a result, Korea was gradually reduced to a colony of Japan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The criminal nature of the treaty also found its expression in that it set the stage for large-scale invasion of Korea by European and U.S. powers which watched for a chance of aggression, turning it into a theatre of competition by capitalist powers. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Right after the conclusion of the treaty, the U.S. led other aggressor forces in the invasion of Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. realized the Korea-U.S. negotiations by using the Qing Dynasty and concluded the aggressive and unequal \"Korea-U.S. Treaty\" in 1882.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"Korea-U.S. Treaty\" helped make a framework of justification for European powers to invade Korea with the involvement of the Qing Dynasty and provisions of the treaty for aggression. It was a curtain-raiser to invading Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the conclusion of the \"Kanghwa Island Treaty\" by Japan, UK, Germany, France, Czarist Russia and other European powers made their ways to Korea one after another to impose unequal treaties upon the government of the Ri Dynasty.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Korea thus turned into a theatre for aggressors' competition, deepening the national crisis. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The fabrication of the \"Kanghwa Island Treaty\" was an unpardonable act of aggression as the crafty and vicious Japanese aggressors wantonly violated the Korean nation's sovereignty and an unprecedented crime as it turned Korea into a theater of European capitalist aggressor forces' operations to conquer it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries are going reckless, persistently pursuing their hostile policy toward the DPRK and stepping up the moves to stage a comeback to Korea, instead of honestly reflecting on the hideous crimes committed by Japan against the Korean people in the past and apologizing for them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These are, however, nothing but rash actions perpetrated by them oblivious of the lesson taught by their past. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean people learned the historical truth that they can defend neither the nation's dignity nor the country's sovereignty when a country is weak in military muscle. They will surely force Japan, the sworn enemy, to settle all its past crimes under the banner of Songun and fully pay for the blood shed by them in the past without fail."

Dado que anunciaron sin escrupulos que los ejercicios belicos conjuntos \"Key Resolve\" y \"Aguilucho\" toman por su objetivo la \"situacion bruscamente cambiada\" y el \"derrumbe\" del sistema de alguien, nuestro ejercito y pueblo entraran en la ofensiva general para acabar con la ocupacion militar del Sur de Corea por parte de los imperialistas norteamericanos y llevar al fracaso total el sistema de dominacion antinacional de la banda de los traidores surcoreanos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesear una \"contingencia\" o \"derrumbe\" del regimen socialista a nuestro estilo, optado y construido por nuestro pueblo, no pasa de ser un sueno ridiculo de los absurdos, que no saben nada de nuestro ejercito y pueblo, igual a querer la caida del cielo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la RPDC que avanza a galopes hacia la gran potencia prospera con el poderio de la unidad monolitica se registran solamente las innovaciones y milagros seculares que sorprenden a todo el mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs muy justo que nuestro ejercito y pueblo entren en la ofensiva general para llevar al arruinamiento final a los que se atreven a desafiar a nuestro prestigioso sistema socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Puesto que ellos aclararon que los simulacros \"Key Resolve\" y \"Aguilucho\" revisan el caracter real del aventurero \"plan de combate local\" contra la RPDC, nuestro ejercito y pueblo responderan en cualquier momento con la justa guerra total a las imprudentes provocaciones de los agresores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl \"plan de combate local\" de los imperialistas norteamericanos y la banda de traidores surcoreanos es el guion de confrontacion con la RPDC trazado bajo el pretexto de hacer frente a \"distintas formas de provocacion\" de alguien. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, es un producto de la astuta estrategia de EE.UU. de debilitar y derrumbar a la contraparte con incesantes provocaciones militares y presiones. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tContamos con todo el ejercito y el pueblo unidos compactamente en torno a la Direccion de la Revolucion y con la elevada agudeza de todo el pueblo y el invencible ejercito revolucionario del monte Paektu capaz de calar a fondo como ver la palma de la mano cualesquier provocaciones e intrigas agresivas y frustrarlas de un solo golpe.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi los invasores desatan una provocacion hablando de \"combate local\", el mundo observara la contramedida total de nuestro ejercito y pueblo, nunca vista, y la represalia despiadada como la de echar Seul en el mar de fuego, en que se hagan anicos todas las maniobras conflictivas por la estrategia y tacticas nunca imaginables. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Como que los ejercicios belicos conjuntos \"Key Resolve\" y \"Aguilucho\" tienen por su meta eliminar las armas nucleares y misiles de la RPDC, nuestro ejercito y pueblo responderan a los chantajes nucleares de los agresores con el disuasivo nuclear a nuestro estilo, y a la amenaza de misiles con nuestro ataque de misiles a nuestra manera. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   La realidad comprueba que los imperialistas norteamericanos y la banda de titeres surcoreanos son autores que estorban la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana con el chantaje nuclear contra la RPDC introduciendo en el Sur de Corea y su contorno los colectivos de buques de guerra armados con ojivas nucleares, aviaciones de cazabombarderos estrategicos y otros medios de ataque nuclear, so pretexto de los simulacros militares conjuntos como \"Key Resolve\" y \"Aguilucho\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, revela claramente a todo el mundo que la preconizacion de la actual administracion norteamericana al mundo sin armas nucleares no pasa de ser un rotulo vistoso. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tApreciamos la paz. Y aspiramos y demandamos invariablemente el alivio de tension. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, dado que los imperialistas norteamericanos y la banda de traidores surcoreanos desafian con sus acciones militares agresivas a nuestra propuesta de hacer amplio dialogo y negociaciones para la paz y el alivio de la tension, nuestro ejercito y pueblo tomaran rotundas contramedidas militares al respecto."

            "content": "Jefe de delegacion del Norte avisa a la capa militar del Sur de Corea\r\nPyongyang, 27 de febrero (ATCC) -- En estos dias, la banda de traidores surcoreanos lleva a la confrontacion total la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana aferrandose a la intriga psicologica contra la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t  La \"Federacion de Movimiento por el Norte Libre\" y otras 24 entidades conservadoras anti-RPDC, instigada por la banda traidora, dispersan desde el pabellon Rimjin, en ocasion de la gran fiesta nacional del Norte, cientos de miles de volantes, USB y DVD que registran los datos intrigantes, opusculos malsanos de propaganda, billetes de un dolar USA utilizando grandes globos de goma.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En particular, en el pasado, la banda traidora hablaba tanto de que el lanzamiento de volantes anti-RPDC de las entidades conservadoras civiles no tenia que ver nada con las autoridades, pero, en la actualidad moviliza hasta los infames \"parlamentarios\" del \"Gran Partido Nacional\" para el complot psicologico anti-RPDC, lo cual revela fehacientemente que la confrontacion con el Norte es la politica estatal del Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por otra parte, la capa militar titere despacha a las zonas de nuestra parte los globos con cestos de ropas, videos y libros malsanos. Esto es un crimen imperdonable. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Pero, la banda traidora esta muy equivocada. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El intento de desintegrar nuestro regimen socialista, potente por el Songun y unido con la unica alma, y de debilitar la conviccion de nuestro ejercito y pueblo, valiendose de las escorias humanas y sucias cosas, no pasa de ser una ilusion vana nunca realizable aunque pasen ciento, mil anos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Con respecto a la campana psicologica anti-RPDC que se torna cada dia mas persistente coincidiendo en tiempo con los ejercicios belicos conjuntos EE.UU.-Sur de Corea \"Key Resolve\" y \"Aguilucho\" de caracter agresivo contra la RPDC, el jefe de nuestra parte a las conversaciones militares a nivel de general Norte-Sur revelo el dia 27 la intriga psicologica de la capa militar titere y le envio el siguiente aviso, que aclara la posicion de principios de nuestro ejercito:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La campana psicologica de la capa militar titere, que se libra en estos momentos en los alrededores del frente, deviene una traicion a la nacion que contraviene totalmente a la demanda de la epoca y toda la nacion que desea abrir la nueva coyuntura de la reunificacion pacifica y la prosperidad nacional mediante el dialogo integral y negociaciones. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Avisamos oficialmente que si siguen tales actos pese a las reiteradas advertencias de nuestra parte, se realizara en el principio de defensa de la soberania el fuego a punteria directa contra las fuentes de intriga psicologica anti-RPDC incluso el pabellon Rimjin.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Los traidores surcoreanos deben poner de inmediato fin a las intrigas psicologicas anti-RPDC, dandose clara cuenta de la gravedad de la situacion creada."
