This behavior is prompted by their arrogance and self-complacency that they have advanced science and technology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Imperialists calculate that developing countries can neither live on nor achieve material prosperity unless they depend on them because of their backward science and technology no matter how big they have resources and population. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present century is the century in which mankind makes a leap forward at the speed surpassing human imagination on the basis of the intellectual ability reached by it. It is the science and technology that provides a sure guarantee for the independent development and national prosperity in developing countries to suit the trend of the development in this era. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Science and technology serve as a key factor of making it possible for developing countries to achieve leaping progress and national prosperity in the present century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere is a bright prospect for developing countries in their efforts to achieve scientific and technical development and material economic prosperity in the 21 century. They do not want to remain in the backward state but are striving hard to achieve a high goal to achieve independent development and national prosperity to suit the specific conditions of their countries and meet people's desire.
