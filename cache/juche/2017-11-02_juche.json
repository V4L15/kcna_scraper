Korean Puppet Warmongers' Anti-DPRK Military Confab Denounced\r\n Pyongyang, November 2 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the National Peace Committee of Korea in a statement Thursday denounced the U.S. and the south Korean puppet warmongers for holding frequent confabs and getting keen on kicking up the war racket for aggression of the DPRK in a bid to bring it down by force.\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently the U.S. Defense Secretary Mattis and the puppet Defense Minister Song Yong Mu at the 49th annual consultative meeting in Seoul had a discussion on such issues as sharing information on \"missile threats from north Korea\", the operation of THAAD deployed in south Korea, the expansion of the cyclic deployment of the U.S. strategic assets on the Korean peninsula, and intensifying joint military exercises like the U.S. nuclear carrier task force drill, ballistic missile warning drill and anti-submarine drill, and agreed to further mutual cooperation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Earlier, the chairmen of the U.S. and the puppet Joint Chiefs of Staff at the 42nd military commission session discussed the way of joint operation to cope with the \"nuclear and missile threats from north Korea\", measure for strengthening mutual operation of combined command control system C41 and the way of revising joint operational plan targeting the DPRK \"OPLAN 5015\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This proves that the meetings described as annual ones were just dangerous military gatherings to spur the frantic moves for a nuclear war against the DPRK, the statement said, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Being taken aback by the might of the DPRK, the U.S. thinks of holding the puppet forces under its tighter control under the pretext of \"tightened alliance\" and use them as cannon fodder for a war of aggression against the DPRK. This is the invariable purpose of the U.S. The puppet forces, on the other hand, seek to rise from their military inferiority with the help of their master and thus realize their ambition for the invasion of the north. This is their foolish ambition.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is that the confabs were held at a time when the U.S. is straining the tension to the maximum by introducing three nuclear carrier strike groups and nuclear strategic assets into waters off the Korean peninsula and around it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the puppet forces' increased military nexus will only reveal their disgusting nature as warmongers destroying peace on the Korean peninsula and the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The aggressors and provokers must understand that whatever military confabs they have, they will just be useless armchair talks before the army and people of the DPRK full of annihilating will to make retaliatory blows at the enemies, and wake up from the wild dream."

They even let it release a false report that the cause of the collapse is thought to be attributable to the \"nuclear test\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This clearly proves that the U.S. and the Japanese reactionaries have gone desperate to slander the DPRK politically and morally, now that they find it hard to check the DPRK's development of a nuclear force through military threat and barbarous sanctions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK, which made the development of a nuclear force at a high stage after having access to even H-bomb with its own efforts and technology, becomes the might representing independence and justice for the world progressive people but deadly sledge-hammer blow to the enemies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whenever the DPRK took measures for bolstering the capabilities for self-defence to put a fundamental end to the U.S. hostile policy toward it, the Japanese reactionaries, not knowing where to draw line, spoke for the U.S. and went busy, getting vociferous about \"threats\" from someone. This is a well-known fact.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than the Japanese reactionaries who put interceptor missiles on a permanent deployment even within the premises of the government building under the pretext of the ballistic rocket launch by the DPRK. They even mobilized ordinary citizens engaged in their work for livelihood for an evacuation drill, while staging drills for deployment of \"Patriot\" interceptor missiles one after another.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese authorities resort to a trite method to convince the public that the national trouble was caused by \"nuclear threats\" from the DPRK even though it was attributable to the worst government administration. When taking this into account, we can not but take note of one fact which is wide spread across Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There happened the U.S. forces' helicopter accident in Okinawa recently, reminding one of the accidental fire of nuclear-tipped ground-to-air missile \"Nike Hercules\" by the U.S. forces there in 1959, and this has put the Japanese authorities into hot water.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Okinawa Prefectural governor on Oct. 24 asserted that \"it is trouble of Okinawa that it is suffering such damage from the state\", claiming that there are no probe into the cause nor measure for improvement from the U.S. forces even though there occurs U.S. helicopter accidents one after another in the prefecture.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The controversial report about misinformation is also part of the Japanese reactionaries' clumsy trick to divert elsewhere the heated-up public attention.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Several media openly complain, branding the Japanese reactionaries' moves to render the fictitious story about \"threat from the north\" extremely serious as a frivolous act peculiar to Japan aimed to justify their arms buildup.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Clear is the aim sought by Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They seek to secure a pretext for sending the Japan \"Self-Defense Forces\" into the Korean peninsula on their own initiative by building up the public opinion over \"nuclear threat\" from the DPRK and thus create a foundation for realizing the ambition for overseas expansion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries behaving mischievous while clinging to the coattail of the U.S. should clearly understand the strategic position of the DPRK which has reached the highest stage, and face up to the situation and should refrain from going reckless by citing the DPRK as a pretext.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If catastrophic consequences beyond imagination are entailed by the shower of retaliatory fire, the TV Asahi will also be made to pay a dear price for its sordid act as it resorts to smear campaign, not discerning the trend of the times."

            "content": "Vocero de CNCDP condena la confabulacion militar anti-RPDC de EE.UU. y el Sur de Corea\r\nPyongyang, 2 de noviembre (ACNC) -- El portavoz del Comite Nacional Coreano por la Defensa de la Paz publico el dia 2 una declaracion condenando a EE.UU. y los belicistas surcoreanos que en estos dias se dedican a los alborotos de  guerra agresiva anti-RPDC haciendo frecuentes conspiraciones contra la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\tLa misiva va como sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la reciente 49a reunion consultiva anual de seguridad, realizada en Seul, Mattis, secretario de Defensa de Estados Unidos, y Song Yong Mu, ministro de Defensa Nacional surcoreano, discutieron los problemas por la consolidacion de la cooperacion mutua entre otros como el problema de compartimiento de informaciones sobre la \"amenaza de misiles del Norte (de Corea)\", el de administracion de operacion de THAAD, estacionado en el Sur de Corea y de la ampliacion de la ubicacion de las propiedades estrategicas nucleares norteamericanas que se ubican de manera rotativa en la Peninsula Coreana, el ejercicio de fortalecer los ejercicios militares conjuntos como el entrenamiento de flotilla de ataque de portaaviones nucleares norteamericanos y el de alarma de misiles balisticas, el de batalla contra submarinos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon anterioridad a eso, los presidentes de la Junta de Jefes de Estado Mayor de EE.UU. y el Sur de Corea realizaron la 42a reunion militar, ocasion en la cual conspiraron secretamente el plan de operacion conjunta frente a la \"amenaza nuclear y de misiles del Norte\", las medidas de fortalecimiento de operacion mutua del sistema de control de mando conjunto C41 y el proyecto de renovacion de \"OPLAN 5015\", plan de operacion conjunta de agresion al Norte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto demuestra claramente que estas reuniones, efectuadas bajo pretexto anual, fueron la peligrosa conspiracion militar para acelerar mas las maniobras de guerra nuclear contra la RPDC, realizadas cada dia mas freneticamente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAtemorizados con el poderio de la RPDC, EE.UU. tiene el invariable objeto de tomar en su mano a los titeres surcoreanos para utilizarlos como carne de canon de la guerra de agresion a la RPDC bajo el pretexto del \"fortalecimiento de la alianza\" y resultan ironico el intento de los titeres surcoreanos que tratan de recuperar su inferioridad militar y realizar su ambicion de agresion al norte en confabulacion con su amo yanqui.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo mas intolerable es que esta discusion coincide en el mismo tiempo con que EE.UU. se lleva a la extremidad la tension introduciendo los 3 colectivas de golpe de portaaviones nucleares y otras propiedades estrategicas nucleares en la Peninsula Coreana y sus alrededores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuanto mas se fortalezca la confabulacion militar entre EE.UU. y los titeres surcoreanos, tanto mas se revelaran la   naturaleza sucia de los belicistas que destruyen la paz de la Peninsula Coreana y de region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos agresores y provocadores deben despertarse de su sueno ilusorio teniendo bien presente de que sus cualesquier complots miliares no pasan de ser una palabreria inutil ante el ejercito y pueblo de la RPDC, armados con la voluntad de aniquilar al enemigo."
