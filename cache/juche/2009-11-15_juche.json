            "content": "Kim Jong Il's Leadership over Cause of Independence Lauded\r\n Pyongyang, November 15 (KCNA) -- History knows no such strategist and supreme commander as Kim Jong Il who has led the confrontation with the U.S.-led imperialists to victory, making undying contributions to the human cause of independence, the cause of peace with rare wisdom and far-sightedness, steel-strong pluck and guts and outstanding strategy and commanding art, says Rodong Sinmun Sunday in a signed article.\n\t\t\t\t\t The greatness of Kim Jong Il as supreme commander on the world anti-imperialist front finds its vivid manifestation in the historic course in which he advanced a great idea and correct strategy and tactics, powerfully encouraging  the world revolutionary people in their  struggle against imperialism, and has foiled the imperialist reactionaries' anti-DPRK offensive and firmly protected peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and the rest of the world by pursuing unique Songun politics, the article notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to Kim Jong Il's great idea on independence against imperialism and outstanding strategy and tactics the anti-imperialist independent forces have grown stronger while the imperialist hegemonic forces have become considerably weaker amid the fierce struggle between the revolutionary forces and the counter-revolutionary forces and between the anti-imperialist independence forces and the imperialist hegemonic forces on the international arena.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il's great idea on independence against imperialism is triumphing in the world today.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK has remarkably raised its international prestige and national dignity while resolutely foiling the ever more undisguised anti-DPRK moves on the part of the imperialist allied forces. This would be unthinkable without the outstanding leadership of illustrious commander born of Heaven\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il who has built the invincible revolutionary armed forces by clarifying the philosophy on arms that a revolution is started with arms and brought to completion with arms and attaching importance to the army and the military affairs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Today the progressive people ardently revere and follow Kim Jong Il as supreme commander of the world anti-imperialist front in the present times because he has provided brilliant leadership over the human cause of independence, regarding it as his lifetime goal and mission to accomplish it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Progressive mankind confidently sees a rosy future and victory of the cause of independence in the 21st century in the great personality of Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is its unshakable conviction that the cause of independence against imperialism is sure to triumph as long as it is led by Kim Jong Il."
