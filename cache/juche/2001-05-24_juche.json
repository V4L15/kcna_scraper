They also powerfully demonstrated the iron faith and will, revolutionary stamina and indomitable spirit of the servicemen's families to join their husbands stalwartly standing guard over the country in devotedly defending the headquarters of the revolution and achieving the final victory of the Korean revolution at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the end of the performance Kim Jong Il warmly acknowledged the performers and the audience and congratulated the performers on their successful performance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was greatly satisfied with their performance in which the servicemen's family art circle members not only made a fresh and truthful depiction of their life and feelings but presented numbers of high ideological and artistic value. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He highly praised the servicemen's families for their exploits, saying that they are, indeed, proud women revolutionaries who lived and struggled in a revolutionary manner full of conviction of victory and optimism in the period of the \"arduous march,\" too, when the country underwent the most rigorous trial. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He put forward highly important tasks which would serve as a guideline in further developing the popular and mass art activities.    \r\n\r\n"

The MD is not one for \"defense\" but one for attack, and a strategic system targetted at the whole world, not a single country and region.\r\n The past east-west Cold War was the confrontation between socialism and capitalism in ideology and system whereas a new cold war is aimed to put the world under the U.S. domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is working hard to dominate Asia for the present in a bid to hold world hegemony and the U.S. Asia strategy is chiefly aimed to dominate the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is foolish of the united states to try to conquer the world and establish the sphere of domination by \"force\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n History has already proved the policy of \"strength\" abortive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. keen on establishing the MD rejected by all the world people and dominating the world is, indeed, a real rogue state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. moves to establish the MD will result only in precipitating its isolation and destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration is well advised to drop its anachronistic ambition to dominate the world and immediately withdraw its plan to establish the MD.    \r\n\r\n"

This is the unique Juche-based theory of the fall of capitalism set out by Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the most just theory based on the Juche idea and a scientific analysis of the actual conditions of the capitalist society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the capitalist society the politico-ideological life is getting extremely reactionary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bourgeois politics is anti-popular politics representing the interests of the exploiting class including monopolistic conglomerates, crafty oppressive politics and dictatorial politics backed with money. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A parliament in capitalist society is nothing but a fig leaf to conceal bourgeois dictatorship under the signboard of parliamentary \"democracy.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the capitalist society in the reign of the above-said politics the popular masses are mere victims of this politics, excluded from state administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Cultural and moral life in the capitalist society is getting poorer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the money-is-almighty capitalist society personal relationship is decided by money and not only the material wealth but also conscience and obligation are traded and personal value and character are also estimated by money. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the capitalist society literature and arts are regarded as commodities, and accordingly, they only play the harmful role of eroding people's sound thinking and consciousness and spreading corrupt way of life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Reactionary and poor politico-ideological, cultural and moral life is the main factor of the inevitable collapse of capitalism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Capitalism is doomed to fall from the angle of material life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Imperialists assert that progress of the information industry is bringing a sort of benefit to people, but this is sheer sophistry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fall of capitalism is an inevitable outcome of the sharp internal contradiction within the capitalist society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And this fall is possible only thanks to the resolute struggle of the revolutionary and independent forces against counter-revolutionary forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when masses of broad segments are ideologically awakened and come out in revolution, will the doom of capitalism come earlier. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the theoretical and practical significance of the unique theory of the inevitable fall of capitalism clarified by Kim Jong Il, the article stresses: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His idea and theory of the inevitable fall of capitalism serve as an immortal treasure as they put the revolutionary theory of the working class on a higher level and a historic declaration heralding the fall of capitalism bluffing with its downfall at hand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This theory deals a telling blow to the imperialists and bourgeois advocates who paint capitalism today as a society based on \"harmony\" among classes and a prosperous one and  serves as a militant banner vigorously encouraging the revolutionary parties and progressives of the world in their march for independence.    \r\n\r\n"
