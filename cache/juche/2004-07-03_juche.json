The idea and line of attaching importance to the army set out and invariably maintained by him in his lifetime serve as ideological, theoretical and methodological guidelines for the Songun politics pursued by leader Kim Jong Il today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chief of the Group for the Study of Kim Jong Il Works Aschalow Kelecha in his speech said that the Korean people call the President their father.

Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 2 (KCNA) -- The U.S. has introduced F-117 Stealth fighter bombers into south Korea while putting spurs to the increase of the combat power of its forces present in south Korea allegedly to ensure the qualitative superiority of the deterrent force against the DPRK. This is a dangerous move for a war seriously threatening peace and security on the Korean peninsula as it is a grave military step to make a preemptive attack on the DPRK.\r\n The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland (CPRF) said this in information bulletin No.875 issued Thursday with regard to a recent official announcement of the south Korean Ministry of Defense on the arrival of more than 10 F-117 Stealth fighter bombers of the U.S. Air Force at a U.S. air base in south Korea for increasing field operation capability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the U.S. to get over-heated in arms buildup right after the military talks between the north and the south of Korea and the third round of the six-party talks proves that the Bush administration's talk about peace is no more than a veil to cover up its aggressive nature, the bulletin said, and went on: This only brings us constantly exposed to U.S. threat once again to the awareness that we should have no illusions about the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. arms buildup and arbitrariness are allowed in south Korea, our nation will face nothing but a war. The south Korean people of all strata should wage a more daring anti-U.S. struggle to resolutely smash the adventurous arms buildup moves of the U.S. war hawks that are bringing dark clouds of a nuclear war over the territory of Korea and drive the U.S. imperialist aggression troops, the very source of aggression and war, out of south Korea.    \r\n\r\n"

That is why they are frantically pushing forward nuclear tests and the modernization of nuclear weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has thus become the world's biggest nuclear weapons state and a country posing the greatest nuclear danger to the people.  It has stockpiled at least 20,000 nuclear weapons at present. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. warlike forces are in the process of producing smaller nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThese are aimed at making limited strikes at individual targets, underground structures and very limited areas. This is a very dangerous and wicked design to freely use nuclear weapons like conventional weapons in wars of aggression to be ignited by the U.S. in the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Proliferation security initiative\" proposed by the Bush administration is also aimed to go unchallenged in nukes and control the world as it pleases with its absolute nuclear edge. This is, in essence, designed to seek the nuclear monopoly and prevent other countries from having access to nuclear weapons so that they may not challenge the U.S. militarily. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those countries the U.S. calls \"rogue states or dangerous states\" are strong in their stand for independence against imperialism. The U.S bellicose forces made those countries targets of their \"anti-terrorism war.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn other words, they are keen to make those anti-imperialist and independent countries victims of their \"strategy for preemptive attack.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is the primary target of their nuclear attack. The Korean People's Army and the people of the DPRK will further increase the country's defence capability for self-defense under the banner of Songun to cope with the evermore undisguised moves of the U.S. for a nuclear war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
