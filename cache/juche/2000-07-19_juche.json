V.

V. Putin, President of the Russian Federation, to the DPRK Paek Nam Sun warmly welcomed the Russian guests upon the authorization of Kim Jong Il, Chairman of the DPRK NDC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is the first official visit of the head of State of Russia to the DPRK in the history of the DPRK-Russia relations, he said, adding: An expression of the friendly feelings toward the Korean people, this visit is an indication that President Putin and the Russian government attach importance to the DPRK-Russia relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The sovereignty and dignity of the country have been defended, political stability has been achieved and work to achieve national prosperity has made brisk headway in Russia since Putin began leading state affairs as a whole, he noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people are now making vigorous endeavors to successfully carry to completion the revolutionary cause of Juche started by the President Kim Il Sung and reunify the country under the unique army-first revolutionary leadership of the great leader Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Strengthening and developing the friendly and cooperative relations between the DPRK and Russia not only conforms with the common desire and fundamental interests of the two peoples but also constitutes an important contribution to ensuring peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK government and people greatly treasure the friendship with Russia and will in the future, too, make positive efforts to expand and develop these relations in the spirit of the new treaty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He expressed the conviction that brief as Putin's current visit is, it would mark an important occasion in further developing the bonds of the DPRK-Russia friendship towards the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Then, Russian Foreign Minister I.S. Ivanov made a speech. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He expressed thanks for the warm welcome, kindness and hospitality accorded to them upon the authorization of the Russian President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He said people's wisdom is always more correct than a political view and Russia considers the desire of the people for friendship and cooperation as a basis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   President Kim Il Sung, the founder of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, based himself on this stand, he said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The cooperative relations of good-neighborliness and mutual benefit with the DPRK constitute a basic component of Russia's Asia-Pacific policy. We consider these relations to be an important factor of stability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Russia and the DPRK have an identical position of supporting the compliance with the anti-ballistic missile treaty, a bedrock of strategic stability. The two countries unanimously denounce any form of international terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Describing the inter-Korean summit held in Pyongyang last June as a manifestation of good faith and sincere will of the Korean nation to shape its destiny by its own effort, Ivanov said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Russia, calling for the relaxation of the political and military confrontation, considers it necessary to strengthen confidence-building measures and ensure lasting stability in the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Russian and the Korean people have rich experience in cooperation accumulated for scores of years, but their potentials, including economic cooperation, have not been utilized to the full, he noted, and said: Exchange in science, culture and education should be normal and beneficial. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In conclusion he expressed the belief that the Russia-DPRK summit meeting would inject fresh vitality into the Russia-DPRK cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The banquet proceeded in a cordial atmosphere overflowing with feelings of friendship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A performance of the KPA merited chorus was given there. \r\n\r\n"

It will make it possible for the Prime Minister and ministers to pay official visits to the shrine and hold \"memorial services\" as big \"rituals\" unaffectedly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The issue of the mode of existence of the  shrine turns out to be one related to the mode of existence of militarism today. A road is being paved for Japan to legally preach militarism under the name of \"religion.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Though the Japanese ruling quarters are putting up the signboard of \"religion,\" they seek to convert Japan into a militarist state centering on \"Emperor,\" busying themselves with whetting their swords for continental aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   With nothing can the conservative forces of Japan cover up their black-hearted intention. \r\n\r\n"

More than half a century has passed since the end of World War II but Japan has not yet sincerely repented of its past crimes, persistently pursuing its hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such behaviour of Japan can never be tolerated as it betrays its intention to repeat its past shuddering crimes, concludes the commentary. \r\n\r\n"

Putin, President and supreme commander of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, is due here today to visit the DPRK at the invitation of Kim Jong Il, Chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission and Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Rodong Sinmun in an editorial says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is the first visit to the DPRK to be paid by the state leader of Russia. The Korean people warmly welcome Putin coming to the DPRK carrying friendly feelings of the Russian people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His visit to the DPRK marks an important event of great significance in developing the DPRK-Russia relations on a new basis. It also inspires the Korean people in their drive to build a powerful nation of Juche and accelerate the reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Today the DPRK-Russia friendly relations are entering a new stage of development to meet the desire of the two peoples. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The signing of the DPRK-Russia treaty of friendship, good neighborliness and cooperation in February marked an important occasion in putting the relations between the two countries onto a new stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK-Russia traditional relations of friendship will further expand and develop on the principle of the complete equality, independence, mutual respect, non-interference in their internal affairs and reciprocity and in the spirit of the treaty of friendship, good neighborliness and cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   New changes have taken place in Russia recently. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   President Putin set out the general aim to build powerful Russia in conformity with the reality of Russia and the aspiration and demand of its people and is mobilizing them to achieve it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people congratulate the Russian people on their good results made in political, economic, military and various other fields and wish them greater success in their work to build powerful Russia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Pointing to Russia's efforts on the international arena to guarantee world peace and security, the editorial says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Russian government is exerting efforts to build a multipolar world against hegemonism and strong-arm politics of the imperialists and their moves to establish a unipolar world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A particular mention should be made of the fact that the Russian government is opposed to the U.S. moves to abrogate the \"ABM treaty\" and establish the \"missile defense\" system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people appreciate and support this stand and efforts of Russia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   An editorial of Minju Joson says that the Korean people know well about the domestic and foreign policies of the friendly Russian people to achieve their objective to \"build powerful Russia\" and wish them success in their efforts for its materialization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people who set store by the traditional DPRK-Russia friendship will make every possible effort to develop the friendly relations with the Russian people in the future, too, the editorial concludes. \r\n\r\n"
