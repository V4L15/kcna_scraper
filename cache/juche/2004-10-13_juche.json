This is nothing but an intentional and deliberate buildup of false rumor to keep the situation unstable on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK would not have bothered to manufacture missiles with so much trouble unless the U.S .resorted to military threat and aggressive war moves against it, having deployed a lot of nuclear weapons and missiles in and around south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is not in a position to talk about other's missile threat. It is none other than the U.S. which is producing and deploying the largest number of missiles on the globe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And it must not go unnoticed that the U.S. is openly scheming to mount a nuclear and missile preemptive strike at the DPRK. With \"success\" in the development of a super-high speed ground penetrating missile, it decided to transfer six of this type, first of all, to its forces in south Korea by the end of 2005. It has made a forward deployment of a squadron of F-15E fighter-bombers in south Korea allegedly to increase the capability of deployment in contingency on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists even brought into the East Sea of Korea Aegis destroyers equipped with a high-performance radar system and made them undertake operational duty under the excuse of coping with \"the threat of north Korean ballistic missiles\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is freely setting afloat rumors about \"north Korea's possible launching of ballistic missile\" in an attempt to carry into practice its strategy of preemptive attack on the DPRK.

The U.S. and Japan, however, are vociferous about the dangerous nature of the DPRK's missiles. This is related to their sinister political and military purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has increased its forces' capability to fight a war in Northeast Asia including the Korean peninsula and escalated their moves for military intervention under the pretext of \"threat\" from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has massively shipped into areas around the DPRK its huge armed forces including nuclear-powered carrier in a bid to put the strategy of preemptive attack on it into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is according to this strategy that the U.S. has relocated its ground forces in south Korea and, at the same time, bolstered its naval and air forces there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is contemplating deploying a new carrier striking group in the Asia-Pacific region. It has already deployed its destroyers equipped with Aegis missile interceptor system in the East Sea of Korea and brought one squadron of air force F-15E to south Korea. All these military moves are part of its madcap arms buildup. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has also shipped latest type tanks, armored vehicles, unmanned reconnaissance planes, Stealth fighter-bombers, missiles and other ultra-modern war means into south Korea according to its arms buildup plan in a bid to step up its preparations to stifle the DPRK by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has already worked out a detailed operational plan to fight a Korean war and, on this basis, intends to preempt an attack on the DPRK all of a sudden from the sea and air and on the land after transferring and amassing troops in operational theaters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These unprecedentedly reckless military moves on the part of the U.S. compel the army and people of the DPRK to harden their determination and will to exert utmost efforts to increase the defence capacity to defend the sovereignty of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the consistent stand and mode of counteraction of the DPRK to keep itself fully ready for both dialogue and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will increase its military deterrent force in every way, now that the U.S. is becoming desperate in its moves to stifle it by force.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He taught ways to do so one by one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He dropped in at a flight training hall and met airmen in training. He acquainted himself in detail with their service ranging from their training to their dresses and had a warm conversation with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then he took deep care of airmen's service and living, looking round a servicemen's hall, a bedroom, a mess hall, a kitchen, a washroom, a daily provision store and other places. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was greatly satisfied to learn that the unit has provided best conditions for servicemen's living and built modern entertainment and logistic facilities to suit the characteristic feature of the airmen, in particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He underlined the need for the commanding officers to show special care for the airmen's living. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He had a photo session with the servicepersons of the unit.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
