            "content": "Lee Myung Bak Regime of S. Korea Will Face Stern Punishment: KPA Supreme Command Spokesman\r\n Pyongyang, April 18 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army on April 18 issued the following statement:\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK celebrated in splendor with great national pride the centenary of the auspicious 100th Day of the Sun amid great attention and expectation of the whole world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The celebrations were a grand political festival as they demonstrated the unshakable resolution of the army and people of the DPRK to dynamically advance toward the new century of Juche full of conviction and optimism after reviewing with pride the glorious 100-year-long history of Juche Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The festive atmosphere ran high as Supreme Commander Kim Jong Un was elected to the top post of the party, state and revolution of the DPRK. The world came to look up to the DPRK with admiration and envy, saying that the most prominent man appeared in Korea in the East.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The people in the south are warmly hailing with national pride and honor the \"appearance of extraordinary young leader\" as the \"rebirth of President Kim Il Sung\", the father of the nation and great sage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even at this hour an unprecedented jubilee which started in this land and is spreading to various parts of the world is turning into mankind's events replete with \"worship for Kim Jong Un\" and \"trust in Kim Jong Un\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is only traitor Lee Myung Bak and his group that are committing such extreme provocations as chilling the festive atmosphere of fellow countrymen and daring hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The Lee group is hurling elder reactionaries of the \"ROK Elders Alliance\" and student hooligans into Kwanghwamun Square and other parts of Seoul to stage such hideous rowdyism as hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group is wirepulling behind the scene such reckless acts as egging riff-raffs on to set up models portraying the supreme leadership of the DPRK and fire at them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From right after the grand military parade of the DPRK to celebrate the Day of the Sun, the Lee group let wicked conservative media including Dong-A Ilbo paint a wrong picture of even the image of the dignified DPRK for its false propaganda purpose.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how frantic the group may get with confrontation with fellow countrymen and no matter how high-handed it may go, there should always be a limit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In view of the ceaseless grave provocations which should not be overlooked, the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army, as already declared, solemnly re-clarifies the will to wage an uninterrupted all-army and all-people sacred war to wipe out the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors, the sworn enemy with whom the nation can never live under the same sky.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The dynamic march past of ranks of paraders and powerful means for limitless strike on the square to celebrate the auspicious Day of the Sun will lead to the Korean-style battles to blow up the stronghold of the group of traitors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the group of traitors committed the thrice-cursed treason against the nation which suffered the great loss last year and hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK at units of the puppet army later, the DPRK warned the group of those crimes and clarified internally and externally its stand to take merciless retaliatory actions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is more irrepressible and intolerable is the resentment of the army and people of the DPRK at the group of traitors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The immediate goal of the DPRK is to cut off the windpipes of the group and its followers hell-bent on hideous provocations and blow up the bases for provocations in the land and sky.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The single-mindedly united army and people of the DPRK who regard the dignity of the supreme leadership as more precious than their own lives will take merciless revenge upon any perpetrator of hideous provocations no matter where he is.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As even the heart of Seoul is served as a base for provocative acts of hurting the dignity of the DPRK's supreme leadership, the DPRK will take a special action to blow up everything there. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then the group will keenly realize what merciless punishment the whole army and all people of the DPRK will mete out to it for the thrice-cursed treason committed up to now.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how desperately dogs may bark, they can do nothing against the bright sun. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK who hold its supreme commander in high esteem as the eternal sun will step up the historic advance for prosperity at the watershed of history in which a new century of Juche starts, while waging a sacred war to wipe out a tiny handful of group of traitors to the last man.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those who dare provoke the inviolable DPRK should bear in mind that they would never be able to escape a stern punishment."

The group even egged old ultra-right elements and paid conservative youth organizations and other conservative riff-raffs on to fire at the images representing the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and went the lengths of hurting the portraits of the great men of Mt. Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is another unpardonable and thrice-cursed hideous provocation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The celebrations for the Day of the Sun marked a grand centennial festival that reviewed with pride the 100-year history of the Sun's Korea, that ended the history of the nation's distress as a wretched colony and demonstrated the biggest honor and dignity, and promised the bright tomorrow of a prosperous reunified country and the future of mankind who has achieved independence. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the Koreans and the world admired the grand celebrations with keen interest and congratulated the great auspicious event with sincerity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was only traitor Lee and his group who kicked up smear campaign, speaking ill of the grand festival held by the compatriots. This proved that they are the worst hooligans bereft of the soul of the nation and conscience as a human being and the most despicable savages with whom one can not live under the same sky.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The smear campaign kicked up by the puppet group is last-ditch efforts of those shocked by the might of the single-minded unity and the tremendous military power that were demonstrated through the celebrations for the Day of the Sun. It was also the desperate bid to curb the world from cheering the solemn declaration made by the DPRK of the start of the new times of great succession.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Traitor Lee took the lead in making vituperation only to disclose his nature as a wicked confrontation-minded and anti-reunification element. This was a disgusting deed to maintain his failed confrontation policy and prolong his remaining days at death-bed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group made up of dirty philistines who know nothing but money calculated the fund used for the celebrations, running whole gamut of calumnies and vituperation. But what is incalculable with money is the single-minded unity and the might of Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Do they know that the DPRK has the single-minded unity of the army and people around the heaven-sent brilliant commander which is more powerful than nuclear weapons and inter-continental ballistic missiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The single-minded unity has guaranteed the glorious 100-year history of Juche Korea and it will guarantee tens of thousands of years of the Sun's Korea to come.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Changes\" in the DPRK touted by the group is sheer sophism and the puppet group of conservatives faces the stern judgment by the south Koreans who want changes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The repeated provocations against the DPRK show that traitor Lee can never drop his nature as a confrontation element and such a wicked man should be punished without mercy. It also proved that the DPRK's judgment and decision were quite right.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Koreans including south Koreans can never escape disaster and misfortune if the despicable group of traitors as Lee is allowed to lord it over.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The indignation and hatred of the army and people of the DPRK at the Lee group of traitors are running sky-high. They are full of pledge to stamp out the hideous provokers to the last man.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group will get nothing but destruction from its reckless confrontation racket.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group will be made to pay a dear price for its provocations and will never be able to evade the most miserable fate."

            "content": "Portavoz de Comandancia Suprema del EPC condena a camarilla de MB\r\nPyongyang, 18 de abril (ACNC) -- El portavoz de la Comandancia Suprema del Ejercito Popular de Corea hizo publica el dia 18 la siguiente declaracion:\n\t\t\t\t\tEn medio de gran atencion y esperanza de todo el mundo, el ejercito y el pueblo de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea conmemoraron con solemnidad el centenario del Dia del Sol con el gran orgullo y dignidad nacional, que fue un gran festival politico que hizo balance orgulloso de la gloriosa historia de cien anos de la Corea del Juche y manifesto a todo el mundo la invariable decision de los militares y civiles coreanos tendentes a marchar a pasos firmes hacia la nueva centuria de la Era del Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl tener al Comandante Supremo Kim Jong Un en el puesto cimero de nuestro Partido, Estado y revolucion, el clima del presente festival llego al cielo y el mundo nos miro con envidia diciendo que aparecio un hombre mas celebre en Corea del Oriente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTambien los habitantes surcoreanos alzaban las voces de elogio a el llenos de dignidad y orgullo nacionales calificando la \"aparicion del lider joven\" de \"renacimiento del Presidente Kim Il Sung\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa oleada de tal jubilo sin precedente iniciada en esta tierra, que se extiende a todo el mundo, se convierte en un ferviente entusiasmo de \"veneracion a Kim Jong Un\" y \" confianza en  Kim Jong Un\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, solo el traidor Lee y sus seguidores echan agua fria al clima de la fiesta de los connacionales e insultan atrevidamente nuestra maxima dignidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLanzaron a la Plaza Kwanghwamun y otros lugares a los reaccionarios ancianos pertenecientes a llamada \"Alianza de Padres del Sur de Corea\" y gangsteres estudiantes a cometer la picardia de difamar nuestra  maxima dignidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la actualidad, la camarilla del traidor Lee manipula por detras a las chusmas para que se atreven a abrir fuego contra los blancos que describen la Maxima Direccion de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTan pronto como termino el solemne desfile militar del EPC en conmemoracion del Dia del Sol, dio publicidad a sus caprichos falsificando hasta el simbolo de nuestra dignidad a traves de los recalcitrantes medios de prensa conservadores incluyendo Dong-A Ilbo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa confrontacion fratricida y la barbaridad tienen sus limites. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDado que se crean sucesivamente graves situaciones que no podemos observar con brazos cruzados, la Comandancia Suprema del Ejercito Popular de Corea vuelve a aclarar seriamente al interior y exterior del pais la voluntad de desplegar mas intransigente e incansablemente la sagrada guerra pannacional de todo el ejercito y pueblo para exterminar a la banda traidora de Lee Myung Bak, enemigo jurado con el cual no podemos vivir bajo el mismo cielo, como ha declarado ya antes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl impetu de las columnas de desfile militar y la marcha de los poderosos medios de ataque, mostradas en celebracion del Dia del Sol, se convertiran en la  batalla de ataque a nuestro estilo para destruir el baluarte de la banda traidora.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ano pasado en el periodo de gran duelo nacional la banda traidora cometio tremendos crimenes nunca tolerables y despues, en algunas unidades militares surcoreanas insultaron nuestra maxima dignidad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn aquel entonces, les hemos advertido en varias ocasiones y declaramos al interior y exterior nuestra posicion que insinua la venganza despiadada. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa no es contenible el rencor de nuestro ejercito y pueblo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestra meta inmediata es quitarles la vida a la banda traidora y sus seguidores, enloquecidos por las provocaciones de gran dimension, y eliminar sin rastros los nidos de esas provocaciones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestras fuerzas armadas consolidadas por la unidad monolitica de los militares y civiles que aprecian mas que su vida la maxima dignidad, daran el golpe demoledor a los provocadores quienquiera que sean y dondequiera que esten.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe tomaran las medidas de accion especial para destruir por completo aunque sea Seul, ya que este se utiliza como punto original de difamacion a nuestra maxima dignidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda traidora experimentara profundamente cual es la despiadada sentencia de nuestro ejercito y pueblo para saldar cuenta de sus tremendos crimenes cometidos hasta la fecha.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAunque se desespere la horda de los perros no podra tocar nunca el sol radiante.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el punto decisivo en que se inicia la nueva centuria del Juche, los militares y civiles coreanos que enaltecen a su Comandante Supremo como eterno Sol, aceleraran por una parte la historica marcha por la prosperidad, y por la otra, desplegaran simultaneamente la sagrada guerra para exterminar a un punado de los traidores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos que se atreven a denigrar nuestra maxima dignidad deben darse clara cuenta de que no podran evitar la severa sentencia."
