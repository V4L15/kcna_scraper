Korea\r\n Pyongyang, November 29 (KCNA) -- Some time ago, the Kim Young Sam group issued advance warrants of arrest for the author of a textbook \"I am first generation of reunification\" for primary school pupils and for the chief editor of a publishing house, its publisher, on charges of violating the \"national security law\".\r\n   Commenting on this, a news analyst of Rodong Sinmun today says:\r\n   It clearly revealed once again that the Kim Young Sam group are the truculent enemy of reunification.\r\n   The national division, which has lasted for more than half a century, has inflicted immeasurable sufferings and misfortunes upon our fellow countrymen.\r\n   It is the greatest desire and unanimous aspirations of the whole nation to put an end to the national split and achieve the reunification of the country. Furthermore, the students in the north and the south unanimously want to become the last generation of division and the first generation of reunification.\r\n   Educators are obligated to bring dreams of children into bloom and lead them along a correct road. Accordingly, it is good, not criminal, that they have edited and published textbooks to guide the rising generation to reunification as educators of the divided country.\r\n   The Kim Young Sam group can survive under the structure of division. This is why they, upset by the textbook on reunification, are persecuting those who edited and published it, branding them as criminals.\r\n   However, it is the last-ditch effort of those who have no future and are doomed to ruin.    \r\n\r\n"

S. on confidential document on sortie of U.S. troops in contingency on Korean Peninsula\r\n  Pyongyang, November 29 (KCNA)--Pyongyang-based newspapers today, commenting on a recently-revealed confidential document related to sortie of the Japan-based U.S. troops in \"contingency\" on the Korean Peninsula which had existed in the 1960s, declare that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will always sharply follow every movement of the U.S. warmongers with full military preparedness. \r\n   According to a recent report of the Japanese Mainichi Shimbun, it was agreed at negotiations for amending the U.S.-Japan \"Security Treaty\" in 1960 that the Japan-based U.S. troops could make an immediate sortie in \"contingency\" on the Korean Peninsula without any prior consultation with the Japanese government.\r\n   The analyst of Rodong Sinmun says:\r\n   We take a serious view of the document because it was discovered when the United States was further beefing up its forces and intensifying war preparations around our country.\r\n   The document convinces us that during the cold war era, the United States had been engrossed in war preparations to stifle the DPRK on the plea of preventing \"southward advance\" of the Soviet Union.\r\n   It is focussing its policy of strength on the DPRK. It schemes to exercise collective armed forces against the DPRK any time by setting in motion the new \"U.S.-Japan defense cooperation guidelines\" for coping with \"contingency on the Korean Peninsula\".\r\n   As the enemy tries to impose war upon us, presenting military threats and pressure to us, we cannot but attach great importance to the military.\r\n   This is because socialism and national security, our life and soul, are guaranteed by the idea and policy of attaching great importance to the military.\r\n   As long as the U.S. military threats and adventurous war preparations against the DPRK are not terminated, we will further increase the defence capabilities of the country with the highest revolutionary vigilance.\r\n   The United States must not misjudge our will and warnings but stop the military moves against the DPRK.\r\n   A signed commentary of Minju Joson warns that if the United States continues laying obstacles to peace and reunification of the Korean Peninsula, our people will not overlook it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
