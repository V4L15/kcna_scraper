It is increasing its say to realize the multipolarization of the world, opposed to U.S. unilateralism as evidenced by its arbitrary and high-banded practices on the international arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The EU worked out its economic strategy with a view to checking the U.S. economic infiltration and pressure upon the European region and introduced euro from January 1, 2002. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nNow the countries of the EU are going ahead of the united states in gross output value and trade value of the world at present. The EU recently agreed with ASEAN to found the EU-ASEAN trans-regional trade organization as part of the preparations to conclude a free trade agreement between the two regions with an aim to boost the economic ties between them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also agreed to set out a new European security conception, drawing the lesson that the security of the EU can not be guaranteed without its strong defence capability. It is going ahead with the project to coordinate views of its member states on many issues such as joint European security and defence policy. \"European rapid defence force \" will appear before long to perform its independent defence function. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The efforts of the EU to protect independence and realize the multipolarization of the world will create an atmosphere favorable for the development of its relations with the DPRK. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. urged to drop its hostile policy towards DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 15 (KCNA) -- The United States is still insisting on its old assertion that the DPRK should scrap its nuclear weapons program before dialogue, claiming that it will be an act of rewarding bad behavior to accept the new bold proposal advanced by the DPRK and Washington will not offer quid pro quo to Pyongyang. This is a clear indication that the U.S. is not willing to renounce its hostile policy toward the DPRK even after the Beijing talks.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary says that it is illogical for the U.S. to insist on its hostile policy toward the DPRK, creating the impression that the renunciation of its hostile policy towards the DPRK is a sort of reward to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The news analyst continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is escalating the tensions on the Korean Peninsula by increasing its threat and pressure on the DPRK, after labeling it an \"enemy,\" pursuant to its hostile policy towards Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not a sort of reward to the DPRK for the U.S. to drop its hostile policy towards the former. Washington should have done it long ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such complicated outstanding issues between the DPRK and the U.S. would not have cropped up had the U.S. dropped its hostile policy toward the DPRK as demanded by Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is neither reason nor pretext for the U.S. to fail to renounce its hostile policy toward the DPRK in order to defuse the tensions and settle the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, now that the DPRK advanced a new comprehensive bold proposal for clearing up U.S. security concerns at the same time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It will be possible to settle the outstanding issues between the DPRK and the U.S. including the nuclear issue only if the U.S. opts to renounce its hostile policy toward the DPRK and approaches dialogue from a proper stand, though belatedly.    \r\n\r\n"

They were clearly demonstrated in bringing about miraculous changes in all fields of society in the most difficult period of the Korean revolution and history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the Songun revolutionary leadership and the Songun policy of Kim Jong Il serve as an all-powerful treasured sword of our revolution and an ever-victorious banner, they called upon all people to push ahead with the drive to defend socialism and build a great prosperous power, remaining true to his leadership.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
