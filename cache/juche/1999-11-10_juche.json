Receiving revolutionary education from his parents and guidance from the President Kim Il Sung, he nurtured anti-Japanese patriotic idea and high class awareness and grew up to be an indomitable communist revolutionary fighter possessed of noble revolutionary spirit and virtue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He dedicated himself to the struggle to carry out the line of armed struggle put forward by  Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   An unveiling ceremony was held  at the academy on November 9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A wreath sent by General Secretary Kim Jong Il was laid before the statue amid the playing of the wreath-laying music. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Also placed there were wreaths  and bouquets in the name of the Ministry of the People's Armed Forces and the KPA military academies of different levels including Kim Chol Ju Artillery General Military Academy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The participants stood in silent tribute to Kim Chol Ju. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   KPA vice Marshal Jo Myong Rok, director of the general political department of the Korean People's Army, in his speech at the ceremony said that though Kim Chol Ju's life was short, it was a brilliant life of communist revolutionary fighter replete with intense loyalty to the leader and his cause, ardent love for the country and  people, indomitable revolutionary spirit and strong will and revolutionary optimism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He called on all the servicemen to think and act in any place and any time, guided by the idea and will of Kim Jong Il like Kim Chol Ju who firmly and devotedly defended and carried out Kim Il Sung's revolutionary line and fully display the revolutionary spirit of unconditionally implementing to the last orders and instructions of Kim Jong Il. \r\n\r\n"

The Armistice Agreement signed between the DPRK and the United States has become no more than a waste paper due to the betrayal of the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States is now working hard to take a grip over the Korean peninsula to realize its strategy for world supremacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean peninsula has become the first target of attack by the Japanese reactionaries who leave no stone unturned to achieve its wild design for overseas invasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nJapan is fully ready to invade the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean ruling quarters are watching for a chance to attack the north to prolong their remaining days, zealously following the war policy of the U.S.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The ever closer military tie-up among the United States, Japan and the South Korean ruling quarters to provoke a new war on the Korean peninsula compels the DPRK to further increase its self-reliant defence power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But for strong self-reliant defence power the DPRK  would not have been able to defend its sovereignty and dignity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe world peace can be ensured only by our gun of justice.\r\n\r\n"

The previous report which said 50 were killed and 300 wounded was based on information provided by the railway authorities at that time. This included only employees of the station,  who fell victim to the bombing, leaving those ordinary civilian victims uncounted. \"At that time, nearly 100 families lived around the Riri Railway Station and over half of them were killed by the bombing,\" said witnesses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Meanwhile, the paper \"Hangyorye\" reported that there was increasing evidence showing the truth about the massacre committed by GIs in Rogun-ri during the Korean War.   The paper noted that the names of those who had been considered to be killed in Rogun-ri are still registered as alive in the document of the town office  of Yongdong county, North Chungchong Province, and those who survived the bombing at that time are undergoing sufferings as disabled. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "IMF's \"relief fund\" intended to destroy S. Korean economy\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Pyongyang, November 10 (KCNA) -- The South Korean authorities claim that the \"relief fund\" given by the International Monetary Fund is helpful to \"stability\" of the economy and \"settlement\" of the crisis. Rodong Sinmun in a signed article dismisses this as a deceptive artifice to cover up the criminal nature of their sycophantic treacherous economic policy dependent on outside forces, the policy that put the South Korean economy on the verge of bankruptcy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Under the \"agreement on relief fund\" between the IMF and South Korea economic share went into the hands of the IMF as it is allowed to interfere in and control the economy as a whole including South Korea's production, prices, current payment, financial scale, interest rate, industrial policy, financial restructuring, opening of financial market and introduction of \"lay-off system,\" the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The mandate of the IMF is, in essence, intended to intensify the U.S.'s colonial domination over South Korea and economic plunder of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Pointing out that the South Korean economy has gone bankrupt under the mandate of the IMF, the article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Under the mandate of the IMF the \"government\"-controlled economic system is on the verge of collapse and the artery of the South Korean economy barely supported by comprador capitalists and businessmen with the \"special favour\" from the \"government\" is feared to be cut. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   And exchange rate and interest rate are on a steady rise while the currency value and the rate of real estate keep falling . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Business groups are going bankrupt en masse, hard hit by the market economy. Not a few enterprises belonging to 30 business groups proved to be insolvent and the debts of the Hyun Dai, Dae Woo, Sam Sung, L.G. and S.K. business groups increased 302 percent as of the end of June last. The Dae Woo group sold off most of its 41 affiliated businesses to foreign capital to tide over the financial difficulties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korea First Bank and the Seoul Bank which used to issue more than half of the \"government\" loan were sold off owing to the \"restructuring\" of the IMF. Many other banks, Pohang Iron Works and other enterprises have gone into the hands of foreign monopoly capitalists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The IMF's \"relief fund\" is nothing but capital and a bait to drain the South Korean economy of its last penny. That is just like poison to destroy the South Korean economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The only way out for the South Korean economy to survive is to stop depending on outside forces and achieve economic independence. \r\n\r\n"
