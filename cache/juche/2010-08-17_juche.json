This is an unpardonable provocation against the DPRK as it brought into bolder relief the vicious intention of the group of traitors to rush headlong into confrontation and war to the last.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The traitor talked about \"unification tax,\" sheer nonsense, at a time when the situation prevailing in Korea is so tense that a war may break out any moment. This is no more than sophism let loose by an idiot who knows nothing about reunification, insensitive to what is happening in the world and ignorant of the inter-Korean relations, a profiteer who knows nothing but money and a political imbecile. That is why he has become a target of derision by the public at home and abroad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite preposterous for the group to cry out for \"peaceful community\" while staging the DPRK-targeted war exercises almost everyday, to trumpet about \"economic community\" after totally scuttling the inter-Korean cooperation and to call for \"national community\" after totally negating the north-south joint declarations and standing in the way of the country's reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group unreasonably put up someone's \"dismantlement of nukes\" as preconditions for mending the inter-Korean relations and achieving reunification. This is nothing but ridiculous rhetoric to force the DPRK to disarm itself and realize the ambition for invading the DPRK together with the U.S. and is as foolish an act as expecting the sky to fall.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The vituperations let loose by the traitor are tantamount to a declaration of an all-out confrontation to bring down the system in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent rhetoric made by the traitor clearly proves that he is an arch criminal who pushed the inter-Korean relations to a collapse and the situation to the brink of a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The traitor will be forced to pay a dear price for spelling out the \"unification tax\", his own invention.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had better mind his own business now on the verge of bankruptcy before foolishly seeking to bring down other's system.       If the group of traitors rushes headlong into confrontation to the last, the DPRK will resolutely react to it."

Al mismo tiempo, se ha revelado claramente a todo el mundo que el nuevo poder de Naoto Kan tambien es otro lacayo politico que anda adulando a su amo norteamericano y da espaldas a la opinion publica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSenala asi el periodico Minju Joson en un comentario individual divulgado este martes y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl servilismo a EE.UU. es el temperamento y vicio cronico de Japon. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHistoricamente, Japon fue burlado por todo el mundo como doncella politica de EE.UU. y enano politico por su actitud tan sumisa a este imperio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHatoyama llego al poder criticando la politica servil a EE.UU. practicada varios decenios por el Partido Democratico Liberal y prometiendo con fanfarroneria que estableceria la \"independencia\" en la politica sobre EE.UU. y expulsaria la base militar norteamericana de Futenma a las afueras de Okinawa o del pais de acuerdo con la fuerte demanda de los habitantes japoneses, incluso los de ese departamento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, poco despues, defraudo la esperanza del pueblo con el engano y la traicion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn fin, por sus acciones oportunistas y faltas de entereza politica, Hatoyama ha sido doblemente castigado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, Naoto Kan se porta como su antecesor adulando al amo gringo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto insinua que el poder de Naoto Kan practicara tambien la politica de sumision a EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa historia muestra la verdad de que fueron cortos los mandatos de los sucesivos regimenes japoneses que no mantuvieron la independencia ni el criterio politico y dieron espaldas a la voluntad del pueblo para congraciarse con su amo."
