            "content": "U.S. termed sheer liar \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 31 (KCNA) -- \"Information\" used by the United States for justifying the Iraqi war has proved totally false, creating a great furor.\r\n Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun today says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At a time when the \"legitimacy\" of the Iraqi war unleashed by the U.S. is being regarded doubtful and there is growing opinion that the \"information about the suspected production of weapons of mass destruction\" in Iraq might be faked up to invade it, the misinformation about Iraq's \"plan for purchasing uranium\" is being brought to light. This has made it impossible for the U.S. to escape the charge of being an aggressor and criminal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Much upset by this, the U.S. is these days letting loose a string of poor excuses. The U.S. is experiencing a hot agony of shame internationally in face of the disclosure of this misinformation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a trite method employed by the U.S. imperialists to invade other countries to resort to plot-breeding and fabrications. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is becoming evermore undisguised in its campaign against the DPRK in a bid to invent a pretext for war and topple its system by force just as Washington did in Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite just for the DPRK to have increased its self-reliant defence capability in every way under the uplifted banner of Songun to cope with the U.S. ever-escalated hostile policy to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should be brought to international justice for its war of aggression committed against Iraq without any justification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt should also be sternly tried by human conscience for having slandered the DPRK with all sorts of lies and plots and perpetrated pressure and blackmail against it.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Dangerous U.S. military move under fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 31 (KCNA) -- Some of the rapid deployment brigade, an elite combat unit of the United States equipped with ultra-modern precision weapons, are due to arrive in South Korea on August 1 for training.\r\n Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun today says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unit, based in Fort Luis, Washington state, is an ultra-modern force equipped with high-performance light armored vehicles, which are fitted with remote controlled weapons and capable of destroying bunkers, and an electronic commanding system. It is the first elite combat unit organized in the army according to the u.s. \"new concept of world strategy.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This new unit has a mission to carry out its military operation after being swiftly deployed in any region of the world in case of emergency according to a new \"operation concept.\" The creation of this force is aimed to ignite another Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This indicates that the new force created on the basis of the \"lesson\" the U.S. drew from the Iraqi war is part of the moves to build up forces to execute the Korean war and its projected training in South Korea is intended to adapt itself to operation areas and test its combat capability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After all, the unit can be termed an advance party, a scout party to ignite another war of aggression against the DPRK. \r\n This is a military move which can be seen only on the eve of a war, an indication that the U.S. second Korean war scenario is being put into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is by no means accidental that there are rumors in the U.S. that the Bush forces would unleash a war in Korea within this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. fever for invasion of Korea has already gone beyond the limit. But the Bush group must clearly know that the DPRK is fully ready to strongly react against any strike of uptodate weapons and psychological warfare.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Koreans called upon to carry out WPK's line of national reunification \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 31 (KCNA) -- The line of national reunification of the Workers' Party of Korea serves as a great line of national independence and patriotism as it guarantees the sovereignty and the dignity of the country and the nation and the prosperous development of a reunified country and the prosperity of the nation, declares Rodong Sinmun in a signed article today.\r\n It says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The movement of national reunification in Korea has entered a turning phase of independent national reunification after going through ordeals unprecedented in history. This is unthinkable apart from the WPK's most correct line of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The three charters of national reunification is an immortal banner of national reunification and the most justifiable and realistic fighting program. The National Alliance for the Country's Reunification emerged amidst the struggle to implement the three charters, which are run through with the spirit of national independence regarding the sovereignty and the dignity of the nation as its life and soul and which embody noble patriotism. This led to the tripartite alliance among people in the north, the south and overseas, which is growing stronger as the days go by. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Great national unity is most essential for national reunification. The 10-point program of the great unity of the entire nation set forth by President Kim Il Sung and the five-point policy of great national unity propounded by leader Kim Jong Il serve as the banner of national unity and action program for all the Koreans who love the country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe driving force of national reunification has grown stronger than ever before in the process of carrying out the 10-point program and the five-point policy of great national unity and this has revitalized the independent reunification movement and given a strong impetus to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The proposal for founding the democratic federal republic of Koryo fully represents the three principles of national reunification--independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity--a reunification program common to the nation, as it shows the whole image of a unified state and indicates the way of realizing it. It sets out a detailed blueprint of realizing reunification by means of building mutual confidence and achieving unity after removing misunderstanding and mistrust on the basis of tolerating and recognizing the differing ideologies and systems existing in the north and the south. It also clarifies the mandate and duties to be fulfilled by the federal government and regional governments on a fair principle and reasonably defines the nature and the name of the federal state.    \r\n\r\n"

Paektu area was registered as an international biosphere reserve at a meeting of the bureau of the international coordination council of the man and biosphere (mab) under unesco in april juche 78 (1989). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A publication issued by the mab introduced the geographical position of the Mt.

He underscored the need to train all the servicepersons as combatants strong in ideology and faith by paying primary attention to the ideological education . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While going round an education room, a lecture room, a bedroom, a mess hall, a daily provision store, a washroom and other places of the company under the unit, he took warm care of the living of the servicepersons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After learning about the unit management, he expressed great satisfaction over the excellent living environment, saying that every place of the unit is kept so neat and tidy that he felt refreshed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said that all the units of the people's army have learned the fighting spirit and way of life of the anti-Japanese guerrillas to bring about signal changes in all aspects of ideology, morality and cultural life.
