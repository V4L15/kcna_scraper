Korea\r\n Pyongyang, March 27 (KCNA) -- The U.S. Defense Department spokesman and military officials including the Defense Secretary repeatedly announced their intention to keep the U.S. troops in South Korea.\r\n   Commenting on this, a news analyst of Rodong Sinmun today says:\r\n   What the United States seeks in this is to maintain its military prerogative of supreme command and colonial domination over South Korea for an indefinite period, start a military adventure against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and thus realise its Korea strategy with strength.\r\n   Reinforcing its armed forces in South Korea, the U.S. recently reorganised its 8th Army, the nucleus of the forces, into a field army system.\r\n   This means that the U.S. military adventures have entered the stage of ignition.\r\n   As long as the U.S. continues war moves against the DPRK, leaving its troops in South Korea, the abnormal hostile  relations between the DPRK and the United States cannot be removed.\r\n   It is high time the United States withdrew its troops from South Korea without losing face.\r\n   It would be well advised to take a bold decision to withdraw its troops with reason.    \r\n     \r\n\r\n"

The main manner is to bow head or body.\r\n   This manner is divided into slight, deep and half bows, and slight bow is popular among Koreans.\r\n   The slight bow is a form of expressing greeting on one's feet.  The deeper bending, the higher respect. This form is taken by both men and women.\r\n   Deep bow is a form of bending down on knees with hands touching the floor. It is used as a greeting to superiors and generally on New Year's Day and birthday.   \r\n    Half bow is a form used by superior as sign of answer to subordinate's greeting as well as between friends.\r\n   In this form they bend body and head slightly while walking or stopping.    \r\n    People at the same age can exchange words or facial expressions as a sign of greeting.\r\n    They usually say, when meeting, \"How do you do?\", \"How are you?\"  \"I'm sorry to interupt you,\" \"It's long since I saw you last,\" etc. And, when departing, \"Good Bye\", \"I wish you good health,\" \"I'm afraid you will take much trouble,\" \"See you again,\" etc.    \r\n \r\n\r\n"

The lifting of the \"sanctions\" is also an obligation of the United States under the DPRK-U.S. framework agreement.\r\n   If it persists in \"sanctions,\" turning a blind eye to this stark reality, it will be held wholly responsible for all consequences arising therefrom.\r\n   It must act with discretion, mindful of this.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
