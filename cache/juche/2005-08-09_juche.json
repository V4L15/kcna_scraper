The \"resolution\" was adopted at the session of the House of Representatives held on Aug. 2.  In the resolution Japan did not use such words as \"colonial domination\" and \"acts of aggression\" perpetrated by the Japanese imperialists against the Asian countries in the past nor did it mention the issue of settlement of the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Timed to coincide with this, the educational authorities of Tokyo Metropolis adopted a decision on letting the metropolitan secondary schools use the distorted history textbooks since next spring. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such action is an intolerable insult to the Korean people and other Asians upon whom the Japanese imperialists inflicted unbearable pain in the past and a criminal act of negating the history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"international role\" much touted by the Japanese reactionaries is a contemporary version of the \"Eastern peace\", a slogan for aggression put up by the Japanese imperialists, and a scenario for conquering the world in the 21st century.\r\n By teaching the school youth and children the distorted history they seek to drive them to the road of militarization and overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their moves to distort history and infuse militarism into the young Japanese are aimed at staging a comeback to Korea. Their black-hearted ambition to reinvade and dominate Korea is being put into practice.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is Kim Il Sung that gave rebirth to the people who had been subjected to the mediaeval tyranny, backbreaking labor and maltreatment, deprived of their country by the Japanese imperialists. Since the country's liberation, the people have fully exercised their right to independence and lived a creative life. He is, indeed, the liberator of the nation\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Kyong Ok, vice-chairwoman of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Women's Union, had this to say: \"Through the 20-year-long hard-fought revolutionary struggle against the Japanese imperialists, Generalissimo Kim Il Sung emancipated women from the wretched fate of sexual slavery for the Japanese army and all feudal fetters. They are now taking proper positions in all fields of the political, economic and social life, loved as flowers of the families and society.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Yu Chol Song, a worker of the Pyongyang Steel Plant, said that the anniversary of the country's liberation makes me not only jubilant with the holiday but resentful of the Japanese imperialists. He went on to say: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Sixty years have passed since the liberation of the country. But the Japanese reactionaries, far from honestly apologizing and compensating to the Korean people for the crimes committed against them for nearly half a century, are still resorting to anti-DPRK moves with outcries over 'dominium' over Tok Islet and 'kidnapping issue'. The Korean people will certainly take their long pent-up revenge on them\". \r\n Ri Kyong Sik, a serviceman, stated: \"Though many years have passed, the target of the Korean people has remained unchanged. If the Japanese reactionaries persistently seek  showdown with the Korean people in disregard of their good will and magnanimity, the servicepersons will avenge themselves on the enemies a hundred fold with the military power they have long built up\".    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
