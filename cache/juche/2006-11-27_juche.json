All the servicepersons and people consider it as their life and soul to devotedly defend the headquarters of the revolution and create anything from nothing and turn impossibility into possibility, if wished by him to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are displaying unshakable faith in the above-said all-out march by strictly abiding by the principle of independence against imperialism, the principle of socialism, firmly convinced of the victory of Korean style socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are upholding the Songun policy of the Workers' Party of Korea, regarding it the most sacred civic duty to defend the country even under the situation where they are hard pressed for everything and decisively shattering the economic blockade of the U.S. imperialists and reactionaries in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance. They always live and work in a revolutionary and sound manner as required by the socialist way of life, standing firm against the enemies' vicious ideological and cultural poisoning. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-mentioned firm faith of the Korean people finds a clear expression in the fact that they are giving full play to the fervent patriotic enthusiasm in their efforts to make their country rich, strong and prosperous. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean working class is manufacturing modern type machines and energetically pushing forward the technological updating of the national economy by itself with the grit and pluck instilled into it by the party. The agricultural workers in the DPRK are now all out in the drive to boost the agricultural production, true to the party's policy of bringing about a signal turn in agriculture. The scientists and technicians are reaching the eminence of ultra-modern science and technology by their own efforts and with their own wisdom and technology, single-mindedly determined to glorify their country. All the people in the DPRK are working hard to turn their residential areas and workplaces into a socialist land of bliss with ardent love for their country, worksites and native places.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The foreign forces and the anti-reunification forces are frantically kicking up rackets of confrontation with the DPRK and persisting in their moves to provoke a new war, going against the desire of the nation and the trend of the times. All this is aimed at hamstringing the efforts of the Koreans to achieve reconciliation, peace and independent reunification through national cooperation. The unreasonable intervention and obstructions of the U.S. and the pro-U.S. conservative forces have repeatedly thrown the favorably developing inter-Korean relations and smoothly progressing undertakings for reconciliation and cooperation into crises. The June 15 era should not allow any foreign forces and anti-reunification forces to halt its advance or terminate it. It is the great idea and ideal that steers the era. The idea of \"By our nation itself\", the great spirit of independence, is cherished deep in the heart of every Korean. With no vicious obstructions can the separatist forces at home and abroad stop the advance of the June 15 era of reunification or terminate it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The era of independent reunification is making a dynamic advance under the banner of \"By our nation itself\" despite all difficulties though it is facing unprecedented challenges and ordeals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans have strong will and resolution to firmly preserve the June 15 era of reunification and further glorify it with firm confidence and optimism, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The chief executive officially asserted himself that Japan's \"pacifist constitution\" is unjust as it was worked out under somebody's coercion after the war and blustered that he would take the \"bold action\" of revising the constitution during the tenure of his office. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries consider as a dagger thrust into their backs Article 9 of the constitution, its principal article which calls for renouncing Japan's right to belligerence and participation in wars, bans keeping an army as regular armed forces and does not recognize the right to collective self-defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They seek to pull out this dagger in a bid to rush headlong into the operations to invade and conquer the Asian continent as they did in the past. This is the very reason why they are getting so frantic in their moves to revise the constitution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that in case the present constitution is replaced by a war constitution in Japan to build a state mechanism for militarist overseas expansion, this will pose a direct threat to the peace and stability in Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Asian countries will never tolerate Japan's moves for militarist overseas expansion as they experienced the vicious and brutal nature of the Japanese militarists, the commentary concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S. authorities insist on their unacceptable American-style logic and arrogant conception that their will is precisely a law to govern the world and any country violating this law is liable to become a target of their military strike. If the above-said practices of the U.S. imperialists are overlooked any longer, the life style governed by the law of the jungle will prevail over the international community and justice and truth will be mercilessly trampled down and the world will turn into a lawless one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their arbitrary and high-handed practices are criminal acts of seriously disturbing the peace and stability of the world. It was a typical example of those practices that the U.S. perpetrated brigandish aggression against Iraq defying the wishes and will of the UN and the international community. Any aggression against a sovereign state constitutes state terrorism and an infringement upon its sovereignty. The U.S. imperialists' \"anti-terrorism war\" is chiefly aimed at establishing an American-style order for dominating the world by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-mentioned practices of the U.S. imperialists are criminal acts to block the independent development of all the countries and nations, the progress and prosperity of humankind. Only when the principle of non-interference in other's internal affairs is observed in the international relations can all the countries and nations choose ideologies and social systems according to their wishes to suit their specific conditions and exist with their own political life style and their own way of managing economy.  The U.S. has openly interfered in other countries' internal affairs, advocating the unacceptable logic that there should be no ideologies and social systems that do not meet its will and interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is neither entitled to represent the international community nor capable of doing so. The U.S. imperialist's persistent arbitrary and high-handed practices in the international arena would precipitate their thorough international isolation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This news came as a strong shock and created quite a stir worldwide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His historic inspection brought the dawn of reunification to the land of 3,000 ri frozen due to confrontation and division and gave all Koreans a new hope and confidence of national reunification. This immortal feat will always shine in the national history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The cause of national reunification is witnessing a new historic turning-point thanks to Kim Jong Il's Songun policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The powerful war deterrent of the DPRK, a praiseworthy result of the Songun policy, serves as a mighty treasured sword as it provided the Korean people with a bright prospect of winning a decisive victory in the stand-off with the U.S. and achieving national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the people should wage a dynamic patriotic movement for independent reunification, peace against war and great national unity under the banner of the June 15 joint declaration to decisively frustrate the harsh sanctions of the U.S. and its followers against the DPRK and turn out as one in the struggle to foil the plot of the pro-U.S. conservatives to return to power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The AINDF will as always creditably fulfill its historic mission as the vanguard leading the struggle of the people from all walks of life to win independence against foreign forces and the movement for national reunification under the invincible banner of Songun.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
