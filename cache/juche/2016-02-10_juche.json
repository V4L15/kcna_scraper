            "content": "Servilismo y dependencia llevan a pais y nacion al arruinamiento, insiste Rodong Sinmun\r\nPyongyang, 10 de febrero (ACNC) -- Algunos paises tratan de superar las dificultades y lograr el desarrollo economico y la prosperidad del pais mediante el servilismo a las grandes potencias y la dependencia de las fuerzas extranjeras. Esto es un proceder muy peligroso que convierte a una nacion en la humillante e impotente y arruina el pais. \n\t\t\t\t\tSenala el diario Rodong Sinmun en un articulo individual publicado este miercoles y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi un pais depende de las fuerzas extranjeras observando su actitud, actua al son de ellas sin tener su propio criterio. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el mundo actual en que predominan el despotismo y las arbitrariedades de los imperialistas, el intento de sacar provecho ateniendose a otros sin confiar en sus propias fuerzas lleva al pais a la autodestruccion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa agresion y el saqueo es la naturaleza del imperialismo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs una absurdidad depositar la esperanza en la \"ayuda\" y \"cooperacion\" de los imperialistas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa \"ayuda\" de los imperialistas persigue el objetivo de subyugar en lo politico y economico los paises subdesarrollados y los que no le agradan y establecer el orden a estilo occidental en esos paises. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa unica via para los paises aspirantes a la independencia y el progreso es cultivar su propia fuerza y resolver lo todo apoyandose en sus propias fuerzas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos exitos y experiencias de la RPDC que sale siempre victoriosa prueban que el autofortalecimiento es el remedio todopoderoso y fuente de todas las victorias."
