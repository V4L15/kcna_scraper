            "content": "Japan should not act rashly\r\n   Pyongyang, January 5 (KCNA) -- Japanese Prime Minister Obuchi held a New Year press conference on January 1 and slandered the DPRK again, branding the DPRK's launch of an artificial satellite as  \"launch of a ballistic missile\". He alleged it must be confirmed that there are no underground nuclear facilities in the DPRK.\r\n   Moreover, he impertinently cried that Japan \"will decisively cope with the DPRK's  possible launch of another ballistic missile\"  in close \"cooperation\" with the United States and South Korea.\r\n   Even today when the world public recognizes that the DPRK launched an artificial satellite, Japan is insisting that it was a \"ballistic missile launch\" and,  worse still, the Japanese Prime Minister is inspiring the psychology of anti-DPRK confrontation, crying for  \"decisive measure\" against somebody. \r\n   In a word, at the press conference, Obuchi announced Japan will be engaged in the frantic anti-DPRK campaign this year, too, as last year.   \r\n   By vociferating about \"missile launch\" and \"suspected underground nuclear facilities,\" he revealed Japan's ulterior intention to find pretexts to step up arms buildup and modernization of armed forces for the purpose of staging a comeback to the Korean peninsula this year.\r\n   Under the pretext of coping with \"missile threat\" by the DPRK, Japan is not only squandering a large amount of money on development of military reconnaissance satellites but also actively  trying to introduce the \"theatre missile defence system\" with the united states. Besides, it is putting spurs to  modernizing the \"self-defence forces\".\r\n   The Japanese authorities should know that they are playing at wrong cards from  the beginning of the year. They had better ponder over consequences to  be entailed by \"decisive counteraction\" against the DPRK.\r\n   If Japan finally takes the road to anti-DPRK confrontation in league with the united states, she will only go to ruin.    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n"

Without putting an end to the U.S. domination and subjugation, the South Korean people's independent life and wishes, national reconciliation, unity and reunification cannot be realised.\r\n   The South Korean people should not lay down the banner of the struggle of anti-U.S. independence, anti-puppet democracy and for national reunification, before they win the final victory.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n"
