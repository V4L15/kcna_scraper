This is the basic spirit and the hardcore of the declaration, the article says, and goes on: \r\n There lie difficulties in the way of opening the door of reunification by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation owing to the challenges of the united states and the anti-reunification forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an urgent task of the movement of the Korean nation for independent reunification to meet the challenges of the United States and the anti-reunification forces and implement the inter-Korean joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is working hard to hamstring the improvement of the inter-Korean relations and the movement of the Korean nation for independent reunification, pursuant to its \"hardline policy\" toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Joint military exercises targeted against the DPRK are frequent in South Korea and fellow countrymen in the north are defined as its \"principal enemy\" and the suppression of pro-reunification patriotic organizations is going on there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Success in the movement for independent national reunification depends on whether the Korean nation shatters these challenges of separatist forces at home and abroad or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation should decisively foil the anti-national and anti-reunification moves of the separatist forces at home and abroad and carry on its dynamic grand march for independent national reunification, united close under the banner of the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An immediate task before the nation is to hold various functions and stage the reunification movement common to the nation significantly on a nationwide scale on the occasion of the first anniversary of the historic Pyongyang meeting and the publication of the declaration.    \r\n\r\n"
