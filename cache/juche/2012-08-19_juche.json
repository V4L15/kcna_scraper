            "content": "Japan's Misconduct over Tok Islets Issue under Fire\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, August 18 (KCNA) -- Following the south Korean chief executive's tour of Tok Islets, the Japanese reactionaries have busied themselves, raising a series of \"hardline cards\" such as suspension of government-level exchange, recall of the Japanese ambassador from Seoul, visit to Yasukuni Shrine and stop to cooperation with south Korea over the DPRK issue. They are even talking about bringing a lawsuit against south Korea to the International Court of Justice.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Saturday in a bylined commentary says in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the crafty attempt of the Japanese reactionaries to highlight the issue of Tok Islets this time in a bid to make it one of international disputes and take practical steps needed for grabbing the islets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's ever-more stepped-up moves with an eye on the islets are just the version of the Japanese imperialists' moves for aggression of Korea in the past and their extension.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What Japan seeks is to stage a comeback to Korea with the issue of the islets as a momentum.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan now has gone so shameless as to move to realize its old dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\". The south Korean conservative authorities are to blame for this. The Lee Myung Bak regime has resorted to such submissive diplomacy as reading the face of Japan, the sworn enemy of the Korean nation, kissing with it, being engrossed in the moves to stifle fellow countrymen in the north. The regime has resorted to \"quiet diplomacy\" in dealing with Japan while calling for \"the era of new cooperation, not questioning the past\". As a result, Japan has become all the more arrogant. The south Korean chief executive went to Tok Islets, the inviolable part of territory of the Korean nation. But he was snubbed by his masters just like a criminal who trespassed on the land of other country without its permission.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean ruling forces described his tour as a \"reflection of the strong will to defend the islets\" but this will give little help to changing the situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean nation will never tolerate the Japanese reactionaries as they have been intent on the moves to grab the islets, far from making apology and reparation for the past crimes. The same warning goes to the quislings who are selling the interests of the nation while fawning on the Japanese reactionaries."
