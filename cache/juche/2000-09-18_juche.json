This clearly indicates that the editorial staff of the paper has been reduced to a political maid of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Asahi Shimbun's servility is nothing new because Japan spreads an umbrella when the sky over Washington gets cloudy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Therefore, it invites only an ironic smile and contempt from the international community and leaves a disgrace as a political maid of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Asahi Shimbun's encroachment upon the dignity of the DPRK is no more than an intolerable sophism and nobody will lend an ear to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Asahi Shimbun should retake its dignity as one of media before admonishing others unreasonably. \r\n\r\n"

The present developments oriented towards improved inter-Korean relations and reunification are a process which should be valued from the viewpoint of peace and security in northeast Asia. Those countries concerned should not hamper it but do something helpful to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is making a fiction of \"missile threat\" from the DPRK in a bid to find justification for its moves to establish the \"Theatre Missile Defence\" and \"National Missile Defence\" systems, which are inviting worldwide apprehensions for their frivolous and threatening nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe DPRK's missile plan assumes peaceful nature from A to Z. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK pays attention to the fact that the U.S. admitted its responsibility for barring the President of the presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly and his party from the UN Millennium Summit and clarified its stand that it has no reason to perpetuate hostile relations with the DPRK. If this U.S. position is materialized in practice, the DPRK is always prepared to make an affirmative response to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Whether Japan revives its militarist ambition or becomes a peace-loving country is an important matter related to peace and stability in Asia, neighboring Korean peninsula in particular. We expect that Japan will find its future in its sincere settlement of the past any time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Now that the north-south joint declaration is being smoothly implemented on the Korean peninsula, new sound international relations will be established in northeast Asia if hostile relations between the DPRK and the U.S. and between the DPRK and Japan are removed. The head of the delegation expressed a hope that the UN, too, will take a practical measure to dismantle the \"UN command\", a remnant of the Cold War. \r\n\r\n"
