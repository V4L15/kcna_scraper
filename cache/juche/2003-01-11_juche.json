            "content": "Statement of DPRK Government on its withdrawal from NPT \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 10 (KCNA) -- The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement today as regards the grave situation where the national sovereignty and the supreme interests of the state are most seriously threatened by the U.S. vicious hostile policy toward the DPRK.\r\n The full text of the statement reads: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A dangerous situation where our nation's sovereignty and our state's security are being seriously violated is prevailing on the Korean Peninsula due to the U.S. vicious hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States instigated the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to adopt another \"resolution\" against the DPRK on January 6 in the wake of a similar \"resolution\" made on November 29, 2002. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under its manipulation, the IAEA in those \"resolutions\" termed the DPRK \"a criminal\" and demanded it scrap what the U.S. called a \"nuclear program\" at once by a verifiable way in disregard of the nature of the nuclear issue, a product of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK, and its unique status in which it declared suspension of the effectuation of its withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Following the adoption of the latest \"resolution\", the IAEA director general issued an ultimatum that the agency would bring the matter to the un security council to apply sanctions against the DPRK unless it implements the \"resolution\" in a few weeks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This clearly proves that the IAEA still remains a servant and a spokesman for the U.S. and the NPT is being used as a tool for implementing the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK aimed to disarm it and destroy its system by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A particular mention should be made of the fact that the IAEA in the recent \"resolution\" kept mum about the U.S. which has grossly violated the NPT and the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework, but urged the DPRK, the victim, to unconditionally accept the U.S. demand for disarmament and forfeit its right to self-defence, and the agency was praised by the U.S. for \"saying all what the U.S. wanted to do.\" This glaringly reveals the falsehood and hypocrisy of the signboard of impartiality the IAEA put up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK Government vehemently rejects and denounces this \"resolution\" of the IAEA, considering it as a grave encroachment upon our country's sovereignty and the dignity of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is none other than the U.S. which wrecks peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and drives the situation there to an extremely dangerous phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the appearance of the Bush administration, the United States listed the DPRK as part of an \"axis of evil\", adopting it as a national policy to oppose its system, and singled it out as a target of preemptive nuclear attack, openly declaring a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Systematically violating the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework, the U.S. brought up another \"nuclear suspicion\" and stopped the supply of heavy oil, reducing the AF to a dead document. It also answered the DPRK's sincere proposal for the conclusion of the DPRK-U.S. non-aggression treaty and its patient efforts for negotiations with such threats as \"blockade\" and \"military punishment\" and with such an arrogant attitude as blustering that it may talk but negotiations are impossible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. went so far to instigate the IAEA to internationalize its moves to stifle the DPRK, putting its declaration of a war into practice. This has eliminated the last possibility of solving the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula in a peaceful and fair way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was due to such nuclear war moves of the U.S. against the DPRK and the partiality of the IAEA that the DPRK was compelled to declare its withdrawal from the NPT in march 1993 when a touch-and-go situation was created on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As it has become clear once again that the U.S. persistently seeks to stifle the DPRK at any cost and the IAEA is used as a tool for executing the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK, we can no longer remain bound to the NPT, allowing the country's security and the dignity of our nation to be infringed upon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the grave situation where our state's supreme interests are most seriously threatened, the DPRK Government adopts the following decisions to protect the sovereignty of the country and the nation and their right to existence and dignity: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Firstly, the DPRK Government declares an automatic and immediate effectuation of its withdrawal from the NPT, on which \"it unilaterally announced a moratorium as long as it deemed necessary\" according to the June 11, 1993, DPRK-U.S. joint  statement, now that the U.S. has unilaterally abandoned its commitments to stop nuclear threat and renounce hostility towards the DPRK in line with the same statement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Secondly, it declares that the DPRK withdrawing from the NPT is totally free from the binding force of the safeguards accord with the IAEA under its article 3.\r\n The withdrawal from the NPT is a legitimate self-defensive measure taken against the U.S. moves to stifle the DPRK and the unreasonable behavior of the IAEA following the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though we pull out of the NPT, we have no intention to produce nuclear weapons and our nuclear activities at this stage will be confined only to peaceful purposes such as the production of electricity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. drops its hostile policy to stifle the DPRK and stops its nuclear threat to the DPRK, the DPRK may prove through a separate verification between the DPRK and the U.S. that it does not make any nuclear weapon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States and the IAEA will never evade their responsibilities for compelling the DPRK to withdraw from the NPT, by ignoring the DPRK's last efforts to seek a peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue through negotiations.    \r\n\r\n"

But only one is clear. It is nowhere the enemies find safety before the sphere of the DPRK strong strikes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Let us see who will win and who will be defeated in the fire-to-fire standoff. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists will be defeated and the DPRK will be an honorable winner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the United States fires a shot, we will fire ten and hundred shots. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A new Korean war will finally lead to the third world war. If a war breaks out on the Korean Peninsula where military and strategic interests of neighboring big countries are entangled, they will be embroilled in it, like it or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States will get nothing in the showdown with the DPRK, but defeat and ruin.     \r\n\r\n"

It is a foolish delusion for them to frighten the people's army and people of Korea with a sort of \"sanctions\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of Korea have a great history in which they have successfully pushed forward the revolution and construction despite the blockade of the U.S. imperialists and imperialist reactionaries since the republic was founded. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. set up a \"consultative group cooperation committee\" in November 1949 and has enforced control over export of technology and trade control against the DPRK in military, electronic, aerial and maritime fields. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The conditions of the country were very difficult in the period of the \"arduous march and the forced march.
