The unity should be based on patriotism and the spirit of national independence, and it should be achieved on the principle of promoting co-existence, co-prosperity and common interests and subordinating everything to the cause of national reunification. All this reflects the unanimous desire and demand of the whole nation and fully meets the interests of all political parties, groups and people of all social standings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The program elaborates on the issues of protecting the material and spiritual wealth of individuals and organizations, encouraging their use for the promotion of great national unity, understanding, trusting and uniting each other through contacts, exchange of visits and dialogue, strengthening the solidarity of the whole nation in the north, south and overseas for the sake of national reunification and highly praising those who have contributed to the great unity of the nation and to the cause of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The 10-point program is a great banner for the national independence and unity, the most reasonable and realistic program for reunification which makes it possible to solve all the problems in the efforts to achieve national unity and the country's reunification in accordance with the interests of the nation and the most fair political program of national unity acceptable to anyone who loves the country and the nation and wishes the country's reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The 10-point program enabled the Korean nation to carry on a dynamic struggle for national reunification with a clear goal and orientation, confidence and courage, whereas it dealt a heavy blow to the warmongers and separatists at home and abroad who stood in the way of national reconciliation and unity and challenged peace and national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The great leader Kim Jong Il formulated the three principles of national reunification, the 10-point program of the great unity of the entire nation and the proposal for founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo advanced by the President as the three-point charter of national reunification, thus providing the Korean nation with a strong mainstay of great unity and national reunification. \r\n\r\n"
