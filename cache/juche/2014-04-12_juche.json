            "content": "NDC Spokesman Blasts Park Geun Hye's \"Dresden Declaration\"\r\nPyongyang, April 12 (KCNA) -- During her German junket Park Geun Hye made public in Dresden a \"three-point proposal to the north\" which consists of \"solution to humanitarian issues\", \"establishment of the foundation for improving people's livelihood for the common prosperity\" and \"recovery of homogeneity\" and so on which were nothing but a medley.\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the National Defence Commission of the DPRK released a statement Saturday clarifying its views and principled stand as regards the fact that the south Korean authorities are talking nonsense that they \"expect\" positive response from the DPRK to the \"Dresden Declaration,\" which does not deserve even a passing notice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t First, the \"Dresden Declaration\" is nothing but a jargon let loose by a traitor to the nation as she was so servile as to peddle the internal issue of the nation in other country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park called on outsiders to help solve the issue of the territory and nation divided into two by foreign forces and vociferated about the application of mode of unification in which \"one side is swallowed up and the other absorbs it\" to the \"unification\" of the Korean peninsula. This was the daydream of a psychopath and a reckless behavior. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Second, the \"Dresden Declaration\" is a nonsensical one made by an anti-reunification element who deceived the public with hypocrisy and deception as she offered no solution, ignorant of the present state of the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"three-point proposal to the north\" is all irrelevant and indifferent to the improvement and development of the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As far as the issue of solving the humanitarian issue is concerned, it called for putting on a \"regular basis\" the reunions of separated families and relatives to build \"confidence\" between the north and the south and \"rendering nutritional aid to women in childbed and babies\" to carve out a \"future of unification\" together with the world community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park should have studied the order of priority in the work for improving the north-south relations if she wished to talk about peaceful reunification, though belatedly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park described the \"recovery of homogeneity\" through \"common prosperity\" and \"exchange\" based on \"aid\" and \"cooperation\" of the international community as a priority task for mending the inter-Korean relations. Her assertion only self-exposed that she is no more than a blind person as she is politically ignorant and dull-witted and insensitive to realities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters is that she desperately hurled mud at the DPRK with such lies as \"pain\" and \"hunger\" while crying out for \"aid\", \"cooperation\" and \"exchange.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Third, the \"Dresden Declaration\" is nothing but anti-reunification outpourings intended to improve her poor image in utter disregard of the interests of the country and the nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"Dresden Declaration\" is no more than rubbish of the times as it is peppered with treachery, hypocrisy and anti-reunification intention too base to tout. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the south Korean authorities requested the DPRK to clarify its formal stand on the \"Dresden Declaration\", it would like to clarify the following principled stand on this occasion:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should bear in mind that the tongue lashing of Park Geun Hye is the first root cause of deteriorating the north-south relations and beclouding the prospect of the nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  It is the unanimous view of the public that the north-south relations will be smoother than now only if Park keeps her disgusting mouth closed. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park should not use the worn-out signboard of \"confidence\" any longer to cover up her wicked intention. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The word \"confidence\" should never be abused as a veil for covering the sinister intention of fostering distrust and inciting confrontation and deceiving the nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Next, the south side should put an end to the anachronistic way of thinking and behavior sticking to the dark past. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nothing is more foolish and nonsensical than trying to bring back the inglorious past under the influence of \"yusin\" perfume. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park should not talk about \"miracle of the Han Riverside\" and the \"then time of laying a strong foundation of economic growth\" instead of mentioning her father's name in a manner of making distant allusion whenever an opportunity presents itself. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She had better draw a lesson taught by the history in which one met a tragic death for trampling down the democracy and enforcing \"yusin\" dictatorship. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She should clearly know that she may reduce Chongwadae to her tomb during her office and meet execution after the expiry of the term of her office, if she persistently behaves as now. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She had better not waste time doing anything reckless but do anything helpful to the interests of the country and the nation and this would be more beneficial to prolonging her remaining days."

Max Thunder involves various types of planes, double the number of those mobilized for the previous drills, and it lasts longer than last year. This goes to clearly prove the provocative nature of the exercises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No one can say when over 100 planes will mount a surprise attack on the DPRK with nuclear bombs and missiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The saber-rattling indicates that the scenario of the U.S. and the puppet group to invade the DPRK has already gone beyond the danger line and entered into a real action.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the puppet group are crying out for UN \"sanctions\" and kicking off a conspiratorial drone racket while taking issue with the DPRK over its regular rocket launching exercises and its steps for bolstering up self-defensive nuclear deterrence for no reason. Timed to coincide with this, they are staging the frantic Max Thunder as part of Foal Eagle in the wake of Key Resolve and Ssangyong combined landing drill aimed at \"occupying Pyongyang\". This goes to clearly prove that all these maneuvers are pursuant to the premeditated and deliberate scenario for a war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t While staging ceaseless war maneuvers against the DPRK with huge aggression forces involved, the U.S. and south Korean puppet forces are massively beefing up their aggressor forces on the peninsula and in its vicinity and threatening and blackmailing the DPRK by force of arms, making much fuss about its rocket launching exercises for self-defence and reported measure for a nuclear test for protecting the national dignity and the right to existence.  These moves bring to light their shameless and double-dealing nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This saber-rattling clearly indicates that \"the nuclear and missile threats\" from the DPRK touted by the U.S. are aimed to justify the U.S. nuclear war drills against the DPRK and disable its nuclear deterrence in a bid to realize the aggressive ambition at any cost. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The saber-rattling made it clearer that the \"Dresden initiative\" and the like made by the south Korean puppet group is nothing but hypocrisy and a poor wordplay intended to realize its foolish daydream, pursuant to the U.S. scenario for war of aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There take place military exercises in various countries and regions of the world but none of them is staged all the year round, going beyond the danger line with huge aggressor forces involved like what is happening in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the UN is to take an impartial action, it should take issue with the dangerous U.S.-south Korea war exercises being staged in the biggest hotspot in the world and condemn them, to begin with.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will never remain a passive onlooker to these reckless war drills. Should the enemies intrude into the inviolable territorial air of the DPRK even an inch, they will mercilessly wipe out the enemies and reduce to ashes not only the sortie bases but all their strongholds through deadly strikes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and south Korean puppet forces will be held wholly accountable for the disastrous consequences to be entailed by this reckless saber-rattling."
