It is an unpardonable mockery of the Korean people and an act of deceiving the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After its defeat, too, Japan joined in the Korean war and suppressed Koreans in Japan, pursuant to the U.S. policy for invading the DPRK. Japan has run the whole gamut of intrigues to block the reunification of Korea and frantically pursued a hostile policy towards the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Having added to the crimes against the Korean nation, Japan is becoming so crafty as to cover up its past crimes and describe itself as a \"contributor to peace\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We categorically denounce and reject such act of Japan as a shameless act of challenging our sovereignty and dignity, international justice and human conscience.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan inflicted huge disasters on the people in Asia and those in other countries of the world by waging wars of aggression, seized by the ambition for the \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\" in the past century. But in the long run, it drank a bitter cup of defeat.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan should not seek the way of ruin by opting for the revival of a war state and overseas aggression under the signboard of \"proactive pacifism\" but gain trust from the DPRK and neighboring countries, to begin with, by liquidating all the past crimes including hideous crimes against the Korean people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The will of the service personnel and people of the DPRK to force Japan to pay for the crimes committed for one century and have their towering grudge settled is growing stronger as the days go by."

Paektu, the reporter noted, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the historic period when the great event of national liberation was imminent, he nurtured the strategic plan for combining the general attack of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army with the all-people uprising and joint operations behind the enemy lines and worked hard to carry it out.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The brigandish Japanese imperialists were defeated on August 15, Juche 34 (1945) along with the gunfire of the anti-Japanese war sounded by the arms of Mt. Paektu, and the historic cause of national liberation the Korean people had longed for was realized with success.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The liberation of Korea put an end to the colonial rule of the Japanese imperialists that had lasted for nearly half a century and helped Korean people retake the sovereignty, and ushered in a bright path of building new Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Over the seven decades since the liberation the DPRK has made the history of brilliant victory and epoch-making changes unprecedented in the national history spanning five thousand years under the wise guidance of the President and leader Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The President who gave the origin of Songun in the flames of the anti-Japanese revolution successfully realized the cause of building the regular armed forces though everything ran short after the liberation, and provided a sure military guarantee for the independence and sovereignty of the country and its prosperity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Fatherland Liberation War was the grimmest ordeal for the young DPRK, but its army and people turned out in the anti-U.S. resistance under the leadership of the President and demonstrated matchless self-sacrificing spirit and popular heroism, thereby defeating the U.S. imperialists who boasted of being the \"strongest\" in the world and honorably defending the freedom and independence of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il developed in depth the Songun idea and line of the President and pursued the Songun politics in all fields as demanded by the changed situation and the developing revolution, thereby ushering in a great heyday of bolstering up national power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The President and Kim Jong Il successfully applied the socialist ideal of Juche, setting a worldwide example in socialist construction and opening a new era of prosperity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The proud history and tradition of the country liberated and glorified by them is being given steady continuity by Marshal Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The invincible might of Songun Korea is being more strikingly demonstrated as Kim Jong Un is ushering in a new heyday of strengthening the People's Army and developing the defence industry under the unfurled banner of Songun and energetically leading the struggle to resolutely smash the vicious war moves of the U.S. imperialists and their followers and their racket for stifling the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Today we are facing the sacred tasks to glorify the new century of Juche as a proud one for the final victory while giving fuller play to the dignity and spirit of Kim Il Sung's nation and Kim Jong Il's Korea under the leadership of Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how much water may flow under the bridge and no matter what ordeals we may face, we should invariably advance along the road of independence, Songun and socialism taken by the President and Kim Jong Il all their lives and thus build the best power in the world, the people's paradise to be looked up by the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The looks of liberated Korea visualized by the President in the secret forests of Mt. Paektu was the one reunified and prospering land and country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t National reunification is the supreme task and the greatest cherished desire of the Korean people which brooks no further delay as they have experienced the seven-decade history of pain and tragedy of national division caused by foreign forces following the liberation of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will resolutely shatter all challenges and obstructions of the separatist forces at home and abroad and build a reunified prosperous country on this land without fail true to the noble intention of the peerlessly great persons of Mt. Paektu."

zealous patronage of the U.S. imperialists after the Second World War, Japan has made full military preparations for independently carrying out any war of  aggression and laid a certain legal foundation for joining in other wars behind the facade of  \"the Pacifist Constitution\", the white paper said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What remains to be done by Japan now is just to readjust and round off domestic laws for launching overseas aggression at will anywhere in the world under the pretext of the \"right to collective self-defence\", unhindered by the \"constitution\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries' above-said moves are a wanton violation of norms of international law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those moves of the Japanese reactionaries are above all criminal acts of blatantly challenging the international conventions which confirmed Japan's state as a war criminal state and a defeated nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Potsdam Declaration on July 26, 1945 clarifies such issues as the issue of making sure Japanese soldiers go back their home and lead a peaceful life after the total disarmament of the Imperial Japanese Army, the issue of making the Japanese government take all possible democratic measures inside the country, the issue of preventing Japan from having access to industry which can help it rearm itself for a war and the need for the Japanese government to immediately declare the unconditional surrender of the Japanese Army and the issue of making sincere efforts for its implementation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Potsdam Declaration became not just the unilateral declaration of the Allied Powers but a document agreed upon by a victor nation and a defeated nation through the Japanese government's series of official acceptances of the \"notice on accepting Potsdam declaration\" and \"Japan's surrender document\", and an international document of strong binding force that confined the position of Japan as a defeated nation under law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries' moves are acts of seriously threatening the principle on peaceful settlement of international disputes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"declaration on principle of international law on friendship and cooperation among countries in line with UN Charter\" that was adopted as Resolution No. 2625 (XXV) at the 25th UN General Assembly on October 24, 1970 specified the principle on seeking peaceful settlement of international disputes by countries so as not to imperil global peace, security and justice, thus reaffirming the basic principle of the UN Charter on peaceful settlement of international disputes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the Japanese reactionaries have persistently moved to realize overseas aggression by force under their former spurious signboard which read \"Japan would abstain once for all from threat by war and armed forces or recourse to the armed forces as a means for settling international disputes\", which is specified in article 9 of the current constitution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's moves for retrogressive revision of domestic laws are criminal acts in breach of \"the Pacifist Constitution\" which was instituted in line with the international demand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even after the institution of the \"Pacifist Constitution\" the Japanese reactionaries, being displeased with it, have maneuvered by hook or by crook to revise it while \"waiting for time to come\" and make Japan \"a country capable of possessing army and a country capable of fighting a war\" under the constitution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japanese chief executive Abe at a press conference on May 15, 2014 stressed the need to have a new interpretation of the constitution, citing such pretexts that it is aimed to help overseas Japanese evacuate from dispute-torn areas, to cope with such threats as terrorism and cyber attack in cooperation with the international community under the banner of \"pro-active pacifism\" and \"international cooperation\" and to implement new \"Japan-U.S. defence cooperation guidelines\" that has faced a big change in the surrounding environment of Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Clear is the aim sought by the Japanese reactionaries in giving up the retrogressive revision of the constitution and resorting to the method of changing the interpretation of the constitution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the situation where there are growing domestic voices protesting against the retrogressive revision of the constitution and procedures for the revision require an approval by more than two thirds of members of the Diet and national referendum, Japan finds it hard to achieve the goal. So they now seek to clear the barrier of the constitution and realize their ambition for overseas aggression at any cost by employing an easier roundabout method.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese chief executive made the interpretation of article 9 of the constitution in favor of aggression and war. As a matter of fact, \"the Pacifist Constitution\" no longer exists in Japan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, in Japan the \"Japan-U.S. defence cooperation guidelines\" are above the \"Pacifist Constitution\", creating the abnormal situation where the guidelines hold sway over the institution and revision of all domestic laws.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As seen above, the desperate moves for the retrogressive revision of domestic laws are neither a simple revision of some phrases and expressions nor the revision for maintaining peace and security as touted by the Japanese chief executive.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an extremely dangerous bellicose act aimed to realize militarization and overseas expansion at any cost."

This reminds one of a guilty party filing the suit first and vividly manifests the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., that was founded as a result of genocide, is the worst flesh trafficker and human rights abuser as it has got corpulent through hundreds of years-long slave trade.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Finding it hard to browbeat the DPRK by force of arms, the U.S. has worked hard to internationally isolate the DPRK by employing such poor method as slandering it in a bid to realize the ambition for stifling it at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The more the U.S. gets pronounced in its hostile moves to overturn the social system in the DPRK, the stronger the will of its service personnel and people will become to defend the socialist system, their cradle, by holding fast to the Songun policy and the line of simultaneously pushing forward the two fronts as a treasured sword. The U.S. should clearly understand this."
