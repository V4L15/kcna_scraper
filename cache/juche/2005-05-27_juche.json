He extended warm appreciation to all the builders who have devoted themselves to the prosperity of the country with loyalty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many new edifices are now appearing in different parts of the country to be handed down to posterity along with the era of Songun thanks to the devoted efforts of our servicepersons and people single-mindedly united around the Party, he noted, adding this stirring reality clearly proves the inexhaustible strength and strong mental power of our army and people fully determined to accomplish the cause of building a great prosperous powerful nation with flying colors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that the Wonsan Youth Power Station is of great importance in realizing the electrification in Wonsan City, he set forth important tasks which would serve as guidelines in completing its construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Underscoring the need to build the power station to win the admiration of posterity because it is an edifice of eternal value to be handed down to the generations to come, he called for paying special attention to ensuring the best quality of the construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is very important for Kangwon Province to make an effective use of its rich hydro-power resources as it abounds in large and small rivers and streams and has a big rainfall, he said, underlining the need to thoroughly implement the WPK's policy of massively constructing minor power stations along with large ones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He expressed expectation and conviction that its builders would bring about a new turn in the construction by displaying popular heroism and matchless devotion and thus exalt their honor of being proud victors.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
