            "content": "U.S. imperialists indicted for massacres of Koreans \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 1 (KCNA) -- The Korean Democratic Lawyers Association made a full investigation into the massacres committed by the U.S. imperialists against the Korean people for a long period, and released an indictment urging the U.S. to own legal responsibility for them on Saturday.\r\n According to the indictment, the U.S. imperialists have committed untold brutal killings of Koreans in wanton violation of publicly-recognized international law and war regulations since the mid-19th century when they started an invasion of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In August 1866 they invaded Korea for the first time by the ship \"General Sherman\". at that time, in Pyongyang they looted inhabitants' properties, raped women and killed ten odd innocent inhabitants, firing bullets and shells at random. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From the beginning of the 20th century, they persistently instigated the Japanese imperialists to occupy Korea and crack down upon its people. In the meantime, they sent scout feelers to Korea under various names to hatch overt and covert plots to reduce it to their colony in future, while killing Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They massacred over one million Koreans from the day of their occupation of South Korea in 1945 to the day before the outbreak of the Korean War. During the war, they killed over 1.2 million civilians in the south of Korea and 3 million in the north and injured 1.5 million in the north and the south of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After all, one sixth of the population of Korea at that time were killed by the U.S. imperialists in the period from 1945 to 1953 alone. \r\n Since the ceasefire, the U.S. imperialists have committed an annual average of over 2,000 cases of various crimes including killings in South Korea, leaving at least 100,000 inhabitants dead or wounded. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n So, no prescription can be applied for the above-said crimes committed by the U.S. imperialists in Korea for more than one hundred years but heavy legal penalties should be given to them for all ages under international law and practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard, the U.S. imperialists should be to totally blame for not only the crimes committed by the united states itself but also the crimes done by bodies and individuals under the U.S. authority. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They must be accountable for all the crimes committed against the Korean people, irrespective of whether they were done by their legislative, administrative and judicial bodies within or beyond their authority. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In view of factors of crimes or in light of their nature and gravity, their massacres of Koreans are applicable to all forms of responsibility--political and moral responsibility, penal responsibility and material responsibility, the forms defined by international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists should totally admit the gravity and criminal nature of aggressive and war actions and killings done by them in Korea historically and apologize to the Korean and world peoples for them, and take practical measures to satisfy the demands of the Korean people so as to redeem their crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Penalties should be imposed upon those who organized and ordered the aggression of Korea and the killings of Koreans and executed them in the 60s of the 19th century and all other U.S. imperialists who committed all sorts of massacres and violence in Korea during the Japanese imperialists' rule over it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Relevant penalties should also be given to the U.S. imperialists who put South Korea under the \"military rule\" and committed barbarism in a desperate bid to keep Korea under their occupation after World War II and to those who planned, prepared, organized and gave orders for the application of war methods and means in violation of war regulations and rules and usage and the massacre of Koreans and executed them during the Korean war according to the gravity of the crimes regardless of their positions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Besides, penalties should be imposed on all those have kept forces in South Korea and committed unprecedented human rights violations, killings and violence while seeking to provoke another war in Korea, and their accomplices. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Various forms and ways can be applied to impose such legal penalties on them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists should legally punish those responsible in the U.S. according to the procedures and methods. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should take such practical measures as instituting a law calling for investigating the massacre of Korean civilians and punishing those responsible, set up an organization or an advisory committee with such mandate at its congress or the administration so as to ferret out criminals who directly organized those crimes or perpetrated them together with accomplices and punish them according to the law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people have a legitimate right to hold the U.S. imperialists accountable for those crimes anytime according to the law of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In case they are tried under the law of the DPRK, they will face appropriate punishment according to the gravity of their crimes under its criminal law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' mass-killings of Koreans were a serious challenge to the justice and peace of the world and conscience and morality of humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The international community, therefore, may set up an appropriate international court and punish GI criminals by its ruling under the watch of the world people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In that case the Korean people have a legitimate right to disclose the GIs' crimes at the international court, strongly demand it sternly judge criminals and execute sentences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people have a legitimate right to institute legal proceedings against the U.S. crimes and punish them anytime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans will exercise this right generation after generation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the U.S. imperialists are working hard to start a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula in a bid to massacre the Koreans under the pretext of its \"nuclear issue\", far from apologizing for the massacre of Koreans they committed century after century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is our belief that the lawyers, politicians, democratic figures and peace-loving people the world over who respect human rights and love justice and peace would join in the international campaign to try the U.S. imperialists who killed Koreans century after century at the international war crimes tribunal, pay due attention to the U.S. imperialists' new criminal moves against peace on the Korean Peninsula and humankind and make positive efforts to frustrate them in time. \r\n\r\n"

Minju Joson today in a signed commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Holding fruitless talks would only mean wasting time and would be worse than having no negotiations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The news analyst continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is essential for settling the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula is not any format of talks but for the U.S. to have a will to settle the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue was spawned owing to the nuclear threat and blackmail caused by the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The key to resolving this issue can be found only when the U.S. has a true willingness to make a switchover in its DPRK policy. The issue will never be settled unless the U.S. makes a bold switchover in its DPRK policy. If the U.S. is ready to change this policy, such a thing as format of talks will not be a problem as far as the settlement of the nuclear issue is concerned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We are not opposed to the talks for the settlement of the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is our consistent stand to peacefully settle the issue through dialogue. It is our stand that the DPRK-U.S. talks should be held to be followed by the U.S.-proposed multilateral talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through the multilateral talks the U.S. seeks to obstruct the settlement of the issue overtly and covertly and shift the blame for it onto the DPRK in a bid to secure a leverage of international pressure on the DPRK and attain its sinister purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., however, is seriously mistaken.

This betrays the U.S. sinister attempt to make the Palestinian president titular and turn the confrontation between Palestine and Israel into that between the Palestinian authority and the Palestinian \"terrorist\" organizations in a bid to plunge Palestine into \"a civil war\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"road map\" set out by the bush administration can be called \"road map for greater Israel empire\" as it is aimed to carry out the aggressive Mideast policy of the U.S. and Israel, a policy aimed to raise Israel's status in the Arab region to found \"greater Israel empire.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration has made persistent efforts to put the \"road map\" into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States and Israel are becoming undisguised in their moves to deprive the present Palestinian President of any authority. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During his two Mideast trips in the last three weeks Powell met the new Palestinian Prime Minister, while ignoring Arafat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During his Mideast tours Powell took great pain to assert the justice and importance of the \"road map,\" negotiating with different countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pretending to be interested in the economic development of the middle east, the U.S. is talking about the conclusion of \"an agreement on free trade\" with Arab countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these facts go to prove that the United States, while paying lip-service to Mideast peace and stability, is, in fact, keen to calm down the anti-U.S. spirit that has mounted among the Arab countries with the Iraqi war as a momentum and use Israel for realizing its ambition for dominating the region.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

He has intensified the drive to strengthen the WPK into the powerful revolutionary vanguard capable of carrying out the idea and cause of the president since his demise, in particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The greatness of Kim Jong Il has also been clearly proved by the fact that he has turned the WPK into invincible combat ranks as strong in organization and discipline as the Korean People's Army and brought about a fresh turn in the method and style of the party work as required by the Songun era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is thanks to his wise leadership that the Juche-oriented Songun idea prevails throughout the party and the WPK has grown to be ever-victorious combat ranks as strong in organization and discipline as the KPA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Guided by the Songun idea, the party has achieved the single-hearted unity and there are the revolutionary discipline and order whereby all members of the party act as one as intended by the leader.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
