The United States intends to bring to greater intensity its pressure to bear upon the DPRK by turning the fictitious \"human rights issue\" of the latter into a political and international problem and, furthermore, stifle it by force of arms. What the United States is after is to render its confrontation with the DPRK more acute with the \"human rights\" offensive against the latter and, moreover, light the fuse of a war. Trying to find a pretext for a war, it is whipping itself into frenzy in its massive war games, with vast aggression forces amassed in and around south Korea. The \"human rights issue\" is what it brings forward for this purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nobody can vouch that the United States, the robber who stoops to any infamy by placing its domestic law above international law, would not launch into an armed intervention against the DPRK any time by brandishing the \"act on human rights in north Korea.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. \"human rights\" offensive can never work with the DPRK. It is waiting for a social confusion in the DPRK. But it is as foolish and vain as waiting for a rain from a clear sky. The human rights concept based on the U.S. view of value cannot be applied to the DPRK, and it can never be allowed to use it for a political aim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are heightening vigilance against the attempts of the United States to impair the dignity and prestige of the independent DPRK, make it legal and its policy to mount a \"human rights\" offensive designed for interference in the internal affairs of the DPRK and isolate and stifle it at any cost by cooking up the act full of lies. If the U.S. persisted in its scheme to do harm to the DPRK by the \"human rights\" offensive, the anti-U.S. sentiments of the Korean people would grow a hundred fold. The more vicious the United States becomes in hurling every conceivable slander at the DPRK, putting pressure upon it, the greater is the might of the single-hearted unity of the army and people of the DPRK and its self-reliant defense capabilities. And they will make full preparations to beat the enemy at one blow if he dare pounce upon them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

If the U.S. imperialist bellicose forces dare ignite a war of aggression on this land, the army and people of the DPRK will give vent to their pent-up resentment and wrath against the U.S. and deal merciless retaliatory blows at the aggressors so that they will not be able to have even a chance to repent of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities opened the sky, seas and land of Korea to huge foreign aggression forces coming to do harm to the fellow countrymen and, worse still, are staging north-targeted war exercises together with outside forces.
