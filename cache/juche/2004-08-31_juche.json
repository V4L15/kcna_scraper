            "content": "Protection of Fascist Law Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 30 (KCNA) -- The south Korean Constitutional Court ruled on August 26 that some paragraphs of the \"Security Law\" are consistent with the \"constitution,\" according to south Korean MBC.\r\n All the nine judges of the court made this decision on the first and fifth paragraphs of article 7 of the SL by the consensus of their views though they are rebuffed and condemned as poisonous provisions blocking reunification and stamping down democracy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nation is called upon to put an end to the era of division and confrontation and work together for independent reunification. Yet the above-said court adopted such a reckless decision to totally block national reconciliation and cooperation, still considering the north where fellow countrymen live as an \"anti-state organization\" and making \"praises, encouragement and information service for it\" and \"printing of enemy-benefiting literature, its possession and distribution\" punishable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis cannot but be an anachronistic crime going against the new. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-reunification conservative forces came out in protection of this fascist law despite the mounting actions among various circles for the repeal of the SL as exemplified by the recommendation for the total abolition of the SL sent by the Human Rights Committee of south Korea to the \"National Assembly\" and the \"Ministry of Justice\" recently. This is nothing but a foolish attempt to prolong the remaining days of their dirty political careers by keeping the SL in force. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They elaborated on the noteworthy achievements of the Korean people in socialist construction under his leadership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Stressing that leader Kim Jong Il, carrying forward the cause of Kim Il Sung, has built a military power, pursuant to unique Songun politics, they said it is owing to mighty military capabilities that the Bush administration dare not open fire at the DPRK and the latter is standing against the U.S. with strong will of independence and national spirit of self-respect in the DPRK-U.S. confrontation over the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the same day, a round-table talk was held at the Tlustice Committee, Beroun County, of the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia of the Czech Republic. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The chairman of the Paektusan Czech-Korean Friendship Association in his speech at the round-table talk praised the immortal exploits of Kim Il Sung in founding the DPRK, noting that the DPRK is vigorously pushing forward the building of a great prosperous powerful socialist nation without vacillation in face of the moves of the imperialist combined forces to isolate and stifle it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Film shows were held at the Secretariat of the Pan-African Movement, Pribram, the Czech Republic, and the Kim Jong Il Class of Kitante Primary School in Kampala City, Uganda, from Aug. 23 to 25.

            "content": "Prospect of of Six-party Talks Depends on U.S. Renunciation of Hostile Policy. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 30 (KCNA) -- Some quarters of the international community are spreading unrealistic mistaken rumors as regards the prospect of the fourth round of the six-party talks, contending that the stand of the DPRK \"is illustrative of Pyongyang's customary blackmail tactics\" and it is \"aimed to gain time while waiting for the U.S. presidential election returns.\"\r\n Commenting on this, a Rodong Sinmun news analyst Monday says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is the very one knocking the bottom out of the six-party talks and throwing hurdles in the way of the solution to the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt can never evade the responsibility for this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One should not get on the nerves of the dialogue partner or threaten it if the talks are to run a smooth course. But, on the contrary, the United States is laying a huge stumbling block in the way of the talks, while deliberately increasing the military tension on the Korean peninsula. As a result, the process of the talks has moved backward and it is sinking into a crisis of collapse. The point is whether the U.S. has the will to drop its hostile policy toward the DPRK, or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK and the U.S. are standing in the most acute hostile relations on the world political arena. The main obstacle in settling the nuclear issue between them and ensuring regional peace and security is the unjustifiable hostile policy of the U.S. toward the DPRK. Herein lies the reason why the prospect of the fourth round of the talks is beclouded. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should build again the foundation of the six-party talks it has demolished by showing its will to actually renounce its hostile policy toward the DPRK. This is the urgent duty of the U.S. and the key to the resumption of the talks.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Terms U.S. Attempt to Bring Down DPRK Pipedream \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 30 (KCNA) -- Recently U.S. President Bush made a brigandish demand that the DPRK disarm itself and Under- Secretary of State Bolton let loose the balderdash that it is possible for north Korea to expect improved relations with the U.S. only when it settles not only the issue of nuclear weapons but issues of biological and chemical weapons, ballistic missiles, human rights, etc.\r\n A string of such bellicose remarks that can be heard from the U.S. these days clearly indicate that the aim of the U.S. is not to seek a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue but to bring down the system in the DPRK by forcing it to change its system and disarm itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has consistently stood for a peaceful negotiated settlement of a series of pending problems such as the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To this end the DPRK has repeatedly urged the U.S. to drop its hostile policy towards the former and accept the most fair and aboveboard proposal of \"reward for freeze\" based on the principle of \"words for words\" and \"action for action\" as early as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. had sincerely accepted the proposal and positively opted for solving the problems, the projected meeting of the working group of the six-party talks would have been held and their prospect would have become bright, not dim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., however, has become more adamant in its policy stance that \"there would be no reward for freeze\", completely destroying the foundation of the talks in a bid to escalate its stand-off with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is evidenced by the U.S. impudent demand that the DPRK lay down its arms, while calling for its settlement of not only the issue of the nuclear weapons but issues of biological and chemical weapons, ballistic missiles and human rights and so on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such assertion of the U.S. glaringly discloses its sinister intention to solve the nuclear issue by bringing down the DPRK's system,\" not through dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. gave lip-service to the negotiated solution to the DPRK-U.S. nuclear issue under the pressure of the fair world public opinion. But this was hypocrisy and a fig-leaf to cover its cunning scheme to deliberately throw hurdles in the way of dialogue and bring down the system in the DPRK by force for arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This system is the Korean style people-centered socialist system which was chosen by themselves and which they consider as their life and soul and a system under which their perfect unity is growing strong thanks to the might of the Songun policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a pipedream for the U.S. to try to destroy this inviolable system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the U.S. has disclosed its ulterior motive to overthrow the system in the DPRK by force of arms it is left with no option but to bolster its capability for self-defence in the future.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This situation calls on all the Koreans in the north, the south and overseas to turn out as one in the anti-U.S., anti-war struggle for national dignity and destiny. Rodong Sinmun Monday says this in a signed article. It goes on:\r\n The struggle against the U.S. and war is a pressing task of the nation vital to its destiny. All the Koreans should firmly unite as one and struggle to emerge victorious in this struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today when the peace of the country and the destiny of the nation are seriously threatened, all members of the nation should ponder over their own fate and bravely turn out in the struggle against the U.S. imperialists' moves for aggression and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north, the south and overseas should unanimously rebuff and denounce the U.S. imperialists�� moves for a war of aggression against the north and defend the peace of the country through national cooperation against the U.S. They should strongly oppose and condemn such sycophantic act as encouraging the outside forces in their frenzy for aggression and their reliance upon them and sternly punish those traitors to the nation and pro-U.S. warmongers getting involved in those moves, crying out for \"cooperation with outsiders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe Songun policy pursed by the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) serves as a shield for the nation as it firmly protects the security and interests of all fellow countrymen in the north, the south and overseas with arms. They should be proud of the invincible Songun policy and fully support and uphold with ardent patriotism the great Songun policy of the WPK, a treasured sword to defend the destiny of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans are the master of the destiny of the nation. No foreign force can and will save the destiny of the Korean nation from a crisis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north, the south and overseas should have a transparent Juche-oriented viewpoint and stand that they are the master of their own destiny and turn out in the anti-U.S., anti-war struggle as one to honorably defend the peace on the Korean peninsula and bring the day of independent reunification earlier.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And more than 100 representatives of other political parties and public organizations were present there as observers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President delivered a historic report \"For the Establishment of a United Party of the Working Masses\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the report, he clarifies the necessity of the establishment of the Workers' Party of Korea and the goal, nature and duty of the Party and sets forth tasks for developing it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The inaugural congress examined the drafts of the Party's program and rules, and unanimously adopted a decision on merging the two parties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also decided to rename Jongro, the Party's organ, Rodong Sinmun and to found its politico-theoretical magazine Kunroja. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The congress elected Central Committee of the Party headed by the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The appearance of the Workers' Party strengthened the alliance of the workers, peasants and intellectuals, raised  the leading role of the working class and consolidated the foundation of the democratic national united front. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was a fine fruition and great victory of President Kim Il Sung's outstanding idea on building a mass party.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
