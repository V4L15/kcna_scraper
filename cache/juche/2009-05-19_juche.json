            "content": "S. Korean \"Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade\" Accused of Its Anti-DPRK Campaign\r\nPyongyang, May 19 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea issued a statement on Monday in which he said that as long as such group of pro-American lackeys as the \"Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade\" of south Korea is allowed to stay in offices, it is impossible to prevent the inter-Korean relations from being further deteriorated and a war from breaking out on the Korean Peninsula to turn south Korea into a sea of fire and to debris. \n\t\t\t\t\tThe statement continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the DPRK vehemently turned down the UNSC's \"presidential statement\" and took strong measures against it, the \"ministry\" and other institutions of the puppet authorities of south Korea, in league with the United States and Japan, called for \"appropriate steps\" and \"sanctions\" against the DPRK while terming those steps \"a challenge to the international community.\" And they are blustering that south Korea remains unchanged in the principle calling for the full participation in the PSI.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said \"ministry\" has even the issues related to the inter-Korean relations under its thumb, exercising full mandate in the matters of diplomacy, security and unification, and working with bloodshot eyes to make them serve the purposes of foreign forces' confrontation with the DPRK and their war policy under the signboard of \"priority to the U.S.-south Korea alliance.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than the \"ministry\" that totally torpedoed the process of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in collusion with its U.S. and Japanese masters. It is again the \"ministry\" that has conducted a campaign against the inter-Korean joint declarations and staged a vicious \"human rights\" farce against the DPRK even in the international arena and persistently insisted on south Korea's full participation in the extremely dangerous PSI.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Mandarins of the \"ministry\" went the lengths of impudently interfering in the issue of the Kaesong Industrial Zone. They did not hesitate to make reckless remarks that they would bring to the UN Human Rights Council the case of the person who is now under investigation after being arrested while hatching anti-DPRK plots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is preposterous for those wholly responsible for the torpedoed process of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula to talk about the \"denuclearization.\" Raising it as a precondition for improving the inter-Korean relations is, in the final analysis, nothing but rhetoric intended to completely sever the inter-Korean relations, denying dialogue and cooperation, and disarm the DPRK in a bid to ignite a war of aggression against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak group had better come to its senses and stop adding to the crimes committed against the nation through such machines as the \"ministry\", a tool of the U.S. and its war servant."

And even foreign films seriously misrepresenting the reality of the DPRK are openly shown there. \n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the Literature and Art Sub-committee of the North Side Committee for Implementing the June 15 Joint Declaration in a statement issued Tuesday said: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an indication that the vicious and dastardly moves of the group of traitors to completely stamp out the idea of \"By our nation itself\" which has dynamically advanced the June 15 era in the sphere of literature and art of south Korea and benumb the south Koreans' thoughts have reached an extreme phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group is staging such farce as reproducing the above-said cheap films and TV dramas which were washed away by the strong trend of the June 15 era after being censured and rejected as garbage of history in south Korea in a bid to prop up the unpopular pro-U.S. conservative \"government\" and bring under control the situation in which it is driven into a crisis at home and abroad. This is, however, a serious miscalculation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The people's sound thinking and morality cannot but be ruthlessly violated and the north-south relations can never be improved as long as sycophancy towards the U.S. is justified, fascists are allowed to ride roughshod and confrontation with fellow countrymen is incited in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group is sadly mistaken if it thinks it can quell the just and patriotic thinking of the south Korean people desirous of national unity and reunification with chains of fascism. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group had better stop its rash acts and immediately halt its despicable smear campaign inciting north-south confrontation, well aware of the miserable end met by those who swam against the trend of the times."

Korea\r\nPyongyang, May 19 (KCNA) -- More than 10,000 workers from different parts of south Korea held a rally in Taejon on May 16 denouncing the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors for its unjust labor policy on the occasion of the 29th anniversary of the May 18 Kwangju popular uprising. \n\t\t\t\t\t Speakers at the rally declared they could never forget the desire of the participants in the May 18 Kwangju uprising brutally killed by the fascist military dictators 29 years ago. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Referring to the fact that Pak Jong Thae, chairman of the Kwangju branch of the Freight Workers' Solidarity, committed suicide in protest against the unwarranted action taken by the management side to dismiss workers en masse, they stated it was none other than Lee and big businesses that drove him to death. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the death of Pak Jong Thae was by no means in vain, they declared that workers from different parts of south Korea would turn out as one in the actions to gain the right to work and surely emerge victorious in the struggle against the Lee regime. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In another development, the solidarity called a general strike on the same day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the solidarity would never allow any act to suppress the general strike but launch a full-dressed struggle against it, the organization declared it would call on the members of the trade unions in all fields including construction, railway, harbor, gas and electricity to launch a solidarity struggle. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Members of the solidarity marched along streets of Taejon in demand of an end to the unpopular labor policy."

Tomar la \"desnuclearizacion\" por premisa de las relaciones N-S significa, en fin de cuentas, la negacion al dialogo y la cooperacion, el rompimiento total de estas relaciones y la provocacion de la guerra contra el Norte de Corea luego de desarmarlo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La banda de Lee Myung Bak, con su propia cabeza, debe abstenerse de acumular las culpas ante la nacion siguiendo al \"Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y de Comercio\", sirviente de EE.UU. y  acolito de la guerra."
