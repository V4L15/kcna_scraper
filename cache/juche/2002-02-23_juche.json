            "content": "DPRK delegate refers to peace-keeping activities\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 23 (KCNA)  A DPRK delegate addressing a meeting of the ad hoc committee on U.N. peace-keeping operations on Feb. 12 said that today's reality requires the peace-keeping activities to fulfil their mission and role before the international community and consistently adhere to their basic principles of activity in conformity with them. He referred to the following issues in this regard:\r\n Firstly, peace-keeping operations are necessary for ensuring international peace and security but it is most urgent to remove the root cause of all sorts of misfortune and clashes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This root cause is the way of thinking and the policy of confrontation in the era of the cold war. therefore, dominationism, hegemony and unilateralism, an expression of policy of showdown in international relations, should not be allowed and there should be no such practices as encouraging or instigating disputes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Secondly, it is also important for the U.N. to conduct peace-keeping operations in conformity with the principles and purpose of the U.N. charter and on the principles of respect for each country's sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is essential here is to conduct peace-keeping activities in such a way as to make substantial contributions to ensuring international peace and security to meet the expectation of the U.N. members. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thirdly, it is imperative to foil any attempt to achieve sinister political and military aims under the signboard of peace-keeping operations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the UN's 50 odd year-long history shows, its activities for international peace and security have been misused in many cases for the political and military purpose of invading specified countries and their consequences are still left. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean peninsula can be cited as a good example. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The delegate expressed his expectation that all the U.N. members would not allow the U.S. to abuse the sacred name and flag of the U.N. in South Korea any longer but pay due attention to putting an end to such practices.     \r\n\r\n"

This is a brigandish logic. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The further the U.S. moves to stifle the DPRK get intensified, the greater efforts the DPRK will exert to strengthen its revolutionary armed forces and consolidate the country's military position in every way. no one has the right to take issue with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is shameless and gangster-like act for the U.S. to threaten the DPRK with blatant aggression after interpreting its just measure as an evil action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is, indeed, an empire of evil. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose forces' frantic moves against the DPRK will only lead to a war.       If the U.S. ignites a war of aggression in Korea under an absurd pretext, it will not miss the chance to wipe out the aggressors to the last one on this land but achieve the cause of national reunification.     \r\n\r\n\r\n"
