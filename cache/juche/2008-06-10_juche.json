He set forth the tasks to be fulfilled by the sub-unit to further increase its combat capability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He took deep care of the living of the soldiers of the sub-unit as their real father would do, making the rounds of an education room, a bedroom, a mess hall, a kitchen, a  wash-cum-bathroom and an outdoor resting place and other places of the sub-unit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He appreciated the efforts made by the sub-unit, greatly satisfied to learn that it has successfully built entertainment, educational and supply service facilities by thoroughly applying the way the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Army managed its unit and its commanding officers, in particular, have taken utmost care of the living of its soldiers with paternal affection. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He enjoyed an art performance given by soldiers of a company of the sub-unit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  All soldiers of our People's Army are not only strong in faith and will but creators of noble and beautiful morality and culture and arts, he noted, stressing no force on earth can match these steel-strong elite ranks advancing, singing loudly songs of struggle and faith. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He had a photo session with the servicepersons of the sub-unit.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Under this situation the KPA cannot remain a passive onlooker to the above-said disturbing development, while abandoning its nuclear deterrence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA will never allow the U.S. to exploit the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula as a pretext for intensifying the moves for aggression against the DPRK and a fig-leaf for covering up them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Should the U.S. and the south Korean warlike forces persist in their moves for a war against the DPRK as now, the KPA will be left with no option but to further bolster all its war deterrents. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. conservative hardliners and the present south Korean rulers had better behave themselves, thinking twice about to what extent the daily aggravating military confrontation with the DPRK will drive the six-party talks, the DPRK-U.S. relations and the inter-Korean relations.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Paektu having powerful means for attack and defense and the whole country has turned into an invulnerable fortress as all the servicepersons and people are fully armed with the revolutionary soldier spirit, a spirit of not fearing any formidable enemy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The invincible might of the WPK's Songun policy has been fully displayed in reliably defending the peace on the Korean Peninsula and the security of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Korean Peninsula were other country and region, a war would have broken out there a hundred times.  It is entirely thanks to the Songun policy that peace has been preserved on the peninsula and the people in the north and the south have been able to lead a stable life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialist forces of aggression, fearful of the Songun policy, the banner for defending peace, dare not touch even a blade of grass and a single tree in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The invincible might of the WPK's Songun policy also finds its expression in the fact that it helps pave the way of independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The materialization of the idea of \"By our nation itself\" enshrined in the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration is guaranteed by the Songun policy. The great successes made by the fellow countrymen at home and abroad in the efforts to improve the inter-Korean relations and advance the movement for national reunification under the uplifted banner of \"By our nation itself\" over the past eight years would be unthinkable without the Songun policy, concludes the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Rivalry for Arctic Seabed Resources\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- A foreign ministers' meeting on the development of the resources of the Arctic Ocean was held on May 28 between Russia, the U.S., Canada, Norway and Denmark. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was the first ministerial meeting held at a time when the development of such natural resources as oil and natural gas has become realistic with the melting of the ice in the Arctic as a result of global warming. There was a heated debate on the development of the Arctic resources. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Observers foresee that the rivalry for the Arctic seabed resources will be screwed up to a new fever pitch as there is no comprehensive international pact on the issue of North Pole and the Arctic coastal countries are at loggerheads, claiming the right to develop the resources. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is by no means accidental. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Arctic is the smallest ocean in the world, but its seabed abounds in resources. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to data available, its oil deposits come somewhere around 250 billion barrels and its natural gas deposits around 8 billion cubic meters, respectively equivalent to 25 percent of the global oil deposits and 45 percent of the global natural gas deposits confirmed so far. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Interests of various countries are brought to a new intensity by the prospects that it will be \"a potential sea route\" linking the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans and turned into a large fishing ground under the effect of global warming. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is against this background that the Arctic coastal countries have plunged into the scramble for the resources of the ocean. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Russia has of late drawn a topographical map of the Arctic seabed to prove that 1.2 million square kilometers, or nearly a half of the Arctic area, could come within its exclusive economic zone. In August last year it put up its flag made of titanic alloy under the Arctic waters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On this basis, Russia is going to submit an application again to the United Nations to have the region as far as the Lomonosov seabed mountain range of the ocean recognized as its exclusive economic zone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is showing off its \"military presence in the Arctic\". In March last year it staged a joint war game dubbed \"Ice Exercise - 2007\" with British nuclear submarines in the ocean allegedly to \"familiarize\" the nuclear submarines to the Arctic  environment and thereby increase the capacity of operational support to the U.S. Pacific forces. And in September it sent a large ice-breaker attached to the U.S. coastal guard to the waters of the ocean under the pretext of \"drawing an Arctic topographical map\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has reinforced up-to-date military equipment including X short wave radar and underwater sonar in and around Alaska to watch scientific survey and military actions of Russia, Canada and other Arctic coastal countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Sweden sent an ice-breaker for the development of the Arctic and Canada is planning to launch a satellite capable of watching the Arctic waters while intensifying patrol there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile Japan and Germany, which are not Arctic coastal countries, are trying to worm themselves into the development of the Arctic resources. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Analysts say it is highly probable that the Arctic area will turn into \"a stage of a new Cold War\" for grabbing natural resources.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
