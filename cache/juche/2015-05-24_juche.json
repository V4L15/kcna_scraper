After looking at trophy banners, he said that there are so many banners, an indication that the corps has performed a lot of feats in combat and political training and sites of socialist construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Praising the unit for having built well the room for the education in the revolutionary history and the room devoted to its history, he noted that there may be advanced and backward units in other affairs but there should be no superior or inferior units in building ideological education base and conducting education through it. He called on it to let its service personnel deeply grasp the undying exploits President Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il performed by leading the army so that they may register shining successes in making combat preparations and bolstering up combat capabilities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He looked round the room for the study of military affair and operation command room before listening to the report on the unit's operation plan for defence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the unit is steadily increasing the capabilities of the commanding officers and its staff members to organize and command operation actions as intended by the party, he instructed them to put utmost spurs to rounding off combat preparations with the firm viewpoint and stand to be fully responsible for them before the party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that the unit has a very important duty to perform, he set forth important tasks which would serve as guidelines for increasing the unit's combat capability in every way. He gave precious instructions to spruce up the building of the command and thoroughly establish the method of commanding and managing the unit applied by the anti-Japanese guerillas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round the library and soldiers' hall of the unit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Underscoring the need to operate the soldiers' hall well, he said it is necessary for the revolutionaries to have the ideological and moral pabulum just as a man cannot live without food. He instructed the unit to direct efforts to strengthening the five-point education set forth by the party in order to train all the service persons as indomitable fighters who do not abandon their revolutionary faith unto their death.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round soldiers' room, room for education and mess hall of the company directly under the large combined unit to take warm care of their living.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He called for waging a dynamic drive to improve the soldiers' diet as supply service is important for rounding off the combat preparations. He instructed the unit to successfully cultivate vegetables and bean and, at the same time, organize the work for conducting well not only fisheries and stock breeding but also fish breeding.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He gave a pair of binoculars, machine gun and automatic rifle to the unit as gifts and had a significant photo session with service personnel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Learning that the soldiers on military duty were not able to take part in the photo session, he said he was reluctant to leave the unit, noting how regretful they must be. He showed such profound loving care for them as sparing time and inviting all of them to join in another photo session. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Hwang Pyong So and Jang Chang Hwa."

Korea\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, May 24 (KCNA) -- Five years have passed since matchless confrontational maniac and traitor Lee Myung Bak cooked up the \"May 24 step\", pushing the north-south ties into a phase of confrontation. \n\t\t\t\t\t The \"May 24 step\" was the anti-nation, anti-peace and anti-reunification one for escalating the confrontation with the compatriots in the north, an unprecedented one in light of the circumstances of its fabrication and the course of its implementation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters is Park Geun Hye and her party's argument that if it is to be lifted, there must be such \"responsible step\" as the north's \"admission\", \"apology\" and \"assurances for preventing recurrence\". They went the lengths of blustering that their stand is immutable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Policy Department of the DPRK National Defence Commission in a statement on Sunday clarified its principled stand as regards the \"May 24 step\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. The \"May 24 step\" is an undisguised denial of the historic June 15 joint declaration, the achievement common to the nation, and its action program the October 4 declaration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTraitor Lee Myung Bak and his party branded the June 15 era of reunification as a \"lost decade\" and blustered they will bring a \"decade of confrontation\" to freeze the compatriots' enthusiasm for reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This blustering was proved by the Cheonan warship sinking case and the \"May 24 step\" that ensued.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Five years have passed since then and the chief of the Chongwadae has also changed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the May 24 step remains a cancer-like entity, blocking the improved relations between the north and the south, spoiling the national concord and unity and escalating the confrontation and tension.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis clearly shows that Park Geun Hye and her party are just as same as Lee Myung Bak.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. The \"May 24 step\" is a measure for confrontation that was fabricated under the pretext of the sinking of warship \"Cheonan\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe step based on fabrication can not but be a measure for confrontation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Availing ourselves of this opportunity, we'd like to urge with courtesy Park and her party as follows:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If they have any ground with which they can prove the DPRK's responsibility for the sinking case, they should respond to its demand to jointly look into the case in the eyes of the whole nation and the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There would be no excuse whatsoever for them to decline our demand, if they are not afraid.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The investigation into the truth will be easier as the hull of Cheonan warship which had been broken into two parts was salvaged and placed on the land.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We still keep a powerful inspection group of the DPRK NDC ready to get down to joint investigation into the case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If Park and her party turn down this just demand of the DPRK, that will only be their admission of the case as their own farce. The \"May 24 step\" should, therefore, be naturally lifted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 3. The ill-famed \"May 24 step\" is a product of political intrigues which should be thrown into a dumping ground of history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The step is a product of political swindles against the nation, reunification and peace which no one wants, and the biggest trouble of all the Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Hye and her party should admit before the whole nation the crimes against fellow countrymen they committed by clinging to the \"May 24 step\" and throw it away into a dumping ground of history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They talk nonsense such as \"dialogue first and lift of the step next\", only revealing their cynical ploy to push the the north-south dialogue to another theatre of confrontation. But this is just a waste of time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The people from all walks of life in south Korea should rise up as one in the nationwide struggle to have the \"May 24 step\" lifted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The great turn and avenue to the improvement of the north-south relations depend on the lifting of the step."
