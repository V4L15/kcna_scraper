Rodong Sinmun Friday says this in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: The north and the south should make tireless and sincere efforts for substantially developing the north-south relations in order to consolidate the successes achieved in the efforts to carry out the cause of national reunification and positively promote the present reality.\r\n What is most urgent is to put an end to all face-saving practices in the north-south relations and take measures to substantially promote national reconciliation and unity, guided by the spirit of \"By our nation itself,\" the matter earnestly discussed at the 16th inter-Korean ministerial talks and clarified in its joint press release. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north-south relations can be the genuine ones between compatriots and all problems can be solved smoothly only when the north and the south recognize and respect each other. This matter presents itself as a more urgent one because there exist differing ideologies and systems in the north and the south and both sides are not willing to give up theirs. Any side's denial of the other side's ideology and system would only trigger off confrontation and make it impossible to expect any improvement in the inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This being a hard reality, south Korea is not yet free from such consciousness of confrontation as refusing to recognize the system in the north and rejecting it, insisting on its ideology, system and ism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a matter of fact, the ultra-right conservative forces in south Korea including the Grand National Party are now openly painting the north as their \"principal enemy,\" invoking the \"National Security Law,\" to lay a stumbling block in the way of the process to warm up the north-south relations and promote the reunification movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now is the time for south Korea to stop rejecting and antagonizing the north and make a bold decision to scrap the outdated laws and institutional mechanisms such as the \"NSL\" inciting the inter-Korean confrontation. To do so is a proper attitude toward the issue of the north-south relations and a true stand to work for the nation and reunification. Maintaining this approach and stand alone would make it possible to substantially develop the north-south relations as required by the era of \"By our nation itself\" and desired by all Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans in the north and the south and overseas sincerely hope that the inter-Korean relations will develop more substantially in the spirit of \"By our nation itself\" and follow their prospect with deep concern.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
