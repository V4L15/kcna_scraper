            "content": "Spokesman of DPRK FM on Implementation of DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 17 (KCNA) -- We strongly demand Japan settle, first of all, such serious human rights abuses as the Japanese imperialists' massacre of over one million Koreans, forcible drafting of more than 8.4 million Koreans and forcing at least 200,000 Korean women into sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army during their colonial rule over Korea, in line with the basic spirit of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration, said a spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry in a statement issued on Tuesday one year after the publication of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration.\r\n The statement goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration was adopted thanks to the magnanimity shown by the DPRK to establish new DPRK-Japan relations in a forward-looking manner regardless of all sentiments and reality as the Japanese prime minister visited the DPRK for the first time in history to officially apologize for Japan's crime-woven past and express his will to settle it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The bilateral relations finally greeted a turning phase of their improvement with the publication of the declaration as a momentum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But, regretfully, the review of the past one year indicates that the present bilateral relations are much worse than those before the declaration was published. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the supervision of the government authorities steps are being taken in Japan to internationalize the nuclear issue and the issue of abduction and substantial sanctions are applied against the DPRK to strangle it economically. Rackets aimed to suppress the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, a dignified overseas compatriots organization of the DPRK, are becoming more undisguised. The Japanese authorities have taken one measure after another to increase their military capacity in a bid to launch overseas aggression under the pretext of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities are making much fuss about the issue of abduction of a few Japanese, although they have not probed the truth behind hideous human rights abuses Japan committed against the Koreans in the past and compensated for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the abduction issue is concerned, it is an abnormal isolated case that occurred against the backdrop of persistent hostile relations between the DPRK and Japan and the Koreans' bitter anti-Japanese sentiment caused by the successive Japanese authorities' refusal to redeem their past and their persistent pursuance of hostile policy toward the DPRK. This issue, however, has already been settled during the Japanese prime minister's Pyongyang visit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This notwithstanding, Japan is asserting that it will establish diplomatic relations with the DPRK only after this issue is solved. This reminds one of an assailant putting up \"conditionality for reconciliation\" before a victim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already known, the basic spirit of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration is for both countries to settle unhappy past and, on this basis, solve pending issues and establish fruitful political, economic and cultural relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The master key to the implementation of the declaration is for Japan to settle its past in view of the historic background against which the declaration was adopted and its basic spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should opt for redeeming its past. It should probe the truth about incidents on a case-by-case basis and disclose them, apologize to the victims and their bereaved families separately and fully compensate for its crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This comes as an indispensable precondition for the normalization of bilateral relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The future improvement of bilateral relations will depend entirely on whether this issue is solved or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Invariable is the DPRK's will to implement the declaration to the last. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is how sincerely Japan would come out to implement it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan does not come out with a sincere attitude in the basic spirit of the declaration it will also be difficult for the DPRK to implement the declaration.    \r\n\r\n"

This made it possible for the DPRK to actively contribute to developing its friendly and cooperative ties with many countries on the principle of mutual respect for sovereignty, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefits, strengthening the activities and role of the UN and defending the world peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has made principled assertions and demands and conducted energetic activities to protect its sovereignty and interests on the U.N. forum and ensure that international issues are properly settled on the principle of international justice and impartiality and in conformity with the norms governing the international relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such efforts of the DPRK had a positive impact on the activities of the UN and the fair solution to international issues and enjoyed support and sympathy from many UN member countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK as a member country will as ever respect the UN Charter, sincerely implement its international commitment and encourage the UN to fulfil its duty and mission. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson in a signed article says that the DPRK will fulfill its duty in line with the UN Charter.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Assails Anti-Chongryon Campaign \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 17 (KCNA) -- The Japanese reactionaries are viciously cracking down on the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) and Koreans in Japan.\r\n The Tokyo Metropolitan Administration recently imposed taxes on the facilities of the central headquarters of Chongryon including the property tax and has gone through the procedures to seize them on charge of non-payment. Such threatening telephone calls as \"explosives have been laid at organs of Chongryon\" in Tokyo Metropolis frequently came to the head office of the newspaper Asahi Shimbun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This was part of the dastardly terrorism committed against the backdrop of the mounting atmosphere hostile to the DPRK and Chongryon and criminal acts to block the patriotic activities of the officials of Chongryon and Koreans in Japan and stamp out their democratic rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already known, there were frequent acts against Chongryon such as laying of explosives and firing bullets at organs of Chongryon, mud-slinging and violence against officials of Chongryon and children of Koreans in Japan and unjust economic measures against the Chongryon-related facilities even after the adoption of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration in September last year in which both sides promised each other not to do any actions threatening each other's security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n July and August alone witnessed hideous terrorism in which explosives were laid and shots were fired at organs of Chongryon and national financial institutions of Koreans in Japan in different parts of Japan including Niigata, Fukuoka and Okayama, and different local self-government bodies reexamined or revoked the measure of exempting Chongryon-related facilities from paying property taxes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These acts, a product of Japan's anti-DPRK and anti-Chongryon hostile policy, perpetrated in different parts of Japan clearly indicate that the Japanese reactionaries' moves to destroy Chongryon by all means and methods have been carried into extremes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Explicitly speaking, there is neither reason nor pretext for the Japanese reactionaries to persecute and suppress Chongryon and the Koreans in Japan as it is a dignified overseas compatriots organization of the DPRK and they are its proud citizens. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the light of the historical background against which many Koreans were forcibly taken to Japan during the Japanese imperialists' military occupation of Korea and in view of the present situation where the Koreans in Japan are subject to all sorts of national insult and discriminations they should be duly protected by law and accorded special treatment by the Japanese government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the Japanese reactionaries' reckless suppression of Koreans in Japan are getting more and more undisguised under the tacit protection, connivance and encouragement of the Japanese authorities. This arouses the DPRK's serious concern. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will never forgive the Japanese authorities, who have not taken any measures or legal steps to prevent the anti-DPRK and anti-Chongryon acts of the right-wing reactionaries, talking about what they called \"people's feelings\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities should drop its hostile policy toward the DPRK and immediately take relevant measures to prevent the recurrence of hostile acts against Chongryon.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Nine years have passed, but the U.S. has gone back on its promise. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is natural for north Korea to resume the building of the nuclear power plant when the U.S. stopped supplying heavy oil to it in December last year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is keeping many planes and submarines loaded with nukes around the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the recent six-way talks in Beijing, the U.S. declared that it would not hold any negotiation before north Korea took a practical step of physically dismantling its nuclear program \"verifiably and irreversibly.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rightist media shut their mouths to the fact that the U.S. has deployed a lot of nukes in East Asia to render the situation strained in the region while making much ado about the self-defensive will of north Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

All this is a shining fruition of  Kim Jong Il's best idea, leadership and virtue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Inexhaustible is the united strength of the Korean nation.
