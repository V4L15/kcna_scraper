As the number of the copies of the book could not meet the readers' demand, many students and other young people copied its full text to read it avidly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The president wrote in his reminiscences \"with the century\" that it was something astonishing to write such book in Seoul ridden with political confusion and disorder after the liberation of the country.     \r\n\r\n"

This naturally raises a question as to whether the South Korean authorities have a true will to have dialogue and cooperation with the north and develop the inter-Korean relations or not. \r\n The South Korean authorities are to blame for Choe's reckless remarks. If such anti-reunification element as Choe is allowed to remain in office, he will not be of any help to national unity and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean authorities should clarify their stand on whether they need the sycophantic traitor more than the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration.
