            "content": "Firmly adhering to idea of attaching great importance to science \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Pyongyang, July 4 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun, the organ of the Central Committee of the Worker's Party of Korea (WPK), and Kulloja, the political and theoretical magazine of the WPK Central Committee, published a joint article titled \"Let us build powerful nation, firmly adhering to the idea of attaching great importance to science\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Rodong Sinmun today dedicates one whole page to the article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The idea of attaching great importance to science is a strategic line of building a prosperous and powerful nation which the WPK has brought into limelight, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The WPK is a revolutionary party relying on science.  The essence of the WPK's idea of attaching great importance to science is to give definite precedence to science and technology in the revolution and construction, channel utmost efforts into them and solve all the issues arising in the building of socialism in reliance upon them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The great leader Kim Jong Il said that in order to rapidly develop the country it is necessary to attach great importance to science and give precedence to the development of science, and giving priority to the development of science is a state policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This idea calls for giving definite precedence to science in order to take a firm grip on science and technology in any adversity and an idea of making a bold and ambitious scientific revolution to bring the nation's science and technology to the world's level at the earliest possible date, the article says, and stresses: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the DPRK, there will not happen in the future, too, such things as abandoning the line of attaching great importance to science and technology while seeking immediate gains and being keen on the fulfillment of pressing economic tasks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK's cause of building a powerful nation is bound to be crowned with victory as it is guaranteed by science and technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The powerful socialist country which we are building means a country powerful in science and technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is necessary to develop science and technology by all means so as to solve the problem of food and build an economically powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Science and technology alone paves the only right way to live on one's own. This is a precious truth the Korean people have learned through an arduous struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The development of science and technology is an important work to resolutely smash the imperialists' moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK and thus firmly defend the sovereignty of the nation, and a work of eternal value for the future development of our nation and the everlasting prosperity of the generations to come. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The WPK, considerate of the future destiny of the country and nation, has boosted scientifically backward fields one by one and developed all spheres of science from basic science to space science. This shows its will to take responsibility for the destiny of the nation to the last. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people will never repeat their bitter history of a colonial backward country as they are firmly adhering to the great idea of giving great importance to science and technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK has strong ideology and army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If we rapidly develop science and technology, our country will surely reach a high eminence of a powerful country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The rapid scientific and technological development in the DPRK is firmly guaranteed by the respected leader Kim Jong Il's politics of giving great importance to science, the article says, adding that the Korean people are looking forward to the bright future of the Juche-oriented science and technology thanks to his politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The factor of steady development of Korea's science and technology lies in the inexhaustible might of the Korean style socialist system. A bright prospect of science and technology is surely guaranteed by strong scientific and technological forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the desire and militant spirit of the Korean people to vigorously advance towards progress and prosperity without the slightest stagnation and marking time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The article calls on the people to scale the high peak of a powerful nation depending on science and technology in the 21st century and demonstrate the dignity of the country and the nation to the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Underlining the need to develop science and technology our own way, the article says that our own way means Juche-style and a treasured sword which makes it possible to achieve the rapid development of science and technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The article continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe establishment of Juche will help gain actual profits in the development of science and technology: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We should concentrate efforts on the solution of urgent scientific and technological problems in building a powerful nation and thus fully settle the problems of food and clothing, keep production at a high rate and improve land administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We should earnestly learn from the scientific and technological successes made in various countries around the world and widely introduce them and rapidly develop the up-to-date science and technology such as electronics and bio-engineering to suit the trend of the modern scientific and technological progress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Our scientists and technicians are faced with very important tasks to bring the nation's science and technology to the world's advanced level as early as possible. The qualifications of scientists and technicians should be raised and many world famous inventors and scientists produced to implement the tasks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The article underscores the need to establish the spirit of giving great importance to science and technology in the whole society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The upcoming 21st century will be a century of great national prosperity in which the Korean people will scale a high peak of a scientifically and technologically strong nation by displaying the strength built up for over 50 years under the guidance of the party and the leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Final victory is in store for the Korean people holding fast to science and technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The cause of building a powerful nation will be achieved without fail as long as there are the guidance of the great Kim Jong Il, the most correct line of giving great importance to science, a large contingent of scientists and technicians loyal to the party and the leader and revolutionary people, the article concludes. \r\n\r\n"

He highly praised them for giving an inspiring performance fully reflecting their lives and sentiments in the program. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHaving women revolutionaries like families of servicemen, the cause of the Korean revolution is bound to triumph, he added. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Line of simultaneously carrying on building up of economy and defenses \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 4 (KCNA) -- The Worker's Party of Korea put forth a new strategic policy of simultaneously carrying on the building up of economy and defenses at the fifth plenary meeting of the 4th Central Committee of the WPK held in December, Juche 51 (1962). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At that time the U.S. imperialists sparked the Caribbean crisis against the Republic of Cuba and escalated their war of aggression in Vietnam. They further intensified their moves for a war of aggression against the DPRK, frantically stepping up preparations for a new war in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Under that situation the WPK put up the militant slogan \"A rifle in one hand and a sickle or hammer in the other\" and called on all the people to vigorously push ahead with the socialist economic construction while increasing defence capability of the country . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   After the plenary meeting the WPK decided to exert great efforts for the building of national defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean People's Army (KPA) energetically conducted the work to turn the entire army into a cadre army and modernize the whole army. As a result, the KPA grew strong and developed to be a-match-for-a-hundred cadre army fully prepared politically and ideologically and in military technique and invincible revolutionary armed forces equipped with powerful offensive and defensive means. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The gigantic work of placing all the people under arms and turning the whole country into a fortress, was successfully carried out. All the people were thus versed in military knowledge and tactics necessary for waging a modern war and strong defenses were built in all parts of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The WPK also vigorously pushed forward the economic construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In order to accelerate the socialist industrialization in economic construction, the party took measures to increase the production by making a more effective use of economic foundations already laid, while making preparations and creating conditions for expanding and strengthening the heavy industrial base. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Steps were taken to further readjust and reinforce the heavy industry and thus produce and supply in time machines and equipment necessary for the development of light industry, agriculture and fishing industry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It also paid a deep attention to keeping the capital construction going, boosting transport and developing science and technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It was thanks to the WPK's line of simultaneously carrying on the building up of economy and defenses that the DPRK could achieve an independent development with its own strong defence and economic forces. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan should feel ashamed of remaining \"enemy state\" \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Pyongyang, July 4 (KCNA) -- Japan can shake off the disgrace of being an \"enemy state\" and become a dignified member of the international community enjoying its confidence only when it fully redresses its crime-woven past and starts with a clean sheet, says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Although a half century has passed since the end of World War II, Japan has not yet shaken off the disgrace of an \"enemy state\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   To get rid of this disgrace means making its new appearance in the international community. This entirely depends on what efforts the country concerned exerts to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan should consider it as its bitterest shame to remain an \"enemy state\" and honestly work to get rid of the disgrace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   First of all, it should admit its crimes committed in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan describes its past aggression of Asia as an operation to \"protect and liberate\" the Asian people from big powers trying to expand the sphere of influence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan's wrong viewpoint and attitude toward its past crimes find expression in its efforts to evade the compensation for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If Japan is to win recognition and confidence from the international community, it should compensate for its past crimes. In other words, it should take measures to pay material compensation of which the assailant can convince the victim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan still remains an \"enemy state\" enjoying neither support nor understanding from the world people because it has not taken any measure for compensation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Failing to judge how the world sees Japan as it is overcome with joy, it seeks the position of a political power commensurate with its status as an economic power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If Japan goes on as now the world people's bad feelings and impression of it will remain unchanged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan's any delay in admitting and redressing its crime-woven past will only increase people's caution against Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan should clearly see this and redress its past as early as possible. \r\n\r\n"
