On this basis, the U.S. worked out a variety of operation plans for attacking the DPRK with nukes and is putting them into practice. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. stages every year joint military drills under various codenames including Foal Eagle and Ulji Freedom Guardian with south Korea. Means for a nuclear war huge enough to carry out a war are involved in the drills. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In its \"nuclear posture review\" the U.S. listed the DPRK as a target of preemptive nuclear attack and worked out even a war scenario calling for the use of nukes against the DPRK in case of \"contingency\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean people have been exposed to the biggest nuclear threat of the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Had not the Korean people have access to nuclear deterrence under such situation, how miserable their destiny would have been and what dangerous phase the situation on the Korean Peninsula would have reached. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. nuclear threat is making all Koreans nuclear hostages and the DPRK's line of simultaneously developing the two fronts is the most righteous one for defusing the nuclear war threats on the Korean Peninsula and reliably ensuring peace and security of the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A war is deterred on the peninsula and peace and security have been preserved in the Asia-Pacific region thanks to the DPRK's nuclear deterrence which is physically checking the war moves of the U.S. and its followers. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those who do not know about this are either politically blind ones ignorant of the law of the world or traitors leaving all the interests of the nation to the tender mercy of outsiders. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No interests would be thinkable apart from national sovereignty and vital rights. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The servants of the outsiders' nuclear campaign would be well advised to face up to the trend of the times and stop at once their despicable acts of treachery."
