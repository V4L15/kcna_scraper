He led the people to build an independent machine-building industry remaining unaffected by any fluctuation, after putting up the slogan \"Iron And The Machine Are The King Of Industry\"   as a result, tractors, trucks, bulldozers and cranes were produced in a matter of five years after the war which were followed by the manufacture of an 8-meter turning lathe and electric locomotive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The president wrought such a miracle as a machine begetting a new machine and a factory begetting another factory, smashing all sorts of mysticism about technique. As a result, the industrialization of the country was realized in a matter of 14 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was thanks to this independent and modern machine-building industry that the Korean people could successfully manufacture machines and equipment requiring up-to-the-minute technology and launch a satellite even in the period of the \"Arduous March\" and the forced march, thus demonstrating the tremendous might of the state.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"
