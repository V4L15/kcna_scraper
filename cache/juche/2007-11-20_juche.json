But the treaty had no signature of the King and seal of the state. So it was a mere sheet of paper without any binding force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the Japanese imperialists got the \"agreement\" of the five traitors of 1905 including Ri Wan Yong and committed the lawless act of declaring the \"conclusion of the Treaty\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The indelible crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists were glaringly exposed to the world by an autograph letter of King Kojong which was found in the library of Columbia University of the U.S. in 1993. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the letter he stated he, as the King, did not mandate ministers to sign the \"Ulsa Five-point Treaty\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After faking up the \"treaty\" by military threat and blackmail and fraud and swindling, the Japanese imperialists rigged up the \"Treaty of Annexation of Korea by Japan\" in order to \"legalize\" it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They wrote a \"petition for annexation\" and made the \"Iljin Association\", a pro-Japanese organization, present it to the Japanese reactionary government and the Korean government in December 1909. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Letting loose the insolent jargon that \"power is necessary for annexation\", they threatened Korean ministers and fabricated the \"annexation treaty\" on August 22, 1910, thus totally putting the feudal state of Ri Dynasty out of existence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the strength of the forged \"treaties\" the Japanese imperialists reduced Korea to their colony and inflicted immeasurable mental and material damage on the Korean people for 40-odd years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the Japanese reactionaries deny altogether their past crimes against the Korean people and persistently attempt to evade their responsibility till now. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of Korea will surely settle the past crimes of Japan which left on the Koreans wounds which can never be healed.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Flunkeyism and the idea of depending on outsiders are ideas as harmful as poison as they make the nation subservient and weak and do great harm to the cause of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when all the Koreans in the north and the south and overseas resolutely oppose and reject flunkeyism and dependence on outsiders with transparent spirit of national independence can they independently solve the reunification problem of the country to meet their will and interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are directly responsible for the movement for national reunification. So, only when they strengthen the driving force for reunification united close under the banner of the great national unity, can they decisively frustrate the moves of anti-reunification forces at home and abroad and dynamically advance the movement for independent reunification. All the fellow countrymen in the north and the south and overseas are full of firm determination and will to pool their intention and strength to defend peace on this land and achieve the reunification of the country and national prosperity and development.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a very dangerous military move to round off its preparations for overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday observes this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aim sought by Japan through the above-said joint military exercise was to boost the capability of its \"Self-Defense Forces\" to fight an actual battle and get them familiar with overseas operations for aggression under diverse circumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By building the missile defense system (MD) the Japanese reactionaries seek to increase Japan's capability for mounting preemptive missile attacks on the DPRK and other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The moves for the MD pushed forward by Japan in collusion with the U.S. have entered such practical phase as joint development and deployment of new-type missiles and the moves to boost capability for missile strike after going beyond the phase of research. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the goal of Japan to rank itself among military powers and conduct high-handed military actions in different parts of the world under the pretext of \"making a contribution to world peace\". With nothing can the Japanese militarist forces hide their sinister criminal design to pave the way for overseas aggression by zealously backing and joining the U.S. in its \"war against terrorism\" under the pretext of military cooperation with it. The Japanese reactionaries are making desperate efforts to turn their country into a military giant and launch overseas aggression in a bid to realize at any cost their old dream of \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\" which they failed to do in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The reckless moves of the Japanese reactionaries for militarization are escalating the tension in Northeast Asia and putting the peace and security there at grave peril, warns the commentary.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"
