            "content": "Kim Jong Il Provides Field Guidance to Fruit Farm\r\n Pyongyang, July 21 (KCNA) -- Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army Kim Jong Il, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK, provided field guidance to the Taedonggang Combined Fruit Farm rebuilt on an expansion basis and the newly built Taedonggang Combined Fruit Processing Factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t The first leg of his guidance was the Taedonggang Combined Fruit Farm. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The builders worked such astonishing miracles as completing the project for expanding the capacity in a short span of time, which is tantamount to a grand nature-harnessing project and successfully built an apple tree nursery covering 50 hectares, in particular, thereby establishing a fruit tree sapling production system based on tissue culture. This made it possible to lay a firm foundation to produce and ensure fruit tree saplings by itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After being briefed on the newly built Taedonggang Pig Farm, the Taedonggang Turtle Farm and the Taedonggang Net Factory newly built in the area of the Taedonggang Combined Fruit Farm before a huge map showing its panoramic view, he went round various places of the farm including the Taedonggang Apple Tree Nursery to acquaint himself in detail with the construction and fruit cultivation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The construction of such large-scale fruit farm as the Taedonggang Combined Fruit Farm is a great project which can be undertaken only under the socialist system of the DPRK which regards collectivism as its life and soul, he said, adding: Great, indeed, is the mental power of the army and the people of the DPRK singly-mindedly united around their party and leader.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the farm is a great structure suited to the appearance of the new century, he said: The appearance of the country is changing day by day thanks to the dynamic drive for a great surge across the country and this remarkable change confidently heralds a bright future of a powerful nation to appear in the near future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The combined farm is a model farm of weighty significance not only in supplying fruits to the people but also in developing the nation's fruit farming on a modern basis, he said, putting forward the important tasks facing the factory and the farm.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to increase the fertility of soil in the orchards of the farm it is necessary to make an effective use of circular production system of fruit growing and stock breeding, stock breeding and fruit growing, he noted, underlining the need to revitalize the management of the Taedonggang Pig Farm and apply more organic compound fertilizers to orchards.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Relevant units should pay deep attention to the Taedonggang Combined Fruit Farm as it is an important farm conducive to improving the diet of the people, he said, calling on them to ensure the production and supply of sufficient quantities of equipment and raw materials including machines, agricultural chemicals and fertilizers needed in the farm.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The next leg of his guidance was the Taedonggang Combined Processing Factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The Factory covering 49 000 square meters is a modern and combined producer of processed fruits. It is capable of annually producing tens of thousands of tons of processed fruits including varieties of juice, cider, jam, liquor, vinegar, perfume, shampoo and rinse by enriching fruits such as apple, pear, peach and strawberry.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a great success that the soldier-builders, workers of the factory and their helpers have successfully built in a brief span of time the modern and combined fruit processing factory desired by people, he said, expressing great satisfaction over the fact that they have built another  model factory representing the era of Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He noted that the factory has been built at the best level of quality and is equipped with the latest technical facilities. He said with confidence that the experience eloquently proves that when officials thoroughly apply the Party's idea of attaching importance to science and technology with a high sense of the Party spirit, the revolutionary spirit and the serve-the-people spirit and steadily create something new, boldly getting rid of the ready-made conception, they can bring all the fields including the foodstuff industry to the highest level in a short span of time and effect a radical turn in improving the standard of people's living.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The important task facing the factory is to boost the production of varieties of processed fruits helpful to improving the standard of people's living by use of the newly laid production foundation and ensure their quality and hygienic security, he noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He repeatedly praised all the builders and their helpers who carried out the project for expanding the capacity of the Taedonggang Combined Fruit Farm and the construction of the Taedonggang Combined Fruit Processing Factory for their great contributions to the sacred drive for the prosperity of the country and extended thanks to them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by senior officials of the party and armed forces  Kim Jong Un, Ri Yong Ho, Kim Ki Nam, Choe Thae Bok, Jang Song Thaek, Kim Jong Gak, Kim Yong Il, Kim Yang Gon, Pak To Chun, Choe Ryong Hae, Thae Jong Su, Kim Phyong Hae, Mun Kyong Dok, Ju Kyu Chang, U Tong Chuk and Kim Chang Sop, Members of the Central Military Commission of the WPK Kim Kyong Ok, Kim Won Hong, Kim Yong Chol and Yun Jong Rin and Department Director of the NDC Hyon Chol Hae."
