            "content": "Review of six months after adoption of June 15 inter-Korean joint declaration \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 15 (KCNA) -- Six months after the historic Pyongyang meeting and the publication of the north-south joint declaration evidently show who, in Korea, truly hopes for reconciliation, unity, peace and reunification and has been faithful to the joint declaration and who has been seeking to bring the inter-Korean relations back to confrontation, going against the declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is stressed in an article titled \"Nothing can stop nation's advance towards 21st century, century of independence and reunification\" published six months after the adoption of the declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the past six months the North Korea has made all its possible efforts with sincerity to smoothly implement the agreed points clarified in the inter-Korean joint declaration. But, some political quarters of the south have engaged themselves in the moves to put the brake on its implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Citing facts to fully disclose such frantic moves they made to bring the north-south relations back to the state of confrontation while opposing the historic Pyongyang meeting and denying the joint declaration, it further says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From the very day the issue of Pyongyang meeting was high on the agenda they dismissed it as \"premature\" or a deed of getting involved in the north's \"tactics for united front.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWhen the June 15 joint declaration was adopted they denied it, asserting that it means the south has given in and played into the north's hands. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such obstructive moves were manifested more saliently in hamstringing the basic spirit of the meeting and the declaration. As soon as the declaration was published they made much ado about nothing. They desperately rejected it and more zealously called for \"permanent presence of the U.S. forces\" and close \"cooperation in security\" and \"cooperation system\" with their masters. And they further strengthened the political and military ties with outsiders while staging with the United States large-scale joint military exercises such as \"Ulji Focus Lens\" and \"Foal Eagle\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some quarters in South Korea also denied the provision of the joint declaration on reunifying the country by federal and confederal formulas. Arguing that acceptance of the north's lower stage of federation means concession of the \"liberal-democratic system,\" they have held that this reunification formula should never be accepted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The separatists including the right-wing conservative forces of South Korea threw obstacles in the way of smooth progress of dialogue, contacts, cooperation and exchange between the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They blocked for no reason visits and contacts between political parties and organizations and figures from all walks of life of the north and the south. As far as the inter-Korean economic cooperation is concerned, they asserted that \"it is just like paying tribute to the north\" and \"the principle of reciprocity should be maintained.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They made it difficult to properly solve such humanitarian issues as the reunion between separated families and relatives by staging a money offensive aimed to incite confrontation between the two systems and destabilize the other side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They put up various conditions even on mutual aid between fellow countrymen in a bid to block it under the pretext of \"transparency.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The right-wing conservative forces of South Korea regard the people in the north not as compatriots but as an \"enemy.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They defined the north as the \"principal enemy\" again in a recent \"white paper on national defence.\" This was an unpardonable provocation to the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Moreover, anti-north meeting and \"signature campaign\" took place in the center of Seoul. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north and the south should not take any different approach to the implementation of the June 15 joint declaration, the charter of the nation and the great program for independence and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And the ruling and opposition parties and the progressive and conservative forces should not differ from each other in this aspect. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The inter-Korean relations and the issue of reunification related to the destiny of the nation should not be used by any party as a plaything in a political scramble under any circumstances, nor should be an object of jealousy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the inter-Korean relations go back to the state of confrontation, there will be no way to restore them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No one can block the advance of the Korean nation toward the 21st century, a century of independence and reunification. \r\n\r\n"

The world history of politics for the 20th century knows no other great men than them who have conducted energetic activities for the country and the people, and national sovereignty and dignity, he said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The independent politics of the DPRK was provided by Kim Il Sung and is being consolidated and glorified by Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The matchless grit of Kim Jong Il with which to allow no infringement upon national sovereignty and dignity even under the pressure and blockade of the allied forces of imperialists gained much favour in many countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK, led by Kim Jong Il, great master of independent politics, will further shine as a bulwark of socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The independent politics is firmly guaranteed by powerful national defence capacity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il is leading the revolution and construction to victory with his army-first politics of strengthening defence power and giving greater prominence to the army as the pillars of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality of the DPRK which is winning victory after victory in political, ideological and military confrontation with the imperialists evidently shows that the army-first politics is a treasured sword for defending socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As long as the Korean people and people's army are led by Kim Jong Il's superb army-first politics, they will as always emerge victorious and build a powerful socialist state without fail. \r\n\r\n"

This behavior of the U.S. deserves denunciation as it is a manifestation of its arrogant great power chauvinism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. also hurt the dignity of the South Korean people as far as the massacres of civilians in Rogun-ri are concerned. An investigation team of the U.S. defense department, while admitting the mass killings, is going to conclude that they were not perpetrated by order from the superior but occurred by accident in confusion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. clinches the mass killings as \"accidental cases that occurred without any order from the superior\" in a bid to evade state responsibility, it will trigger off protest and indignation of not only the victims of mass killings in Rogun-ri but all other people. Such unequal relations between the U.S. and South Korea can no longer go on. \r\n\r\n"
