Many media commented that north Korea called on the U.S. to conclude a peace treaty for peace on the Korean Peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Thursday observes in a commentary that there is no country which does not bring the issue of peace on the peninsula up for discussion if it is interested in the Asia-Pacific.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In fact, it is more than once that the situation on the peninsula reached the danger of world nuclear disaster due to military provocations committed in this region, a strategic point in which the interests of world nuclear powers are intertwined and the biggest nuclear arsenal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No other area in the world has so dense deployment of huge strategic nuclear forces as south Korea which witnesses provocative saber-rattling including joint military exercises almost everyday.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is entirely thanks to the DPRK's nuclear deterrence that peace has been preserved on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has to opt for concluding a peace treaty with the DPRK if it truly hopes for the improvement of relations with the DPRK and peace on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By origin, the Armistice Agreement was premised on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The replacement of the AA by a peace treaty is a priority issue for peace. This is self-evident. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts prove that the discussion of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is unrealistic and the conclusion of a peace treaty is an urgent task.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should no longer make far-fetched assertions that the denuclearization comes first while rendering the situation on the peninsula tense through ever more undisguised military provocations but make a bold decision to conclude the peace treaty at an early date."
