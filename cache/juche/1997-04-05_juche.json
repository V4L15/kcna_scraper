But only the Kim Young Sam group are desperately trying to check the improvement of the DPRK-U.S. ties. of late top officials have flown to south Korea one after another from the U.S. for \"accomodation\".

We love peace and want no war. But if the south Korean puppets start a war against the DPRK in alliance with the U.S., we will annihilate them.
