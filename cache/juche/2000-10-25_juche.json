            "content": "Japanese Prime Minister's claim to Tok islet assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 25 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Korean Democratic Lawyers Association (KDLA) in a statement issued today accused Japanese Prime Minister Mori of claiming that Tok islet, part of the inviolable territory of Korea, \"belongs to Japan.\" \r\n Drawing attention to Japan's intrusion into the territorial waters of Tok islet getting more frequent these days in the wake of Mori's reckless remarks, the spokesman says that where Tok islet belongs to is now indisputably clear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was the Korean nation who discovered the islet some 1,500 years back and used it as a base for eking out living. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was again Korea which took a measure to officially put the islet under its jurisdiction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Tok islet has been clearly marked as part of Korea's territory on foreign maps and on the map of Japan printed before its occupation of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KDLA bitterly denounces the reckless remarks of the Japanese Prime Minister and Japan's intrusion into Tok islet as a grave violation of the dignity and sovereignty of the Korean nation and as a deliberate act of disturbing the peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The attitude of the Japanese authorities towards Tok islet clearly shows their views, standpoint and stand on Korea and its nation. The claim to Tok islet raised by Japan instead of making compensation for its wrongs done against Korea in the past goes to clearly prove that though more than half a century has passed since Japan was forced to quit Korea, it is watching for an opportunity of reinvasion, still considering the Korean peninsula as the place where to realize its ambition for militarist overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will never tolerate such tragedy as allowing Japan to deprive the nation of its sovereignty and offering the inviolable territory of the country to it as a colony but force Japan to pay for all sorts of misfortune and pain imposed by the Japanese imperialists upon the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The spokesman demanded the Japanese chief executive apologize to the Korean nation for his irresponsible remarks and opt for Japan's honest settlement of its past as early as possible.    \r\n\r\n"

This is a manifestation of the revolutionary obligation in the common struggle against the imperialists, he said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a living example of proletarian internationalism that the Chinese party and government gave disinterested material aid and moral support to the Korean people in their fight against the imperialists' aggression even under the difficult conditions right after the People's Republic of China was founded. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The servicemen of the Chinese People's Volunteers came out to the Korean front and displayed unrivalled bravery and mass heroism in battles, sharing life and death with men and officers of the KPA in the same trench. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter expressed deep thanks to the Chinese party, government and people for helping at the cost of blood the Korean people in their just struggle and paid highest respects to the martyrs of the CPV on behalf of the Korean people and the servicemen of the KPA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Korea-China friendship has developed on good terms in the interests of the two peoples even under the changed situation, the reporter stressed, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historic visit of Kim Jong Il, the great leader of the Workers' Party of Korea and the Korean people, to the People's Republic of China in may is an epochal event in further strengthening and developing the Korea-China friendship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The participation of respected General Secretary Jiang Zemin in a banquet given at the DPRK embassy in Beijing to celebrate the 55th anniversary of the WPK recently shows that the Chinese party and government value the Korea-China friendship very much. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To consolidate and develop this friendship is the behests of the great leader Kim Il Sung and the invariable stand of the WPK and the DPRK government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We believe that Korea-China friendship will continue to consolidate and develop in the future, too, by the joint efforts of the two peoples. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Chinese people have achieved great successes in socialist modernization drive with Chinese characteristics under the leadership of the Communist Party of China led by respected Jiang Zemin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the achievements made by the Chinese people prove that the line and policy put forward by the Chinese party and government are just ones to suit the specific conditions of China. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We are very pleased to see everything going well  in China and heartily wish the Chinese people greater success in the socialist modernization drive and in the struggle for the reunification of the whole country under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A silk banner in the name of the Ministry of the People's Armed Forces of the DPRK was conveyed to Chi Haotian, head of the Chinese high-ranking military delegation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Embroidered on the silk banner were the flags of the DPRK and China and letters \"Long live the militant friendship and solidarity between the armies and peoples of Korea and China \"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Colonel general Chi Haotian, vice-chairman of the PRC central military commission, state councillor and Minister of National Defence, who is heading the Chinese high-ranking military delegation, made a speech at the rally. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the honor of participating in celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the Chinese people's volunteers' entry into the Korean front in the DPRK, he expressed sincere thanks and paid high tribute to Kim Jong Il, General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and Chairman of the National Defence Commission, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the fraternal Korean people and the army, on behalf of the government of the PRC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Chinese People's Volunteers, the people and army of Korea achieved victory that greatly startled the world by fighting shoulder to shoulder, he said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This victory was a common victory won by the peoples and armies of the two countries in frustrating the strong-arm policy and resisting aggression. It was a great victory recorded in the modern history of the world war in which the weak beat the strong and weak forces defeated stronger ones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt recorded a shining page in the human history of justice and progress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The victory carried weighty significance and had a great impact not only on China, Korea and the east but on the whole world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This victory foiled the vicious plots of the imperialists to stifle the new-born socialist countries, thus protecting the security of the two countries, defending the peace in the far east and the world and greatly inspiring the peoples of many countries of the world in their heroic struggle to win national independence and liberation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chi Haotian said that as a veteran of the Chinese people's volunteers he personally witnessed the warm care and sincere assistance given by President Kim Il Sung, the Korean party and government, the people and army of Korea to the officers and men of the CPV during the war and realized how dear the blood-sealed China-Korea friendship was and it was not so easy to achieve and defend peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In recent years the people and army of Korea united close around Kim Jong Il and the WPK have made new great successes that drew world attention despite the complicated international situation and several years of natural disasters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The traditional friendly and cooperative relations between China and the DPRK are now developing at a new stage and demonstrating their deep historic roots and great vitality thanks to the deep care of General Secretary Jiang Zemin and General Secretary Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He expressed firm conviction that the peoples of China and Korea would unite closer to record without fail a new chapter in the noble work to strengthen and develop the traditional friendship between the two countries and give impetus to peace and human progress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then, a silk banner in the name of the Chinese high-ranking military delegation was conveyed to Kim Il Chol. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Inscribed on the silk banner were the letters \"China-Korea friendship will be evergreen \"    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
