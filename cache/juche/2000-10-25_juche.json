            "content": "Japanese Prime Minister's claim to Tok islet assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 25 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Korean Democratic Lawyers Association (KDLA) in a statement issued today accused Japanese Prime Minister Mori of claiming that Tok islet, part of the inviolable territory of Korea, \"belongs to Japan.\" \r\n Drawing attention to Japan's intrusion into the territorial waters of Tok islet getting more frequent these days in the wake of Mori's reckless remarks, the spokesman says that where Tok islet belongs to is now indisputably clear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was the Korean nation who discovered the islet some 1,500 years back and used it as a base for eking out living. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was again Korea which took a measure to officially put the islet under its jurisdiction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Tok islet has been clearly marked as part of Korea's territory on foreign maps and on the map of Japan printed before its occupation of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KDLA bitterly denounces the reckless remarks of the Japanese Prime Minister and Japan's intrusion into Tok islet as a grave violation of the dignity and sovereignty of the Korean nation and as a deliberate act of disturbing the peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The attitude of the Japanese authorities towards Tok islet clearly shows their views, standpoint and stand on Korea and its nation. The claim to Tok islet raised by Japan instead of making compensation for its wrongs done against Korea in the past goes to clearly prove that though more than half a century has passed since Japan was forced to quit Korea, it is watching for an opportunity of reinvasion, still considering the Korean peninsula as the place where to realize its ambition for militarist overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will never tolerate such tragedy as allowing Japan to deprive the nation of its sovereignty and offering the inviolable territory of the country to it as a colony but force Japan to pay for all sorts of misfortune and pain imposed by the Japanese imperialists upon the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The spokesman demanded the Japanese chief executive apologize to the Korean nation for his irresponsible remarks and opt for Japan's honest settlement of its past as early as possible.    \r\n\r\n"
