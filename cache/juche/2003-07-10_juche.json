            "content": "KCNA flails bill on Japanese SDF's overseas dispatch to Iraq \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 9 (KCNA) -- The three ruling coalition parties of Japan at the special committee of the House of Representatives on July 3 reportedly railroaded a bill on dispatching the Japanese self-defence forces to Iraq under the pretext of \"supporting Iraq in its post-war rehabilitation\". The bill will be adopted as a law by the end of this month and the SDF troops will enter Iraq from this fall.\r\n This provided the Japanese reactionaries with a permanent legal guarantee for dispatching the SDF to any combat areas in the world and launching expansion overseas in real earnest so as to realize their old dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has always worked hard to launch expansion overseas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries have become more undisguised in their moves to provide a legislation for overseas aggression since the beginning of the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In October 2001 Japan adopted the \"law on special measure on terrorism\" and on may 15 this year it adopted three bills on \"emergency\", thus legalizing the SDF's participation in any war of overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan increased the SDF's capability for an actual war by sending it to several parts of the world, while laying a framework for its overseas dispatch. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In 1992 it sent the SDF to Cambodia under the pretext of protecting election observers and in 1994 to Rwanda and after the September 11 incident to Afghanistan, East Timor and other countries expanding the sphere of its activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In may last the SDF participated in the U.S.-led cobra gold military exercises, the largest-ever in Asia, and in the subsequent period in Japan-U.S. joint military exercises staged in the U.S. with F-15 fighters and early-warning and control plane of its air SDF involved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The adoption of a bill on dispatching heavily armed ground, maritime and air SDF at the same time to Iraq for the first time in the history of its overseas dispatch shows well to what a dangerous phase Japan has gone in its moves for its troops' overseas dispatch. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' dangerous moves for expansion overseas are bound to go bust due to strong censure and condemnation by the Korean and other Asian people.    \r\n\r\n"

The anti-Japanese organization embraced Koreans at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Hyong Jik put forward policies of the proletarian revolution, revolutionary armed activities, etc. and rallied broad segments of people in the anti-Japanese struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He advanced the idea of \"Jiwon\" (aim high) that the liberation of the country should be achieved through struggle continued generation after generation. He, under the motto of \"Jiwon\", brought up his children to be indomitable revolutionaries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His idea was successfully materialized by President  Kim Il Sung, his eldest son. The president liberated the country and built a powerful socialist state on this land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The noble life and exploits of Kim Hyong Jik have always been kept in the memory of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His statues, museums and monuments were built in Kangdong county of Pyongyang, Sakju county of North Phyongan Province, Junggang county of Jagang Province and other places of the country associated with his revolutionary activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Schools, units and places were named after him.

He cried out for throwing a network of blockade in waters off Nampho, Anju, Wonsan, Chongjin and others to intercept all its \"suspicious ships\" and inspect their cargo.\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary dismisses his remarks as part of the U.S. media diatribe aimed to veil the criminal nature of its naval blockade against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No sleight of hand on the part of the U.S. can cover up the criminal nature of its naval blockade, notes the commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to international law and norms governing international relations including the un charter and the convention on the un law of the sea, the commentary holds that the naval blockade against the DPRK is a grave criminal act of infringing upon the sovereignty of an independent state, an unreasonable terrorism in the sea and a gross violation of international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such brigandish naval blockade of the U.S. is as dangerous an act as igniting a new war on the Korean peninsula, the commentary observes, and continues: paragraph 15 of the Armistice Agreement stipulates that all opposing parties shall not engage in blockade of any kind of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In case the U.S. conducts naval blockade against the DPRK and lays an \"international siege\" to it, this may soon lead to the total abrogation of the armistice agreement. then there is no need to explain what this means.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
