            "content": "Japan's undisguised design for overseas aggression \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 20 (KCNA) -- The Japanese reactionaries were reported to have asserted that Japan cannot properly make an \"international contribution\" unless the Japanese \"Self-Defence Forces\" is allowed to exercise the right of its collective self-defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This jargon is assailed by Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary. Japan's hue and cry over the \"international contribution\" is not for peace but for paving a wide avenue for aggression, the commentary observes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the pretext of making an institutional mechanism for \"international contribution,\" they are working hard to delete the article of the constitution disallowing the Japanese armed forces to exercise the right of collective self-defence and stipulate in it a new article permitting it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The greatest ambition of the Japanese militarists is to realise the \"Greater East Asia Coprosperity Sphere.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Permitting them to exercise the right of collective self-defence means allowing them to launch overseas aggression and any legislation on it means a green light to officially pushing ahead with their design. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their moves to rewrite the present constitution and rename the \"Self-Defence Forces\" \"Japanese Army\" are aimed at constitutionally allowing Japan to have regular combat forces, demonstrating the might of the militarist aggressor forces to the world and openly hurling the \"SDF\" into overseas aggression under the signboard of \"national security and interests.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the past Japan committed invasion of Asia under the motto \"peace in east\" only to suffer a defeat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Japanese reactionaries go in for overseas aggression, advocating the \"international contribution\" and persistently calling for the exercise of the right of collective self-defence, it will lead Japan to destruction. \r\n\r\n"
