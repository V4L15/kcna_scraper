This cannot be construed otherwise than a sinister aim to vitiate the atmosphere of national cooperation and reconciliation on the Korean Peninsula at present and bring the trend of DPRK-U.S. dialogue back to the past confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An act of blocking the reunification constitutes the worst violation of human rights on the Korean Peninsula and to cooperate in the efforts to achieve reunification and frustrate the moves for a war mean the fullest guarantee of human rights, the commentary said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It urged the U.S. to ponder over the ardent passion for reunification on the Korean Peninsula once again, withdraw the base and futile \"human rights\" offensive and the hostile policy toward the north and opt for warming its relations with the north at once.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
