            "content": "DPRK Delegate Denounces U.S. Nuclear Doctrine \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- The DPRK delegate made a speech at a meeting of the UN Disarmament Commission on April 11.\r\n The proliferation of nuclear weapons is quite natural in the presence of nuclear weapons and the threat of their use, he said, adding: The U.S. nuclear doctrine is a practical obstacle in the way of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Urging the nuclear weapon states to come to the conference table for a ban on nuclear weapons as demanded by the non-nuclear states including the non-aligned countries, he said: At the UN Security Council and disarmament bodies, the United States and its allies recently came out with the robber-like claim that the only thing that remained to be done was to block the proliferation of nuclear weapons as their nukes posed no threat, separating their nukes from the proliferation issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., he went on, is pulling its full weight on the development of new nuclear weapons, declaring a preemptive nuclear attack their security strategy, and is applying double standards in its nuclear policy in favor of its interests. This doctrine of the U.S. is a total denial of the NPT and a threat to global peace and security. It will result in frustrating international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation efforts and fanning up the nuclear arms race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's possession of nuclear weapons is a legitimate right to defend its sovereignty today when the Bush administration listed it as part of an \"axis of evil\" and a \"tyrannical\" state and is getting all the more undisguised in its drive to overthrow it, he declared, and continued:. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK cannot renounce nuclear weapons when the U.S. is intensifying nuclear war rehearsals to make a preemptive strike at it, ignoring the joint statement adopted at the 4th-round six-party talks. It will need not a single nuke when the U.S. abandons its hostile policy toward the DPRK and becomes able to co-exist with it.\r\n The U.S. should no more engage itself in erecting a roadblock in the way of the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula but  show its will in practice to fulfill its obligation laid down in the joint statement of the 4th-round six-party talks.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They, therefore, are participated in mainly by flower companies and floriculturists from various countries.\r\n On the contrary, only Kimilsungias and Kimjongilias are put on display at the flower festivals held in the DPRK on the occasion of the Day of the Sun and the February holiday as an annual event. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These festivals which take place with the participation of Koreans at home and abroad and foreign friends are expanded in scope year after year.\r\n More than 8,000 potted Kimilsungias were on display at the 8th Kimilsungia Festival. It was visited by hundreds of thousands of people every day.\r\n The number of Kimilsungias displayed at the 8 rounds of festivals totaled over 50,000 and that of visitors nearly four million. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Kimilsungia festival is decorated in harmony with other flowers and plants, splendid background, varied delicate sculptures and art works. Such fascinating scene cannot be found in any other flower festivals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The flower festival full of profound reverence and missing of the Korean people and the world progressives for President Kim Il Sung constitutes a new chapter in the world history of flower plants.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They are fully ready to resolutely fight against the imperialists if they come out to infringe upon the sovereignty of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present situation requires the Korean nation not just to talk about peace on the Korean Peninsula but protect it through actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north and the south are just like one community linked with the same destiny as regards the issue of peace on the peninsula.\r\n To put an end to the U.S. domination and interference in south Korea and reunify the country represents not only a struggle to realize the cherished desire of the Korean nation but a just and patriotic struggle to foil the U.S. imperialists' moves to provoke a new war and defend peace and security on the Korean Peninsula.\r\n The U.S. is getting evermore frantic in its moves to bolster its forces and large-scale nuclear war exercises targeted against the north under the signboard of relocation and \"strategic flexibility\" of its forces in south Korea in a bid to provoke a new war.\r\n Now that the outsiders are bringing dark clouds of a nuclear war to hang over the peninsula peace should not be begged for. Only concerted efforts of all the Koreans can defend peace.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
