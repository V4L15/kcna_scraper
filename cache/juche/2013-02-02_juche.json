            "content": "DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman Blasts U.S. Double Standards over Satellite Launch Issue \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, February 2 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK gave the following answer to the question put by KCNA Saturday as regards the fact that U.S. revealed the double standards and brigandish nature by denying the DPRK the right to launch satellite for peaceful purposes:\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., which masterminded the UN Security Council's \"resolution\" against the DPRK's launch of satellite Kwangmyongsong 3-2, supported and defended south Korea's launch of satellite Naro, drawing worldwide censure and derision.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the U.S. State Department made sophism that south Korea has carried out space launch program in a responsible manner and clarified that it is not for military purposes, adding that south Korea's approach is, therefore, quite different from north Korea's.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. denied the DPRK's right to launch satellite for no justifiable reason but blindly connived at the satellite launch by its stooge south Korea. This is the height of double standards and impudence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The successful launch of Kwangmyongsong 3-2 by the DPRK was the exercise of the legitimate right of a sovereignty state consistent with universally recognized international law. Even professional institutions in the U.S., to say nothing of the international community, admitted that the DPRK's satellite goes around its orbit. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This being a hard fact, the U.S. perpetrated the highhanded hostile act of deliberately negating the DPRK's independent and legitimate right to satellite launch. This goes to prove that from the outset it intended to use the satellite launch as a new occasion of stifling the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. was wrong in seeking the adoption of UNSC \"resolutions\" which it cites whenever an opportunity presents itself to use as a pretext for denying the DPRK's right to satellite launch. It forced the UNSC to enforce the hostile policy in a bid to block the DPRK's scientific research into space and its economic development, trampling upon the universally accepted international law reflecting the general will of the international community in violation of the fundamental principles of the UN Charter which calls for respecting each country's sovereignty and ensuring impartiality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Last year when it left no means untried to stifle the DPRK the U.S. allowed the south Korean puppets to drastically extend the range of missiles in violation of the missile non-proliferation regime cooked up by itself, straining the regional situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Still overlooked is the brigandish logic that its stooges are allowed to do whatever they like and those countries hostile to it are not allowed to do anything and the law governing existence based on jungle law prevails. It is the situation of the present world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The American way of thinking, American standard may work on other countries but never on the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK have launched an all-out struggle to defend the dignity and sovereignty of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. brazen-faced double standards and highhanded hostile act are bound to face the DPRK's toughest retaliation."

Puppet Defence Minister Kim Kwan Jin, Chief of the Intelligence Service Won Se Hun and others fully backed him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Chon Yong U, chief of Diplomacy and Security in Chongwadae, Ryu U Ik, puppet minister of Unification, and other confrontation maniacs of south Korea said that \"the north should choose one, either survival or nuclear weapons\" and \"stronger sanctions unbearable by the north have to be imposed\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the south Korean regime do not hesitate to make such outbursts as calling for not ruling out even military \"sanctions\". In the meantime, the U.S. ultra-modern war means are being amassed in south Korea and in the areas around the Korean Peninsula. The U.S. nuclear submarine and Aegis cruiser entered south Korea to hold combined marine exercises and to show off \"military muscle\" while the puppet army was put on \"an alert to stand guard against the north.\" Warmongers are inciting war fever while touring units in the forefront areas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean puppet group of traitors, which took an active part in the adoption of the unwarranted UN \"resolution\" against the Koreans, are now working hard to escalate confrontation with the DPRK and provoke a war against it while calling the DPRK's counteraction for defending its inviolable sovereignty an \"additional provocation\". This shows that the south Korean group consists of hooligans and matchless villains to exterminate the nation in collusion with outsiders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group's anti-DPRK confrontation racket is a last-ditch effort of a man more dead than alive. The intention of the group is to make a bluff with the help of the American master and save its tarnished image even a bit. It also seeks to drive the situation to the extremes by brandishing the ball of fire, plunge the north-south ties into an irretrievable phase and hand over the baton of \"sanctions\" and \"confrontation\" to the next regime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The ever-more intensified confrontation racket on the part of the U.S., the Lee group and other hostile forces goes to prove that the UN \"resolution on sanctions\" against the DPRK is a product of the deliberate and planned intrigues to escalate the hostile steps against it to bar it from building an economic giant, and to isolate and stifle it. But they are seriously mistaken.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"sanctions\" of the enemies further hardened the will and strength of all service personnel and people of the DPRK to defend their just cause and build the most powerful nation, a highly-civilized socialist nation under the banner of justice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group talks about \"sanctions\" in league with the U.S. and Japan. This reminds one of a puppy knowing no fear of the tiger as it is a suicidal act of jumping into fire with fagot.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK already declared its toughest stand to cope with the hostile steps of the ferocious enemies, and its army and people are fully ready and waiting for only the time for final battle. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is fully ready for both economic and military \"sanctions\", and anyone who encroaches upon its dignity and sovereignty even a bit with any form of \"sanctions\" will not be able to avoid deadly retaliation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group should bear in mind that its participation in the \"sanctions\" against the DPRK will lead to a historical grand war for national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Invincible is our just cause and no force on earth can arrest it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group should stop a foolish act, understanding the fierce nature of the history of stand-off between the DPRK and the U.S."

Those countries which claim to be big powers tested intercontinental ballistic missiles in the eyes of the world during the Cold War and the post Cold War, in particular, but the UNSC had never put the issue on the table and discussed it.

Y si alguien atenta, aunque sea en lo minimo, la dignidad y la soberania de la RPDC mediante la \"sancion\" de cualquier tipo, no podra evitar el fuego de venganza terrible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa camarilla surcoreana debe tener presente que tomar parte en la \"sancion\" contra la RPDC desatara la gran e historica guerra por la reunificacion de la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa justa causa de la RPDC es invencible y no existe en este mundo el que pueda frenarla.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda surcoreana debe actuar con prudencia recordando como ha transcurrido la enconada historia de enfrentamiento RPDC-EE.UU. que prosigue de siglo en siglo."
