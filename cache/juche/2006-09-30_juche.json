            "content": "Head of DPRK Delegation Reiterates DPRK's Stand on Denuclearization of Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 29 (KCNA) -- The DPRK government maintains its consistent position to resolve the issue of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula peacefully. Choe Su Hon, vice-minister of Foreign Affairs who is leading the DPRK delegation, declared this at the plenary session of the 61st General Assembly of the United Nations on Sept. 26.\r\n Referring to the necessity and justice of the Songun policy of Kim Jong Il, he said that the Songun policy provides a sure guarantee for safeguarding the sovereignty and security of the country and ensuring peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and the rest of the region, given the evermore undisguised U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went on to say: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's possession of powerful deterrent solely meant for self-defense is in full line with the interests of the regional countries in peace and security and peaceful environment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As well known to the world, the important points stipulated in the Joint Statement adopted at the Six-Party Talks on September 19, 2005 are the commitment made by the DPRK to abandon its nuclear program and the U.S. commitment to co-exist with the former in peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK remains committed to implementing all the agreed provisions of the Joint Statement on an equal footing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S., soon after the announcement of the Joint Statement, lost no time to impose financial sanctions upon the DPRK, a dialogue partner, eventually scrapping the already-agreed itinerary for the following rounds of the talks and creating the present impasse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these facts clearly indicate that the U.S. is not in favor of both the Six-Party Talks and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Turning to the issue of the expansion of permanent membership of the UN Security Council, he stated that the UN member countries should not allow under any circumstances such a country as Japan to sit on the council as it is a war criminal which invaded Asian countries and massacred innocent civilians and, worse still, has worked hard to distort its history of aggression, instead of settling it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The government of the DPRK will continue in the future, too, to develop the relations of friendship and cooperation with all member states that respect its sovereignty in accordance with the idea of its foreign policy: independence, peace and friendship and make a positive contribution to the efforts of the international community to achieve world peace and security and sustainable development, he concluded.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

What the U.S. seeks through this is to accelerate the preparations for a war of aggression against the north. \r\n Minju Joson Friday observes this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a matter of fact, the U.S. is amassing hardware for preemptive attacks such as Aegis craft in waters off south Korea and its vicinity under the signboard of \"transfer of the right to command wartime operations.\" It is against this backdrop that north-targeted war maneuvers never cease there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is pressurizing the south Koran authorities to stage more war exercises while accelerating its preparations for a war against the north under the above-mentioned signboard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is using the \"transfer of the right to command the wartime operations\" as a pretext for strengthening its politico-military domination over south Korea and hurling its troops as a shock brigade and bullet-shields of the U.S. forces in the war against the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Anyone in whose vein runs the blood of the Korean nation is duty-bound to see through the U.S. sinister aim to pit Koreans against themselves and demand the withdrawal of its forces from south Korea. This being a hard reality, the south Korean military authorities are busy introducing ultra-modern weapons such as Aegis craft, early-warning control plane, military spy satellite and new-type fighters, describing \"the process of taking back the right to command the wartime operations\" as something for \"self-reliant national defence\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nï¿½@The arms build-up stepped up by the south Koran authorities under the above-said pretext is an outrageous military provocation against the army and people of the DPRK and, at the same time, a blatant mockery and insult to the south Korean people aspiring after independence and peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the south Korean authorities truly stand for \"self-reliant national defence\", they should stop supporting the outside forces but opt for national cooperation aimed at driving the aggressors out of south Korea and achieving independent reunification by the concerted efforts of the Koreans.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

So immeasurable is harm the U.S. did to south Korea, the crime it committed against the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Never should it go unnoticed that the U.S. imperialists renamed some places of south Korea as well as localities of the northern half of Korea their own way, according to the recently disclosed fact. This clearly proves again that the U.S. has long established its Korea policy aimed to put the whole of Korea under its domination and has consistently pursued the policy of aggression against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans keep tabs on the crimes of the U.S. imperialists who have been hell-bent on their policy of aggression against the DPRK, even renaming localities of Korea as they please.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, said this in a statement on Friday assailing their fresh arms build-up. It said:\r\n Some time ago, the south Korean military authorities announced that they completed the development of a cruise missile capable of striking major military targets in the DPRK and they are contemplating mass-producing and deploying it at the \"Guided Missile Command\" in one or two years to come. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said arms build-up is an intolerable provocation as it will push the inter-Korean relations to the phase of confrontation and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation now prevailing on the Korean Peninsula is so alarming that the sovereignty and security of the nation are now seriously infringed upon by the reckless moves of the U.S. to stifle the DPRK and ignite a war against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The prevailing situation requires all the Koreans to turn out in the anti-U.S., anti-war struggle for peace to defend the country's peace and the destiny of the nation under the banner of \"By our nation itself.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the south Korean warlike forces are hell bent on the arms buildup and war exercises against the north as active supporters and accomplices of the U.S. in its moves to stifle the north. These cannot be construed otherwise than hideous crimes against the nation as they force fellow countrymen to fall victim to the nuclear war to be ignited by the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK will never remain a passive on-looker to the reckless confrontation moves of the south Korean warlike forces to step up their dangerous arms buildup against the north in wanton violation of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only stern judgment and merciless punishment of history and the nation await the traitorous forces which bring only misfortune and disasters to the nation, toeing outside forces' policy of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean bellicose forces should behave themselves, mindful that their arms buildup to hurt fellow countrymen would adversely affect the north-south relations and this foolish act would only lead to their self-destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This goes to clearly prove that the U.S. is the world's biggest nuclear criminal in bringing the danger of a nuclear war to the earth, declares Rodong Sinmun in an article Friday.\r\n The author of the article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the results of an investigation made public by the U.S. National Archives recently, the U.S. kept more than 13,000 nuclear weapons deployed in Europe, Asia and other parts of the world in the period of the Cold War in the last century and at least 7,000 of them in Europe, many of which still remain in Germany, Britain and other European countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is raising terrific outcries over \"nuclear threat\" from other countries, terming their nuclear activities for peaceful purposes \"development of nuclear weapons.\" This is a broad hoax to conceal its own criminal nature and justify its attempts to dominate the world with nuclear weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. nuclear arsenals are filled to overflowing with more than 20,000 nuclear weapons of all types. They include over 5,400 intercontinental ballistic missile warheads and more than 1,750 nuclear bombs and cruise missile warheads. The U.S. Defense Department in its 2002 report on nuclear posture decided to resume researches into nuclear weapons which it had suspended for 10 years since 1992 and allocated 6.3 billion U.S. dollars to the nuclear weapons program in fiscal 2004. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Citing facts to prove that the U.S. imperialists are nuclear war fanatics bent on inflicting nuclear disasters upon humankind, the article stresses: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The increasing danger of a nuclear war comes from the U.S. attempts at preemptive nuclear attack and its reckless moves to launch a nuclear war. The world public opinion is getting assertive that the U.S. should stand trial for seeking to bring nuclear disasters to humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are the most dangerous force of nuclear war and an enemy common to humankind endangering its existence. The world peace-loving people should wage a dynamic struggle to foil the U.S. imperialists' aggressive and belligerent nuclear policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had better stop its criminal moves to inflict a nuclear holocaust upon humankind.      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
