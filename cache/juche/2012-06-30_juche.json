At last she was allowed to enter a brick house. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She said: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"The master of the house spoke Korean.

Then he brought me in a car to a place in Dalian where I stayed for about a week. One day a man who claimed to be 'a manager' took a photo of me. I learned later that he was bribed by the puppet regime and had the job of taking away people from the DPRK to south Korea. Two days later, he appeared and said it was time for me to leave for meeting my father. Then he let me get on a car and drove it to a place I could not know. I was thus handed over to this or that man according to a scenario of the puppet group. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"At around 4 p.m. on June 28 I got aboard a 'ship bound for Qingdao' together with a woman at Dandong Port. At around 9 a.m. next day when the ship anchored, the woman threw my fake certificate into waters before getting it off. And she told me to wait for someone approaching me before a W.C. on the ground floor of a building before disappearing. Then a man took me to the second floor of the building.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"When I opened the door and entered a room, an overbearing man with a longish face took something to drink out of a box on the desk and offered it to me. He said in a cynical tone, 'This is a drug making everybody speak only truth. You are in south Korea.' \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"The enemies asked me about my career, how I lived in the DPRK, etc. and told me to write about them. They coaxed and threatened me. They went the lengths of insulting me and even making a fool of me. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"It was not until I was questioned for about 20 days that I was allowed to go to see my father. But my father was lying on a hospital bed after undergoing an operation on the brain. He was a human vegetable unable to see or hear. It was only at that time that I realized I was deceived by the enemies\"."

War.\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean War ignited by the U.S. on June 25, 1950 imposed unspeakable misfortune and sufferings on the Korean people, causing tremendous human and material losses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has, however, falsified the truth of history and persisted in its moves to stifle the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a foolish act to evade the responsibility as the provocateur of the Korean War and realize its wild ambition for domination.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Historical facts bring to bolder relief the true colors of the U.S. as provocateur of the Korean War and a war criminal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean War was an inevitable product of the U.S. strategy for putting the world under its control. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was pursuant to the U.S. foreign policy for aggression and its direct result.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. set it as an immediate strategic goal of its foreign policy to establish \"leadership over the world\" and dominate the world by taking advantage of its favorable position in which it emerged the boss of the imperialists after the end of World War II.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t U.S. President Truman in his \"message\" sent to Congress on December 19, 1945, said that at last it became possible for the U.S. to get the leadership position which U.S. President Wilson had wished to grant to it after the end of World War I, adding that it should assume with pleasure the mission to \"lead the world\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to realize its wild ambition to dominate the world the U.S. declared the Cold War against the growing socialist countries and world revolutionary forces and came out with what it called \"containment strategy.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The so-called Truman Doctrine spelled out by Truman at a joint meeting of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives in March 1947 was an open declaration of a war against the socialist forces and the world independent forces and a declaration that called for carrying out its strategy for world domination and \"containment strategy\" in real earnest.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The proclamation of \"Truman Doctrine\" and the establishment of the above-said strategy meant that the U.S. launched an \"anti-communist crusade expedition.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. attached importance to the Far East in Asia in carrying out its strategy for dominating the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t MacArthur, commander of the U.S. forces in Fart East and commander of the UN forces during the three-year Korean War, said at that time that Europe had a dying system but Asia having 800 million population would decide on the advance of the world history in 1 000 years to come, adding that the U.S. will lose the whole world if it fails to put Asia under its control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. reactionary government ostensively advocated the policy of putting main emphasis on Europe but it enforced the policy of attaching importance to Asia in practice under the influence of \"those advocating Asia first\" including MacArthur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They attached great importance to Korea, in particular, among Asian countries, \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Top secret document No. 4849\" of the Information Research Bureau of the U.S. Department of State on January 28, 1949 said that in the light of Korea's geographical situation in Northeast Asia to control Korea and its people was of value to any other states interested in the Far East and it was beyond any doubt that Korea was very important for the U.S. from the political point of view.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For its military and strategic position of Korea the U.S. regarded it as a strategic stronghold for making a military strike at any region in the Far East and as a \" bridgehead\" and a \"forefront in the Far East\" from which to intrude into China and the Far Eastern region of the Soviet Union.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To cite just an example, MacArthur was reported to say that Korea was like a bridgehead leading to the continent and that conquering the whole of Korea would help the U.S. forces cut off the only supply line linking Siberia of the Soviet Union with its southern parts and put the whole areas between Vladivostok and Singapore under the U.S. control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. also said Korea was the forefront in the East where it was standing in confrontation with communism and a political and military confrontational hotspot between the East and the West as the north and the south of Korea were taking quite different paths after the end of World War II.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Much upset by the fact that the DPRK was making a leaping advance toward socialism, bringing about epoch-making changes, the U.S. termed Korea an \"ideal battle site on which every possible success of the U.S. in Asia might hinge\" and a \"testing ground for the confrontation between the U.S.-style democracy and communism.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This finally prompted the U.S. to adopt it as a basic policy toward the DPRK to colonize the whole of Korea by means of war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. considered war as an effective lever for bringing down the people's democratic system deeply rooted in the DPRK and imposing aggressive demands upon its people strong in independence. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. illegally brought the issue of Korea up for discussion at the UN in autumn of 1947, cooking up the puppet regime in south Korea in 1948 and worked hard to build \"Asia's best\" puppet army. All this was aimed at meeting these demands.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As seen above, the Korean War was an inevitable product of the U.S. brigandish strategy and policy for aggression toward the DPRK, both aimed to colonize the whole of Korea and realize its scenario for dominating the world in the Far East, using it as an outpost. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. was keenly interested in the Korean War also because of its serious economic crisis at that time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Economic depression started in the light industrial field at the end of 1948 and then caused a chain reaction in the heavy industry. It rapidly hit iron and steel industry in March 1949. As a result, about 4 600 companies went bankrupt in the first half of that year, causing a huge surplus work force. The number of the full unemployed was expected to increase to 13 million within 1950. The profits of monopolies drastically dropped to 28.4 billion U.S. dollars in March 1949 from 36.6 billion U.S. dollars in September 1948.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The monopoly tycoons of the U.S. urged the ruling quarters of the administration to start a new war, expecting the government to make preparations for giving a fresh strong shot in the arm of economy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"War for prosperity!\" was a call of U.S. monopoly capitalists who were struggling to rid of the crisis caused by over-production.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reactionary government speaking for the interests of the U.S. billionaires finally put spurs to the war preparations, stepping up militarization of economy and arms race.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Arms race unprecedented in peacetime in the U.S. history was kicked off with 1948 when economic crisis started as a momentum and the horror of economic crisis reached at its height in 1950. The Korean War broke out that year against this background. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on this, Japanese book \"Korean War\" said that \"Korean War was a way-out of economic crisis that faced the U.S.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The U.S. ignited the Korean War also because the puppet regimes in Asia were on the verge of collapse.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet regime of Syngman Rhee faced a serious ruling crisis after its shameful defeat at the puppet National Assembly election on May 30, 1950.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Rhee clique held just 47 seats out of 210 seats in the NA while the \"faction calling for negotiations with the north\" dominated it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If a \"presidential election\" was held under that balance of forces in the NA, it was very likely that a \"candidate from the middle faction\" would be elected.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As an American historian commented, a war was \"the last hope\" of the Rhee clique to survive under that situation and it was to ignite a fratricidal war as soon as possible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Traitor Syngman Rhee sent Jang Myon to Washington to inform it of the fact that the \"government\" might collapse around June 10 - 13 and \"asked for prompt U.S. assistance\" to help him weather the crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Upon receiving an urgent message from Rhee, Truman had to prevent the collapse of the puppet government in south Korea as there was no other way for him but to \"support him\" and had no option but to ignite the projected war as early as possible, as he confessed. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Another reason for the U.S to decide to go to war was the information that the Chinese people were planning to liberate Taiwan in summer of 1950.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to what was confessed by Mun Hak Bong, former advisor to the CIC and political advisor to Syngman Rhee, the U.S. received information that the Chinese people would conduct an operation for liberating Taiwan in July, at the latest, and came to make a decision to take an initiative. This prompted the U.S. to advance the date of the start of the Korean War. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The United States fixed June 25 as the date for starting the Korean War. Lurking behind this was a crafty plot to cover up its true colors as a war provocateur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Historically, the \"tactics of making a surprise attack at dawn of Sunday\" was a trite method employed by the imperialists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Russo-Japanese War, the Sino-Japanese War and the Pacific War were all kicked off with surprise attacks early Sunday mornings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. added a new meaning to this method. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was proved by what Robert, head of the U.S. military advisory group, told Syngman Rhee.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Explaining the reason why the U.S. chose June 25 for the start of the war, Robert said June 25 was Sunday and no one would believe that the Christian states, the U.S. and south Korea, would ignite a war on Sunday as they observe the Sabbath. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In other words, the decision was intended to make people believe that neither the U.S. nor south Korea provoked the war first, Robert said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. set in motion its paid media to release the following false report in a bid to cover up its true colors as a war provocateur: Two third of the south Korean puppet troops had an off-day on June 24 when the \"preparatory martial law\" that had been proclaimed on June 13 was lifted.   All brass hats of the units deployed in the areas along the 38th Parallel above divisional commanders took part in a \"ball\" held at a club of the puppet ground force in Seoul on that evening.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But Ri Song Ga, commander of the 8th Division of the south Korean army deployed in the eastern sector of the front at that time, testified to the fact that all the puppet forces in the area along the 38th Parallel were on combat alert after being ordered not to leave their barracks on the eve of June 25 and launched an attack at dawn.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With nothing can the U.S. cover its true colors as a war provocateur. It can never escape a severe punishment by history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is instigating the south Korean puppet forces and the Japanese reactionaries to ignite the second Korean war, a nuclear war, instead of drawing a due lesson from its bitter defeat in the last Korean war,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the belligerent forces of the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces dare provoke another war, oblivious of the lesson taught by history, they will face a strong counter-action of the army and people of the DPRK and meet a miserable end. Those who do not want peace but seek a war should bear this in mind."
