It destroyed by itself the \"missile technology control system\" for preventing the worldwide proliferation of the ballistic missiles. It threw a wet blanket over the effort for restraint of long-range missile launch and all other efforts for stability of the Korean Peninsula and its surrounding areas, and destroyed the foundation for dialogue and negotiations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is left with no moral qualifications to talk about the development of the DPRK's missile capability as it is the chieftain that sparked off new missile arms race in Northeast Asia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has so far stepped up sanctions against the DPRK, calling for preventing its satellite launch for peaceful purposes while claiming that satellite also uses the ballistic missile technology. But, now it is in a position unable to make any excuses even though the DPRK launches a long-range missile for military purposes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is natural for the DPRK to bolster missile capability for striking the stronghold of aggression under the condition that the U.S. intends to put forward south Korean puppet forces as a bullet-shield after deploying a great number of nukes and missiles targeted against the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent missile move will result in endangering the security of the U.S. mainland, far from ensuring it. The U.S. will have to hold full responsible for it."
