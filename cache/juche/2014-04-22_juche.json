He was very pleased to watch it, saying: \"He is the son of Hero Kil Yong Jo. He is flying in the sky just as his father did. That is the flight made to defend the country, following in the footsteps of his father. Excellent.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kil Hun skillfully piloted the plane to the place where Kim Jong Un was waiting for him before making a report on his fulfillment of the training order to him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hugging him and holding his hands for a while, Kim Jong Un said with appreciation: \"You are admirable. Well done. I listened with keen attention to your speech made at the meeting of airpersons. You have shown in practice the pledge you made there.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He kindly asked Kil how old he was when his father died and if he remembered his father. Kim Jong Un added: \"He lost his father when he was three years old. He has grown up to stand at the post guarded by his father. He has become a squadron leader at the age of 25 like his father. The generation of our revolution is replaced by a new one like this.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recalling that Hero Kil Yong Jo was a genuine combat pilot who showed in practice the spirit of devotedly defending the leader, Kim Jong Un urged Kil Hun to take the lead in flying to defend the country as his father did. He had a photo taken with him, holding him in his arms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then, planes of the unit took off, making twin formations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The flying corps performed difficult flight missions, making a barrel roll at a very low altitude and fully demonstrated the militant stamina of the fighters to mercilessly blow up the citadel of enemies and wipe out the enemies to the last one by making prompt sorties like the lightning over Mt. Paektu once an order is issued any moment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He met the airpersons who finished their training and encouraged them. Then he had a photo taken with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said he organized the training without any prior notice upon being told that the airmen came back from the meeting yesterday, but it was very successful, adding this proved that the unit has always kept itself fully combat ready in response to the slogan \"We wait for the Party's sortie order.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"As an air battle allows no moment's delay,\" he said, instructing the unit to intensify the flight training so as to fully prepare the airpersons as death-defying corps in the sky and able combat pilots capable of skillfully fighting a modern warfare.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Jang Jong Nam, So Hong Chan, Han Kwang Sang, Hwang Pyong So, Ri Jae Il, Kim Pyong Ho and Ma Won Chun."

With such awkward excuse, he asserted it is high time that a UNSC was called to discuss the DPRK's \"human rights issue\" and bring it to the International Criminal Court.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His rash act is a last-ditch effort intended to lend credence to the \"report\" peppered with fabrications and create an atmosphere of international pressure on the DPRK in this regard.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lurking behind it is a dishonest and political purpose of the U.S. and its followers seeking to undermine the ideology and social system of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now, the forces hostile toward the DPRK regard the \"human rights issue\" as a main lever for stifling it since they had no way out over the \"nuclear issue\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After all, such political swindlers as Kirby were mobilized so as to internationalize the nonexistent \"human rights issue\" of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As for Kirby who took the lead in cooking the \"report\", he is a disgusting old lecher with a 40-odd-year-long career of homosexuality. He is now over seventy, but he is still anxious to get married to his homosexual partner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This practice can never be found in the DPRK boasting of the sound mentality and good morals, and homosexuality has become a target of public criticism even in Western countries, too. In fact, it is ridiculous for such gay to sponsor dealing with others' human rights issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As been already known, what was put up by Kirby and his group as data is all testimonies made by those \"defectors\", who are runaways or terrorists as they betrayed their country and nation after committing indelible crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the Kirby group styling itself a judge accepted such unconfirmed data to cook up the \"report\". This makes one question if the group has an elementary legal sense. After all, they changed their position as judges with money paid by the U.S. and its followers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At present, many countries and even Western media and personages are astonished at the Kirby group's \"report\" presented to a sacred UN body, terming it a replica of Nazi-style arbitrariness.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is so pitiable for the U.S. and its followers to attempt to frighten the DPRK by letting such dirty swindlers, ready to do anything for money, invent an anti-DPRK false document.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK reject the fabricated document as a foul crime unprecedented in the world history of human rights and will surely force them to pay dearly for it."

            "content": "ACNC comenta demagogia anti-RPDC de estafadores politicos\r\n Pyongyang, 22 de abril (ACNC) -- El pasado dia 17, el presidente del \"comite de investigacion\" de la situacion de derechos humanos de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea, Michael Kirby, concedio una conferencia de prensa en la sede de la ONU.\n\t\t\t\t\t Cuando los corresponsales de varios paises sospechaban la autenticidad del \"informe sobre DDHH\" presentado por el comite, el les respondio que eso se basa en los \"testimonios de los fugitivos norcoreanos\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Prosiguio que ahora es el tiempo de convocar la reunion del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU para tratar el \"problema de DDHH\" de la RPDC y discutir el tema de remitirlo a la Corte Penal Internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El acto verbal de Kirby tiene la meta de atribuir autenticidad a su invento y crear el ambiente de presion internacional sobre el \"problema\" de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Detras de ello, esta el peligroso proposito politico de EE.UU. y de sus seguidores de suprimir la idea y regimen de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Fracasadas en su intento de doblegar a la RPDC con el \"problema nuclear\", las fuerzas hostiles cuestionan tanto el \"problema de DDHH\" considerandolo como medio principal para atropellar a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En esa sucia campana estan movilizados los estafadores politicos como Michael Kirby.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kirby, inventor principal del susodicho \"informe\", es un viejo lujurioso que dejo sonados casos de homosexualidad durante mas de 40 anos pasados y ahora, aunque tiene mas de 70 anos de edad, esta impaciente por casarse con otro maricon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El que se atreve a atender el problema de DDHH de un pais es ese \"pajaro\" que no puede existir en la RPDC, donde reinan la idea sana y la etica noble, y causa escandalo social hasta en los paises occidentales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Como ya conocido, la fuente de datos presentados por la banda de Kirby es la chismografia de los \"fugitivos norcoreanos\" que huyeron al Sur de Corea tras cometer imperdonables crimenes ante el pais y el pueblo o actos terroristas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Sin embargo, los compinches de Kirby, que se creen jurisperitos, inventaron el informe con esos datos sin confirmar su veracidad, lo cual pone en entredicho sus conocimientos del derecho.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Parece que ellos cambiaron su magistrado con el dinero ofrecido por EE.UU. y sus satelites.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ahora muchos paises y hasta algunos medios de prensa occidentales critican el \"informe\" como una copia de la insistencia al estilo nazista mostrandose consternados por la circulacion del mismo documento en la organizacion de la ONU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El ejercito y el pueblo de la RPDC condenan ese informe intrigante estigmatizandolo como caso repugnante nunca visto antes en la historia mundial de DDHH."
