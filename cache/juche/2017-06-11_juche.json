Korean Authorities for Escalating Confrontation\r\nPyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- The south Korean authorities are following the outsiders' sanctions against the DPRK, being displeased with the latter's just measures for bolstering up its military capability for self-defence. Of late they supported the U.S. in independently releasing the list of additional targets of sanctions against the DPRK and the UN Security Council in fabricating its anti-DPRK \"sanctions resolution\" 2356.\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun Sunday says this is an unpardonable provocation escalating the distrust and conflict between the north and the south as they actively joined the U.S. and its vassal force's criminal moves to block the DPRK's bolstering up of its nuclear force and realize their ambition to stifle and pressurize it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The commentary notes:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's series of measures for bolstering up its nuclear deterrence in succession are entirely just as they are those for disabling and shattering the military moves of the U.S. hell-bent on a nuclear war against the DPRK by introducing nuclear strategic assets into south Korea and its vicinity and for defending peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the south Korean authorities are trying hard to create a good impression that they are interested in the improvement of the north-south relations through allowance of some non-governmental exchanges while crying that they will make efforts for dialogue with the north and ratcheting up pressure upon it simultaneously to make it dismantle its nukes. Meanwhile, they are siding with the foreign forces that are resorting to all sorts of means and methods to intensify sanctions against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities would be well advised to understand that their acts joining with outsiders' anti-DPRK sanctions and going against the trend of the times are as foolish as those losing the support of the people and doing harm to them by themselves."

It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Gone are the days never return when the U.S. could browbeat the DPRK with nukes of aggression. On the contrary, the DPRK has become the biggest menace to the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Regarding the structure of standoff between the DPRK and the U.S., the relations between them have already turned into those between the nuclear weapons states. It is a clear fact that the boasting of the U.S. strength doesn't make sense to the DPRK that has rapidly developed the nuclear attack capabilities and has already become the nuclear power in the East and leading rocket power in Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a ludicrous behavior of the U.S. that couldn't discriminate its rival, making bluff. Embarrassed to see the behaviors of the Trump administration, the voices critical of the policy toward the DPRK are coming from even the political circles and scholars.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should understand that its ill-advised muscle-flexing wouldn't change the situation and should behave with self-control and prudence."
