Typical of them is U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was the U.S. that has long antagonized and threatened the DPRK, compelling it to build defence capability to cope with it. It is, however, urging the DPRK to give priority to \"people's living.\" This is a hypocritical act of causing illness and then administering medicine.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was an undying historical feat that leader Kim Jong Il protected the dignity and supreme interests of the country and nation and built the DPRK into a self-defensive military power which no aggressor forces dare to provoke. This serves as an eternal foundation for accelerating the building of a thriving socialist nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The dear respected Kim Jong Un has already set forth a goal of Korean-style development and strategies and tactics for enabling the Korean people to live well with nothing to desire more in the world. He is now wisely leading the general advance of the Korean people for economic construction and improving the standard of people's living.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world witnessed the events in December last year when the Korean people bitterly grieved over  the demise of leader Kim Jong Il, the auspicious events in April this year when the country shook with their cheers and the spectacular celebrations of the anniversary of the Korean Children's Union on June 6 this year. These events clearly showed how foolish and ridiculous the U.S. was in its attempt to meddle in the internal affairs of the DPRK over its \"human rights issue\" and \"people's living\" and hurt its single-minded unity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will make sustained efforts to bolster up its nuclear deterrent to guarantee the peace and security of the country and the nation as long as the U.S. persistently antagonizes it, in actuality, while saying that it has no hostile intent on the former. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The munitions industry of the DPRK has now a foundation and capacity to steadily boost its nuclear deterrent by itself without letting its people fasten their belts any longer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the U.S. where people's livelihood and vital rights present themselves as serious problems, in fact, as 99 percent of its population is exploited by those who account for just one percent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hillary would be well advised to pay more attention to the issues of economic crisis and huge hordes of jobless people, which have become so serious that they may dash the hope of the administration of the Democratic Party for stay in power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The passage of time will prove that the Korean-style socialist system chosen by the people of the DPRK will prosper fast unlike the American-style capitalist system."

Kim Jong Il taught the immutable truth that a revolutionary party is, in essence, the party of the leader and a political organization which embodies his idea and ensures his leadership. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The undying feats he performed by developing Kim Il Sung's Korea dignified with Songun into an indestructible socialist bulwark, independent in politics, self-supporting in the economy and self-reliant in national defence, will shine for all ages.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We are convinced that the party, army and people of the DPRK will register great successes in the struggle to build a thriving socialist nation and reunify the country peacefully under the wise leadership of the dear respected Kim Jong Un."

Otete Gaston Mboyo, deputy general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Democratic Congo and chairman of the Democratic Congo-Korea Friendship and Solidarity Association, said this in a statement on June 11.\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The north and the south of Korea adopted the joint declaration the keynote of which is to reunify the country in the idea of \"By our nation itself\" on June 15, 2000.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the joint declaration which was fully supported by Koreans in the north and the south of Korea and overseas and the world progressives 12 years ago is facing an ordeal due to the U.S. and other foreign forces' interference and perfidy on the part of the Lee Myung Bak group in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the most fair and aboveboard way for reunifying Korea to implement the June 15 joint declaration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Democratic Congo-Korea Friendship and Solidarity Association is convinced that the Korean nation will put an end to the foreign forces' interference and thoroughly implement the joint declaration by the concerted efforts of the Koreans and thus achieve the historic cause of national reunification without fail."
