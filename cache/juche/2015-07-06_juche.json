Not content with this genocide, the soldiers massacred them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It admits of no argument that Japanese militarists were much more cruel and brutal towards other countries and nations than towards their own people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The people of Asia and other parts of the world should hate the past militarism of Japan and guard against its revival for generations as it pursued the policy of war and genocide, bringing so unspeakable misfortune and pain to the people of Japan and other Asian countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ultra-right wing reactionary forces in Japan are getting ever more undisguised in their moves to distort the history of aggression and veer it into the Right and turn it into a military giant so that it may appear a warring state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If such moves are allowed to go unchecked, humankind will suffer more terrible disasters than what it did seven decades ago.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A man aged 77 who took part in the event said that he became stronger in his assertion 70 years since the end of the war that a war should be averted as it causes people to suffer from diseases and starvation not only during it but in its subsequent period.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His words amount to a curse against Japanese militarism in the past and condemnation of the present Japanese reactionaries' moves to turn Japan into the Right and militarize it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese and other Asian people should not forget the unbearable misfortune and pain brought by Japanese militarism in the past but check and foil the daily intensified moves of the Japanese reactionaries to turn Japan into the Right and militarize it."
