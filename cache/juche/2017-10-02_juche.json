This is an act that can never be tolerated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To remind them once more, the DPRK's measures to strengthen the nuclear force are, for all intents and purposes, an exercise of its right to self-defense to safeguard peace and security in the Korean peninsula and the region from the vicious anti-DPRK hostile policy and nuclear threat of the U.S. which aim at obliterating the DPRK's sovereignty and rights to existence and development and annihilating the DPRK itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whoever it is, getting recklessly involved in the confrontation between the DPRK that possesses the powerful nuclear deterrence in practice and the U.S. is a foolish act tantamount to jumping into the fire with fuel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.K. would better get rid of its forlorn hope of eliminating, in collaboration with the U.S., the nuclear deterrence of the DPRK that now possesses even H-bomb and ICBM and address the DPRK-related issues from a strategic perspective.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The secretary of State for Defense should contemplate his words and behavior, rather than persistently ignoring the cause of the evil and dancing to the tune of the U.S."
