Korea Urged \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 10 (KCNA) -- Alejandro Cao de Benos, chairman of the Association for Friendship with the Korean People and head of the group of participants in an international march for Korean peace and reunification that visited the DPRK, at a press interview expressed full support to and solidarity with the Korean people in their just cause of driving the U.S. forces out of south Korea and achieving national reunification.\r\n Noting that the Korean people have been suffering from national division for over half a century, he said the main reason of this lies in the U.S. forces' occupation of south Korea and the vicious hostile policy of the U.S toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went on to say: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Peace of the Korean peninsula at present is gravely menaced by the U.S., which is chiefly to blame for the division of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The peninsula is one of the regions where the danger of war is the biggest in the world. The U.S. is deliberately aggravating the situation of the Korean peninsula, obsessed with an anachronistic daydream, turning its back on the world trend toward detente and peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While increasing pressure on the DPRK over the \"nuclear issue\", the U.S. is reinforcing combat capabilities of its forces in south Korea and staging massive war exercises in an unbroken chain, thus leading the situation to the brink of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., hating peace and reunification of Korea, is laying stumbling blocks in the way of reconciliation and cooperation of the Korean nation and throwing a wet blanket over the atmosphere of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the facts go to prove that the U.S. is the real criminal blocking peace and reunification of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It should take its aggression forces and military hardware out of south Korea at an early date.    \r\n \r\n\r\n"

Paektu on August 10, Juche 52 (1963), and gave instructions that the Korean people should live and fight with the soul of Paektu.\r\n Since then many soldiers of the Korean People's Army, people from all walks of life, south Korean and overseas compatriots and foreigners, a total of more than 11 million, have gone up the mountain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hundreds of thousands of people went to Mt. Paektu every year in the past 40 years. Among them KPA expeditionary groups and national youth vanguard expeditionary groups marching to the revolutionary sites in the area of the mountain made excursions there several times. Included among them were march groups from various social strata such as expeditionary groups of trade union, agricultural workers' union and women's union members, provincial expeditionary groups and student expeditionary groups.\r\n They held colorful functions including loyal oath-taking meetings and singing meetings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many compatriots of different social standings at home and abroad climbed the mountain on the anniversary of the country's liberation in Juche 79 (1990) and held the starting ceremony of Paektu-Hanna grand march for the promotion of national reunification and such functions for reunification continued in the later period. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Also among the members of the nation climbing Mt. Paektu through decades and centuries were delegations and home-visiting groups of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan and overseas Koreans from other regions of the world, a south Korean press delegation, a visiting group of Jeju Islanders, \"the flower of reunification\" and \"the reunification bird of hope.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A German woman writer and many other foreign friends enjoyed a bird's-eye view of Lake Chon of clean and blue water and the splendid panorama of the Mt.

In this regard the DPRK can not but anatomically delve into the unjustness of the U.S. proposal once again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now the U.S. is talking about the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe DPRK, of course, has no objection to it. The point is the way of reaching the goal of denuclearization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The key to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is for the U.S. to abandon its hostile policy towards the DPRK and take goodwill measures to convince the DPRK of this. For this, the U.S. should commit itself to the renunciation of its hostile policy towards the DPRK and, as its first-stage step toward compensation commensurate with it, lift the economic sanctions and blockade against the DPRK, remove it from the list of \"sponsors of terrorism\" and directly join in energy compensation scaled at 2 million kw in reward for the announcement of the denuclearization target by the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is trying to put a sort of psychological pressure on the DPRK, mumbling that \"there will be no reward for wrong doings\", but this is a foolish dream. If the U.S. is not interested in the proposal for \"reward for freeze,\" the two sides may go their own ways. The U.S. should not dream of freeze without reward.

Korean Authorities Urged to Withdraw Decision on Troop Dispatch \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 10 (KCNA) -- The south Korean authorities additionally dispatched troops to Iraq on August 3 despite strong opposition and denunciation at home and abroad.\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says in a signed commentary: This is an anti-national and anti-popular act of diametrically challenging the demand of the whole nation and a servile and despicable treacherous act as it betrays the dignity, security and interests of the nation, yielding to the outside forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities talked a lot about \"interests\" to justify the troop dispatch. By \"interests\" they meant an \"alliance\" with the U.S. It is their contention that the lives and properties of the people and the dignity and interests of the Korean nation should be sacrificed to keep this \"alliance\" alive. Do the south Korean people really need such an \"alliance\" and how can this be in the interests of south Korea? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the south Korean authorities are asking the U.S. to ensure \"peace on the Korean peninsula\" in return for their troop dispatch to Iraq, the commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no need to explain that the U.S. moves to escalate the tension through the arms buildup and plays with fire to invade the north are not aimed to seek a peaceful negotiated solution to the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is a foolish self-contradictory behaviour to offer troops to the foreign forces in their war of aggression, while crying out for averting a war to be launched by outside forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The same can be said of other pending issues including the relocation of U.S. troops and transfer of the U.S. military base in south Korea. Endless is the greed of the U.S. whose true colors as a wolf remain unchanged. The south Korean authorities get nothing but slaps in their faces for offering everything to their master. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should withdraw the dispatched troops and revoke the decision on troop dispatch, though belatedly, bearing deep in mind that they would be held accountable for their treacherous acts and the serious consequences to be entailed by them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
