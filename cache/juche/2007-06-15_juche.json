They are working hard to install a pro-U.S. regime there by whipping together remnants of the military fascist dictatorship and wire-pulling them behind the scene, while perpetrating ceaseless moves for a war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The June 15 joint declaration can neither be implemented nor can the reunification of the country be achieved as long as the U.S. and its lackeys the pro-U.S. conservative forces including the \"Grand National Party\" are allowed to go on the rampage to bring back to south Korea the dark period of the fascist dictatorship and the Cold War era of confrontation with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The patriotic people in the south are waging a strenuous struggle to oust foreign forces from south Korea and shatter the moves of the pro-U.S. conservative forces to return to power under the slogan of a great alliance against the U.S. and conservatism as they are well aware of the U.S. imperialists' true colors as aggressors and the fascist and anti-reunification nature of the GNP through history and their bitter experiences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As they are led by Kim Jong Il, a peerless patriot and the great Songun brilliant commander, the Koreans will emerge victorious in the struggle to implement the June 15 joint declaration and surely greet the day of glory when they live a happy life holding in high esteem the sun of Songun in the reunified country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The vanguard fighters and patriotic people from all walks of life in south Korea will step up their dynamic march for independent reunification under the uplifted banner of \"By our nation itself,\" cherishing the immense national pride of holding in high esteem Kim Jong Il who ushered in the June 15 era of reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This shows that they are trumpeters on the payroll of the aggressive outside forces and reactionary conservative forces including the Grand National Party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The media of the era of \"By our nation itself\" should and must publish articles promoting the reconciliation and unity of the fellow countrymen and encouraging the movement for independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no room in the June 15 era of reunification for the phony media unburdening themselves of a nasty spate of delirium, ignorant of the interests of the nation and the desire of the fellow countrymen.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He keenly experienced the sorrow and misfortune of a ruined nation, cultivating hatred for the Japanese imperialists and the spirit of resistance to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The deep care and guidance of President Kim Il Sung were the wherewithal and nutritive elements by which he could grasp the truth of the revolution and grow to be a true revolutionary with an indomitable fighting spirit, stubborn will and noble traits and virtues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He devoted himself to the cause for the fatherland and nation with a firm faith that the Korean revolution was sure to win under the leadership of the President and the liberation of the country and the final victory of the revolution could be achieved only when protecting him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He took as the maxim the speech of the President at the Mingyuegou Meeting held in December 1931 and made all efforts he could to successfully accelerate the work with the Chinese Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Deceived by the Japanese imperialists' national alienation policy and pernicious propaganda, the Chinese anti-Japanese units ill thought about Korean revolutionaries.  He boldly went among the units and led them to unswervingly take the true road of anti-Japanese struggle with his flawless Chinese and speech, flexible tactics and extraordinary knowledge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He also awakened intellectuals, handicraftsmen, small traders and even minor landlords as well as workers and peasants in the Antu area to rally them under the anti-Japanese banner and render positive support to the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle, thus making a prominent contribution to consolidation of mass foundation for the anti-Japanese armed struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Chol Ju died a heroic death at a sudden encounter with enemies near Chechangzi on June 14, 1935. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was, indeed, an indomitable revolutionary soldier who upheld President Kim Il Sung with his confidence and obligation.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Ademas, deviene el noble ideal signado del patriotismo y el amor a la nacion, apoyado y consentido unanimemente por la nacion coreana. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Sin embargo, algunos medios de prensa conservadores, al abandonar su postura de principios, denigran el citado ideal, fomentan el enfrentamiento con el Norte y congelan la reconciliacion y la unidad de la nacion, lo cual demuestra que ellos funcionan como plumiferos pagados al servicio de las fuerzas foraneas agresoras y las conservadoras reaccionarias como el \"Gran Partido Nacional\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Los medios de prensa de esta epoca de \"Entre nosotros, los connacionales\" deberan escribir los articulos, que contribuyan a lograr la reconciliacion y la unidad de la nacion y a impulsar el movimiento por la reunificacion independiente. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Los seudomedios de prensa, que propagan disparates sin saber cuales son los intereses de su nacion ni distinguir la aspiracion nacional, no tienen derecho a subsistir en esta era de reunificacion del 15 de Junio.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
