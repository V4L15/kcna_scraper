But you cannot win a revolutionary comrade for 1,000 pieces of gold.\"\r\n   \"Matters concerning the political lives of people cannot be rounded off.\"\r\n   \"A person who cannot love people, cannot make a revolution.\"\r\n   \"Unless you know how to love comrades, you cannot receive comradely love.\"\r\n   \"Even if parents are revolutionaries, their children will not necessarily be revolutionaries.\"\r\n   \"Where there is love, there is hate.\"\r\n   \"If one knows oneself, one becomes a revolutionary, if one does not know oneself, one becomes a slave.\"\r\n   \"Conscience is the mirror of action, and the measure by which to distinguish truth from untruth.\"\r\n   \"A man's conscience is the same as his heart.\"\r\n   \"It is a human virtue to repay other's kindness with kindness.\"\r\n   \"The value of a new thing cannot be measured without a new measure.\"\r\n   \"Without originality, nothing new can be created.\"\r\n   \"The poverty of philosophy leads to the poverty of thought, and the poverty of thought leads to the poverty of creation.\"\r\n   \"Literary style is a product of knowledge and enthusiasm.\"\r\n   \"People see, hear, feel and receive things according to the degree of their knowledge.\"\r\n   \"People can express themselves according to the degree of their knowledge.\"\r\n   \"To love our things and treat them carefully is love for the fatherland and Juche.\"\r\n   \"One must be an enthusiastic patriot before being a scientist.\"\r\n   \"Even if you read foreign literature, your spirit should be your country's.\"\r\n   \"True patriotism is in the struggle for fatherland unification.\"\r\n   \"If we delayed even a step the education of the next generation, the advance of our fatherland will be delayed 10 steps.\"\r\n   \"Words are the man.\"\r\n   \"There are words behind words.\"\r\n   \"If words are superfluous, vocabulary is poor.\"\r\n   \"Speaking is in itself action.\"\r\n   \"Literature is  an art of words.\"\r\n   \"A single revolutionary poem can be worth 10 million spears.\"\r\n   \"Art is the product of thought and enthusiasm.\"\r\n   \"Where there is life, there are music and songs.\"\r\n   \"Human life without music like a garden without flowers.\"\r\n   \"True poetic words can be found in the words of the people.\"\r\n   \"The words of a song should be a fine poem.\"\r\n   \"Schematization is a wall that separates literature from readers.\"\r\n   \"The popular masses are the wisest critics.\"\r\n   \"A person who does not know the beauty of flowers, cannot grow them.\"\r\n   \"Enthusiasm is a great source of creation.\"\r\n   \"My political philosophy is the Juche idea.\"\r\n   \"Think a hundred times, and choose once.\"\r\n   \"A person becomes strong when he knows himself, and becomes weak when he does not know himself.\"\r\n   \"A person with a high thought and will, has a high character.\"\r\n   \"One's beauty is not to be found in one's features but in one's thought.\"\r\n   \"Cries without creation are like thunder without rain.\"\r\n   \"If creation is discovery, imitation is repetition.\"\r\n   \"Man's noblest joy is in creation.\"\r\n   \"A miracle is not an accident given by Heaven, but a necessity given by the people.\"\r\n   \"Speed is in the hearts of the popular masses.\"\r\n     \r\n"
