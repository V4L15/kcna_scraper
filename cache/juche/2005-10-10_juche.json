            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on Great Mother Party, WPK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 9 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today carries an editorial article headlined \"The Workers' Party of Korea is the great mother party.\"\r\n The lengthy article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The development of the WPK as a mother party is the historic summing-up of the 60-year building of the Party. \r\n To develop the Party as a mother party is the fundamental requirement of the building of the socialist ruling party. The Party guided by the Juche idea has been built and strengthened as a mother party since its foundation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Party has carried out its duty as the mother party responsible for the destiny of the people for tens of years last. The people call  the Party the  mother party from the bottom of their  hearts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The development of the Party as the great mother party is of great significance in building a revolutionary party and accomplishing the cause of the Juche revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With the successful accomplishment of the cause of mother party building the relationship between the Party and the popular masses has become the most solid ideological and intentional relationship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The bosom of the Party is that of the great mother as it leads the people to successfully carry out arduous revolution . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With the accomplishment of the cause of mother party building in the country the Party and the people have become a community of destiny. \r\n Unshakable is the will of the Party to do anything and spare nothing  for the sake of the people and for  their happiness. \r\n We can proudly say that we have achieved the invincible kindred unity of the Party and the people like that of mother and her children, the most solid and vital unity that others used to yearn after as an ideal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The main factor of terming the WPK the great mother party lies in embodying the benevolent politics and the Songun politics together in party building and activities under the banner of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history of the Party developing into the great mother party has fully demonstrated to the era and the humankind that the benevolent politics and the Songun politics are the most powerful socialist political mode that helps give a most dignified life to the people, build the ground of happiness and defend the destiny and future of the people firmly in any worst adversity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The biggest fortune for a party and people is to be led by a good leader and the biggest misfortune is to be led by a bad leader. It is the valuable truth proved by the 60-year-long history of party building that a party can become a mother party only when it has the great father of the people, who takes responsibilities for their destiny to the end , at the head of the party and army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK is a great party which has perfectly practiced the intrinsic requirements of a mother party in view of its guiding idea, historical root and tradition and its noble spirit of service for the people. No change can be seen in its popular and revolutionary characters no matter how much water may flow under the bridge and how many generations may be replaced. We should make the history of the Party that of the great mother party that forms a harmonious whole with the popular masses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To conduct party building and activities as President Kim Il Sung planned, intended and showed by his practical model and do everything in his way, this is the way of steadily strengthening and developing the Party into the mother party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article calls for glorifying leader Kim Jong Il's exploits in party building as the eternal foundation of the Party and the valuable treasure of the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history of the Party will be exalted as the history of the harmonious whole of the party, the army and the people as long as Kim Jong Il stands in the van of the Party and the revolution and there are the most correct idea of mother party building and the good army and people who have shared  sweets and bitters with the Party for a long time, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Herein lie the true appearance, invincible might and high dignity of the WPK which has been strengthened under the wise guidance of the President and Kim Jong Il. \r\n The WPK has led the popular masses to record a proud history of great change and creation in the revolution and construction for the last 6 decades.\r\n True to the Juche-oriented revolutionary idea and line of the President, the Party successfully carried out the deep-going social revolutions at two stages and two rounds of difficult rehabilitation and construction to establish the progressive socialist system and sped up the three revolutions, ideological, technical and cultural, under the banner of uninterrupted revolution to build the socialist country of Juche shining with independence in politics, self-supporting in economy and self-reliance in national defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the leadership of the President, the invincible and iron-willed commander, the Party led the fierce Fatherland Liberation War against the armed invasion of the U.S. imperialists and its stooges to victory to honorably defend the freedom and independence of the country and smashed the imperialists' every persistent move for aggression and war to resolutely defend the sovereignty of the country and the gains of the revolution.\r\n In the last one decade, the period of the most stern trial in particular, the Party held fast to the line of attaching importance to ideology, the political line of unity, the Songun revolutionary line in the revolution and construction to consolidate and develop the unity and cohesion of our society into the single-minded unity of the whole Party, the entire army and all the people based on comradeship centered on the leader and significantly strengthen the political and ideological position of the revolution and trained the Korean People's Army into a strong revolutionary army prepared politically and ideologically and in military technique on the basis of the successes achieved in the struggle to model the entire army on the Juche idea and thus consolidated the military position of the DPRK as an impregnable fortress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Party has bravely smashed the imperialist reactionaries' vicious moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK in reliance on the political, ideological and military might of the country, achieved victory after another in defending socialism and waged a persevering struggle to build modern production bases and many monumental edifices of eternal value in different parts of the country and lay a firm material foundation for the building of a prosperous and powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK has applied the idea of national independence to open up a turning phase in accomplishing the cause of national reunification and remarkably expanded the external relations of the country and boosted the international solidarity with the Korean revolution thanks to its independent foreign policy.\r\n We are faced with historic tasks to step up the building of a great prosperous powerful socialist nation, speed up the independent reunification of the country and achieve the final victory of the cause of Juche, the cause of Songun under the leadership of the great Party.\r\n We should uphold the President as the eternal leader of the Party and the people, glorify his idea and exploits performed in party building and more firmly establish the Party unitary leadership system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should politically and ideologically defend the headquarters of the revolution with our lives and thoroughly implement the line and policies of the Party. \r\n The single-minded unity of the Party and the revolutionary ranks is the mainstay of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The whole Party, the entire army and all the people should unite close on the basis of the revolutionary comradeship to augment the might of our revolutionary ranks in every way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should fully embody the Party's Songun politics, an all-powerful treasured sword for victory in our revolution, under any circumstances and conditions and direct primary efforts to the strengthening of the KPA and the development of the national defence industry to consolidate the military position of our revolution as firm as an iron-wall. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should step up the economic construction to bring about a surge on all the fronts of the socialist construction and occupy the high peak of a great prosperous powerful nation as early as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will achieve the three forms of cooperation--national independence, peace against war and reunification and patriotism--under the banner of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration to build a powerful, independent and prosperous reunified country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will firmly unite with the people of all the countries advocating independence in the idea of our foreign  policy-- independence, peace and friendship-- to resolutely defend global peace and security and wage a vigorous struggle to build an independent, peaceful and friendly new world.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
