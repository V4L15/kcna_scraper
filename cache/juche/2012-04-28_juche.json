This cannot but arouse concern.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMany countries around the world are making efforts to prevent the revival of militarism and fascism, recalling the past history of wars which brought disasters to them. It is, however, only Japan that behaves quite contrary to this trend.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Japanese reactionaries are regarding the shrine as a center for reviving fascism that had been used as a tool for infusing militarist ideology into people, militarist ruling mode and a lever for overseas aggression in the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThrough the visit to the shrine they praise the war criminals and imbue Japanese people with the idea of defending the history of aggression, not guilty consciousness, in a bid to create social atmosphere of militarism and reinvasion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is their ulterior intention to hurl the people including the younger generation into overseas aggression when an appropriate time comes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is quite natural for the international community to closely follow the moves of the Japanese reactionaries keen on overseas aggression to inject militarism into people, and heighten vigilance against Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs a matter of fact, there is mounting fever in Japan to visit the shrine and the number of official visitors to it is on the daily increase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis cannot but reflect the extreme militarist tendency prevailing throughout Japanese society, going beyond the scope of individual ultra-nationalists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan is prevalent with ultra-right social trend whereby dangerous aggression forces calling for overseas expansion and militarism are rampant, oblivious of the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan's so-called Yasukuni culture means the revival of fascism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe harder the ultra-right conservative forces work to turn back the trend of history, agitating a war, the gloomier Japan's prospect will be.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe road taken by Japan at present leads to the same destruction as what militarist Japan met in the past."
