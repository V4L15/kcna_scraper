The greatness of Kim Il Sung's revolutionary exploits was clearly proved in this period. He is, indeed, an eternal leader as he provided a great revolutionary heritage which indicates a bright way for the country and the revolution to follow and leads them to a victory and prosperity even today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean revolution has entered a new historical stage of progress where Kim Il Sung's idea and cause are being fully carried to accomplishment in all fields under the banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean revolution can advance successfully and win victory only when it defends and glorifies his revolutionary exploits based on them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a fundamental requirement for advancing the Korean revolution along the road of Songun only to glorify his revolutionary heritage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His revolutionary idea and exploits are powerfully encouraging the army and the people of the DPRK to advance along the road of the Songun revolution. Fully reflected in his revolutionary exploits are a bright blueprint for the building of a great prosperous powerful nation, a noble example of patriotism to be displayed in the struggle for its materialization and the principle of struggle and creation to be observed generation after generation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people neither vacillate nor hesitate as they have a solid foundation for building a prosperous country that had been bequeathed to them by him. The army and people of the DPRK will in the future, too, bring about the great prosperity of the country with the might of Juche under the uplifted red flag of socialism as desired by him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il's Songun leadership faithfully serves the purpose of successfully materializing Kim Il Sung's idea and cause. The editorial calls on the whole party and army and all the people to singleheartedly uphold Kim Jong Il's Songun leadership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson editorially notes that thanks to Kim Jong Il,  Kim Il Sung's revolutionary life and immortal exploits will shine forever along with the victorious advance of the revolutionary cause of Juche.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean Judicial Authorities' Unreasonable Decision Flailed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 1 (KCNA) -- The south Korean judicial authorities at a recent \"final trial\" of those related to the \"remittance to the north\" sentenced all of them to one to three years in prison or two to four years of stay of execution, after confirming the original verdict of \"guilty\" passed on them.\r\n A spokesman for the Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee in a statement issued on March 31 in this regard said history will certainly punish the anti-reunification group in the name of justice and patriotism and declare not guilty those who were unreasonably charged with \"crimes.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The committee bitterly denounces the recent decision made by the south Korean judicial authorities as a challenge to the historic Pyongyang summit meeting and the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and as an anti-national act of deliberately laying a hurdle in the way of achieving reconciliation and unity between the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The committee makes it clear that the nation does not recognize the recent court decision as it was made by the judicial authorities caving in to the pressure of the ultra-right conservative forces of south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a publicly recognized fact that the issue of \"remittance to the north\" can neither be a subject to investigation nor punishment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the Grand National Party cooked up a system of \"special inspection\" and kicked off a racket of \"trials\" through arbitrary practices and pressure. With nothing can it retrieve the consequences entailed by them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A businessman who took the lead in the economic cooperation between the north and the south met a tragic death and those who exerted efforts to put an end to the confrontation and mistrust between the fellow countrymen became subject to harsh punishment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality proves that the judicial authorities of south Korea, who are utterly indifferent to the desire of the fellow countrymen, are a group of man-hunters as they shut their eyes to the thieves and let them lord it over the National Assembly but brandished swords at those who spent a petty amount of money in the dealing between the fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those who go against the trend of the times and the mindset of the people are bound to meet destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The committee will as ever push forward inter-Korean economic cooperation to achieve national reconciliation and unity and promote co-existence, co-prosperity and common interests of the nation in keeping with the desire and wish of all the Koreans to pave a wide avenue for independent reunification through national cooperation under the banner of the joint declaration.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
