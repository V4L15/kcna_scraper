            "content": "Unpardonable flunkeyist acts\r\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 23 (KCNA) -- The South Korean chief executive recently revealed his flunkeyist nature again at a confab with the Japanese Prime Minister on a visit to Seoul.   During his visit to Japan last October, he had announced a humiliating \"declaration on partnership\". After returning to South Korea, he sold off fishing grounds of South Korea to Japan, took a measure of opening the door for corrupt mass culture of Japan and adopted a \"policy on combined use of Chinese characters\" in an attempt to curry favor with the Japanese authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   During the confab, he talked about a \"new future-oriented partnership\" aimed at rendering political, economic, military, social, cultural and all other domains of South Korea dependent upon Japan. Worse still, he went the length of opening it to the public in a \"joint communique.\"   What cannot be overlooked is the fact that \"close cooperation among South Korea, Japan and the United States\" over the \"nuclear suspicion\" and \"missile threats\" from the DPRK was reaffirmed at the aggressive and unequal confab.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In this connection, the South Korean ruler cried that the north's missiles pose threats to Japan and make even greater threats against South Korea.   It is clear that the Japanese and South Korean authorities have no faculty of thinking to properly discern between facts and \"suspicion\", satellite and \"missile.\" This is proved by the fact that, although more than half a year has passed since the DPRK launched its first satellite last August, they are still insisting that it is a \"missile launch.\" Now, their \"common view\" about the \"missile launch\" is arousing hatred as well as astonishment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese and South Korean people feel nothing but contempt for shameless acts of those politicians who are vociferating about \"peace of Asia\" and \"needs of the times heading for the 21st century\", shunning or distorting stark historical facts.   They should have lent their ears to the fact that, synchronizing with the South Korean visit of the Japanese Prime Minister, South Korean people turned out in protest actions against the visit, loudly shouting it is impossible to establish future-oriented South Korea-Japan relations as long as Japan refuses to liquidate its past. \r\n   \r\n"

Korea's arms buildup program against DPRK\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 23 (KCNA) -- A few days ago, the South Korean authorities confirmed and published a \"mid-term 5-year plan for arms buildup\" aimed at invading the north.   Under the plan, military spending will increase by 4 to 6% on an annual average for 5 years from next year. Thus, a total sum of 81,500 billion won will be spent for a military purpose.   Of the total sum, 26,700 billion won will be allocated for arms buildup.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities plan to develop new-type missiles to replace the existing Nike ground-to-air missiles by expending a colossal amount of money. They also plan to build a 7,000-ton \"aegis\" destroyer and introduce up-to-date fighters and an unmanned reconnaissance plane to reinforce the three services of the army.   The South Korean authorities are now crying that if the \"plan\" is carried out, South Korea will have an early warning system and can keep \"watch\" over the north and \"hit major targets through long-distance flights.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What they stress more than anything else in preparations for a war against the north is \"getting edge over the north in military power.\"   Under the motto of \"maximizing military power,\" they introduced long-distance transport helicopters from the United States last year and deployed latest destroyers. Besides, they signed a new arms contract of 8.2 billion U.S. dollars with the United States.   The \"mid-term 5-year plan for arms\" fully discloses the design of the South Korean authorities to invade the north. \r\n\r\n"

It is a variant of theory of \"unification through absorption\" and an extension of the outdated theory of confrontation with communism.   Describing the decadent \"liberal democracy\" as \"standard of unification\" is a revelation of the ulterior intention of the present \"government\" that is pursuing \"sunshine policy\" and \"engagement policy\" towards the north.

And the South Korean red cross went to the length of sending a \"letter\" to international human rights organizations including the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Amnesty International on Mar. 15 in an attempt to internationalize this issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The statement says:&nbsp;&nbsp; Such behaviour of the South Korean rulers has no validity= it is motivated by a new smear campaign to refuse their repatriation.   The Korean Measure Committee for Rescuing Unconverted Long-Term Prisoners in South Korea, in the name of all the fellow countrymen, brands this move of the South Korean authorities as a blatant challenge to the demands of international law for human rights and the humanitarian principle and bitterly condemns it.   The unconverted long-term prisoners do not hail from the south but have always demanded their repatriation to the north as they had been crippled due to a long prison life. Moreover, they have no families in South Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There are in the northern half of Korea no \"ROK army's POWs\" or \"those kidnapped by the north\" noisily mouthed by the South Korean authorities. There are only those who voluntarily joined the People's Army and fought after refusing to serve any more as cannon fodder of the U.S. during the past Fatherland Liberation War and those who came over to the north through different channels.   Getting married and enjoying a happy life with their families and relatives as citizens of the DPRK, they have expressed their will not to go back to cursed South Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities' call for \"exchanging\" those who expressed their will not to go back to South Korea as they are enjoying a worthy life with their families in the north with those in South Korea who wish to come back to the north where their families await them is very unjustifiable both from the humanitarian point of view and in view of International Law. That was why  the successive South Korean rulers could not raise sort of \"exchange\". Nevertheless, the present rulers wearing the mask of \"people\" put up unreasonable conditions. This is nothing but their last resort to bar the repatriation of unconverted long-term prisoners, finding no pretext whatsoever to reject the north's just demand.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such move of the South Korean rulers is contrary to the \"sunshine policy\" and \"engagement policy\" on their lips. This is an immoral and rude act of applying  \"reciprocity\" rejected at home and abroad even to the humanitarian work.   If the unconverted long-term prisoners die before  being repatriated, the South Korean rulers will be held wholly responsible for it.   We strongly demand that all the unconverted long-term prisoners including the old Kim In So, Kim Yong Thae and Ham Se Hwan be repatriated unconditionally and immediately to the north where their families live, as wished by them. \r\n\r\n"

And they fabricated the numbers of \"those abducted by the north\" and of \"POWs,\" clamoring about \"condition of those abducted by the north\" and the \"survival of POWs\" before sending a \"letter\" calling for \"cooperation in \"repatriation\" to the UN commission on human rights and the Amnesty International.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their is a third-rate farce designed to mislead public opinion. It has neither grounds nor justification. It is one more anti-north smear campaign aimed at keeping the unconverted long-term prisoners from being sent back to the north.   For the present \"government\" to talk about \"feelings of the people\" is the height of impudence.   The unconverted long-term prisoners of the north origin do not belong to the \"ROK.\" Ever since they were taken prisoner they have all along earnestly called for their return to the north. While in prison for decades, they were handicapped. Worse still, they can no longer live in South Korea where they have no relations. So, they call for an early return to their hometowns in real earnest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As for the \"POWs\" and \"those abducted by the north\" advertised by the South Korean authorities, they are all citizens of the DPRK, who voluntarily defected to the north, yearning after the society established there. All of them made home and enjoy a happy life in the north. They are unanimous that they will not go back to cursed South Korea where colonial fascist rule is rampant.   The loud-mouthed \"exchange\" of the unconverted long-term prisoners, who are calling for return to the north where their families are waiting for them, with the people who do not want to go back to the south, enjoying all blessings with their families in the north, is  quite unreasonable either from the humanitarian point of view or in view of international laws. It runs counter to the \"sunshine policy\" on the lips of the present \"government.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Kim Dae Jung group, finding no reason whatsoever to refuse to meet the reasonable demands of the north for repatriation of the unconverted long-term prisoners, are peddling as a last resort the \"exchange,\" which is the application of the \"reciprocity\" even to the humanitarian issue, on the International Arena.   NDFSK, on behalf of all the South Koreans and all the fellow countrymen desirous of reconciliation, unity and reunification between the north and south of Korea, condemns in the strongest terms the Kim Dae Jung \"government\" for blocking the return to the north of the unconverted long-term prisoners, describing the \"exchange\" of the unconverted long-term prisoners with the people who defected to the north as \"feelings of the people.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The unethical and anti-reunification criminal refusal to send the unconverted long-term prisoners back to the north cannot be justified in any case. It will only bring bigger disgrace to them under the eyes of the international community.   The Kim Dae Jung group should immediately stop anti-humanitarian attempt to use the return of the unconverted long-term prisoners to the north for one more round of confrontation with the north, apologize for decades-long imprisonment of the unconverted long-term prisoners and unheard-of torture and maltreatment of them and immediately send them back to the north where their families are waiting for them, as demanded by them. \r\n\r\n"
