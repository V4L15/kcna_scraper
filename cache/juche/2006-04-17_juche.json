            "content": "Chollima Statue, Symbol of Juche Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 15 (KCNA) -- The Chollima Statue, symbol of Juche Korea, stands on Mansu Hill in Pyongyang.\r\n The statue, a People's Prize laureate work, was unveiled on April 15, Juche50 (1961).\r\n It, which depicts Chollima, a fabulous winged horse, reflects the heroic mettle of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The great upsurge of Chollima was effected in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea after the historic plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) convened in December Juche 45 (1956). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Upholding the revolutionary slogan \"Charge at the speed of Chollima!\" set forth by the WPK, the working class and people worked hard in the spirit of taking ten, nay, one hundred steps while others taking one step and wrought epoch-making miracles in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Enemies raved that the DPRK would not rise up even 100 years after. The Korean people, however, made a great leap forward of building the socialist industrial state in a brief span of time and ushered in the Chollima era, the era of national prosperity.\r\n Since then world people have called Korea the \"land of Chollima\".\r\n The construction of the statue was initiated by President Kim Il Sung and completed under his meticulous guidance. The feature of a worker holding high the \"Red Letter\" of the WPK Central Committee and a female peasant having a rice-sheaf in her arms who ride Chollima soaring high in the sky strikingly reflects the revolutionary spirit of the Korean people who are boundlessly faithful to the Party and the leader.\r\n The statue consists of a bronze sculpture and a granite sculptural stand. And the bronze sculpture is 14 meters high and 16 meters long. The height from the ground to the top of the \"Red Letter\" is 46 meters.    \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
