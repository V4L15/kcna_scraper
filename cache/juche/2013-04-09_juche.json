            "content": "Minju Joson critica venta de bomba de EE.UU. al Sur de Corea\r\nPyongyang, 9 de abril (ACNC) -- Segun fuentes extranjeras, Estados Unidos. decidio vender en mayo al ejercito titere surcoreano la bomba teledirigida por laser Bunker-Buster, disenada para atacar las instalaciones nucleares subterraneas de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\tHasta la fecha, EE.UU. vino restringiendo la exportacion al extranjero de esa arma sofisticada. Pero, quiere venderla ahora exclusivamente al ejercito surcoreano con el fin de desatar a toda costa la guerra nuclear en la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi revela el periodico Minju Joson en un comentario individual divulgado el dia 9 y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl imperio intensifica su campana para aplastar militarmente a la RPDC dando su enfoque a neutralizar el disuasivo nuclear de autodefensa de ella y desarmarla.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA citar una prueba de ello, se incremento bruscamente en los ultimos anos el numero de los efectivos norteamericanos asentados en el Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tActualmente, EE.UU. mantiene en suelo surcoreano mas de 37 mil efectivos, o sea, 9 mil mas que 28 mil, numero acordado con la parte surcoreana en 2008.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tParece que la ambicion de dominar el mundo hizo perder juicio a EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi EE.UU. quiere enfrentarse hasta el final con la RPDC, esta tampoco rehusara el enfrentamiento. Hacer probar a EE.UU. lo que es una guerra de verdad es la unanime voluntad y posicion del ejercito y el pueblo de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe actuar con prudencia justipreciando la realidad."
