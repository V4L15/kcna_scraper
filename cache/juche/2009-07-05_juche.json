            "content": "Kim Jong Il Provides Field Guidance to Tideland Reclamation Site on Taegye Islet\r\n Pyongyang, July 5 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il gave field guidance to the Tideland Reclamation Site on Taegye Islet in North Phyongan Province.\n\t\t\t\t\t After being briefed on the reclamation before a huge map showing a panoramic view of the site, he went round for hours the huge breakwaters and reclamation site to acquaint himself in detail with the work done there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He highly estimated the feats performed by the builders intensely loyal to the Party for having built one of the great structures to shine forever with the Songun era by courageously overcoming difficulties and ordeals and displaying popular heroism and unparalleled devotion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nature-remaking project as gigantic as the West Sea Barrage has been completed by the builders in the main, he noted, adding that this is a precious fruition of the persevering will of the Korean people to build a great prosperous powerful nation in this land with their own efforts and technology at any cost and a striking demonstration of the inexhaustible mental power of the heroic Korean people single-mindedly united around the party. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the builders in the tideland reclamation site fully determined to successfully carry out the behests of President Kim Il Sung are the brave conquerors of sea and indomitable fighters expanding the land of the country braving rough waves, he praised them as creators of the feats to be always remembered by the country and its people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then, he learned about the farming condition, while looking round paddy fields in the reclaimed tideland.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Feasting his eyes on a vast expanse of the fields which looks like a green carpet, he said that it was, indeed, spectacular scenery. And he expressed great satisfaction over the appearance of such huge socialist farm. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He indicated ways of doing successful farming in the reclaimed tideland, greatly pleased to hear that the grain yield was on the increase every year. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He put forward the tasks to be fulfilled to complete the reclamation project earlier than scheduled, saying that the reclamation of the tideland on Taegye Islet is one of the important undertakings for the development and prosperity of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underscored the need to take thorough-going measures for the supply of materials necessary for carrying out the project, noting that it is necessary to pay state attention to it as it is a difficult and vast one to harness nature. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Enlarging the area of the land of the country, its eternal treasure, is an important work for the happiness of the generations to come and the prosperity of the country, he said, expressing great expectation and conviction that the above-said builders would demonstrate once again the revolutionary spirit of the heroic working class of the DPRK by successfully carrying out this honorable and noble mission and duty. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Kim Phyong Hae, chief secretary of the  North Phyongan Provincial Committee of the WPK, Pak Nam Gi and Jang Song Thaek, department directors of the WPK Central Committee, Ju Kyu Chang and Ri Je Gang, first vice department directors of the WPK Central Committee."
