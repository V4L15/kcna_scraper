They ran wild to nip the young DPRK in its bud by hurling more than two million troops including their forces, mercenaries from its 15 satellite countries, the south Korean puppet army and Japanese militarists, and huge war hardware into the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But they could never subdue the Korean people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the 3-year hard-fought war, the Korean army and people defeated the U.S. imperialist aggressors by giving full play to their matchless bravery and popular heroism. They thus honorably defended the freedom and independence of their country and demonstrated the dignity and spirit of the nation to the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that it has been long since the war ended on the Korean peninsula but lasting peace has not yet settled on this land, Rodong Sinmun says:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Far from drawing a lesson from their ignominious defeat in the past Korean War, the U.S. has worked hard to provoke another war century after century, not dropping its wild ambition for invasion of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present south Korean authorities have turned their face away from the DPRK's call for ushering in a new history of improved north-south relations and independent reunification in the idea of By Our Nation Itself. They are only getting hell-bent on boosting \"alliance\" with the U.S., slapping sanctions against the DPRK and staging drills for a nuclear war against it, while hyping \"nuclear threat from the north\", just like the former conservative regime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation calls on all compatriots at home and abroad to turn out in the nationwide struggle for achieving the country's peace and reunification by foiling the moves of the bellicose forces within and without to ignite a war again.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson also appeals to all the compatriots in the north and the south and abroad to turn out as one in the nationwide struggle for driving the U.S. imperialists out of south Korea, preserving peace on the Korean peninsula and opening up a broad avenue to independent reunification."
