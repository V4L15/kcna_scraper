Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 30 (KCNA) -- The South Korean people's struggle for peace against the Iraqi war of the U.S. is a just struggle for protecting peace, universal idea of humankind, and life and dignity of people, says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At least 70 national assemblymen, including those of the ruling Democratic Party of South Korea, set themselves against the troop dispatch to the Iraqi war projected by the South Korean authorities, saying that the mobilizing of the South Korean people for the unjustifiable war deserves moral and political denunciation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the world peace-loving people unanimously said, the Iraqi war provoked by the U.S. is an illegal war of aggression which can not be justified in any case. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. ignited a Iraqi war under the pretext of disarming Iraq, acting as an interpol no body authorizes it to do and ignoring the U.N. that is a vicious challenge to the sovereignty of an independent state and an unpardonable encroachment upon the sovereignty of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush hawks are going to unleash a war against the DPRK on the basis of the experiences in the on-going Iraqi war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In a nutshell, the Iraqi war is a test war for the second Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the South Korean authorities are keen on a farce for \"support\" to such dangerous war and troop dispatch. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are trying to justify their unjust moves, clamoring about \"interests of the state\" and \"wise settlement of the nuclear issue, but the projected troop dispatch is a criminal act of welcoming the United States' war of aggression against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From this point of view, it is only too just that the South Korean people denounce the U.S. war of aggression against Iraq and the authorities following it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their misbehaviour against the interests of the nation deserves curses and denunciation by all the fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the fellow countrymen should frustrate the war and confrontation efforts of the United States and its followers through the national cooperation and turn out in a struggle for national sovereignty and peace.    \r\n\r\n"

The issue of such bonds is intended only for the prosperous development of the country and the promotion of the people's wellbeing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The bonds have three forms: 500-won bond, 1,000-won bond and 5,000-won bond. They will remain valid for ten years from may 1, Juche 92 (2003) to the end of April, Juche 102 (2013). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The bonds will be redeemed by payment of drawn prize money and principal sum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lottery on the bonds will be held once in every six months in the first two years from this year and then once in a year, on the principle of openness and objectivity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The total principal sum of the bonds drawing a losing number will be redeemed on a phased basis by the annual state budget from December Juche 97 (2008) to the expiry of the term of validity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those buying many bonds will be duly rewarded politically and materially in recognition of their patriotic devotion to the building of a powerful nation.    \r\n\r\n"
