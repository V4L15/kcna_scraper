            "content": "CPRC Spokesman Urges S. Korean Authorities Not to Forget Lesson from Incident in August Last Year\r\n Pyongyang, August 23 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Country (CPRC) of the DPRK issued a statement on Tuesday, in which it said that it is the proud history and tradition of the DPRK that it has recorded only legendary stories of victory in the fierce confrontation with the enemies at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t The great victory won by the DPRK by which it saved the destiny of the country and nation from a hair-trigger crisis in August last year was recorded as the most significant event in the annals of honor, the statement said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Looking back upon those days in August last year, they were the days of extremely dangerous and acute stand-off when the military conflict and the danger of war reached the zenith on the Korean peninsula after the cease-fire.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At a time when the world was watching with great concern the war machine that began to operate on the Korean peninsula, it was none other than supreme leader Kim Jong Un who made a bold decision which no other person can take and brought about a dramatic turn for the country, nation and compatriots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The peerlessly great man Kim Jong Un, cherishing the noble mission for protecting the country and the nation, took all possible measures to smash the military provocations by the U.S. and the south Korean warmongers at a go. He initiatively provided high-ranking urgent contact unprecedented in the history of north-south dialogue with the arms being leveled at the enemies and opened up a breakthrough to winning a great victory without blood-shed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet authorities could not but come out to the high-ranking dialogue, in fear of the destructive ruin they would face in the second Korean war. The adoption of a dramatic agreement between the north and the south helped remove a big danger of war and opened an important phase for turning the situation in favor of the DPRK and improving inter-Korean relations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A radical turn would have been brought about in the situation of the Korean peninsula if the agreement adopted by the north and the south one year ago had been valued and implemented. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the Park Geun Hye group has persistently taken issue with the DPRK, frequently talking about \"nuclear threat from the north\" and \"provocation\", thereby laying the blame for worsening inter-Korean relations and catastrophe of the situation on the Korean peninsula at the door of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even at this moment, the Park Geun Hye group is running the whole gamut of vicious and despicable moves to attain the sinister aim of achieving \"unification of social systems\" while talking about the \"collapse of the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The stupid and ignorant Park group opted to take the road of war, confrontation and permanent division, not the way of peace, improved relations and reunification while persistently refusing to respond to the offer of good faith made by the compatriots in the north. Therefore, it is fated to meet only miserable destruction and death.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the puppet group perpetrates a ridiculous provocation again, oblivious of the lesson taught by the August incident last year, the DPRK will never miss the golden opportunity but launch a great war for national reunification of justice and thus annihilate the group of traitors to the last man and blow up the bases of the U.S. imperialists, the chieftain of aggression, on the earth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The most just and independent DPRK has the proud tradition of winning victories but the pro-U.S. group of traitors is fated to sustain a shameful defeat as it is selling off the nation to outside forces and hurting the destiny of the compatriots."

South Korea has to shoulder the financial burden of 25 billion US dollars owing to the \"shuttle diplomacy on pro-north countries\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean people carry on their protest actions, saying that \"sanctions against the north lead to sanctions against the south\" and \"south Korean people are being exhausted due to Park Geun Hye.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even a U.S. credit appreciation company and world biggest investment and banking company said that Park Geun Hye brought an exorbitant amount of damage in the economic field of south Korea and exercised a negative influence on creditability by shutting down the Kaesong Industrial Zone, urging foreigners to restrain investment in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As seen above, the south Korean authorities' \"unprecedented sanctions against the north\" bring political and economic crisis to south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the Park Geun Hye group is busy floating a false story in a bid to mislead public opinion at home and abroad.
