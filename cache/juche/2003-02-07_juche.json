They are expending a lot of energy, time and money on a variety of methods such as persuasion, appeasement, deception and threat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seems to regard such behaviour as some sort of generosity or respect for its dialogue partner or its \"leadership\" over the international community, but it is obvious that it is unsuitable for the U.S. styling itself a \"superpower\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In settling any issue in all social relations ranging from human relations to international relations, it is necessary to give priority to properly defining its bilateral and multilateral nature and provide those parties concerned with a chance to sit face to face and seek its negotiated settlement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, a product of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK, is a bilateral issue to be settled between the DPRK and the U.S. through negotiations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is, therefore, the only realistic way of fundamentally solving the nuclear issue and peacefully settling the serious crisis to conclude a non-aggression treaty between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Despite the fact that the nature of the issue and the way of settling it are so easy to understand, the U.S. is persistently trying to bring up it to the un only to make it complicated and create artificial difficulties in the way of its solution. Then why? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seeks to abuse the name of the international organization in a bid to justify its infringement upon the sovereignty of the independent state, a member state of the UN. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has no too much time, energy and money to expend in the light of its internal and external situation and its position. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThere are not always opportunities for the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had better respond to the negotiations with the DPRK without delay instead of wasting time in garnering support from others, unbecoming for the \"superpower\".    \r\n\r\n"

But the advertisement is no more than a smoke-screen to hoodwink the world public, slacken our strain and then make a forestalling attack on us. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the U.S. makes a surprise attack on our peaceful nuclear facilities it will spark off a total war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is foolish for the U.S. to think that we sit idle with folded arms to wait until it gives orders for a forestalling attack to be started. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will answer a forestalling attack with a powerful counterattack and a total war with a total war.    \r\n\r\n"

These are, however, nothing but a base and ridiculous challenge to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has applied sanctions against the DPRK for the past more than 50 years in a bid to strangle it. But those only proved to be blank firing and abortive as it did not work on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK does what it wants, standing unfazed in face of U.S. sanctions and blockade and it has grown stronger than ever before. It does not care whether the U.S. puts sanctions upon it or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has its own way of living. It can develop its own economy, science and technology as fast as it can to build an economically powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to review with cool head the failures and setbacks it suffered in pursuing the policy of sanctions against the DPRK over the past 50 years and reconsider it.
