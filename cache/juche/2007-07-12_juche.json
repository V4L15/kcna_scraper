            "content": "North-South Military Working-Level Talks Held \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 11 (KCNA) -- The north-south military working-level talks were held at the Thongil House in the portion of the north side in Panmunjom on Tuesday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present there was the delegation of the north side led by Korean People's Army Senior Colonel Pak Rim Su. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the talks the head of the north side's delegation accused the south Korean authorities of conducting a psychological warfare against the DPRK by use of handbill-scattering equipment and a variety of broadcasting media. He sited facts to prove that they are craftily slandering the headquarters of the revolution in the DPRK and the socialist system of Korean style by mobilizing even anti-DPRK organizations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went on to say: Both sides agreed to stop all propaganda and psychological operations against the other side on June 4, 2004 and reaffirmed on May 11 this year that they would more strictly abide by and implement the north-south military agreement already adopted. Nevertheless, the south side is persisting in the new form of psychological operation. This is an unpardonable criminal act of scrapping the bilateral military agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The attitude of the south side is a traitorous act of swimming against the trend of the June 15 era towards reconciliation, unity and reunification and an anti-peace move to deliberately dampen the aspiration and wishes of the whole nation to prevent the danger of war and achieve durable peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-DPRK psychological warfare of the south side is a military provocation timed to coincide with the intrusion of south Korean naval warships into the territorial waters of the north side which is being perpetrated in the West Sea of Korea almost everyday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The head of the delegation of the north side demanded the south side admit that all its psychological operations are a wanton violation of the bilateral agreement and make a formal apology to the north side. He, at the same time, urged the south side to immediately disband all the anti-DPRK organizations involved in the new psychological operations, severely punish their main culprits and take responsible measures against the recurrence of such psychological operations against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south side admitted the fact that such psychological operation was conducted against the DPRK and reiterated that it would take steps against the recurrence of such case. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The talks discussed other issues arising in the implementation of the joint press release adopted at the 5th north-south general-level military talks.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He was so stupid as to assert that one should not blame the United States because Japan would have come under the control of the Soviet Union but for the U.S. use of atomic bombs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Extremely reckless remarks made by Japanese mandarins including the outbursts let loose by the minister of Health, Labor and Welfare describing women as \"baby-making machine\" bring into bolder relief the weakness and base nature of the Abe regime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Abe team is becoming adamant in denying even the sexual servitude for the Imperial Japanese Army which had been admitted by its predecessors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Regarding the diplomacy of depending on the United States as the cornerstone of its foreign policy, the Abe group is going extremely zealous in supporting U.S. foreign policy for aggression including its policy of \"anti-terrorism war,\" while taking an active part in the U.S. hostile moves against the DPRK and rendering cooperation in them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a tragedy in history and shame on the Japanese people that there exists on earth such a corrupt and despicable regime as the Abe regime made up of servile top class pro-U.S. sycophants and dirty political charlatans, concludes the commentary.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The health of women is being seriously deteriorated in many countries because of early marriage, unwanted pregnancy, sexual violence, malnutrition and so on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Every minute, a woman dies in childbirth. Every minute, the loss of a mother shatters a family and threatens the well-being of surviving children. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Reporter: Would you tell me about the activities of the DPRK government for the improvement of women's health and welfare? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chief: The government has long pursued the policy of encouraging population growth and paid deep attention to the health of women. As a result, the birth rate reached 44.7 percent in Juche 59 (1970). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While raising the social understanding of the population issue for the purpose of qualitative growth of population, the government has adopted Laws on Public Health, Families, Nursing and Upbringing of Children and others and thus improved the women's health and welfare in a systematic way. It has established a system under which the mothers and children are looked after at the expense of the state and society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In particular, the section doctor system constitutes a firm guarantee for prophylactic treatment to protect women's health. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Doctors of infirmaries and clinics in residential quarters take in charge of families. They have consultations concerning family planning and regularly look after the health of the pregnant women with responsibility. Women undergo medical check-up over ten times and five times respectively before and after childbirth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The medical service for mothers and children that had been confined only to obstetrical and gynecological departments was further expanded in the 1990s and a positive measure was taken to make men participate in protection of the reproductive health of women. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Reporter: When did the cooperation between the UNFPA and our country start from?\r\n Chief: It started from 1986. Now it is in the 4th cycle of assistance. During the previous cycles, many medical facilities and medicament were rendered to more than 80 hospitals including the provincial maternity hospitals. A progress has been made in the improvement of women's health. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Reporter: What activities have been done on the occasion of World Population Day? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chief: A special issue of the newspaper \"Population Newsletter\", organ of the centre, was published and distributed to organs concerned and a seminar and photo and poster shows were arranged in the Grand People's Study House on the theme for this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nVarious propaganda activities for the theme are being conducted.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Sin embargo, esta empantanada ahora en un atolladero por sus erroneas y fracasadas politicas internas y externas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Asi senala el periodico Rodong Sinmun en un comentario individual de este miercoles y continua: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@La muy compleja situacion politica creada en Japon en visperas de las elecciones de consejeros de la dieta es un producto inevitable de las reaccionarias politicas exteriores y interiores del gabinete de Abe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@En menos de 10 meses posteriores a la aparicion del ejecutivo de Abe se desataron uno tras otro los casos sensacionales como el suicidio de un ministro en activo, que nunca habia sucedido en ese pais despues del fin de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, la desaparicion de los registros vinculados a la pension, los escandalos y disparates de los altos funcionarios. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Recientemente, el recien dimitido ministro nipon de Defensa Kyuma produjo un gran revuelo al decir que no se debe reprochar a Estados Unidos por el lanzamiento de bombas atomicas porque si este no lo hubiera hecho, el pais isleno habria sido ocupado por la ex Union Sovietica. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Mientras tanto, el ministro japones de Salud y Trabajo insulto a las mujeres como \"maquinas de parir\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Todas esas palabras tan groseras resaltan la vulnerabilidad y la asquerosidad del ejecutivo liderado por Abe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Por otra parte, la banda de Abe niega porfiadamente hasta el crimen relativo a las \"consoladoras sexuales\" para las viejas tropas japonesas, lo cual fue admitido por sus antecesores. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Al tomar como piedra angular de su politica exterior la diplomacia sobre EE.UU., ella apoya activamente la politica exterior agresiva de este imperio, incluso la \"guerra antiterrorista\", y colabora de buena gana en las maniobras hostiles a Corea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@La existencia del poder de Abe tan corrupto y sucio, integrado por los aduladores a EE.UU y estafadores politicos de pesima calana, resulta una tragedia de la historia y una verguenza para el pueblo japones.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
