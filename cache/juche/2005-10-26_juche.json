But it held aloft the banner of building a great prosperous powerful nation, overcoming all sorts of trials and difficulties, and demonstrated its national power to the world by launching a satellite and declaring its possession of nukes, he noted, adding: This is the fruition of the wise leadership of the WPK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Speakers including Lyudmil Kostantinov, chief of the Bulgarian Group for the Study of the Juche Idea, underscored the fact that the WPK has advanced along a straight path of victory without committing even a single mistake or undergoing any twist and turn in the way of implementing its line for the last 60 years because it has solved all problems independently and creatively, invariably guided by the Juche idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the end of meetings the participants watched Korean films \"'Ever-Victorious Workers' Party of Korea', Grand Gymnastic and Artistic Performance for Celebrating the 55th Anniversary of the WPK\" and \"The Concrete Wall, Symbol of National Division.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, photo exhibitions and film shows took place in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and India in the period from Oct. 2 to 11.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Commenting on their action, Rodong Sinmun today denounces it as sympathy and instigation of the war frenzy of the bellicose forces at home and abroad.\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With the dangerous war scenario opened to the public the criminal plot of the U.S. and the south Korean bellicose elements for a war of aggression against the north has been brought to light again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is now massively introducing latest war equipment into south Korea and stepping up the strategic relocation of its armed forces there under the pretext of bolstering their combat power and relocation. This indicates that its scenarios to invade and seize the north are being put into practice.\r\n The scheme of the south Korean authorities to harm the fellow countrymen by joining the foreign forces in their war moves is contrary to the desire of the nation and the trend of the times and an anti-national, anti-peace and anachronistic action for a war in the Korean Peninsula.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun Tuesday notes this in a signed article. It goes on:\r\n The reality proves that it is impossible to achieve national reunification, the true sovereignty of the country and national prosperity unless an end is put to the U. S. imperialists' policy of occupation of south Korea and their moves to provoke a new war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists chiefly responsible for the partition of the Korean Peninsula into two have built high political and physical barriers in a bid to block the Korean nation's development, prosperity, peace and independent reunification. It is due to the U.S. imperialists that the Korean nation with a history spanning 5,000 years still remains divided into the north and the south and has not yet achieved uniform development and prosperity in all fields of economy and social life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A tense situation always prevails in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is impossible to realize the people's desire for uniform development and prosperity wherever peace is disturbed and a tense situation persists. \r\n The June 15 era is the era of independent reunification in which the Koreans are paving the way for independent reunification through national reconciliation and unity. The Koreans are called upon to put a period to the U.S. policy of occupation of south Korea and drive the U.S. troops out of it in order to win back the sovereignty dearer than their life and soul and build a strong and prosperous reunified country to demonstrate the honor of the nation to the world, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The DPRK visit by President Hu Jintao expected soon will mark an important occasion in boosting the bilateral friendship. In this century this friendship is growing stronger with a bright prospect in conformity with the desires and interests of the two peoples. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Chinese people have made great successes by making energetic endeavors to turn their country into a modern socialist country, holding fast to the important thought of \"the three represents\" under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Hu Jintao. \r\n They are radically changing the appearance of their country with their own energies and technology and through their creative efforts and making a dynamic advance towards a higher goal. A new turning phase is now being brought about in the just struggle of the Chinese people to reunify the whole country on the principle of \"one country, two systems\". The policy of the Chinese party and government for peace and development and cooperation relations is commanding support and sympathy of the world and China's prestige and voice are rising in the international arena day by day. \r\n Everything is now going on well in China. The DPRK sincerely rejoices over this success as over its own. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the two peoples enjoy the best time in the history of DPRK-China friendship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the steadfast stand of the DPRK to steadily boost the friendship generation after generation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history of traditional DPRK-China friendship will make more dynamic progress in the future thanks to the concerted efforts of the parties, governments and peoples of the two countries.      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
