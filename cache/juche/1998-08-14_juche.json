Paektu and Kuwol after settling down here.\r\n   Noting that in the north he experienced the invincibility of the singlehearted unity and the inexhaustible might of the unity, O Ik Je stressed the Marshal is the brain and centre of the singlehearted unity.\r\n   The singlehearted unity of the DPRK is the only way for keeping the Korean nation alive and an indestructible weapon and invincible might, more powerful than A-bomb or H-bomb, he said.\r\n   He further said: \r\n   The people in the DPRK are now making a hard march for many reasons, but I could hardly see a shadow of desperation or sorrow in their faces.\r\n   What I have heard and seen in the north is their  march towards the future and their optimistic confidence. \r\n   This is the true features of the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n"

They intend to dampen the nation's enthusiasm for reunification, agitate for confrontation and \"unify Korea by prevailing over communism.\"\r\n   The chief executive, the \"Defence Minister\" and other warmongers of South Korea now make bellicose remarks against the north and incite war fever.\r\n   The chief executive on August 10 called for staging the Ulji military exercise as a \"real-war exercise.\" \"Defence Minister\" Chon Yong Thaek, who had declared the north \"sworn enemy,\" told reporters \"an unshakable outlook on the north and combat preparedness will be maintained till the unification of Korea.\"\r\n   Facts show where the source of disaster is on the Korean peninsula and that the present authorities of South Korea are warmaniacs who outdistance the \"civilian\" regime.\r\n   The United States' frantic war racket with the South Korean authorities who are bereft of reason is an act that negates the framework agreement with the DPRK and betrays the dialogue partner.\r\n   The United States and the South Korean authorities must give up the reckless war exercise, mindful that it will lead them to disgraceful ruin.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

We stated more than once with generosity that the south promotion headquarters could, together with delegates of the south preparatory committee, participate in the second and third rounds of working-level talks of the north, south and overseas preparatory committees which were scheduled to be held in Beijing on August 5 and 10.\r\n   The delegates of the south promotion headquarters, however,  failed to come out to the north-proposed talks.\r\n   We regret that the delegates of the south promotion headquarters have missed a chance to take part in the historic festival at Panmunjom.\r\n   If the South Korean authorities had not prohibited the delegates of the Pomminryon south headquarters preparatory committee from taking part in the talks, the delegates of the south promotion headquarters would have participated in the talks together with them.\r\n   The South Korean authorities formed an \"all-people council for national reconciliation and cooperation\" for the purpose of obstructing the festival, isolating the south headquarters of Pomminryon and the (South) Korean Federation University Student Councils, disintegrating dissident pro-democracy forces and fostering confrontation with the north among them.\r\n   It is attributable to the South Korean authorities' separatist moves that working-level talks to which delegates of the south promotion headquarters were invited could not be held.\r\n   The South Korean authorities must know that if they continue obstructing the festival, trying to divide the pro-reunification forces of the north, south and overseas and seeking confrontation in defiance of our warnings, it is  another intolerable crime against the nation.    \r\n\r\n"
