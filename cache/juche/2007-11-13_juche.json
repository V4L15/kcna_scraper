They are busying themselves with rash acts, asserting that they would hold a joint briefing and take up this matter at the Japan-U.S. summit talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aim sought by them in their oft-repeated call for adopting a permanent legislation is clearly proved by the remarks made by the Japanese prime minister. He uttered that a permanent law is required as the SDF may fail to immediately respond to the request of the international community because the SDF needs some time before going into action under the \"Law on Special Measures against Terrorism\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan regards its \"military cooperation with the U.S.\" as a golden opportunity to pave the way for overseas aggression. The Japanese authorities are complaining that the withdrawal of the MSDF from the Indian Ocean would result in lowering the efficiency of all maritime anti-terrorist activities. This is nothing but sophism to cover up their wicked intention and ambition for aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's militarist nature and sinister aims are being brought into bolder relief as the days go by. Japan's ballyhooing about \"international contribution\" is no more than a slogan for overseas aggression.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
