The purpose of the trial staged by the U.S. military is, in the final analysis, to create illusion among those who entertain disillusionment and skepticism about the U.S.-style \"human rights\" and continue fighting an \"anti-terror war\" for world domination. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is the world's tundra of human rights as it has no right to talk about human rights. The security of lives of people is wantonly violated and all sorts of crimes are taking place in an unbroken chain in the U.S. even at this hour amid a fierce competition for existence under the sway of the law of the jungle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Mass killings of peaceable inhabitants are being perpetrated by the U.S. troops without let-up in different parts of the world under the signboard of \"anti-terror war\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a mockery of human justice and conscience and an outright challenge to them for the U.S. to praise its brigandish \"human rights standard.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As for the \"human rights standard\" touted by the U.S. it is nothing but a brigandish theory of painting a good deed as a crime and vice versa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the human rights abuses by the U.S. are conducted in an organized way according to the instructions and orders of the U.S. administration and the brasshats guided by the above-said shameless theory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is sadly mistaken if it calculates it can don the veil of \"champion of human rights\" through such poor trial. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Mankind will certainly force the U.S. to face a stern judgment of history as it loves justice and peace and respects genuine human rights."
