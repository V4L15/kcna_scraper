            "content": "Japan's nuclear weaponization under fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 3 (KCNA) -- Two British-flagged transport ships with Japan-purchased plutonium on board left Cherbourg port, France, on Jan. 19. Minju Joson today carries a signed commentary in this regard.\r\n It says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has shipped Europe-reprocessed plutonium into its country several times since 1970 under the absurd pretext of providing fuel to its nuclear power plants. It claimed that the shipments were for \"peaceful purpose.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a downright lie. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is said that 85 tons of plutonium are enough to operate the existing nuclear power plants in Japan. However, the Japanese reactionaries plan to secure approximately 400 tons of plutonium by the year 2020. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is enough to make 60,000 nuclear weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the cherished desire of the Japanese reactionaries to go nuclear. To this end, they have made systematic preparations under all sorts of pretexts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has all technical conditions for nuclear weaponization. For example, it is necessary to compress nuclear matters by exploding high-performance charging gunpowder in one millionth second to detonate an atomic bomb. But Japan succeeded in developing hi-technology of detonating it in one ten millionth second. It also has all nuclear-related facilities and modern nuclear launch and delivery means. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Having made full preparations for the production of nuclear weapons, Japan intends to produce nukes and launch overseas aggression with those weapons when an opportunity presents itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these facts go to clearly prove that Japan is a harasser of peace and an arch criminal threatening not only peace and security in the Korean peninsula and the Asia-Pacific region but ecological environment and human existence.    \r\n\r\n"
