This undying exploit deeply touches all the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Ours is a great country which is triumphing thanks to the idea and politics of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His great idea and politics serve as a source of all our victories. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is thanks to the idea and politics of Kim Jong Il that our country is dynamically advancing along the road of Juche despite all tempests of history and shedding its rays as an ideologically and militarily strong country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The solid unity between the leader and the people is the first criterion of a powerful nation as well as a source of all victories. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A rise or fall of a country and a nation depends on unity.  The country in which all the people are rallied firmly as one around their great leader is invincible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the unshakable faith and will of the Korean people to believe and follow only Kim Jong Il and share the same destiny with him no matter how many times the world may change and even if the globe may break off. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This powerful ideological and mental strength represents a cornerstone supporting our country and a source of all miracles and feats. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Ours is Kim Il Sung's  Korea which has grown in strength and developed under the leadership of Kim Il Sung and all the Korean people are his sons and daughters who enjoyed all blessings under his care. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His history of nation building goes on still. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is a sure guarantee for building a Juche-based powerful nation to be true to the idea and leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Jong Il is the destiny of our country and the nation and the banner of all victories and glory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The dignity and honor of our country, the eternal happiness of the Korean people and a brilliant future of a powerful nation lie in holding Kim Jong Il in high esteem. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Minju Joson in an editorial stresses that the DPRK remains a banner of freedom and independence of the Korean people and a powerful weapon for building socialism and is demonstrating its might as a most dignified and powerful socialist country that represents glorious Kim Il Sung's nation.

At the conference attended by representatives of 56 political parties and public organisations, he delivered a report that called for checking and frustrating a separate election in South Korea and establishing a unified central government on the principle of democracy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At a consultative meeting of leaders of political parties and public organisations in north and South Korea in June that year, he reiterated the policy of holding a general election in the north and south and establishing a pan-Korean unified central government without delay. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As a result, a general election was held in north and south Korea in August to organise the supreme organ of state power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In North Korea, 99.97 percent of the voters took part in the election and elected 212 deputies by secret ballot. In South Korea, 77.52 percent of the voters took part in the election and selected 1,080 representatives of the people by signature. They came to North Korea at the risk of life to elect 360 deputies by secret ballot. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The constitution was adopted and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the unified central government, was organised at the historic first session of the Supreme People's Assembly which was held over September 2-10, 1948, attended by 572 deputies elected in north and south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The session elected Kim Il Sung head of state and premier of the cabinet, reflecting the unanimous will and desire of all the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He proclaimed the foundation of the DPRK on September 9, 1948 and published the platform of the government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The foundation of the DPRK meant the successful completion of the Korean people's cause of building the state. \r\n\r\n"
