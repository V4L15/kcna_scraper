The crimes of the Japanese imperialists, the long-time sworn enemy, can never be erased even after centuries.\r\n However, the Japanese reactionaries are beatifying their colonial history and sharpening a sword for reinvasion to realize their old dream of \"greater East Asia co-prosperity sphere\" again, availing themselves of the U.S. imperialists' policy of aggression on Korea, far from making an apology and compensation for the nefarious crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists against the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It can never be pardoned as it is a serious challenge to the Korean nation and public opinion at home and abroad.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Minju Joson today says this in a signed commentary in connection with the lapse of a century since the Japanese imperialists set up the \"Residence-General in Korea\".\r\n  It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists, the sworn enemy of the Korean nation, since they enforced a  heinous colonial rule over Korea can never be forgotten no matter how much water may flow under the bridge and the serious wounds inflicted by them upon the Koreans can never be healed. Japan must honestly apologize and compensate to them for the indelible crimes committed by it against them for more than 40 years of its occupation of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is none other than the U.S. that has encouraged behind the scene the Japanese reactionaries in their moves for reinvasion. The U.S. consented to and zealously backed the Japanese imperialists' aggression against Korea through the \"Taft-Katsura Agreement\" in the past. At the end of the Second World War the U.S. occupied south Korea by force of arms and has since enforced a colonial rule over it, helping Japan revive  militarism and driving it as a shock force for realizing its ambition for world domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north, the south and overseas who love the country and the nation should firmly unite and intensify the anti-U.S., anti-Japanese struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Koreans have an important role to play in that struggle. South Korea is now under the U.S. military occupation and the Japanese reactionaries have stretched out their tentacles of reinvasion to it. The south Koreans from all walks of life should, therefore, turn out as one in the anti-U.S., anti-Japanese struggle because they have suffered from the U.S. and Japanese aggressors more than any others.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Noting that June 15 is a meaningful day as it is of landmark significance in accomplishing the cause of national reunification, the article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To make it a tradition to grandly commemorate June 15 as the \"Day of by our nation itself\" offers an important occasion in increasing the might of the driving force of the nation in every way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans from different walks of life in the north and the south and abroad are the driving force for national reunification which is directly responsible for the movement for national reunification. The cause of national reunification can meet the challenge of anti-reunification forces and make a victorious advance only when the driving force of the nation is strengthened and its role increased. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For all the Koreans to jointly mark June 15 is also significant in injecting increased vitality into the movement for national reunification. \r\n When June 15 is marked as the \"Day of by our nation itself\" this will help the Koreans grasp the new great significance of this idea and participate in the movement for reunification as guided by it to fulfil their commitment as a master. Then the cause of national reunification will gain in dynamism.\r\n It is the unshakable faith and will of all the Koreans at home and abroad to achieve the historic cause of national reunification and prosperity through national concord and great unity as early as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans in the north and the south and abroad will achieve the cause of reunification as early as possible, guided by the idea of \"By our nation itself\".    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
