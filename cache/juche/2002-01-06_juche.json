It was sponsored by the solidarity for the implementation of the south-north joint declaration, the council to inherit the spirit of pro-reunification patriotic martyr Kim Ryang Mu and the Seoul District Federation of University Student Councils.\r\n The meeting reviewed one year's activities conducted to smash the U.S. hardline policy towards the north and implement the joint declaration and vowed to wage a struggle in the New Year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also served as a forum to try the anti-reunification forces for working hard to frustrate the implementation of the joint declaration, depending on foreign forces, not seeking cooperation between compatriots. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A resolution adopted at the meeting charged that the implementation of the declaration is faced with a serious obstacle entirely because of the U.S., calling for an all-out struggle to foil the U.S. hostile policy towards the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It strongly demanded the \"government\" authorities stop all the military actions, among other things, and sincerely approach the south-north dialogue.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's bad habit assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 6 (KCNA) -- Japan, talking about \"possible terrorism\" during the forthcoming world football championships, is working hard to deliberately connect it with the DPRK. Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun today says:\r\n The Japanese police office in a report on \"the review of public security and its prospect\" issued at the end of last year underscored the \"need\" to closely watch the moves of the DPRK, letting loose a string of speculations and nonsense that there might be terrorism from outside during the 2002 world football championships. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a symptom peculiar to the Japanese reactionaries seized with hostility towards the dprk. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They seek to attain a certain aim by taking advantage of the situation where the DPRK still remains on the u.s. list of \"sponsors of terrorism\" with the world football championships at hand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They intend to use the championships as a good chance to launch a fresh anti-DPRK campaign throughout Japan. By doing so, they seek to round off the militarist fascist system now in the making in Japan and, at the same time, make all the Japanese regard the DPRK as the \"arch enemy\" and provide legal and institutional mechanisms to mobilize all the resources, manpower and material, needed for Japan's participation in the second Korean war to be ignited by the united states. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The groundless anti-DPRK smear campaign launched by Japan with the championships as a momentum only touches off bitterer anger and hatred of the Korean army and people against it. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Great national unity called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 6 (KCNA) -- In order to bring about a decisive phase in the struggle for national reunification this year, the Korean nation should get united above all. Unity alone can advance the movement for reunification and is a decisive factor of its victory. \r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a by-lined article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The movement for national reunification which has been dynamically waged since the publication of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration clearly proves that when the Korean people get united and build up thousand-fold strength they can eventually attain reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The prevailing situation more urgently requires the unity of the Korean people than ever before. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is persisting in its offensive to isolate and stifle the DPRK, groundlessly accusing it of \"terrorism,\" \"human rights issue\" and \"nuclear suspicion\". It is aimed to tarnish the international image of the DPRK and egg the anti-reunification elements in South Korea on to prevent compatriots from getting united with each other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There still go on in South Korea such abnormal developments as cracking down upon pro-reunification patriots on the charge of the violation of the \"Security Law\" and getting on the nerves of the fellow countrymen in the north by advocating the \"arch enemy\" theory. All this is intended to serve outsiders' purpose of creating seeds of discord among fellow countrymen in a bid to bar the Koreans from going united. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Once the nation is firmly determined to get united, it can shatter any moves of the anti-reunification elements and achieve great national unity.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
