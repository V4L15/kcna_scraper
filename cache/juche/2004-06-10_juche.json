            "content": "RS on Reactionary and Dangerous Nature of U.S. \"Preemptive Attack Strategy\" \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- The world cannot be peaceful nor can the development of human civilization be expected unless the U.S. imperialists' aggressive \"preemptive attack strategy\" is thwarted and frustrated, says Rodong Sinmun Wednesday in a signed article.\r\n It continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States, since its appearance, has perpetrated aggression and wars on innumerable occasions. No administration, however, put forward \"preemptive attack strategy\" as the external military line under the pretext of \"the security of the U.S.\" like the Bush administration. This strategy vividly reflects the robber-like and bellicose nature of the U.S. imperialists who are keen on placing the world under their military control and reigning over it as the \"emperor\" after the Cold War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. \"preemptive attack strategy\" is allowed, the world might be reduced to a theatre of U.S. state terrorism and armed intervention and a dangerous ground of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The object of the keenest concern of the U.S. today is to open up a broad avenue for its insatiable greed and accumulation of wealth by getting its clutches on major areas of resources and military and strategic vantages of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. \"preemptive attack strategy\" went unchecked, no country would remain out of the reach of the damages done by the U.S. This strategy is not for the U.S. \"security\" but is a plan of armed attack to grasp economic interests and strategic areas of resources. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a very dangerous doctrine of aggression fostering a renewed arms race and threatening and destroying global peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its reactionary and dangerous nature stands out in bolder relief in its being a strategy of preemptive nuclear attack. It is a very dangerous and grave developments that the U.S. imperialists have listed not only the hostile states but the powers which have entered into relations of \"strategic partnership\" as targets of their nuclear strike to overwhelm them by a preemptive nuclear attack and they are going to easily use small-type nukes as conventional weapons against whatever targets in any place under the mask of \"anti-terrorism\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The countries and peoples desirous of independence and peace should see through the reactionary and dangerous nature of the U.S. imperialists' \"preemptive attack strategy\" which is being forced under the pretext of \"anti-terrorism\" and fight vigorously in every way to curb and frustrate it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n"

The U.S. is stepping up its arms buildup in and around the Korean peninsula at such moment. No one can deny that this is intended to launch a preemptive attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. brasshats told congressional hearings that the increase of the U.S. forces' combat capability in south Korea was to cope with \"threat from north Korea\" and stressed the need to develop small nukes for destroying underground facilities targeted against \"hostile states\", singling out the DPRK as a \"typical example\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This claim of the Bush administration is nothing but a trick to veil its sinister purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In today's world where the U.S. is shamelessly running about, ignoring international justice, urged by extremely unilateral mode of thinking, the most powerful war deterrent is a defense capability strong enough to cope with whatever war provocation moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Those who are fond of fire are burned in fire.
