The reality is quite contrary to what he uttered.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The moment the U.S. comes in attack on the DPRK, the White House will come to an end before anything else.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The anti-DPRK invectives reeled off by this guy is the last-ditch efforts aimed to evade the responsibility for endangering the security of the U.S. mainland as a whole by pushing the DPRK to become the most powerful nuclear weapons state now that the Obama group's DPRK policy proved to be totally bankrupt before its ouster.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He, who had been reportedly in charge of the DPRK policy for the past two decades, is so ignorant of the DPRK. So pitiful is the fate of the American people who depend on such minions for the security of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Being seized by megalomania that it can do whatever it wants, the U.S. has become blind in facing up to the world. It is, therefore, unable to judge that the DPRK is not such a country which it can make obedient to Washington.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What Rassel uttered is just a squeak of a rat but behind him there is shrill cry of Obama.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will remain unperturbed by the useless wriggling of Obama, but the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK including the highly developed nuclear force will never miss the target as they regard it as their primary mission to safeguard the supreme leadership.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. will have to pay a high price for malignantly hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK, and Obama will come to understand the meaning of the price before he leaves the White House."
