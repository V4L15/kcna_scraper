            "content": "Japan's Frantic Moves for Overseas Aggression Blasted\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 24 (KCNA) -- The Japanese authorities are now getting evermore undisguised in their moves to adopt seven bills related to emergency and to promote the Japan Defence Agency to a \"ministry\". These are very serious developments as they are frantic moves of Japan to emerge a military giant and realize its overseas expansion.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' move to promote the agency to a ministry is aimed to set up an official state military machine in a bid to more successfully guarantee their moves for overseas expansion and provide the Japanese militarist armed forces with legal nature and position as regular armed forces and thus round off their preparations for military aggression overseas.  The seven bills related to emergency approved by the Japanese government are designed to perfect the judicial system for war in a bid to legally rush headlong into overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The passage of the above-said bills through the Diet along with three other bills on emergency would mean the adoption of a perfect legislation on emergency. Then, the \"peace constitution\" under which Japan has professed to be a \"peace-loving state\" since the end of the war will remain in name only and Japan will be free to conduct overseas military operations, unhindered, under the legal and institutional system as it did during the Japanese imperialists' war of continental aggression in the past. Herein lies the criminal and dangerous nature of their moves to adopt the bills. \r\n The Korean peninsula is the first target of the Japanese reactionaries' overseas aggression. They are set to begin their operations to conquer Asia and the world by reinvading Korea as they did in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people advocating independence and peace should remain highly vigilant against Japan's moves for aggression overseas and positively struggle to frustrate them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Neo-conservatism Assailed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 24 (KCNA) -- The Korean Central News Agency released a lengthy article titled \"U.S. neo-conservatism is fascism.\"\r\n The article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. neo-conservatism is a reactionary political trend as it calls for converting the whole world into a U.S.-dominated free world of American style. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The assertion of neo-conservatives is based on their sophism about \"globalism\" that the U.S. should have the status of the \"united states of the world\" because its life-style is most advantageous in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. sustained defeats in the Korean and Vietnamese wars and the capitalist world underwent overall crisis including oil crisis early in the 1970s. Neo-conservatism, a bourgeois political trend advocating a more Right and conservative policy, raised its head in the capitalist countries including the U.S. in the latter half of the decade against the above-mentioned backdrop. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Neo-conservatism in the U.S. was clearly reflected in the domestic and foreign policies pursued by the Reagan Administration that took office in the 1980s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When socialism collapsed in the Soviet Union and East European countries and the Cold War came to an end early in the 1990s, the U.S. imperialists had no longer the justification to cite \"threat from communism\", a pretext they had used to meet their essential requirements for aggression and war. Multi-polarization became an irresistible trend of the times in the international arena. Much upset by this development and obsessed by the megalomaniacal illusion about strength, the U.S. imperialists encouraged neo-conservatives to vociferously clamor for building a U.S.-dominated uni-polar world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those wars fought by the U.S. in the 21st century under the pretext of combating terrorism reflect its policy of \"neo-conservatism\" calling for realizing globalization of American style with strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Neo-conservatives made such wild remarks as an \"axis of evil\" while advocating the Bush doctrine that \"you are either our friend or our enemy.\" They adopted the logic of \"preemptive attack\" as a mainstay of their national security strategy in the 21st century and launched Afghan and Iraqi wars without any justifiable pretext. They even dubbed operations \"indomitable freedom\" and \"freedom in Iraq\" openly disclosing the true nature of those \"wars on terrorism\" aimed to realize their neo-conservatism. Rumsfeld asserted that the U.S. was fighting a war of ideas, a war on terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The logic of preemptive attack set out by the neo-conservatives, too, is premised on conducting false propaganda to create hallucination about \"threat\" from someone and fear of the strength of the U.S. and attain its aim of preemptive attack with ease. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis clearly represents the logic of elite that served as a theoretical foundation of fascism pursued by Hitler. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' more zealous pursuance of aggression, war and overseas expansion against the desire of humankind would only get them to nowhere but unilateralism. That's why neo-conservatives openly assert that the U.S. should be a unilateral state in the world irrespective of its role there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their reckless arms buildup, war policies and unilateralism have brought irrevocably catastrophic consequences to the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world bitterly denounces neo-conservatives in the U.S. as barbarians in the modern times as they put Hitler fascists into the shade in their bellicose, cruel and ferocious nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n American-style internationalism advocated by the neo-conservatives is rendering the U.S. further isolated in the international arena while causing unprecedented caprice in international relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Drawing close is the day neo-conservatism will be thrown into the dumping ground of history along with its defeat in the \"war on terrorism\" just as Hitler fascism met destruction along with its defeat in the Second World War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Neither U.S. imperialists' logic of strength nor their \"strategy of peaceful transition\" will work on the DPRK as it is led by Kim Jong Il, illustrious commander born of Mt. Paektu, and has the great Songun politics and the single-hearted unity more powerful than any nuclear weapon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. does not yet know about the DPRK. This is its tragedy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Neo-conservative warhawks' desperate moves to stifle the DPRK, obsessed by their day-dream, will only precipitate their destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Staunch Struggle against Outsiders Called for\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 24 (KCNA) -- Papers today dedicate articles to the 40th anniversary of the March 24 struggle waged by south Korean youth, students and people, expressing support to the south Korean people in their struggle against outside forces.\r\n An article of Rodong Sinmun says that the March 24 struggle was sparked off by the struggle of students of Seoul National University against the projected criminal talks between sycophantic traitors and the Japanese reactionaries. It was a just and patriotic struggle to put an end to the outsiders' aggression and intervention and the fascist dictatorship and achieve national reunification, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This struggle dealt a telling blow at the U.S. and Japanese imperialists and pro-U.S. and pro-Japanese traitors and recorded a brilliant page in the history of the south Korean people's struggle for independence against outsiders and for democracy against fascism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people's desire to live in an independent and democratic new society in a reunified country, free from foreign domination, intervention and fascism, has not yet come true. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK and its anti- reunification moves have reached their height. The U.S. is working hard with blood-shot eyes to bring a holocaust of a nuclear war to the Korean nation while hatching a plot to stifle the DPRK by force under the pretext of the nuclear issue between the two countries. The U.S. is hell-bent on the moves to bar the inter-Korean relations from favorably developing in the basic spirit of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and drop a check-bar on the Koreans' movement for independent reunification. These constitute a serious challenge to the cause of national reunification  The Japanese reactionaries are keen to realize their anachronistic ambition to stage a comeback to Korea, taking advantage of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK. Those sycophantic traitors in south Korea are zealously supporting the U.S. imperialists in their efforts to carry out their strategy to dominate Korea and the Japanese reactionaries in their moves for reinvasion. All this teaches a serious lesson that a new reunified country, independent and democratic, craved for by those participants in the March 24 struggle can never be built unless the U.S. and Japanese imperialists' criminal moves to launch a war of aggression against the DPRK are foiled in south Korea and a struggle is waged against the sycophantic traitors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson says that a key to winning a victory in the struggle for independence against outsiders is for all members of the nation to achieve an unbreakable unity under the banner of the Korean nation-first spirit.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "DPRK Boasts of Excellent Education System\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 24 (KCNA) -- Fifty-five years have passed since the campaign against illiteracy was wound up successfully in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\r\n Just after the liberation of the country in 1945, the situation of education was very poor in the country, affected by the Japanese imperialists' policy of obliterating culture of the colonial nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Eighty percent of the population were illiterates, some 2.3 million of them being adults. There was no university in the country at that time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Every year more than 400,000 children of school age could not go to school. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was an urgent issue in liberated Korea to abolish the Japanese imperialists' educational policy for colonial slavery and establish a popular and democratic education system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the wise leadership of President Kim Il Sung, the Workers' Party of Korea and the DPRK Government successfully carried out the tasks for democratic education in only one year and launched a nationwide campaign to wipe out illiteracy in the country until March Juche 38 (1949). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After Kim Il Sung University, the first university of the country, made its appearance in October 1946, some ten universities and scores of technical colleges were set up in two or three years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The universal compulsory primary education system was introduced in the country in 1956, the universal compulsory secondary education system in 1958, the universal free education system in 1959 and the universal compulsory eleven-year education system in 1975. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The school education system ranging from preschool education to high education, and the social education system have been established on a regular basis in the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Millions of pupils and students are studying at schools at all levels built all over the country, free of charge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A large number of students are preparing themselves in political, ideological, scientific and technical aspects at hundreds of universities every year.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

We can never remain a passive onlooker to such anti-DPRK moves of the Japanese reactionaries.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
