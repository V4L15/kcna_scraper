A signed commentary of Rodong Sinmun says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States, prompted by a foolish design to obtain a sort of concession from the DPRK, is escalating military pressure upon the DPRK when multi-faceted dialogues and negotiations are being held between the DPRK and the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Dialogue is incompatible with military threat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIndependence is the life and soul of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is our will and consistent principle to return dialogue for dialogue and strength for strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If multi-faceted dialogues and negotiations including the DPRK-U.S. talks collapse due to the U.S. moves to stifle the DPRK, the U.S. will have to take full responsibility for this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A commentary of Minju Joson stresses that it will be beneficial to the U.S. bellicose elements to behave with discretion, properly judging their opponents. \r\n\r\n"

This was mainly attributable to the fact that the independence, which had been achieved by those countries, was not defended by armed forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Independence is guaranteed by self-reliance in national defence. Popular masses' independence would have been unthinkable without work to defend the sovereignty of the country and people from the imperialists' invasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The imperialists are outrageous before the weak but mean before the strong. It is, therefore, a must to strengthen the armed forces to prevail over the imperialists in confrontation at any cost. \r\n\r\n"
