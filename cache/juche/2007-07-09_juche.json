There are so many stories about the lofty outlook on the people the President had showed during the anti-Japanese armed struggle, saying that the commander was also a son of the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He exerted indefatigable efforts to provide a happy life to the people while leading the revolution and construction after the liberation of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He passed the fork in Mangyongdae to meet workers of the Kangson Steel Works right after the liberation prior to the visit to his native home that he had remembered for tens of years since his departure. In the flames of the Korean war, he helped peasants sow seeds and manure fields in Wonhwa-ri. The fork, the fields and all the edifices including the Pyongyang Grand Theatre and Sungri and Changgwang Streets still tell his deep affection for the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President's devotion for the happiness of people does not know its depth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In October Juche 74 (1985), he saw it to that a decree of the Central People's Committee of the DPRK was issued to enforce the social security system for the co-op farmers and instructed senior officials of the then Administration Council to carry on revolutionary policies on a higher stage according to the developing reality so as to provide more affluent and cultured life to the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He also saw it to that the 26th Session of the 8th Central People's Committee of the DPRK held in May 1989 took epochal measures in connection with the issues related to improving the people's living standard including issues arising in the tideland construction, seashore cultivation and fish-breeding. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people keep in their minds that he found himself in fields of co-op farms in his 80s in June 1994 and presided over a conference of senior officials in the field of economy to boost the national economy just before his great hearts stopped beating in July.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Abe Group's Suppression of Chongryon Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 7 (KCNA) -- The Abe group is working hard to force upon the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) the sale of the plottage and the hall of its headquarters through the Resolution and Collection Corporation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a wanton infringement upon the sovereignty of the DPRK which no previous regime of Japan has ever dared as it is a move to physically remove the centre of Chongryon and stamp out the activities of Chongryon and Koreans in Japan. Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are running amuck to suppress the bare-handed Chongryon. This clearly indicates that they are villains and gangsters ignorant of basic international law, diplomatic usage and ethics and morality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their move to usurp the building of Chongryon was prompted by Abe's premeditated plot and his direct instruction to realize his sinister political ambition to all intents and purposes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Feeling uneasy about the steady decline of the support rate for Abe with the approach of the election to the House of Councilors, he is keen to put the DPRK-Japan relations to the lowest ebb through the campaign to usurp the building of Chongryon in a bid to fish in troubled waters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their move is aimed at hamstringing the efforts to bring about progress at the six-party talks designed to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula and creating a favorable environment for the militarization of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe Abe group is harshly suppressing Chongryon which has done nothing wrong as soon as its delegates went back to Japan from the six-party talks where they kept mum though they had opportunities to discuss if they had something to say as regards the issue of the DPRK-Japan relations. This is a very crude and nasty deed, indeed. The serious and grave situation created by the Abe group casts a question as to whether there is any need for Japan's continued participation in the six-party talks.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
