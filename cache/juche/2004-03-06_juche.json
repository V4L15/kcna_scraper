It has become ever more undisguised in its moves to speed up the preparations for a war of aggression against the DPRK, massing its troops in and around south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. warlike forces seek to make the second Korean war the biggest of the wars of aggression they have fought so far and an indiscriminate war involving all their forces. It is a very dangerous development that the U.S. imperialists announced the \"new operation plan 5026\" recently to replace their \"operation plan 5030.\" The situation on the Korean peninsula is growing tenser due to the U.S. frantic moves to provoke a new war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. much talk about the \"nuclear and missile threat\" from the DPRK is a prelude to a war as it is intended to provoke a new Korean war by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's armed forces serve as a treasured sword of justice to defend its sovereignty from the enemy's aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush's bellicose forces are well advised to properly understand the might and will of the DPRK and abandon their reckless attempt at a military adventure against the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"

It is no more than a foolish plot to tarnish the image of the dignified DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK, a state guided by the man-centered Juche idea, bans by law the use, transaction and production of drug which renders people mentally deformed. The import of spiritual stimulants for scientific research is under a strict state control and in this field the DPRK has long maintained a close contact and cooperation with the International Narcotic Control Board in this field. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe U.S. had better settle the problem of the fin de siecle drug-related crimes rife in the American society before exercising the super- state \"authority,\" which no one granted to it, to slander others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The more frequently the U.S. releases annual reports to impair the prestige of others, the more saliently they will reveal its social corruption and weakness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to mind its own business.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
