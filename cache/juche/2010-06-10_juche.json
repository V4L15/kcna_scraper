It is violating the independent rights of the people, protecting a fascist dictatorial rule and desperately obstructing the Koreans' cause of national reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group going under the mask of \"pragmatists\" is staying in power depending on outsiders like the successive dictators in south Korea, thus ruthlessly chilling the people's desire for independence, democracy and reunification, \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Traitor Lee Myung Bak cried out for \"channeling all efforts into the economic recovery as elections were over\". His remarks betrayed once again the arrogant and dictatorial nature of the group of traitors not accepting a stern judgment of the people at all. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group is going more reckless in its behavior, far from apologizing to the nation for such crime as faking up the case of warship sinking, thereby escalating the racket of confrontation and war than ever before.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality goes to prove that the south Korean people can never remain self-complacent with the results of the recent \"elections to the local self-governing bodies\" but should intensify the anti-\"government\" struggle till the conservative group is ousted from power."
