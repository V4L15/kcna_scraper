As a result, the peninsula remains the main frontline for the realization of the U.S. reactionary world strategy based on the policy of strength. The U.S. has the unprecedented-in-scope aggression forces in and around South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The increasing U.S. led war maneuvers lead to the growing danger of war and escalating tensions in the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In particular, the tightened U.S.-Japan-South Korea triangular military alliance called NATO of Asian version is one of the factors in having reduced the peninsula into the most dangerous hot spot. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The danger of war in the peninsula poses a grave threat to peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The best way of removing the danger of war on the peninsula is the U.S. troop pullout from South Korea, discontinuation of all war maneuvers and establishment of a new peace-keeping mechanism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All people who want world peace and security should bitterly denounce the U.S. for their moves to provoke another Korean War. \r\n\r\n"

To strictly square accounts with the U.S. for their murderous crimes is a matter of weighty importance in defending the dignity of the Korean nation and keeping outsiders from inflicting disasters upon the nation again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It underscored the need to lay bare massacres by GIs in the North Korea as well as in South Korea during the last Korean War and to make yankees pay for their atrocities one thousand times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. and the South Korean authorities claim that they engage themselves in what they call \"joint investigation\" into the killings in Rogun-ri. That is a deceptive trick to put down the wrath and anti-American feelings of the South Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the height of impudence that the criminals \"investigate\" their crimes. It is not hard to see what result their \"investigation\" will bring about. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their loudmouthed \"investigation\" is designed to while away the time playing tricks and cover up their crimes and flee from the responsibility for them at any cost. So, there is nothing to be expected of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Worse still, the present authorities of South Korea who place the interests of the U.S. above the interests and dignity of the nation are zealous ly defending the excesses committed by uncle Sam. The reality shows that only through impartial and active efforts of the fact-finding team is possible to fully expose the historic crimes of the U.S. Troops. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We express hope that all the fellow countrymen and pro-reunification movement organisations in the north, south and overseas which value the dignity and sovereignty of the nation will show an affirmative response to the constructive proposal of the DPRK for the formation of the joint fact-finding team. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
