Six shells of them hit the area near KPA civil police posts 542 and 543 and other 15 shells fell near KPA civil police posts 250 and 251.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There was no victim of the shelling provocation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, this reckless shelling on the DPRK's military posts, its inviolable territory is a serious military provocation that can never be pardoned.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Gravity of the situation is that the south Korean puppet military didn't hesitate to make such provocation though it has not yet confirmed where a shell allegedly fired by the KPA came from and where it fell in its side, unaware of whether it was an AA gun shell or a bullet or a rocket or not.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Shortly ago, the puppet war maniacs resumed the broadcasting for psychological warfare in all sectors of the front under the pretext of a doubtful mine explosion case. Today they fired shells en masse toward the territory of the DPRK without scientific grounds. All of them are prompted by insanity of the south Korean military war maniacs for provocation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In view of the prevailing crucial situation, an emergency enlarged meeting of the Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea will be convened at Thursday night.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We are now sharply following the south Korean puppet Defense Ministry's attitude toward the ultimatum of the KPA General Staff which declared that a strong military action would be launched unless they stop the broadcasting for anti-DPRK psychological warfare and dismantle all means of psychological warfare within 48 hours.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Foolhardy provocation deserves harsh punishment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean military war maniacs should behave with discretion, well aware of the retaliatory spirit running high among the angry servicepersons of the KPA frontline combined units."
