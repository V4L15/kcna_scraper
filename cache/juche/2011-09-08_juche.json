He highly appreciated their feats.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Sweetening powder made of stevia does not lose its color and taste when it is contained in foodstuff, it does not adversely work in human bodies but does good for treating diabetes, hypertension, nephritis and other diseases, he said, underscoring the need to increase the production of such sweetening as it is in wide use in foodstuff and pharmaceutical industries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He set forth tasks facing the factory, noting it has an important role to play for solving the issue of sweetening of the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The second leg of his visit was the newly built shop for pancakes stuffed with meat at the Kumsong Foodstuff Factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The pancake stuffed with meat is instant food. It is fried pancake wrapped with processed meat, vegetables and sweet soybean paste.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Being briefed on the technical specification of the newly built shop, he looked round various places including pancake production process, meat preparing process and vegetable preparing process installed with latest equipment to learn about in detail about the construction and production there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The operation of the new pancake production process at the shop made it possible to bring about a new change in the understanding of diet of Koreans who used to consider it as a good meal to have boiled rice and soup in the past, he noted. He highly appreciated the creative spirit and the spirit of devoted service for the people displayed by the workers and technicians of the factory and officials of the relevant fields who have devoted their wisdom and enthusiasm to improving the standard of people's living.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He dropped in at a mobile stand serving pancakes to learn in detail about the service of fast-food for inhabitants. He said if such stands are installed in different parts of the city, they would help citizens of the capital city have more convenient and bountiful diet.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He put forth tasks to be fulfilled by the shop for its management and operation, noting that it has an important role to play in developing the technology of the nation's food industry and improving the standard of people's living. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round the construction site in Mansudae area. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He noted with great satisfaction that a new street of Korean style completely away from the existing mode of city construction is now under construction in Mansudae area to meet the modern aesthetic taste thanks to a high political and ideological enthusiasm and labor drive of the builders and soldiers of the Korean People's Army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the most honorable and worthwhile job for the KPA and people, soldiers and disciples of President Kim Il Sung, to spruce up Mansudae area on the best level to mark the centenary of his birth, he said. He expressed great expectation and belief that all the builders and citizens would successfully build up Mansudae area on the best level to positively contribute to fully displaying the mettle and might of Songun Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Kim Jong Un, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission of the WPK; Kim Ki Nam, member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the C.C., the WPK; Kim Kyong Hui, member of the Political Bureau and department director of the C.C., the WPK; Jang Song Thaek, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the C.C., the WPK and vice-chairman of the NDC; Thae Jong Su, alternate member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the C.C., the WPK; Mun Kyong Dok, alternate member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the C.C., the WPK and chief secretary of the Pyongyang City Committee of the WPK; and Pak Pong Ju and Han Kwang Sang, first vice department directors of the C.C., the WPK."

on Thursday to celebrate the 63rd birthday of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Present there were senior officials of the party, state and army, deputies to the Supreme People's Assembly, officials of the party, armed forces, power organs, social organizations, ministries and national institutions, servicepersons of the Korean People's Army and the Korean People's Internal Security Forces, officials in the fields of science, education, culture and art, public health and media, bereaved families of revolutionary martyrs, labor innovators and working people here.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Also present were overseas compatriots delegations including the congratulatory group of Koreans in Japan and compatriots, the chief of the Pyongyang Mission of the Anti-Imperialist National Democratic Front, diplomatic envoys of different countries here, members of the military attaches corps, representatives of international organizations and foreign guests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Choe Yong Rim, member of the Presidium of the Political Bureau of the C.C., the Workers' Party of Korea and premier of the DPRK Cabinet, said in his report that the founding of the DPRK on Sept. 9, Juche 37 (1948) by President Kim Il Sung was a solemn declaration heralding the birth of the first people's country in the colonial East, socialist Korea, and a great event which opened a new history of the building of the Juche-oriented socialist state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reporter referred to the fact that Kim Il Sung put forth the idea and line of building a Juche-oriented state and wisely led the struggle to carry them out, thus developing the DPRK into an independent socialist state centered on the popular masses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe noted that what occupies the most brilliant place in General Secretary Kim Jong Il's leadership over the nation-building is that he has turned the DPRK into a state which realizes the idea and cause of Kim Il Sung, the founder of the DPRK, both in name and reality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He recalled that Kim Jong Il formulated the Songun politics as the basic political mode under socialism and established the state leadership system with main emphasis on national defence, as required by the grave situation which prevailed in the DPRK in the 1990s of the last century and the developing revolution. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed the need to hold the President in high esteem as the founder of socialist Korea and the eternal President of the DPRK for all ages and carry out the revolution and construction always as intended by him and the way he did and thus add shine to the DPRK as the glorious state of Kim Il Sung at all times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reporter went on to say:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the fields and units should continue directing great efforts to strengthening the KPA and consolidating the country's defence capability and supply everything necessary for the defence industry on a top priority basis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We must continue putting spurs to the light industry, a main front in the general offensive this year, and bring about great innovations in agricultural production to improve the standard of people's living as early as possible and increase the speed of the advance for a great surge to the maximum on the overall economic front including the four pilot sectors of the national economy by tapping all the existing production potentials to the fullest extent. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should reinforce the state leadership system with the National Defence Commission as its pivot in every way, establish the strict revolutionary discipline within the power organs whereby everybody acts as one under the unitary leadership of the party, preserve the Juche character and national character in all fields of state activities and social life and strictly adhere to the principle of collectivism and class principle and thus firmly protect the true nature of Korean-style socialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should thoroughly embody the idea of \"By our nation itself\" true to the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and the October 4 declaration and meet the blatant challenges of the anti-reunification forces at home and abroad and foil their obstructive moves and bring about a new phase in the development of the north-south relations by the concerted efforts of the nation and thus accomplish the historic cause of national reunification as early as possible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK government will always glorify the undying exploits performed by Kim Jong Il in his external activities and make every possible effort to develop the good neighborly and friendly relations with various countries of the world and build a new independent peaceful world in the idea of independence, peace and friendship."
