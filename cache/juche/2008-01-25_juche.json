            "content": "U.S., Strangler of Middle East Peace: KCNA \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 24 (KCNA) -- The chief executive of the United States toured Middle East from January 8 to 16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The purpose of his trip was to refurbish the image of the U.S. by \"promoting\" Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, build an anti-Iran alliance by winning over the local countries and establish its domination over this region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through his trip, the U.S. betrayed its double-dealing tactics and one-sided policy inclined to Israel in the Middle East issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In a statement on the Palestinian issue Bush pretended to be deeply concerned over the peace process while failing to put forward any concrete solution to such core points as the definition of the border line of the independent Palestinian state, the issue of refugees and the status of Kudus. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He talked about an end to Israeli occupation of Arab territories, but failed to specify a solution to it. And he described the expansion of Jewish \"settlements\" as an \"obstacle,\" but did not pressurize Israel to stop it. He went the lengths of praising Israel as a \"supporter\" to the peace process, not its obstructer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This not only added to the internal split of Palestine but also openly patronized Israel in its fascist repression and brutal murder of Palestinians. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was with this support of the U.S. that Israel, no sooner had it \"committed\" itself to bending efforts for the solution of the problems pending between the Arab countries and Israel at the international meeting on Middle East peace held in Annapolis, Maryland of the U.S., last November, than it declared its plan to build Jewish \"settlements\" extensively and committed brutal killings of innocent Palestinians almost every day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Blaring that it would not end its occupation of the West Bank until the \"security\" of its own territory was guaranteed and would never surrender Kudus to Palestine, Israel took advantage of Bush's Middle East trip as the best chance to bring into the open its ambition to keep Arab territories under its sway for ever. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Not without reason did Reuters say many people in Middle East regarded Bush as a war maniac who pursues not peace and democracy but the supremacy of the U.S. and Israel. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During his trip, Bush denounced Iran as \"the world's leading state sponsor of terror\". And he urged Persian Gulf leaders to confront with Iran and tried to pressurize them to join the U.S. in its efforts to isolate Iran, restricting their access to Iran's banks and other financial institutions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Timing to coincidence with his trip, the U.S. administration notified Congress of its intent to sell to Saudi Arabia advanced weaponry worth more than 120 million U.S. dollars to bolster the defense of U.S. allies in the Gulf against Iran. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This proposal is the first part of the planned 20-billion-dollar deal with the Gulf which the U.S. announced last year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At that time, the U.S. also declared its plan of $30 billion in arms sales to the Jewish state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as daylight that this will aggravate the local situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Facts vividly show that the U.S. posing as \"an apostle of peace\" and \"an unbiased arbitrator\" is the wrecker and strangler of Middle East peace.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This was an exercise of the internationally-approved right to legal self-defence and due punishment for the provokers and aggressors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Thursday says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the U.S. was so insolent as to send aircraft carrier flotillas to the waters off Wonsan, talking about \"revenge\" for the capture of the spy ship and foolishly seeking to bring the DPRK into submission by threat and blackmail, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The 40 years since the capture of the ship \"Pueblo\" is a history of crimes in which the U.S. has persistently conducted the moves to provoke a war against the DPRK, challenging the unanimous desire of the Korean nation for peace and reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even now, the U.S. invariably pursues the hostile policy towards the DPRK and steadily strains the military tension on the Korean Peninsula, talking about \"dialogue\" and \"peace.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. conservative hardliners are ceaselessly staging military rackets against the DPRK even under the situation where the implementation of the agreements made at the six-party talks is going on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The facts clearly prove that the source of military tension and danger of war on the Korean Peninsula is the confrontation moves of the U.S. conservative hardliners seeking to invade the DPRK while insisting on the anachronistic hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to ease the constant tension and achieve durable peace on the Korean Peninsula, it is important to put an end to the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK and get its imperialist aggressor troops withdrawn from south Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
