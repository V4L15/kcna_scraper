He highly praised the noble patriotism displayed by the servicepersons of the unit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The management as well as combat and political training at all units of the KPA are at a high level, he said, adding that this proud success clearly proves the great vitality of the spiritual, moral and cultural traits of the KPA, the standard-bearer and main force in the Songun revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He then went round an education room, bedroom, mess hall, kitchen, daily provision store, washroom and other places to learn in detail with the soldiers' service and living. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He underscored the need for all commanding officers to bear deep in mind the instruction of President Kim Il Sung that supply service precisely means a political work and properly organize the supply service in order to provide the soldiers with better living conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He spared time to watch an art performance given by servicepersons of a company of the unit joyously celebrating the day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the spirit of devotedly defending the leader, warm patriotism and matchless self-sacrificing spirit displayed by the heroic KPA constitute strength powerful to wipe out any formidable enemy in the world at a single stroke, he stressed that thanks to this great army, the DPRK will win victory in the future, too, as it did in the last war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He had a photo session with the servicepersons of the unit, expressing expectation and conviction that they would resolutely defend Korean-style socialism which the servicepersons and people have safeguarded at the cost of blood.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But this is a cynical ploy to justify its moves to put all sea routes in the world under its control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such moves to expand the sphere of its military and political influence on strategic regions and many countries have, in fact, already gone beyond the tolerance limit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the recent meeting of defence officials of the ASEAN Regional Forum the U.S. talked about the need to blockade seas in various regions including the Malacca Strait under the pretext of combating terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Malacca Strait as well as the Caribbean Strait are major targets of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has chosen the DPRK as a principal target in laying an international siege through the control over major sea routes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By putting major straits under its military control, the U.S. seeks to deter the DPRK from having any economic ties and trade with other countries and thus isolate and strangle it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has become all the more undisguised in its moves to intercept and inspect the DPRK-flagged ships in the open sea since it worked out a security action plan to prevent the proliferation of weapons involving eleven countries last year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The projected multi-national military exercise assumes grave nature as it will be staged under this action plan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. attempt to control major sea routes is in flagrant violation of international law and regulations providing for normal navigation of cargo ships and norms on relations among countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to face up to the international trend towards peace against war and cancel at once its plan to stage such military maneuver as collective blockade operation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Koreans Called Upon to Reject Dependence on Outsiders \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 28 (KCNA) -- It is an unpardonable treacherous act to seek dependence on outside forces and stand against the withdrawal of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces from south Korea, says Rodong Sinmun Wednesday in a signed article. \r\n The U.S. imperialists are dangerous forces for a war of aggression as they always watch for a chance to invade the DPRK and escalate confrontation and tension on the Korean peninsula, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the intrinsic nature of the U.S. to perpetrate aggression and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe U.S. rake up huge profits through wars. It still remains a most dangerous and belligerent war criminal state as it runs wild to put the world under its domination through wars. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its belligerent nature finds its clear manifestation in its moves to launch a war of aggression against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is none other than the U.S. which has harassed peace and destabilized the situation on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an anti-peace act to depend on aggressor outsiders as it would stoke military confrontation between fellow countrymen and escalate the danger of a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A greater bid made by south Korea for a U.S. security umbrella relying on it politically and militarily would only increase the former's political submission and military dependence upon the latter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Obstinate is the way of thinking that one can survive only when one relies on the U.S. The south Korean military is making a desperate effort to maintain the alliance with the U.S. and the military cooperation system which are now shaking to their very foundation in face of the strong trend after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration despite its call for \"self-reliant national defence\". This would naturally lead to the blind support for the U.S. moves to launch a war of aggression against the DPRK and compel the north and the south of Korea to level guns at each other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Continued dependence on outsiders keen on aggression and war would make it impossible to build confidence between the north and the south of Korea or defuse confrontation and tension between them.\r\n It is as dangerous an act as leaving the destiny of the nation at the tender mercy of outsiders in their war gamble to take to flunkeyism and depend on outsiders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Depending on the U.S. would only lead to a fratricidal confrontation and war, not security. Peace desired by both the north and the south can settle on this land only when they reject outsiders and drive them out of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans should resolutely oppose and reject flunkeyism and the idea of dependence on outsiders which would invite aggression and war and turn out as one in a nationwide struggle to drive the U.S. imperialist occupation troops, the root cause of war, out of south Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Demanded\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 28 (KCNA) -- The United States, lording it over the United Nations, has used it for meeting its interests and realizing its ambition for domination. This practice has impaired the dignity of the UN and damaged the member nations' confidence in it. Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says this in a signed article.\r\n The article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. insisted that its forces in south Korea are UN forces. But recently it has unilaterally taken a measure to cut down the troops without getting in touch with the UN. This is little short of admitting itself that the U.S. troops in south Korea are illegal occupation forces, not UN forces.  The U.S. organized the UN forces in south Korea in July 1950 in violation of the UN Charter and regulations after starting the Korean war on June 25, 1950. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. forces in south Korea have nothing in common with the UN forces in view of their organization and control system. Those UN forces hurled into the Korean war in 1950 were not organized under an agreement signed between the UNSC and those countries that offered troops but they were American forces the U.S. has dispatched to Korea timed to coincide with the outbreak of the war before the UNSC adopted Resolution 84. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the 28th UN General Assembly representatives of many countries accused the U.S. of faking up the above-said resolution by abusing the name of the UN and preposterously calling the forces not responsible before the UNSC UN forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. troops in south Korea are, in every case, illegal occupation and aggression troops. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have done nothing but threatening peace on the Korean peninsula and increasing the danger of war on it. The Korean people have undergone a holocaust of a war due to the U.S. imperialist aggression troops presence in south Korea. The escalating tension on the Korean peninsula is also attributable to south Korea-based U.S. troops moves to launch a war of aggression against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The measure unilaterally taken by the U.S. to cut down its troops in south Korea has deprived them of UN helmets and made it hard for it to insist any longer that they are UN forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This measure also laid bare the brazen-faced and deceptive nature of the U.S. which has ignored and mocked at the UN. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had better stop insisting that the U.S. forces are UN forces. It should not fool the world public with a talk about partial troop cutdown but completely pull its troops out of south Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They are painting the issue as a \"dangerous and serious problem\" which should be brought up for discussion at the United Nations, distorting and hyping it.\r\n In this regard Minju Joson Wednesday says in a signed commentary: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTheir behavior is nothing but a rash action which can convince no one as it is like putting the cart before the horse. The commentary cites facts to prove that the U.S. is to blame for rendering the nuclear issue dangerous and serious. It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now the Bush administration is working hard to bridge over the serious political crisis created due to its wrong foreign policy come what may and create an atmosphere favorable for his reelection without fail. Its hard work resulted in dreaming up \"an offensive for pressurizing north Korea over the nuclear issue,\" the offensive aimed at distorting and hyping it and laying the blame for it at the door of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The heavyweights of the Bush administration are seriously mistaken if they calculate they can retrieve their foreign policy failure through this offensive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to settle the nuclear issue, the U.S. should clarify its commitment to observe the principle of \"words for words\" and \"action for action\" and honestly fulfill it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an undisguised escape from reality and the evasion of responsibility to waste time, refusing to fulfill its commitment and finding fault with others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should behave in good faith with a political decision as it is a party directly responsible for the settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
