Kim Jong Il set forth the revolutionary policy on bringing about a new turn in the work of the union as required by the process of modeling all members of the society on the Juche idea and has wisely led the journalists and other media persons to fully discharge their duties as the ideological standard-bearers of the Party in the efforts to accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche, the Songun revolutionary cause. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The message highly praised the officials of the union and all the journalists and other media persons for having successfully carried out their revolutionary duties as forerunners in the ideological work of the Party with loyalty and devotion to the Party and the revolution over the last six decades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also expressed the firm belief that they would singled-mindedly unite around Kim Jong Il and perform in a responsible manner the role of an admirable educator, hard-working information personnel and faithful mouthpiece in carrying into practice the idea and leadership of the Party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Kum Bok, vice-chairman of the KJU Central Committee, made a report at the meeting.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Respect for Sovereignty Called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 29 (KCNA) -- What is most important for establishing a fair international order is to respect the sovereignty of every country and establish equal relations among countries. It is a fundamental requirement for building a new fair international order to abide by the principle of respect for sovereignty. \r\n Rodong Sinmun Sunday says this in a by-lined article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Without having sovereignty guaranteed, it is impossible to ensure the independent development of a country and nation nor is it possible to preserve and consolidate world peace and security. Nobody has the right to infringe upon the sovereignty of other country and nation. For this reason, the principle of respect for sovereignty constitutes a universally accepted norm governing the international relations to be observed by all countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though this principle serves as a basis on which to develop international relations, the new century is witnessing more undisguised acts of infringing upon the sovereignty of other countries and nations. The imperialists are chiefly to blame for this. The U.S. imperialists, in particular, are behaving as they please, lording it over the international arena in utter disregard of international law, justice and impartiality. The \"anti-terrorism war\" launched by the U.S. imperialists since the outset of the new century is an act of aggression intended to infringe upon the sovereignty of other countries and establish an order for world domination. This hard reality goes to prove that the building of a new fair international order would turn out to be nothing but an empty talk unless the moves of the imperialists to infringe upon the sovereignty are foiled. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the principle of respect for sovereignty is to be firmly observed, it is necessary not to tolerate any interference in the internal affairs of other countries and nations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All countries and nations should stand firm against the moves of the imperialists to meddle in their internal affairs. When they make a concession to the imperialists' demand, they will be forced to concede a hundred times and then lose their sovereignty in the end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should not allow the high-handed and arbitrary practices of the imperialists. They are getting more desperate in their high-handed acts. This reality goes to prove that it is very important to build up military muscle strong enough to decisively counter their moves. It is a day dream to expect someone to protect one's sovereignty or calculate that any compromise or concession may help defend one's sovereignty, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This marked a historic event as it ushered in a new era of the Korean revolution in which it advanced on the principle of independence against all sorts of flunkeyism and dogmatism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said tradition that originated from the DIU has served as a fundamental guarantee and a driving force that has helped the Korean revolution dynamically advance along the road of victory without vacillation in any storm and stress for the past eight decades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The President had consistently maintained the principle of independence, the banner of Juche held aloft by the DIU, in the whole period of leading the Korean revolution and led the Korean people to settle all issues arising in the revolution and construction by their own efforts in a responsible manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The slogan \"Let us live our own way!\" put up by the Workers' Party of Korea fully reflects the revolutionary faith and will of the Party, the army and the people in the DPRK to inherit to the last the great tradition of the struggle to establish Juche which originated from the DIU and carry out the revolution and construction their own way, guided by their own faith no matter which way the wind may blow. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said tradition serves as a valuable treasure as it encourages the servicepersons and people to win victory in the stand-off with U.S.-led imperialism and successfully push ahead with the building of a great prosperous powerful socialist nation under the Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK enjoys ever-growing dignity and might and the Korean revolution witnesses a new historic turn despite the daily pronounced hostile policy of the U.S. imperialists towards it. This is a striking demonstration of the WPK's line of independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tradition is based on the firm faith of the Korean people to carry out the revolution and construction according to their independent judgment and determination and the idea of achieving the prosperity of the country and the nation by relying on their own efforts. This great tradition serves as an eternal banner of victory as it guides the revolutionary cause in the DPRK to advance along a straight path, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It was thanks to the Songun policy that the DPRK could successfully push ahead with the socialist construction despite all threats and difficulties and has now acquired high nuclear technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We join the world revolutionaries in extending unequivocal support to the struggle of the DPRK, the WPK and the Korean people led by Kim Jong Il.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The commentary says: This is a clear indication that the new Japanese ruling quarters are invariably pursuing the policy of reviving militarism. This is a blatant mockery of and challenge to peace and, at the same time, an unpardonable act of rubbing salt into the wounds of the Asian people.\r\n Noting that the Japanese ruling quarters' visit to the shrine presents itself as a very sensitive political issue, the commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their visit to the shrine is not intended to \"repent of the crimes committed by Japan in the past\" as they claim but instill the militaristic idea into the Japanese people in a bid to create a social atmosphere for reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Japanese reactionaries' moves to instill the militaristic idea into the Japanese and their moves for overseas aggression are overlooked, they will bring again horrendous disasters to the Asian people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said moves frantically stepped up by the Japanese reactionaries, while persistently evading the liquidation of their past crimes are little short of pushing Japan to self-destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities would be well advised to behave themselves, clearly mindful that it is the only way of regaining the trust of the international community to abandon their ambition for overseas expansion, honestly repent of the past crimes committed by Japan and redress them as early as possible.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
