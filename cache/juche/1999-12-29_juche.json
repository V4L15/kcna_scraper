It rezoned tens of thousands of hectares of fields into standardized ones to successfully carry out the comprehensive mechanization of farming. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   For example, the second work-team of the Ranjong co-operative farm in Kosan county had more than 800 patches. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Land rezoning turned them into 36 standardized fields and brought nearly 2 hectares of land under cultivation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the past there were only patches, each covering 30-40 Phyong (1 Phyong equals six square feet) and there was neither road nor irrigation and drainage systems to speak of in the province. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   After land rezoning odd 2,680 irrigation and drainage systems have been set up in the arable land and roads stretch in the fields with an interval of 500 metres in favour of mechanization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The province finished the land rezoning in a matter of a few months though it was hard pressed for everything including machines and fuel. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Credit for this great change goes to the energetic leadership of General Secretary Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He visited the province to guide its land rezoning and elaborated on the orientation and ways of finishing the project at the earliest possible date.  He said that the land rezoning was important not merely in solving the food problem of the province but also in setting an  example and generalizing it throughout the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Even after the project was finished, he visited its fields several times and took a measure of sending there modern farm machines and materials so that the rezoned land could pay off in farming. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   North Phyongan Province, too, is undertaking land rezoning on a full scale. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The province, drawing on the experience gained by Kangwon Province in land rezoning, has readjusted a large area of cultivated fields into standardized ones in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude. \r\n\r\n"
