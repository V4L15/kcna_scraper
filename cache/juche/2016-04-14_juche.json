These are a crafty trick to divert international criticism of it to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is trying to convince the public that the nuclear threats increase worldwide and the situation on the Korean peninsula is rendered tense due to the DPRK but it is no more than a wild act that can never be understood by persons of reason.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's access to nuclear weapons is not a threat but an inevitable option for self-defence to defend the country and the nation from the nuclear disaster that may be caused by the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the DPRK had not opted for their access to the nuclear weapons and not bolstered them up steadily, it would have fallen victim to a nuclear attack by the U.S. more than a hundred times just as Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is clearly proven by the nuclear war exercises targeting the DPRK being staged in south Korea as well as the plan for nuclear attack and the moves for deployment of nuclear weapons ceaselessly committed by the U.S. against the DPRK for more than half a century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kerry went impudent as to talk about efforts for worldwide dismantlement of nuclear weapons but had it not been for the existence of the U.S., the nuclear threat would not have been posed to the earth and the issue of building \"a world without nuclear weapons\" would not have cropped up.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the U.S. which made the nuclear weapons for the first time in the world and it is again the U.S. which dropped A-bombs on mankind and it is also the U.S. which is stepping up the modernization of nuclear weapons after designating sovereign states as targets of a preemptive nuclear attack.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is also the U.S. which persists in escalating the tension on the Korean peninsula in a bid to invent a pretext for keeping hegemonic status in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That the DPRK is getting itself fully ready for nuclear attack to react to the U.S. attack in kind is not only to defend its right to existence but to safeguard the regional and world peace and security from the nuclear threats of the U.S. which is brandishing its nuclear stick at random.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This time the Japanese prime minister, far from wresting an apology from the U.S., an assailant which inflicted the nuclear disaster on his own nation, chimed in with the U.S. while reading its face.

Pero, si no hubiera existido el imperio americano en nuestro planeta, no habria surgido ni la amenaza nuclear ni el problema de construccion del \"mundo sin armas nucleares\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. es el primer pais que fabrico las armas nucleares y unico pais que acarreo los desastres nucleares a la humanidad. Y ahora da acicate a la modernizacion de armas nucleares fijando a algunos Estados soberanos como blancos de ataque preventivo nuclear. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. agrava persistentemente la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana para preparar el pretexto favorable a mantener la posicion hegemonica en la region de Asia-Pacifico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHacemos todos los preparativos de ataque nuclear frente a la ofensiva nuclear de EE.UU., lo cual es una medida para defender el derecho a vivir y la paz y seguridad de la region y el resto del mundo desde la amenaza nuclear de este imperio yanqui que blande a su antojo el garrote nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl premier japones se alio tontamente a EE.UU. observando su actitud, lejos de obtener las disculpas de este imperio que impuso las calamidades nucleares a su nacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapon, golpeado por las bombas nucleares de EE.UU. por primera vez y unicamente en el mundo, actuo vilmente adulando a EE.UU. en la zona damnificada, lo cual demuestra claramente su situacion miserable como enano politico que se ve obligado a seguir a ciegas a su amo gringo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuanto mas recurran las fuerzas hostiles a la imprudente campana de presion contra nuestro pais, tanto mas fortaleceremos el remedio omnipotente nuclear de autodefensa para extirpar la causa raigal de la calamidad nuclear que amenaza la humanidad, manteniendo la linea del desarrollo paralelo de la construccion economica y la de las fuerzas armadas nucleares."
