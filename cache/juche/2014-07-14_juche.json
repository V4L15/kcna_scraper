Korea\r\n Pyongyang, July 14 (KCNA) -- Recently the U.S. sold more than 360 shells called CBU-105 worth about 200 million U.S. dollars to south Korea. They are reportedly capable of destroying armored vehicles. \n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Monday observes in a commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. claims that the massive sale of latest weaponry to south Korea is to \"deter\" nuclear weapons and missiles of the DPRK. This is, however, nothing but sheer sophism to justify its criminal deployment or selling of weapons and give a shot in the arm of south Korea running helter-skelter, squeezed among big powers. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The final aim of the U.S.  hostile policy toward the DPRK is a war of aggression. It is its calculation to continue using south Korea as a shock brigade for a war against the DPRK and ignite an actual war any moment. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It seeks to ceaselessly stockpile latest weapons for a preemptive attack on the DPRK and potential enemies in south Korea, its forward arsenal, and use them at once when a proper time comes in a bid to bring the disaster of a new nuclear war to Northeast Asia and the Asia-Pacific region. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To this end, the U.S. is frequently staging dangerous war drills to escalate the tension on the Korean peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is planning to stage a \"drill to intercept planes\" with south Korea from mid July and Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military drill in August. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Herein lie the danger and gravity of the U.S. massive deployment and sale of weapons to south Korea. Consequently, the Korean peninsula and the Asia-Pacific region have become the biggest hotspot in the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is sadly mistaken if it calculates it will go safe when it lets the above-said arsenal go off. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should bear in mind that this case will bring its self-destruction."

It, at the same time, regards the DPRK as the first target to stifle in executing its domination strategy and a pretext for covering up its hegemonic scenario.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is for this reason that the U.S. has long instigated its allies to escalate confrontation, while describing the DPRK's just measures for self-defence as \"threats\" to regional stability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is against this backdrop that the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff blustered that the DPRK's measure of bolstering up a military deterrence \"highlights the importance of tri-partite cooperation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It seems that the U.S. finds it hard to invent more plausible pretext than the story about \"threat from north Korea\" for instigating its allies into the aggression moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But its hackneyed trick will not work today.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should clearly know that with nothing can it cover up its wild hegemonic ambition."
