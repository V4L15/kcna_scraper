Es decir, deben ser padres verdaderos de los alumnos antes de ser sus educadores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos alumnos de las escuelas revolucionarias son los hijos del Partido del Trabajo de Corea, que viven unidos a esta organizacion con el mismo vaso sanguineo, y los mios.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEllos deben esforzarse tenazmente por prepararse como pilares de la Corea del Songun teniendo siempre presente la inmensa confianza y benevolencias de los grandes Generalisimos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo la consigna \"!Aprendamos para Corea!\" presentada por el Generalisimo Kim Jong Il cuando convivia con los hijos de los martires revolucionarios de la Escuela Revolucionaria de Mangyongdae, deben aprender con asiduo ahorrando el tiempo y formarse como revolucionarios competentes que puedan cumplir papel importante en la lucha por realizar los anhelos de los Generalisimos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos graduados de las escuelas deben ser pilares y cumplir el papel de vanguardia en continuar firmemente el linaje de Mangyongdae y el del monte Paektu como los hijos de Mangyongdae crecidos bajo la guia de los 3 Generales del monte Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDeben desempenar el rol protagonico en apoyar la direccion del partido sobre la revolucion mediante el Songun cumpliendo fielmente sus tareas de trabajo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl final del mensaje, el Mariscal Kim Jong Un expuso su firme conviccion de que las escuelas revolucionarias formaran magnificamente a los hijos de Mangyongdae como pilares fidedignos, que asumiran en el futuro las responsabilidades del partido, el Estado y el ejercito segun la idea y el proposito del partido, y de que todos los hijos de los martires revolucionarios seran combatientes vanguardistas que apoyaran con fidelidad la direccion del Songun del partido."
