It has also been revealed that his agent got a rebate of 200 billion won for him through contracts between the Hanbo business group and foreign companies. \r\n   The anger of the people and political circles was growing stronger with the revelation of a plot hatched by Kim Hyon Chol with his associates and through his private organization to avoid a \"parliamentary interpellation session.\"   \r\n   Upset by the developments,  The Kim Young Sam group is desperately trying to conceal the truth and assuage public anger. \r\n   In order to put a gag on those related to the incident, the group has forced them to cancel even their planned press conferences,  saying that unfettered media reports on \r\nthe Hanbo incident are undesirable.    \r\n   Meanwhile, Kim Young Sam, feeling uneasy about even the formal investigation into the incident, which has been going on in a planned way, arranged by the puppet prosecution, has opently suggested  its stoppage. He, through the \"Secretary General of the New Korea Party\", said on March 24, \"the investigation should be carried out as early as possible to keep the suspicion concerning the Hanbo incident from increasing\" and \"prosecution has the same view.\" This means that he, at bottom, ordered to hush up the incident by bringing the investigation to an end hastily.\r\n   All the facts show his clan's crimes revealed through the Hanbo incident are only the tip of the iceberg and that with Kim Young Sam, the chief culprit of the incident, left in power, true criminals of the incident can never be detected and punished. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
