            "content": "Safe Return of DPRK's Trading Cargo Ship Mudubong Urged\r\n Pyongyang, April 17 (KCNA) -- The manager of the Mudubong Marine Transport Co. Ltd. gave the following answer to the question put by KCNA Thursday in connection with the fact that its cargo ship Mudubong has been interned for nine months in Mexico for an unjustifiable reason:\n\t\t\t\t\t Mudubong, a trading cargo ship of our company, was stranded on coral reef off Tuxpan Port of Mexico on July 14, 2014 to be interned by the Mexican authorities for damaging coral reef.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the accident we indemnified losses under Mexican rules including relief fund.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On January 17, 2015 the Mexican authorities sent an official document to us to inform that they would send the ship back to us and notified us that they would deliver a document on lifting the internment of the ship to us, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the authorities are now not allowing the departure of the ship, claiming they received a request not to let the ship leave until a \"decision\" is made by the Sanctions Committee against the North of the UN Security Council.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A man who claimed to be a coordinator of experts group of the Committee instructed the internment of the ship upon the authorization of the Committee and spread the false story that the ship belongs to the Wonyang Marine Transport Management Co. Ltd. which is allegedly on the list of sanctions in a bid to freeze the sailing of the ship at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an unreasonable attempt from every aspect.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Firstly, Mudubong is a legitimate property of the Mudubong Marine Transport Co. Ltd., an independent corporate body that came into being under the law of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our company, as a social cooperative organization that was set up in October 2008 with the money invested by individuals, has a certificate of investor and an agreement on the establishment of the company and a document confirmed by a relevant notary's office.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As an owner of the ship Mudubong, our company received business license from the Ministry of Land and Maritime Transport of the DPRK and its business license number is 13-203.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Mudubong has ship registration certificate issued by the Maritime Administration of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Mudubong Marine Transport Co. Ltd. has been registered as the owner of Mudubong and the identification number of the company is 5435991.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The claim that Mudubong does not belong to our company despite these documents recognized at home and abroad would mean depriving investors of their ownership and ignoring laws of the DPRK and it would be just the intentional negation of the authorized institutions of the DPRK that issued those certificates.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The claim that Mudubong belongs to the Wonyang Marine Transport Management Co. Ltd. is a wanton violation of the sovereignty of the DPRK as it is nothing but a far-fetched assertion to keep the ship under detention for an indefinite period and freeze its sailing in the end.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Secondly, the Wonyang Marine Transport Management Co. Ltd. is a company specializing in the management of trading cargo ships and is an independent corporate body.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Just like our company the Wonyang also has its own business license concerning ship management, crew management and mediation of ship chartering, etc. issued by the Ministry of Land and Maritime Transport of the DPRK under its law and regulations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ship management offers one or more professional services to ship-owner company at its request irrespective of ownership.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lots of ship-owners conclude contracts with management companies and entrust business activities to them in order to satisfactorily meet the requirements of regulations set by the International Maritime Organization on safety of human lives in the sea and on environmental protection and to raise efficiency of ship management that requires professional knowledge such as technical management of ships, hiring of crew, disputes and insurance. Data say approximately 35 percent of world trading cargo ships are managed by ship management companies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If ships managed by lots of management companies of the world belong to management companies, ship-owners will burst into side-splitting laughter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To persistently insist that Mudubong comes under the possession of the Wonyang which is responsible for the management of the ship would mean either ignorance of international marine transport usage or intentional denial of it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thirdly, the Wonyang Marine Transport Management Co. Ltd. is just responsible for those matters that require professional knowledge concerning ship management and operation including management for safety of Mudubong and technical guidance within the framework of contract signed with our company.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our company quarterly pays management fee under the management contract signed with this company which in turn offers professional services for Mudubong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Mudubong has been supplied with fuel and spare parts under favorable conditions and at reasonable price through this company that has contacts with many business partners in the world and it passed through canals and called at foreign ports at competitive costs with the help of this company and with its arrangement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our company and the Wonyang have equal relations as a client of special service and provider of special service on the basis of payment conditions and neither of them orders nor controls the other party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To claim that Wonyang possesses and controls Mudubong simply because of the professional services it offers to the ship and touch it gets with foreign dealers for Mudubong at our request would be just a far-fetched assertion based on the way of thinking of the mentally deranged.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Mudubong has been under internment at Tuxpan Port for nine months and has been denied its departure for three months.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its crew and their family members are suffering from unspeakable physical and mental pain due to this abnormal situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our company has already suffered huge losses. If safe return of Mudubong, legitimate property of our company, is held in check, we are thinking of taking legal measures to have damage and losses indemnified.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I, in the name of the crew and their family members and in the name of all of us, strongly demand the parties concerned to stop meaningless controversy and the internment of the ship and ensure at once the safe homeward voyage of the peaceable trading cargo ship Mudubong on the principle of impartiality and humanitarianism."

He went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists are threatening the DPRK but it is no more than bluffing. No force on earth can match the DPRK growing stronger by dint of Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A vice-general secretary of the Islamic Coalition Party of Iran praised the President as a prominent statesman and greatest man recognized by the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The chairman of the Anti-Imperialist Forum of Germany expressed conviction that the President will be remembered by the Koreans and world progressive people as the sun and his cause will be successfully accomplished by Marshal Kim Jong Un."

Estas palabras absurdas no pueden convencer a nadie tanto en vista del proposito de desarrollo, la mision y las especificaciones de THAAD como a la luz de la intencion estrategica y el objetivo agresivo de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl objetivo de desarrollo de THAAD reside en tomar el dominio y hegemonia militar en la Peninsula Coreana y la region del Nordeste de Asia y sus blancos son varios paises de la region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, partiendo de su logica de bandido, los titeres surcoreanos hablan tanto de la \"amenaza nuclear del Norte\" dejando a un lado su crimen de haber colaborado en las maniobras de guerra nuclear de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste hecho deja conocer el gran cinismo de ellos enloquecidos por el servilismo pronorteamericano y la confrontacion fratricida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa \"amenaza de armas nucleares y misiles del Norte\", que suelen mencionar EE.UU. y la banda titere surcoreana, no es mas que un pretexto para ultimar los preparativos de guerra nuclear al introducir en el Sur de Corea los medios de ataque preventivo nuclear como THAAD y establecer el sistema de defensa antimisiles de EE.UU. y para asestar en cualquier momento el ataque preventivo nuclear contra la RPDC y los paises vecinos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin lugar a dudas, el emplazamiento de THAAD agravara el peligro de guerra nuclear mundial porque el Sur de Corea se hara la base avanzada nuclear y polvorin nuclear mas grande para el cumplimiento de la estrategia norteamericana de aplastar a la RPDC y dominar la region de Asia-Pacifico y los paises vecinos se convertiran en blancos de ataque nuclear de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC no estara con brazos cruzados ante las peligrosas pretensiones de los titeres surcoreanos y EE.UU. de desplegar el THAAD y fortalecera el disuasivo nuclear de autodefensa para los maximos intereses del pais, la seguridad nacional y la paz regional."

Segun las estadisticas, lo hacen aproximadamente el 35 % de los cargueros comerciales del mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTeniendo en cuenta tales hechos, la insistencia en que \"Mudubong\" es propiedad de la Corporacion Limitada de Administracion de Transporte Maritimo Wonyang se consideraria como ignorancia o negacion intencional a las costumbres maritimas internacionales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn tercer lugar, la Corporacion Limitada de Administracion de Transporte Maritimo Wonyang se encarga solo de la seguridad, la direccion tecnica y otras labores en que se necesitan los conocimientos especializados en la administracion del barco \"Mudubong\" en el marco del contacto concertado con nuestra compania. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun el contacto, nuestra compania paga en cada trimestre la cuota de administracion acordada, a cambio de la cual esa corporacion ofrece los servicios especializados al barco \"Mudubong\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor intermedio de la Wonyang que tiene muchas relaciones comerciales en el mundo, \"Mudubong\" recibio combustibles y accesorios de barco a precios y condiciones ventajosos y con su ayuda, paso los canales y arribo a los puertos extranjeros con gastos competitivos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestra compania y la Wonyang tienen las relaciones igualitarias entre el demandante y el ofrecedor de servicios especializados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa pasaron 9 meses desde la retencion del barco \"Mudubong\" en el Puerto de Tuxpan, y tres meses desde que fuera desautorizada su salida. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido a tal situacion anormal, los tripulantes y sus familiares sufren indecibles dolores fisicos y mentales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSon enormes las perdidas economicas que sufrio nuestra compania en ese plazo. Si \"Mudubong\" no regresa sano y salvo, tomaremos las medidas juridicas para recibir la indemnizacion merecida. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn nombre de los tripulantes y sus familiares y en el de todos nosotros, demando fuertemente a todas las partes interesadas dejar la discusion innecesaria y la retencion y asegurar ahora mismo el regreso seguro del barco comercial pacifista \"Mudubong\" en el principio de imparcialidad y humanitarismo."
