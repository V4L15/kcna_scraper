Korean Authorities Accused of Scattering Leaflets Hurting Dignity of Supreme Leadership of DPRK\r\nPyongyang, March 25 (KCNA) -- The south Korean puppet military group Monday committed such hideous provocations as firing bullets and shells from the five islands and in their vicinity in the West Sea of Korea including Paekryong Island and Taeyonphyong Island and scattering leaflets hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership and the social system in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea in its information bulletin 1058 issued Tuesday said  that such reckless actions of the puppet military gangsters can never be tolerated as they are a very serious case pushing the north-south relations to an uncontrollable  catastrophe.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe above-said leaflets-scattering operation carried out on the five islands and in their vicinity in the West Sea of Korea, the biggest hotspots, is an extremely reckless action that can be perpetrated only by the puppet military hooligans steeped in confrontation hysteria to the marrow of their bones, the bulletin noted, and continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWith no rhetoric can the south Korean authorities justify the hideous provocative act of hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership and the social system in the DPRK committed by the puppet military group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean chief executive had better put under control something serious happening inside south Korea, not resorting to the charade of misleading the public opinion at home and abroad by creating impression that she is interested in the improvement of the inter-Korean relations with such words as \"confidence\" and \"unification\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe reality goes to clearly prove that there can be neither improved inter-Korean relations nor peace on the Korean peninsula as long as the diehard military gangsters are allowed to dare hurt the inviolable dignity of our supreme leadership.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOur army and people will never pardon even the slightest act of hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership and the social system in the DPRK but deal merciless sledge-hammer blows at its perpetrators.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe provocateurs will be held entirely accountable for the disastrous consequences caused to the inter-Korean relations in the future."
