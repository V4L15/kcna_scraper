They have turned South Korea into their colony and hereditary estate, holding it in political, military, economic, cultural and all other leashes, an indication of a most malicious system of colonial domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The article cites facts to prove that in the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s they, far from drawing a lesson from their ignominious defeat in the Korean War of aggression in the 1950s, have stepped up preparations for a war of aggression in a bid to invade the North Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It documents that they have been a source of artificial division of the Korean nation and hindrance to the reunification of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It further says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Korea would not have been divided, but its people would have long remained a reunified nation if it were not the yankees. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They divided Korea and obstructed its reunification by crook. That is their greatest crime in the world in the 20th century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Humankind is reviewing the 1900s and seeing in the 2000s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is time the account was finally settled with the U.S. with its inglorious traces of aggression, plunder and murder.   Hopefully, the Korean people are not permanently prejudiced against the U.S. as a sworn enemy. The U.S. must repent of its past wrongdoings and stop aggression and intervention in Korea. \r\n\r\n"

The facts give a serious lesson that any dialogue or compromise with those who turn aside from the principles will only result in delaying the fellow countrymen's cause of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Through the August 15 pan-national rallies for reunification in the past decade  the pro-reunification patriotic forces of the Korean nation have grown up to be a powerful driving force of national reunification that can neither be destroyed nor be stamped out. \r\n\r\n"
