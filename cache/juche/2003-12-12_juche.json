Korea under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 11 (KCNA) -- The Taegu District Court of south Korea a few days ago brought to trial the chairman of the General Student Council of Keimyung University who is member of the Central Committee of the 11th-term south Korean Federation of University Student Councils (Hanchongryon) and committed such fascist outrage as sentencing him to two years and six months in prison, one-year suspension of qualification and four-year stay of execution on the charge of \"joining an enemy-benefiting organization\" in violation of the \"Security Law\". We cannot but take a serious note of the fact that the court branded Hanchongryon as an \"enemy-benefiting organization\" by linking it with the north in a far-fetched manner alleging that the 11th-tern Hanchongryon \"accepted the north's line of reunifying the country by communizing the south\" through the National Alliance of Youth and Students for the Country's Reunification and taking issue with its \"guideline of struggle\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun today denounces it as a prelude to a renewed offensive of fascist crackdown on the pro-reunification patriotic forces of south Korea, an unpardonable fascist outrage challenging the nation's desire for reunification and a grave provocation against the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Labeling Hanchongryon as an \"enemy-benefiting organization\" is a slander and an insult to this righteous student organization and, moreover, talking about the \"enemy-benefiting character\" of Hanchongryon today when all people are calling for reunifying the country by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation is a denial of the June 15 joint declaration and it discloses the lack of the will to implement the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such tragedies in south Korea as patriots being taken to prison and righteous organizations incriminated must not continue any longer and remnants of the dictatorship era doing harm to the movement for independent reunification through national cooperation must be eliminated at an early date. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The attitude toward Hanchongryon is not merely an issue confined to an organization but a yardstick pointing up whether one is for reunifying the country independently by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation, or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean judicial authorities should look straight into the trend of the times and act with discretion.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This was an entirely just exercise of its sovereign right because the action was taken as the U.S. totally scrapped the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists adequately examined the feasibility and effectiveness of the plan to ignite the second Korean war through the Iraqi war. The ultimate goal of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK was to provoke the second Korean war, a nuclear war. They needed a blasting fuse for this. The second nuclear crisis was to serve that purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits attention in the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK this year is that it increased its pressure upon the DPRK to the utmost. It was the U.S. tactics and design to bring the DPRK to its knees and wrest concessions from it through such persistent and stubborn offensive of pressure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The confrontation between the DPRK and the U.S. is the gravest and fiercest under the present international situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis is the life and death political and ideological confrontation, confrontation with the U.S. in faith and will and a military showdown. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article describes 2003 as a proud year of victory in which the DPRK fully demonstrated its dignity as Songun Korea in its confrontation with the U.S. thanks to the Songun revolutionary leadership and outstanding strategy of Kim Jong Il and the might of its armed forces.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
