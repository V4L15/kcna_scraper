            "content": "What does five months in S. Korea show?\r\nPyongyang, July 30 (KCNA) -- Though five months has passed since a change of regime in South Korea, there has been no change in policy and everything remains unchanged.\r\n   Politics still exists in a vacuum and the situation of the IMF-controlled economy has become all the more serious.\r\n   The political confusion and economic failure of South Korea have put a dunce's cap on the head of the self-styled \"people's regime.\"\r\n   Commenting on what the South Korean authorities have done over the past five months, Rodong Sinmun today says:\r\n   The \"policy towards the north\" they have pursued, crying for \"improvement of inter-Korean relations\" and \"reconciliation and cooperation,\" is mere rhetoric.\r\n   We have patiently kept a watchful eye on what their policy calling for \"reconciliation and cooperation\" and \"separation between politics and economy\" is like. But the South Korean authorities brought forward \"reciprocity\" at the vice-minister-level contact between the north and the south in Beijing and even planted a tapping apparatus at the negotiating table. As a result, the contact, which was held after a long interval between the two parts of Korea, broke off.\r\n   When we proposed an August 15 grand festival for national reconciliation, unity and reunification, only the South Korean rulers showed a negative attitude to it. They are excluding from the festival the south headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification and the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils, the main forces of the reunification movement in South Korea, and scheming to foil the festival with the participation of riffraff's.\r\n   While crying for the \"separation between politics and economy,\" they have politicized South Koreans' visit to the north, used it for the purpose of escalating anticommunist, anti-north confrontation and infiltrated spies into the north through borders and seas for subversion and sabotage. Worse still, they have defined the north, their dialogue partner, as \"sworn enemy\" and allowed U.S. nuclear-powered flattops and huge combat equipment to be deployed in the sea off the Korean peninsula. Such acts are an open challenge to and provocation against the north.\r\n   What the South Korean authorities have done over the past five months proves that they are seeking dependence on outsiders, fascism, confrontation and war, not national independence, democracy and reunification.\r\n   They should renounce the outdated policy of dependence on outsiders, the policy of anti-north, anti-reunification confrontation and make a policy switchover towards national independence, alliance and reconciliation with the north and reunification. They should also reject outsiders and preserve the Juche character and national character. This is the only way out for South Korea. We will closely watch their future attitude. \r\n    \r\n"

The South Korean authorities had better stop running amuck, clearly knowing that they will finally kill themselves while dancing to the frantic military tune of its American masters.\r\n   If the enemies dare violate the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK even a bit in defiance of our repeated warnings, the Korean people and People's Army will turn out as one to annihilate the aggressors. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
