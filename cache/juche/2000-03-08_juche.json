            "content": "KCNA on U.S. \"annual human rights report\" \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 8 (KCNA) -- As already reported, the U.S. State Department in a recent \"annual report\" on the world human rights slandered the DPRK again.\r\n   The \"annual report\" does not deserve even a passing note as it is full of absurd view on value and logic reversing black and white. Because the United States is not qualified to say anything about the human rights situation in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Out of every 100,000 people in the U.S. eight persons are murdered, at least 300 injured, more than 70 women raped, at least 200 people plundered and over 5,000 people are robbed of their properties every year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   No wonder, criminals call the U.S. a \"heaven\" for murderers, rapists, plunderers and thieves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Worse still, over 10 million jobless people and at least 6.1 million children are wandering about the streets. At least 46 million people are below the poverty line and one fourth of the children are suffering from malnutrition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   And more than 47 million people are suffering from diseases without getting any simple health care. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This poorest human rights record in the U.S. is attributable to its social system's degeneration of human ethics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Prevalent in the U.S. are only the view on life and inhuman politicial view based on the jungle law that \"a man must be a wolf towards the other man.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is nothing but a political caricature for the U.S. to talk about political freedom and rights, though it is not in a position to guarantee the right to existence to the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is ill-famed for the poorest human rights record and the most serious violation of human rights in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   However, the U.S. styles itself a \"judge of human rights.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is well advised to be in the dock as the arch violator of human rights before vociferating about \"human rights issues\" in other countries.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean authorities hit for blocking Pyongyang visit of Kim family \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 8 (KCNA) -- The secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland yesterday published information bulletin no. 803  denouncing the South Korean authorities for blocking the visit to Pyongyang of the family of the late Kim Ryang Mu, permanent vice-chairman of the south headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification (Pomminryon).\r\n   The South Korean \"Ministry of Unification\" turned down the application filed by the widow and two daughters of Kim Ryang Mu, who died in January, for their visit to Pyongyang to deliver his hair and mementoes under an unreasonable pretext that \"There is a high possibility of somebody's use of them for a political propaganda.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This clearly indicates that having committed inhuman acts which led to Kim Ryang Mu's death, the South Korean authorities are going to politically persecute and suppress his family even after his death, the information bulletin said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   By blocking the Pyongyang visit of his family the South Korean authorities once again disclosed their unjust position on the pro-reunification patriotic movement in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities should halt the unjust crackdown on the south headquarters of pomminryon, the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils and other pro-reunification patriotic organizations and pro-reunification figures and legalize all their activities. And they should allow at an early date the Pyongyang visit of the late Kim Ryang Mu's family aimed to fulfil his will.    \r\n\r\n"

Under his army-first politics Korean socialism has always emerged victorious and the DPRK has demonstrated its might to the full. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The imperialists are very afraid of the invincible might of the Korean people's army. the realities of the DPRK clearly prove that the army-first politics is the all-powerful sword for defending socialism and a powerful weapon for realizing the human cause of independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What impressed him during the stay is also the benevolent politics that can be found only in the DPRK, he said, adding: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The history of this politics shaped by President Kim Il Sung is now being continued successfully by Kim Jong Il, the great successor to his cause.    \r\n\r\n"

Man lives dominating nature and society, not subjected to his surrounding world. There are many areas and objects in the world that man does not dominate. Man, however, is steadily expanding his sphere of domination as his cognition faculty and practical capacity are increased. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   That man decides everything means that he plays a decisive role in transforming nature and society and shaping his destiny. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Man plays a leading role in transforming the world contrary to the spontaneous interaction of the material world in general. Great are influence and action of objective factors such as the prevailing circumstances and material and technological means in transforming and developing the world. but it is man who matures objective conditions, makes material and technological means and uses them. As a result, their use and might depends on man. This proves that man plays a decisive role in transforming the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The philosophical principle of Juche clarifies that man is responsible for his destiny. No force on earth can be responsible for the destiny of man except for him.\r\n   Man can shape his destiny by himself. Man is hewing out his destiny while conquering nature with his creative labour and transforming society through continued revolutionary struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   With the clarification of the philosophical principle that man is the master of everything and that he decides everything, his position and role in the world are most correctly expounded and a right way is indicated for shaping his destiny.    \r\n\r\n"
