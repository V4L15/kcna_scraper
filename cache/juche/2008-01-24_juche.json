            "content": "Japan's Reckless Moves to Build Missile Shield Assailed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 23 (KCNA) -- The Defense Ministry of Japan, shortly ago, announced that it would soon operate such new anti-air system as automatic alert and control system under the pretext of countering the \"intrusion\" of \"unidentified\" fighters and others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, the headquarters for space science research of the Japan Organization for Space and Air Research and Development completed the plan for examining the launch of the new small satellite on Jan. 12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These facts go to prove that the Japanese reactionaries' military moves to boost the missile strike capability have entered the phase of full-scale implementation. Minju Joson Wednesday says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the strategic target and invariable ambition for Japan to build a missile shield and secure a military edge in Northeast Asia and realize its ambition for overseas invasion through preemptive missile strike at other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The moves of the Japanese reactionaries to build a missile shield in conspiracy with the U.S. have already gone beyond the phase of joint research and reached such a practical stage as joint development and deployment of missiles and actions to boost the missile strike capability. As a result, the danger of these military moves is increasing day by day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are spending a stupendous amount of funds for steadily updating the missile technology. This aims at modernizing weaponry and equipment of the Japan \"Self-Defense Forces\" to enable them to reinvade other countries independently, not being mere supporters to the U.S. war, and realizing at any cost in the new century its old dream of the \"Greater east Asia co-prosperity sphere,\" which it failed to do in the past, through preemptive missile strikes at other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is clear as noonday that if Japan is allowed to build the missile shield in real earnest, it will seriously threaten the regional peace and increase the military confrontation and danger of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This indicates that Japan is chiefly to blame for wrecking peace and stability in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries should bear deep in mind that their moves to build the missile shield for securing a military edge in Northeast Asia and mounting a preemptive attack would only precipitate their own self-destruction and immediately stop them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In this acute confrontation, the Korean people have won a great victory politico-ideologically, morally and strategically and tactically. The criminal attempt of the U.S. to stifle the DPRK, a forefront for accomplishing the cause of independence against imperialism and a socialist bulwark, met failure and bankruptcy.  The world people no longer regard the U.S. as \"the only superpower.�h Encouraged by the Korean people who beat back the U.S. imperialists' anti-DPRK offensive, the world people are further intensifying their struggle for independence against the U.S. than ever before. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Not a few changes are taking place in the international political landscape.

This is clearly evidenced by the fact that the U.S. is enforcing the illegal \"North Korean Human Rights Act\" aimed at wantonly meddling in the internal affairs of the DPRK after deliberately adopting it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the above-said countries are truly willing to deal with human rights issue, they should bring the U.S. to the court of human rights and punish it as it is chiefly to blame for abusing human rights in wanton violation of people�fs rights to enjoy independence and a genuine life, talking about sham human rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This being a hard reality, they are keeping silent about the U.S., the world�fs worst human rights abuser, and pulling up the DPRK over its non-existent \"human rights issue\" though it fully guarantees the people the right to enjoy independence and a genuine life. This is little short of backing the U.S. in its unjust interference in the internal affairs of other countries and human rights abuses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The noisy anti-DPRK \"human rights\" row kicked up by the U.S. and the EU and other Western countries more saliently reveals the injustice of their politicization, selectivity and application of double-standards in the matter of human rights.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
