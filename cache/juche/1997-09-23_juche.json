This is a proud picture of the KPA today.\"\r\n   \"Under comrade Kim Jong Il's tireless, energetic leadership the military strength of the KPA and the defence capabilities of the country have grown stronger than ever before.\"\r\n   \"He has visited more than 2,150 units and frontline posts of the KPA, making a journey as long as 66,400 kilometres on guidance mission so that combat and political training might be intensified and the fighting efficiency of each soldier matching a hundred foes be consolidated.\"\r\n   \"Today the KPA has grown to be a matchless army with powerful attack and defensive means, frustrated every bellicose move of the enemy and reliably defended the socialist country.\"\r\n   The reporter voiced the resolution of the KPA to exalt the enduring feats performed by Secretary Kim Jong Il in preparing the revolutionary armed forces as defender of the Party, the leader, the homeland and the people and maker of happiness.\r\n   Saying that he, the faithful successor to the revolutionary cause of Juche, is the veteran and experienced socialist political leader, ever-victorious iron-willed brilliant commander and genuine leader of the people, the reporter recommended him as General Secretary of the Party.\r\n   Speaking at the conference, Kim Yong Chun, Kim Il Chol and many other delegates fully supported the recommendation, noting that the KPA soldiers have long placed absolute confidence in the Supreme Commander. \r\n   They said the revolutionary armed forces, which reliably defend the WPK, will smash all the despicable moves of the imperialists and the renegades of revolution and always support with arms Korean socialism, the beacon of the cause of independence. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Kim Po Hyon was very satisfied with his loyalty and filial duty to his father and felt very pleased that he was carrying forward the tradition of the Mangyongdae family.\r\n   Secretary Kim Jong Il had a power of keen observation, insight and analysis in his childhood.\r\n   When he was a child, he found out why chickens raise their bills when they drink water and why there is no black flower. He also thought that one added to one makes two but it makes greater one in some cases. And the reverence of the people for President Kim Il Sung is one and the same and it is irresistible.\r\n   He has had ardent patriotism and free and easy character.\r\n   In a summer day, he saw that some people catched fish on the River Taedong with an explosive. He told them that even fries would die by explosive so they should use nets or hooks.\r\n   That evening, he let his father know what he saw. Later, a measure was taken to protect the country's resources.\r\n   Secretary Kim Jong Il would go to school by foot, wearing simple dress and rubber shoes and taking a cloth wrapper for books. In winter, he heat the stove at the classroom when his turn came.\r\n   He cultivated his traits more admirably through the building of a new country.\r\n   Accompanying his parents, he toured Pyongyang, Chongjin, Nampho, Sonbong, Taedong and other towns and farming and fishing villages. Seeing the people's enthusiasm and endeavours for the building of a new country and feeling their deep reverence for the President, inexhaustible strength, ardent patriotism he vowed to devote himself to the country and the people.\r\n   With such distinguished gifts, he has become the greatest man of Mt. Paektu type and a brilliant commander. \r\n\r\n"
