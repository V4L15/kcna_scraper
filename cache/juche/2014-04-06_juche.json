This provided a sure guarantee for dynamically pushing forward the building of a thriving socialist nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the DPRK holds Kim Jong Un in high esteem at the highest post of the revolution and there is the wise and seasoned leadership of the ever-victorious Workers' Party of Korea shining with the august names of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, the victory of the Juche cause of the building of a thriving socialist nation is sure to be accomplished, concludes the article."

It is now busy, deploying in Japan near the Korean peninsula a new high-performance radar for tracking ballistic missiles, additionally deploying interceptor missiles in the western region of the U.S. which already houses lots of interceptor missiles and reinforcing MD system on Guam.
