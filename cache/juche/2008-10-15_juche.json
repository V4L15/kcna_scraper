Gravest was the crime that they massacred Koreans en masse in cold-blooded way.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe brutal \"punitive operation\" in Jiandao is well illustrative of the brutality, cruelty and viciousness of the Japanese imperialists' genocide against the Korean people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn October 1920 they mobilized huge amounts of armed forces including the troops which had been dispatched to Siberia, a regiment under the 19th Division stationed in Korea and police corps of North and South Hamgyong Provinces under the cloak of \"protecting the lives and properties of the Japanese residents in Jiandao\" and slew Korean people, combing out the land of Jiandao.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey, therefore, turned Hunchun, Wangqing, Helong and other counties of Jilin Province, China where Koreans lived into a sea of blood.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis was the brutal \"punitive operation\" in the year of Kyongsin, which is known as the history of bloodshed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Japanese imperialists took all the villages where Koreans resided as the targets of the \"punitive operation\".
