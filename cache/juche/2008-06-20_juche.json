It finds itself in a new historical stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The great reality is unthinkable apart from the significant June of Juche 53 (1964) which turned a brilliant page in the history of the WPK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il with extraordinary leadership ability made a great oath to accomplish the revolutionary cause through generations as his lifelong mission in the historical period when he started the party work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over the last 40-odd years he has devoted his heart and soul to strengthen and develop the WPK into a powerful revolutionary party which carries forward the revolutionary cause of Juche pioneered by President Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He formulated the revolutionary idea of the President as a monolithic system of idea, theory and method of Juche, proclaimed the modeling of the whole society on the Juche idea as the supreme programme of the Party and made public a lot of famous works for strengthening and developing the party work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the demise of the President, he put forward the basic slogans of the Party--\"The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung will always be with us.\" and \"Let us arm ourselves more firmly with the revolutionary ideas of the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung!\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He also expounded the method of the party's leadership over the revolution and construction and led the efforts to bring about a revolutionary turn in the work system of the party organizations and in the work method and style of officials. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In those days a well-organized work system under which the whole party acts as one under the monolithic guidance of the Central Committee of the Party has been established more firmly and the party method of work of solving all the issues in reliance on the popular masses and popular style of work of taking care of the people with motherly character were created. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The party work has entered a new higher stage in the great Songun era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n General Secretary Kim Jong Il instructed officials that the party organizations should do the party work like the People's Army by embodying the revolutionary soldier spirit and wisely led the efforts to permeate the whole country with the Kanggye spirit, torchlight of Songgang and Thaechon spirit while providing field guidance to various sectors of the national economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the Korean people are striving ever harder to bring the revolutionary cause of Juche to accomplishment, full of optimism and confidence in victory, under the experienced and tested leadership of the WPK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Moreover, there is no need for the DPRK to hide bird flu cases, if there be any. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has taken every thorough-going measure to prevent the avian flu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe State Emergency Anti-Epizootic Committee is active inside the DPRK Cabinet as a national command to combat bird flu. It takes constant measures to monitor the outbreak of the avian flu, send information about it and prevent it, keeping close touch with several international organizations including FAO and the World Organization for Animal Health. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is a well-organized anti-epizootic system in the DPRK to keep pace with the worldwide efforts to fight bird flu and more than 1,600 watch posts in areas along the east and west coasts are conducting the survey of the movements of birds down to details as seasonal birds, major carriers of the bird flu virus, use the air over the above-said areas as their main migratory course. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This notwithstanding, AP spread sheer misinformation. This was a clumsy political charade to tarnish the international image of the dignified DPRK and isolate and stifle it in the end, pursuant to the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is well known that whenever the U.S. hit a snag in pursuing its hostile policy toward the DPRK it used reptile media for anti-DPRK smear campaigns. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not the first time that AP and other U.S. media crafted and spread false stories about the DPRK such as \"counterfeiting\" after being reduced to paid trumpeters serving the authorities, away from objectivity and impartiality considered as the principal ethics of media. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, with no such poor charade can the U.S. ever browbeat the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The clumsy anti-DPRK smear campaign of the U.S. will only end up tarnishing its image.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
