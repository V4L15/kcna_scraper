This is no more than the last-ditch effort of a politician whose days are numbered. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri is a diehard pro-American conservative and a traitor to the nation ill-famed for being an icon of conservatism, confrontation between fellow countrymen, and corrupt politics in south Korea, the news analyst says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was twice defeated in the last \"presidential elections.\" In fact, such defeat was a stern punishment by history and the people. However, this scum of history forsaken and marginalized by the nation is again going reckless, unable to repress his unlimited greed for power. His deed is lashing the people into fury as it is unpardonable political hooliganism mocking the history and the nation and going against the trend of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite natural that all the ruling and opposition parties and people from all walks of life in south Korea are becoming increasingly critical of his running for \"presidential elections.\" As asserted by the public, Ri's action is a disgraceful \"return\" of \"a guy crazy about the presidential office\" or \"a boss of conservatives\" and it is no more than the desperate frenzy of the diehard reactionaries, ultra-rightist Cold War-minded forces to stem the trend of the history and bring back the era in which they could embezzle truck loads of money. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In a \"declaration of his candidacy for the elections\" Ri pulled up the north and criticized the ruling and opposition parties' policies toward it, terming the present government a \"leftist government\" and ballyhooing about the \"nature of the state.\" Such provocative and dishonest remarks can be made only by a diehard separatist keen on anti-national and anti-reunification confrontation. His behavior is extremely disgusting as he again blew the worn-out trumpet to incite confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He has gone so mad with greed for power that he is neither sensitive to the trend of the times nor able to face up to the reality. Being a politician more dead than alive as he is forsaken by the people like a rotten dead tree, this guy is, however, making desperate effort to realize his dream of becoming a \"president\" by fishing in troubled waters. But for this he will only face a merciless judgement by history and people and destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
