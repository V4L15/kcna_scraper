He called for effectively conducting researches into high-yielding fruit seeds. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He laid stress on providing the farm with a sufficient number of tractors, trucks and other vehicles, sprayers and various types of farm machines. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the county is literally a county of fruits, he said that the precious wealth should be effectively used to positively contribute to improving the standard of the people's living. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then he moved on to the Phogu Farm where the land realignment project was completed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Feasting his eyes on the straight roads between fields, water channels and a vast expanse of paddy fields, he praised county officials and agricultural workers for having completed the vast project by themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying it is very gratifying to see realigned land in the county which presents a beautiful landscape, clad in various kinds of fruit trees, he stressed that this is the true picture of the Korean socialist agricultural system based on collectivism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He also went to the Ryongsupho Beach in the seaside of the county. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After hearing a report on the use of the beach from leading officials of the county, he acquainted himself in detail with the beach including the depth of water, the sea bed and saltiness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He proposed a task to spruce up the beach, saying that the beach is very nice for swimming  because water is very clear and sand is good. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said that there should be a sufficient number of hotels and other service and catering facilities and ample conditions for transport so that a large number of people may take a rest and enjoy swimming there.    \r\n\r\n"
