            "content": "Joint New Year editorial of newspapers \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 1 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun, Josoninmingun and Chongnyonjonwi, newspapers of the DPRK, call for opening up the road of advance through the new century in the spirit of the victorious \"arduous march\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In a joint editorial published today, the New Year's day, the papers make this call. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The editorial reviews the momentous events in Juche 89 (2000) and advances tasks to be carried out in the New Year Juche 90 (2001). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Describing last year as a year of great turn marked with momentous events unprecedented in the history of the Korean nation, a historic year that concluded the 20th century with brilliant achievements, it says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people have decorated annals of revolution with victories under the red flag of socialism. The 20th century was a century of glory in which Korea, which once suffered an eclipse on the world map, has demonstrated its dignity as the homeland of the Juche idea, a heroic country and a country of chollima. And it was a century of great pride in which Korean socialism has emerged victorious. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the pride of the workers' party and the people of Korea that they defended the faith, system and cause of Korea through the \"arduous march\" and concluded the century brilliantly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that last year the might of the Korean people's single-hearted unity was displayed, the editorial says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The celebration event for the 55th anniversary of the WPK was a grand festival of the Korean people's single-mindedness characterized by their spirit of worship of their leader and protecting him with their very lives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary ranks were built up as invincible ones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nLast year the Korean people decorated the final charge of the \"arduous march\" brilliantly through indefatigable fortitude. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Last year was a year of great importance when a new phase was opened in the achievement of the cause of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There were the historic Pyongyang summit and the publication of the June 15 north-south joint declaration. It was the remarkable event in the Korean national history to see that more than 50-year-long bottlenecks for Korea's reunion were removed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the enduring feat that leader Kim Jong Il advanced a fresh reunification platform to open up a broad vista for an end to the national division. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The dawn of national reunification is sure to break under his leadership. This is the iron faith of the 70 million fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Last year was a year of great pride when the dignity and honor of socialist Korea were displayed to the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK firmly defending the banner of independence has become the focus of the world's politics. Its hard-line and principled struggle foiled the imperialists' moves to isolate and stifle it. And the \"theory of collapse\" of socialism advocated by the enemies was dismissed and the DPRK has emerged imposingly as an impregnable socialist fortress. This gives a great encouragement to the revolutionary people of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt has become the mainstream of the times to establish and develop goodwill and friendly relations with Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The credit for the great victory won last year which splendidly concluded the 20th century goes to leader Kim Jong Il's preeminent political ability and energetic activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The New Year 2001 is a year of new advance and a great turn in which a broad avenue will be opened for the building of a powerful nation in the 21st century guided by the great party, the editorial says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the first year of the 21st century. The Korean people, basing themselves on the achievements gained in the \"arduous march\", should further display the advantages of socialism in all fields of the revolution and construction and put a new spur to the building of a powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Next year we will mark the 90th anniversary of President Kim Il Sung's birth. It is our party's unshakable will to defend for ever the great deeds of merits Kim Il Sung, father of socialist Korea, performed in the building of the party, nation and armed forces, \"open up the road of advance through the new century in the spirit of the victorious 'arduous march' \" this is the militant slogan that the entire party, the whole army and all the people should put up this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe socialist advance in the 21st century under the red flag is an honorable campaign to thoroughly embody leader Kim Jong Il's politics of independence, unity and love for the country and nation. It is our socialist powerful nation that enjoys high dignity with independence, emerges victorious by unity and thrives with patriotism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should follow our party's great independent politics and solve all the problems in keeping with the actual conditions of our revolution and country.  We should resolutely defend our ideology, our own political system and mode of revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Stressing that strong-arm and arbitrary practices and dominationist moves of the imperialists should no longer be allowed in the new century, the editorial says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will decisively meet the imperialists' challenges and resolutely defend the sacred sovereignty of Korea and the national dignity won at the cost of blood. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is our party's consistent stand to open up a new era of the independent development of international relations on its own. Our party will improve relations with all the nations which respect our sovereignty and make a positive contribution to global independence and peace of humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should embody our party's mighty politics of unity creditably. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The might of the single-hearted unity is guaranteed by devotedly defending the leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWe should make efforts to see our party's politics of noble love for the country and nation blooming with flowers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A key factor in making a new advance under the red flag along the path of socialism in the 21st century upholding the well-advised politics of our party is to stick to the revolutionary army-first policy, the editorial says, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The policy of giving top priority to the army is the permanent strategic objective in the present-time revolution and an all-mighty instrument in socialist construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK has settled all the problems arising in the revolution and construction  on the principle of giving top priority to the military affairs and pushing ahead with the socialist cause with the revolutionary army as the main force. This revolutionary mode will remain unchanged in the future, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our military strength should be made invincible to meet the requirements of the revolutionary era of laying stress on the military affairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nothing is more important task before us today than to consolidate the national economic might commensurate with the 21st century, it notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should give a powerful impetus to socialist construction, upholding the slogan, \"glorify this year as a year of fresh onward march in the building of an economic power in the 21st century \"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The central task of economic development for this year is to consolidate the existing economic infrastructure and display its potentials to the full, while conducting a forceful campaign for refashioning the national economy as a whole with up-to-date technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe most important front in socialist economic construction for this year is power, coal and metal industries and railway transport. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to tasks facing the fields of light industry and agriculture and calling for the building of more cultural, welfare and health facilities and modern houses, the editorial says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should speed up an all-out march toward a socialist paradise and thus glorify this year, the first year of the 21st century, as a year of a new leap, a year of overall revival. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year we should achieve decisive success  in accomplishing the cause of national reunification, it notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The momentous issue of principle for the present in achieving national reunification is to implement the June 15 north-south joint declaration to the letter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This declaration is a proclamation of independence, peaceful reunification and overall national unity anchored on the three principles of national reunification and a landmark of this cause in the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north and the south should pool the nation's efforts and achieve reunification in an independent and peaceful way and through overall national unity, true to the spirit of the historic declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the whole nation is reconciled and united, it precisely means the reunification desired by us. All the Koreans in the north and south and abroad should join the nationwide endeavors to implement the June 15 north-south joint declaration, transcending differences in ideology, social system, political view and religious belief. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our party, army and people will traverse the road of revolution to the end of the earth in any storm and stress, with a monolithic ideology, lineage and faith, the editorial concludes. \r\n\r\n"
