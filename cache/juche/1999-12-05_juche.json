Judging from this, we cannot but doubt whether Japan stands for the improved relations or has an axe to grind while talking about the DPRK-Japan relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The responsibility for the failure to improve the relations between the DPRK and Japan entirely rests with the Japanese authorities. \r\n\r\n"
