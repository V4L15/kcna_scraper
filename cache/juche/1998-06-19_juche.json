The sides will be headed by a KPA general officer and by a U.S. general officer respectively.\r\n   With the military armistice system paralyzed and the armistice agreement left without any real meaning, we have long proposed the establishment of a new peace mechanism and made efforts to have general officer-level talks to discuss preventing armed conflicts and contingencies even before the appearance of the peace-keeping regime. Due to the U.S. unreasonable position, however, the talks have not yet been held.\r\n   We are glad that, though belatedly, the United States changed its position and responded to our demand for the talks.    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n"

Whether they visit their hometowns or not is a matter pertaining to their freedom.\r\n   Their hometown visit has been arranged by the DPRK government's humanitarian step to let the Japanese wives meet their families and relatives in Japan after many years of separation.\r\n   By refusing to accept \"those who divested themselves of their nationality,\" Japan means negating the nationality of its fellow countrywomen.\r\n   We maintain that their hometown visit should take place in accordance with their will and in the humanitarian spirit and that Japan should make clear its position concerning the visit.    \r\n \r\n\r\n"

Measures for successfully holding the festival were also discussed.\r\n   It was unanimously stressed that it is most important to create a favorable atmosphere for the August 15 Festival, which will make a fresh turn in the efforts for great national unity and reunification and mark a good occasion in carrying through the five-point policy of great national unity.\r\n   The issue of holding such a festival involving compatriots in the north, south and overseas has been raised since 1990.\r\n   The failure to hold pro-reunification events at Panmunjom under the cosponsorship of the north and the south is attributable to the fact that the South Korean authorities did not allow South Koreans to participate in them, intensifying the fascist suppression of pro-reunification forces on the strength of the \"Agency for National Security Planning\" and the \"National Security Law\" which rejects national reconciliation, unity and reunification.\r\n   The participants in the meeting expressed concern over the co-sponsorship of the festival which may be impossible without unconditional elimination of the brakes.   And they agreed to take appropriate steps to urge the South Korean authorities to immediately create a climate and atmosphere necessary for smoothly holding the festival in accordance with all the fellow countrymen's desire for national reconciliation, unity and reunification  and refrain from suppressing the pro-reunification activities of the south headquarters of the national alliance for the country's reunification and the South Korean federation of university student councils.\r\n   They vowed to make all efforts to successfully hold the nationwide festival without fail this year when a new phase is being opened up in the efforts for the great unity of the nation and the reunification of the country.    \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Foolish attitude toward DPRK\r\n  Pyongyang, June 19 (KCNA) -- Minju Joson today carries a signed commentary denouncing the Japanese reactionaries for hindering the third hometown-visiting group of Japanese women in Korea, branding them as \"those who divested themselves of their nationality.\"\r\n   By bringing forward the issue of \"those who divested themselves of their nationality\" the Japanese reactionaries say that women with the citizenship of the DPRK, not the Japanese nationality, cannot visit their hometowns though they are Japanese women. This is  nonsense, the paper says, and goes on:\r\n   The Japanese wives in Korea have the nationality of the DPRK but they are of Japanese origin. Accordingly, it can be said that it is the moral obligation of the governments of the DPRK and Japan to realise their wish to visit their hometowns in their old age. That is why the Red Cross organisations of the two countries made joint efforts in the noble humanitarian spirit and had their wish  realized.\r\n   The Japanese authorities, however, are turning their back on all this and blocking Japanese-Korean  women's visit to their hometowns. It is a rude act with no elementary morality and conscience.\r\n   In the past days the Japanese imperialists, drafted more than 6 million people from Korea and worked them hard,  deprived one million people of lives, forced nearly 200,000 women to serve as \"comfort women for the army.\" but Japan has not yet apologized for the crimes over half a century after the war.\r\n   The Japanese authorities are no doubt mad after a political gambling.\r\n   Japan must not try to tarnish the DPRK's  prestige and improve its public image by faking up such a clumsy  phrase as \"those who divested themselves of their nationality\" and creating artificial obstacles in the way of improvement of DPRK-Japan relations, but behave itself creditably.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

His self-sacrificing  spirit has become a model of warm revolutionary comradeship.\r\n   The tradition of revolutionary comradeship was created by President Kim Il Sung and young communists of Korea in the '20s.\r\n   President Kim Il Sung started his revolutionary activities with efforts for making friends and comrades. He regarded it as his principle that only a man ready to die for his comrade can have a true comrade, and set brilliant examples of  genuine relationship between comrades in the whole course of his revolutionary activities.\r\n   Attracted by his warm humanity and distinguished personalities, Kim Hyok, Cha Kwang Su and other young communists called him \"comrade Hanbyol\" and \"comrade Kim Il Sung\".\r\n   They invariably remained faithful to him, keeping their oath, in the grim days when it was hard to predict when the revolution would be  accomplished triumphantly. \r\n   The anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters always shared life and death with each other and even laid down their lives unhesitatingly for comrades  during the arduous revolution.\r\n   This tradition of revolutionary comradeship based on ardent patriotism created by the president made it possible to build the party, government, army and a new prosperous country after the liberation. With it as source of strength, the Korean people could win a great victory in the three-year fatherland liberation war and defend national sovereignty.\r\n   Indeed, the revolutionary comradeship is another mental and ideological feature of Korean society in which the leader, the party and the masses are united in one mind.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
