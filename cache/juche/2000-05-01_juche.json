Hence, the U.S. refuses to withdraw its forces from South Korea and invariably seeks to establish its military domination over Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Its call for enabling its forces stationed in South Korea to perform a more extensive mission, including nuclear capability for the \"security\", is aimed at rounding off its capabilities to invade the DPRK, its neighboring countries and other Asian countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. policy of aggression toward the DPRK has not changed even a bit but is getting more pronounced. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. loudmouthed \"security\" is no more than a slogan under which to militarily intervene in and invade the DPRK and other Asian countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK is compelled to heighten vigilance against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is well advised to drop its absurd intention to launch a Korean War of aggression and withdraw its forces from South Korea without delay. \r\n\r\n"
