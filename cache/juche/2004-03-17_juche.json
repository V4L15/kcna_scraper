It also asserted that it can not normalize relations with the DPRK unless missiles, conventional weapons, biological and chemical weapons, human rights and other issues are settled even after the DPRK's abandonment of all its nuclear programs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. attitude towards the talks shows that the U.S. administration has no willingness to settle the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula but only seeks to isolate and stifle the DPRK under the pretext of the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement expressed the conviction that the DPRK, single-heartedly united under the Songun politics, won't budge an inch in any storm.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Blasts U.S. Political Plot \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 16 (KCNA) -- The U.S. Department of State in a recent \"annual report on drug control\" groundlessly charged that the DPRK considers drug smuggling as a \"state policy.\"\r\n This is a base and despicable political plot of the U.S. to tarnish the international image of the DPRK at any cost and internationalize and legalize \"sanctions\" and \"blockade\" against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some time ago the Australian Court, handling the case of the DPRK trading cargo ship \"Pongsu,\" admitted that \"the state was not involved in it\" and instructed the release of its crewmen for the lack of evidence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This suffices to clearly prove that the U.S. assertion that the DPRK conducts \"drug smuggling\" as a state policy is a whopping lie. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Explicitly speaking, in the DPRK where the people are valued more than anything else the use of and deal in drug and its production are strictly banned by law as it renders people mentally deformed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The import of mental stimulant for scientific research is subject to a strict state control and legal order. The DPRK has long maintained successful contact and cooperation with the International Narcotic Control Board in this field. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When discussing drug trafficking worldwide, the U.S. should be tried before any other country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already known, the U.S. is beset with serious drug-related problems such as drug production, trafficking and use. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In Washington D.C. only, more than 60 drug black markets are regularly operated and a great many drug smugglers are crossing borders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the U.S. where drug addiction resulted in the birth of many deformed babies and the appearance of disabled men and women. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the drug trafficking and use has become a social trend, juvenile drug users are reported to be more than 10.8 million. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though the U.S. is ill-famed for being a \"kingpin of drug use\", \"den of drug-related criminals\" and \"drug-smuggling country,\" it is turning its face away from this evil but is finding fault with someone's non-existent drug smuggling. This can not but be an inveterate bad habit of those accustomed to speaking ill of others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is why the U.S. made such ado about the DPRK's \"drug issue\" and \"human rights issue\" in its \"annual report on drug control.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its ulterior aim is to float all sorts of misinformation about the DPRK in addition to the fiction of \"suspicion of nuclear development\" in a bid to invent pretexts to isolate and stifle it internationally and thus force Pyongyang to scrap its nuclear program first at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had better put under control the drug-related crimes that plague it before pulling up the DPRK while obstinately pursuing its anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Candle-light rallies were simultaneously held in at least 10 provinces and cities including Taejon, Taegu and Kwangju and Jeju Island to protest against the passage of the \"motion of the impeachment\" through the NA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The group of chairmen of general student councils of 23 universities including Hanyang University and Hongik University released a declaration on the situation and declared that they would take an active part in the rallies and demonstrations of civil and social organizations opposing the \"impeachment\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On March 12, the south Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and the Federation of south Korean Trade Unions separately released statements stressing that those organizations would immediately rise up in the campaign for the nullification of the \"impeachment\" in the wake of the approval of the \"motion of the impeachment against the president\" at the NA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Truckloads of citizens staged a demonstration in the vicinity of the building of the \"National Assembly\".    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Increase of Military Force for Self-defence Called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 16 (KCNA) -- Strong military force for self-defence and national defence capability make it possible to successfully advance the revolution and construction, but if this force and capability remain weak, they are bound to fail.  It is, therefore, the primary strategic tasks before the revolution and construction to increase the military force and develop the national defence industry. Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. It goes on:\r\n The revolution and construction are accompanied by fierce confrontation with imperialists in force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S.-led imperialists are unhesitatingly committing aggression against sovereign states under the pretexts of \"anti-terrorism\" and \"elimination of weapons of mass destruction\" and seriously threatening and disturbing the world peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. moves for aggression are getting more pronounced as the days go by. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present international situation convinces the revolutionary people that the revolution and construction can not make smooth progress unless the moves of the U.S.-led imperialists for aggression are frustrated. The revolutionary political parties and people should decisively foil their moves for aggression. To this end they should consider the increase of military force and the development of national defence industry as their primary strategic tasks before the revolution and construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Without firm determination and tightening belt it would be impossible to successfully beef up the military force and develop the national defence industry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary political parties and people should increase the military force and develop the national defence industry despite all difficulties. \r\n It is the trend of developing modern military force and a demand of a modern war to modernize weapons and equipment of an army on the basis of the latest science and technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Great efforts should be channeled into the development of the national defence industry in order to successfully push forward the revolution and construction now that whether a country is a strong nation or a weak one is determined by its military muscle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is, therefore, important for each country to develop its national defence industry by itself and its own way in conformity with its specific conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Quite just are the policy of the Workers' Party of Korea on giving importance to military affairs and its line and principle of building the independent national defence industry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will further reinforce the anti-imperialist and military front, invariably considering it as its primary strategic tasks to bolster the military force and develop the independent national defence industry.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
