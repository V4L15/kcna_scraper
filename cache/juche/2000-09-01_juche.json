He passed away in January 1951. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The officials were deeply touched by the noble comradeship of the President who had long kept with good care the picture and letters, unable to forget even in dreams the revolutionary comrades with whom he shared the idea and purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Here is another story telling about his warm love for revolutionary comrades-in-arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It happened when the President came back to his native home after the liberation of the country, that was 20 years after he left there. His grandparents asked him to shift the graves of his parents to the homeland from the alien land where they died while struggling for the liberation of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   On hearing this, he told them his intention to find out before anyone else the bereaved children of those comrades who fell in the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle. Later he found all of them in different areas and built a revolutionary school for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He also saw to it that the revolutionary martyrs' cemetery and the patriotic martyrs' cemetery were built to hand the revolutionary comrades' spirit and exploits performed in the struggle down to posterity and he found out all those at home and abroad related to his revolutionary activities and met them in his lifetime. These facts show the unbounded comradeship of the President who valued his comrades more than a thousand pieces of gold. \r\n\r\n"
