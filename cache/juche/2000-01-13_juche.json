Korea assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, January 13 (KCNA) -- The \"arms buildup plan\" for the new millennium worked out by the South Korean \"Ministry of National Defense\" is an extremely serious war move to put spurs to the modernization of the \"ROK\" army and overpower the north in a bid to realize its ambition to invade the north, observes Minju Joson today in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Recently, the \"ministry\" decided to spend 5.3 trillion won for \"arms buildup for the year 2000.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It was reported that this biggest-ever military budget was aimed to introduce 20 types of sophisticated weapons, including missiles capable of \"striking main targets of the north,\" large submarines and transport ships. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is a serious development that the \"ministry\" unveiled \"its arms buildup plan\" for the new millennium targeted against the north in the wake of such a war confab as the \"security meeting\" held in South Korea at the outset of the year where the chief executive was foolhardy enough to describe national reunification as an issue to be handled in the distant future, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean economy is now in the grip of total bankruptcy, hardest hit by several years of the IMF mandate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This notwithstanding, the South Korean authorities are not spending money to save the people from dire destitution, but wasting the money collected from them to step up preparations for a war against the north to hurt fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is obvious to everyone that this predatory act is driving the South Korean people into a quagmire of death.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean rulers seek a way out in a war of aggression against the north but it will only hasten their total self-destruction. \r\n\r\n"

Japanese militarists' comeback to Korea is in the offing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But, this can never frighten the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries' war hysteria will only lead them to self-destruction. \r\n\r\n"

There are various forms of tops. This game cultivates children's skill and inspires them to develop their spirit of inquiry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In sledding, vehicles with runners move by sliding over ice at speed, go round snow-obstacles or run in groups, with sleds connected in a line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Rope-skipping is an exercise of the whole body. It not only strengthens children's bodies but also improves their sense to rhythmical movements from childhood and enriches their emotion through jumping over the rope to the accompaniment of music. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There are other interesting games, including number-counting with sticks on an abacus, and cat's cradling. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   These folk games are now encouraged and developed among Korean children. \r\n\r\n"

Hence, staunch spirit is needed above all to fight against the imperialists to the last. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Maintaining this spirit would remove any illusion and fear of imperialism and decisively smash its arbitrary and aggressive acts getting all the more pronounced. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A driving force should be built up to meet the imperialists' challenge to the last. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   No one can replace you in the anti-imperialist struggle to defend the revolutionary gains and national dignity and sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The core of the driving force is the political force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   No force on earth can match the strength of the people united in one idea around the headquarters of the revolution. The strength of the people rallied as one is much more powerful than the latest military equipment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The military force should be built up. To this end, it is important to increase the self-reliant defence capabilities, above all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is equally important to build an independent national economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Economic sanctions and pressure are the old methods employed by the imperialists. Therefore, a self-supporting national economy should be built to torpedo such moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nBegging the imperialists for something will lead to self-destruction. \r\n\r\n"
