As a result, the food problem still remains acute.\r\n   A series of challenges are lying in the way of the Korean people. But they are full of optimism and resolution to overcome all trials and difficulties.\r\n   Encouraged by sincere material and mental assistance from the WFP and other international organisations and governments and people of different countries, the Korean people will make strenuous efforts to clear away the aftereffects of the natural disasters and drastically increase the agricultural production.    \r\n\r\n"

Korea's abuses of DPRK over \"environmental pollution\"\r\nPyongyang, January 17 (KCNA) -- Recently, the South Korean \"government\" authority reportedly abused the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, alleging that air and water pollution is serious in the Rajin-Sonbong Free Economic and Trade Zone due to nonferrous metal factories located there densely.\r\n   His allegation is only what is denied by not only the DPRK people but foreigners and South Korean businessmen who visited the zone.\r\n   Admittedly, the zone is free from the density of nonferrous metal factories and air and water contamination.\r\n   The golden triangle is surrounded by the East Sea of Korea, the famous mountain of Chilbo and other scenic spots and spas, so it is perfect as a tourist resort.\r\n   The DPRK has legal and institutional mechanisms enough to prevent environmental pollution.\r\n   The South Korean authority's abuses are apparently motivated by a sinister political purpose.\r\n   As for environmental disruption, its model is none other than South Korea.\r\n   The South Korean authorities have introduced pollution industry en masse into South Korea from other countries. Now they have left its \"dead economy\" under \"trusteeship\" by the International Monetary Fund, drawing public criticism.\r\n   To make matters worse, foreign businesses have withdrawn their capital from South Korea.\r\n   Obviously, the South Korean authorities consider it very unfavorable to them that the development of the Rajin-Songbong Zone is being accelerated and investment in the zone is ever increasing.\r\n   This is why the authorities are resorting to such a foolish attempt in the hope of curbing the increasing number of foreign investors.\r\n   With the absurd allegation, however, they have nothing to get but nationwide denunciation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
