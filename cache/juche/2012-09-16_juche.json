Because she shielded the conspiratorial case cooked up during the period of the Park Chung-Hee's fascist dictatorial regime.\n\t\t\t\t\t At round-table talks on Sept. 11, she made reckless remarks that the decision of acquittal made by a court as regards the case of the People's Revolutionary Party should be left to history to judge.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Infuriated by this, bereaved families of those who fell victim to the conspiratorial case and organizations of people of different social standings including the \"April 9 Reunification and Peace Foundation, its corporate body\", held a press conference assailing Park's remarks in front of the building of the \"Saenuri Party\" on Sept. 12.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Speakers at the press conference said that Park's remarks refusing to recognize the court's ruling of acquittal is little short of double killing of the victims of the case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The inside story about the case of the People's Revolutionary Party was not disclosed in the period of the preceding regimes but was made known through media from the outset of the case's outbreak.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then a press release was read out.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whenever an opportunity presented itself, Park shielded the past fascist dictatorship by asserting strange logic, made mockery of the persons involved in the case and their bereaved families, inflicting sufferings and wounds upon them, the press release said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She should never be allowed to take the \"presidential seat\" as she is keen to bring back the era of \"yusin\" which recorded a disgraceful page in history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to prevent such conspiratorial case from repeating itself in this land the \"Saenuri Party\" and Park Guen Hye should bend their knees before history and people and apologize for the crimes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the end of the press conference the bereaved families staged a demonstration in protest against the clan of the ruling party shielding the fascist crimes committed by the \"yusin\" dictator in the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the Democratic United Party on Sept. 13 accused Park Guen Hye of expressing her wish to call on bereaved families and the like if they consent, while taking issue with the decision of acquittal as regards the above-said case. This is nothing but a politically-motivated farce, the spokesman said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t People are angered by Park's double-dealing attitude of shielding the bloody dictatorship while reaching out to its victims, the spokesman noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the meantime, the floor leader of the above-said party and others recalled that when the results of the investigation announced in 2005 said the case was orchestrated by Park Chung-Hee, Park Guen Hye made outcry that they were a product of intrigues and plots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They said she is not qualified to become a \"presidential hopeful\", urging her to directly apologize to the people."
