The U.S. is the world's largest possessor of nukes and other weapons of mass destruction and is indiscreetly threatening and invading other nations with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind such remarks is an insidious political intention to tarnish the image of the DPRK vigorously advancing under the banner of independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With the publication of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration a new phase was opened for Korea's reunification and the attention of the world focussed on the DPRK. frightened at this development, the U.S. is making desperate efforts to check it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. ruling quarters should make an official apology to the Korean people for the recent remarks and give up the hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should also immediately withdraw the U.S. forces, a main obstacle to the reunification of Korea by the united efforts of its nation, from South Korea and stop all forms of war games and provocations against the DPRK at once.    \r\n\r\n"

How can Japan be called a country with a principle and national dignity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's moves to launch overseas aggression with the backing of the U.S. will only lead it to its self-destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And its U.S.-toeing attitude and war will invite nothing but isolation and destruction.     \r\n\r\n"

This is an interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state and a violation of the sovereignty of the DPRK, a dignified member of the united nations, the statement said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The permanent secretariat of the organization of socialists in the Mediterranean in a statement on March 1 said that Bush's remarks revealed an intention of the U.S. administration not to defuse the tensions on the Korean Peninsula by persistently pursuing the hardline policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the same day, the All-India Trade Union Congress in a statement said that such remarks clearly showed how shameless and outrageous the U.S. authorities' intention to isolate and stifle the DPRK is. The U.S. should not prevent the Korean people from solving the issue of national reunification independently free from outside interference in the spirit of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, it urged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Federation of African and Asian Lawyers for Human Rights in a statement on March 4 held that the U.S. should admit its responsibility for deliberately hindering Korea's reunification by pursuing a hardline policy toward the DPRK and posing a threat of war to it. It should also stop interfering in the Korean issue at once and withdraw its forces from South Korea, the statement said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n M. K. Pandey, secretary general of the centre of Indian trade unions, in a letter to the UN secretary general on Feb. 25, urged the united nations to condemn the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK and take necessary measures so that all the UN member nations may respect and abide by the international law and the principles of the UN charter.    \r\n\r\n"
