            "content": "Spokesman for DPRK Foreign Ministry Urges U.S. to Choose between Two Options\r\nPyongyang, February 12 (KCNA) -- The DPRK Foreign Ministry released the following statement on Tuesday:\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK's third nuclear test is a resolute step for self-defence taken by it to cope with the U.S. hostile act against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIts successful launch of satellite Kwangmyongsong 3-2 in December last year was a peaceful one from A to Z which was conducted according to its plan for scientific and technological development for economic construction and the improvement of the standard of people's living.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe world including hostile countries recognized its application satellite's entry into orbit and greatly admired its development of space technology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S., however, again prodded the UN Security Council into cooking up a new \"resolution on sanctions\" against the DPRK, terming its satellite launch a violation of the UNSC's \"resolution\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEncroaching upon the right to satellite launch is an unpardonable grave hostile act as it is an infringement on the DPRK's sovereignty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBy origin, the DPRK had neither need nor plan to conduct a nuclear test.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK's nuclear deterrence has already acquired the trustworthy capability strong enough to make a precision strike at bases for aggression and blow them up at a single blow no matter where they are on the earth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was the DPRK's goal to focus efforts on economic construction and the improvement of the standard of people's living by dint of nuclear deterrence for self-defence provided by the great Generalissimos Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il all their lives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK exercised its maximum self-restraint when the U.S. fabricated the \"presidential statement\" over its satellite launch for peaceful purposes by abusing the UNSC in April last year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBut the DPRK's patience reached its limit as the U.S. intensified such hostile act as implementing before anyone else the UNSC's \"resolution on sanctions\", far from apologizing for its renewed wanton violation of the DPRK's right to satellite launch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe main objective of the current nuclear test is to express the surging resentment of the army and people of the DPRK at the U.S. brigandish hostile act and demonstrate the will and capability of Songun Korea to defend the sovereignty of the country to the last.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK's nuclear test is a just step for self-defence not contradictory to any international law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. has long put the DPRK on the list of preemptive nuclear strike.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is quite natural just measure for self-defence to react to the U.S. ever-increasing nuclear threat with nuclear deterrence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK withdrew from the NPT after going through legitimate procedures and chose the way of having access to nuclear deterrence for self-defence to protect the supreme interests of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere have been on the earth more than 2 000 nuclear tests and at least 9 000 satellite launches in the UN history spanning over 60 years but there has never been a UNSC resolution on banning any nuclear test or satellite launch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is the U.S. that has conducted more nuclear tests and launched more satellites than any others. It, however, cooked up the UNSC's \"resolution\" banning only the DPRK's nuclear test and satellite launch. This is the breach of international law and the height of double standards.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHad the UNSC been impartial even a bit, it would not have taken issue with a sovereign state's exercise of the right to self-defence and its scientific and technological activities for peaceful purposes but with the U.S. policy for preemptive nuclear strike, a threat to global peace and security, to begin with.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe current nuclear test is the primary countermeasure taken by the DPRK in which it exercised its maximum self-restraint.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf the U.S. takes a hostile approach toward the DPRK to the last, rendering the situation complicated, it will be left with no option but to take the second and third stronger steps in succession.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe inspection of ships and maritime blockade touted by the hostile forces will be regarded as war actions and will invite the DPRK's merciless retaliatory strikes at their strongholds.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S., though belatedly, should choose between the two options: To respect the DPRK's right to satellite launch and open a phase of detente and stability or to keep to its wrong road leading to the explosive situation by persistently pursuing its hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn case the U.S. chooses the road of conflict finally, the world will clearly see the army and people of the DPRK defend its dignity and sovereignty to the end through a do-or-die battle between justice and injustice, greet a great revolutionary event for national reunification and win a final victory."

            "content": "DPRK's Underground Nuclear Test Is Just Measure for Self-defence: KCNA Commentary\r\nPyongyang, February 12 (KCNA) -- The 3rd underground nuclear test conducted by the DPRK today is part of substantial counter-action against the U.S. hostile policy and arbitrary practices. \n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. attitude toward the DPRK's successful launch of satellite Kwangmyongsong 3-2, in particular, as was the case with all its hostile acts against the DPRK, pushed the resentment of its army and people to an unbearable phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe high-handed logic of the U.S. that the DPRK should not be allowed to launch a satellite while all others are permitted to do so amounts to the worst insult and mockery at the Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK has already served a strong warning to the U.S. because it persistently revealed its sinister attempt to strain the situation with such logic.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. should draw a lesson from its actions which compelled the DPRK to comprehensively reexamine the nuclear issue in April last year and refrain from pushing the situation to such pass no one desires through its excessive hostile reaction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBut the U.S. did not lend an ear to this.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. was so arrogant as to prod the UN Security Council into cooking up the \"resolution\" which calls for economic \"sanctions\" and \"crucial steps\", negating the DPRK's right to satellite launch, and took the lead in implementing it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe UNSC \"resolution\" 2087 fabricated with the U.S. as a main player is a criminal document for state-sponsored terrorism as it negates the right of the Korean people to develop as well as their right to self-determination and existence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. has incited international cooperation to stifle the DPRK while massively deploying nuclear attack means in south Korea and its vicinity and staging exercises for preemptive attack on the DPRK in a bid to strain the situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. brazen-faced arbitrary practices touched off bitter anti-U.S. sentiments among the service personnel and people of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK can no longer live, tightening belt. Let us settle accounts with the U.S. so as to defend the sovereignty of the nation and achieve a final victory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLet's demonstrate the might of the Koreans before the U.S. which looks down upon them. This is the unshakable will of the service personnel and people of the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe third underground nuclear test physically demonstrated the high performance of the DPRK's nuclear deterrent which has become smaller, lighter and diversified as it was a primary counter-measure in which it exercised its maximum self-restraint.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEven the enemies must know well its explosive force and level of the nuclear test as they observed it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe nuclear test conducted by the DPRK represented the towering resentment of its service personnel and people and demonstrated their will and capability to safeguard their sovereignty. No one has the right to take issue with it as it is the legitimate step for self-defence in full conformity with the UN Charter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK's nuclear deterrent serves as a treasured sword for foiling the high-handed and arbitrary practices of the imperialists and protecting its sovereignty and dignity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhether the DPRK will take the second and third tougher measures will entirely depend on the option to be taken by the U.S. in the future. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. should admit its mistake and correct it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf the U.S. again defies the warnings served by the DPRK, its army and people will never miss such historic opportunity given by the U.S."

esta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl exitoso lanzamiento del diciembre del ano pasado de la unidad No.2 de satelite \"Kwangmyongsong-3\" fue enteramente la labor pacifica realizada segun el plan del desarrollo de la ciencia y la tecnica para la construccion de la economia y la mejora de vida del pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodo el mundo, inclusive los paises enemigos, reconocio la entrada de satelite de uso practico de la RPDC en la orbita prevista y quedo admirado ante el desarrollo de su tecnologia espacial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, Estados Unidos volvio a instigar a aprobar la nueva \"resolucion de sancion\" del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU cuestionando el lanzamiento de satelite de la RPDC como violacion de las \"resoluciones\" del Consejo de

Consejo de Seguridad, en vez de pedir disculpa, cuya recrudescente hostilidad nos obliga a no aguantar mas la paciencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl objetivo principal de la presente prueba nuclear es para demostrar la indignacion de nuestro ejercito y pueblo ante el bandidesco acto hostil de EE.UU., la voluntad y la capacidad de la Corea del Songun de defender a toda costa la soberania del pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestra prueba nuclear es una justa medida autodefensiva que no contraviene a cualquier ley internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa hace mucho tiempo, el imperio puso a la RPDC en la lista de objetos de golpe preventivo nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEnfrentarse con el disuasivo nuclear a la recrudescente amenaza nuclear de EE.UU. es una medida de defensa absolutamente justa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA fin de salvaguardar el maximo interes del pais la RPDC se retiro del Tratado de no Proliferacion siguiendo el proceso legitimo y opto la via de disponerse del disuasivo nuclear autodefensivo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la historia de mas de 60 anos de la ONU  se realizaron  en la Tierra mas de 2 mil pruebas nucleares y mas de 9 mil lanzamientos de satelites, pero no hubo ninguna resolucion del Consejo de Seguridad que prohibiera hacerlos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl imperio, que realizo mayor numero de pruebas nucleares y lanzamientos de satelite, instigo a aprobar la \"resolucion\" del CS de la ONU que no permite hacerlos solo a la RPDC, lo cual deviene la violacion de los derechos internacionales y el climax de la pauta de doble rasero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU hubiera tenido la minima equidad, no habria cuestionado el ejercicio del derecho de autodefensa y las actividades de ciencia y tecnica con fines pacificas de un pais soberano sino la politica de golpe preventivo nuclear de EE.UU. que amenaza la paz y la seguridad internacionales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa presente prueba nuclear deviene la primera contramedida tomada por la RPDC manteniendose en el maximo control de si mismo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi EE.UU. crea la situacion complicada  tomando hasta el fin las medidas hostiles contra  la RPDC, esta no podra menos de tomar sucesivamente la segunda y tercera contramedidas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl registro de los buques, el bloque maritimo de que hablan tanto las fuerzas hostiles se consideraran como accion de guerra y provocaran el despiadado golpe de represalia de la RPDC a los nidos principales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe optar uno de los dilemas: respetar el derecho a lanzamiento de satelite de la RPDC tendente a abrir la coyuntura de alivio y la estabilidad o seguir tomando el actual camino errado hacia la tensa situacion persiguiendo hasta el fin la politica hostil a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el caso de tomar el camino de confrontacion, el mundo vera correctamente como defenderan hasta el fin los uniformados y civiles de la RPDC su dignidad y soberania en el combate de vida o muerte entre la justicia e injusticia y como acogeran con el triunfo final el gran evento revolucionario de la reunificacion de la patria."
