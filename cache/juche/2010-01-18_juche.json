They, at the same time, fully demonstrated the might of artistes of the army successfully performing their militant mission as honorable sentinels standing on the first-line of the ideological front. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il expressed great satisfaction over the fact that they presented a splendid performance great in its ideological value and high in artistry with numbers of great cognitional and instructive value as they truthfully represented the inexhaustible mental power and noble traits of the KPA.

            "content": "DPRK on Reasonable Way for Sept. 19 Joint Statement\r\n Pyongyang, January 18 (KCNA) -- The DPRK's proposal for concluding a peace treaty is a reasonable way for comprehensively and fully implementing the September 19 Joint Statement, declared a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK in a statement issued Monday.\n\t\t\t\t\t If the joint statement is to be implemented, the spirit of mutual respect and equality, which keeps the statement vital, should not be violated and there should not be such practice as distorting the order of action, the statement said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The joint statement calls for \"harmoniously\" settling the issues of denuclearization, normalization of relations, energy compensation and the establishment of a peace-keeping regime. There is no agreed point that the issue of establishing a peace-keeping regime can be discussed only when denuclearization makes progress. Only the principle of \"commitment for commitment\" and \"action for action\" is laid down as the only principle for implementing the joint statement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Taking the situation of the U.S. side into consideration, the DPRK made such magnanimous efforts as keeping the discussion of denuclearization ahead of the debate on the issue of concluding a peace treaty at the six-party talks for more than six years. In 2008 the international community witnessed the blowing up of the cooling tower of the nuclear facility in Nyongbyon. The process of denuclearization made such substantial progress that the U.S. stopped applying the Trading with the Enemy Act and de-listed the DPRK as a \"sponsor of terrorism\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This notwithstanding, the debate on the conclusion of a peace treaty failed to kick off, consequently pushing back the process of denuclearization. The mode of pushing ahead with denuclearization before discussing the peace-keeping regime ended in failure. The practical experience proved that pushing forward denuclearization in the absence of confidence is just like building a house without a foundation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is not opposed to the six-party talks and has no ground whatsoever to delay them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There happened such a thing as taking issue even with the satellite launch for peaceful purposes as there was no confidence among the parties to the talks. A satellite launch has never been considered as problematic among the countries that trust one another. Such extreme encroachment upon the sovereignty of a country as discriminately taking issue with its satellite launch compelled it to take such self-defensive counter-measure as a nuclear test and the resultant sanctions caused such a vicious cycle of distrust as bringing the six-party talks to a collapse. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  It is the purport of the DPRK's proposal for concluding a peace treaty to put an end to such vicious cycle of distrust and build confidence to push forward denuclearization. There will be a starting point of confidence building only if the parties concerned sit at a negotiating table for concluding a peace treaty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the six-party talks are to take place again, it is necessary to seek whatever way of removing the factor of torpedoing them. The latest sanctions are not particularly new for the DPRK as it has got used to blockade and sanctions for decades. But if the DPRK goes out for the six-party talks, remaining subjected to the sanctions, such talks will not prove to be equal talks as clarified in the Sept. 19 Joint Statement but the talks between \"defendant\" and \"judge\". The dignity of the DPRK will never allow this to happen. It is nonsensical for the DPRK to sit at the negotiating table with those countries that violate its sovereignty, allowing it to be persistently encroached  upon, and discuss with them the deterrent it built to defend its sovereignty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will continue to make sincere efforts to persuade the parties concerned into accepting its realistic proposal based on experience and lesson."

            "content": "MINREX califica de racional la iniciativa sobre el convenio de paz\r\nPyongyang, 18 de enero (ATCC) -- El portavoz del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea hizo publica el dia 18 una declaracion subrayando que nuestra iniciativa de firmar el convenio de paz es el remedio racional para implementar general y totalmente la Declaracion Conjunta del 19 de Septiembre.\n\t\t\t\t\t  Para poner en practica esa declaracion conjunta, no debe ser desvirtuado el espiritu de respeto mutuo y de igualdad, que resulta lo vital de ella, ni tergiversado el orden de acciones, adelanta la nota y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esa declaracion conjunta establece que se debe resolver de manera \"proporcionada\" los problemas tales como la desnuclearizacion, la normalizacion de las relaciones, la remuneracion energetica y el establecimiento del sistema de paz. En ella no se ve un articulo de consenso que estipule que sera posible discutir el problema de establecer el sistema de paz cuando haya avances en la desnuclearizacion. El principio de \"promesa vs. promesa\" y \"accion vs. accion\" esta anotado como el unico principio de ejecucion de esa Declaracion Conjunta. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Tomando en consideracion la situacion de la parte estadounidense, hemos realizado durante mas de 6 anos el indulgente esfuerzo de anteponer el debate de la desnuclearizacion a la discusion sobre la concertacion del convenio de paz en las conversaciones a 6 bandas. En el ano 2008, la sociedad internacional ha sido testigo presencial de la voladura de la torre de enfriamiento de las instalaciones nucleares de Nyongbyon. El proceso de desnuclearizacion habia logrado un avance tan sustancial como que EE.UU. dejo de aplicar a nuestro pais la ley de comercio con paises hostiles y lo elimino de la \"lista de los paises que apoyan el terrorismo\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Sin embargo, no se pudo iniciar siquiera el debate sobre la firma del convenio de paz y por consiguiente, el proceso de desnuclearizacion tomo el rumbo inverso. Es decir, resulto fracasado el metodo de impulsar la desnuclearizacion antes de debatir sobre el sistema de paz.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La experiencia practica mostro que dar impulso a la desnuclearizacion sin la confianza significa construir una casa sin sentar su base. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  No rechazamos las conversaciones a 6 bandas ni tenemos el motivo de dilatarlas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por la falta de la confianza entre los paises participantes, ocurrio el incidente de cuestionar hasta el lanzamiento de satelite artificial con fines pacificos."
