            "content": "Spokesman for NDC Policy Department Denounces U.S., S. Korean Authorities for Reckless Military Moves\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, July 12 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Policy Department of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK Saturday released the following statement:\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is always preoccupied with aggression and interference. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On Friday the U.S. suddenly hurled the flotilla of the nuclear carrier George Washington into the Pusan Port of south Korea again. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That day the group of Aegis Destroyer Kid under the Third Fleet of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces entered the Tonghae Port of south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is surprising is that these pirate warship groups entered the south Korean ports at the earnest request of the south Korean puppet authorities and amid their noisy welcome though they should have thought twice before doing so. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was reported that those groups would stage a \"drill to intercept planes\" accompanied by naval maneuvers targeted against the DPRK together with the south Korean naval force in the South and East seas of Korea from July 16. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From July 22 they mull staging a large naval joint drill in waters off Jeju Island with warships of the Japanese aggression forces involved. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is that these grave maneuvers are slated to take place in defiance of the special proposal sent by the NDC of the DPRK to the south Korean authorities for improving the north-south relations and ensuring peace on the Korean peninsula and a meaningful statement issued by the DPRK government. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The planned reckless military actions of the U.S. and south Korea are another open challenge to the sincere efforts of the army and people of the DPRK to defuse the tension on the peninsula and create peaceful atmosphere. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are, at the same time, a blatant effrontery to chill the desire and wishes of all Koreans to mend the north-south relations and achieve national reconciliation and cooperation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In February, too, the U.S. sent a formation of nuclear-capable strategic bombers to south Korea, deliberately creating a phase of confrontation when there was a sign of reconciliation between the north and the south. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whenever there was a sign of improving the north-south relations and detente on the peninsula, the U.S. resorted to sinister interference and obstructions. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These actions on the part of the U.S. were prompted by its scenario to retain a grip on south Korea and Japan and lay a siege to the continent in a bid to keep an unchallenged edge in the Asia-Pacific region. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters is that the south Korean puppet forces steeped in sycophancy and submission are pursuing this sinister scenario of the U.S. and persistently introducing nuclear strike means of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces, making constant nuclear blackmail and posing serious threat to compatriots. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the army and people of the DPRK are not afraid of the U.S. nuclear blackmail and threat little short of its \"gunboat diplomacy\" in the last century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should properly understand that the more persistently it resorts to reckless nuclear blackmail and threat, the further the DPRK will bolster up its cutting edge nuclear force for self-defence always ready to go into action.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet forces would be well advised not to miscalculate that their act of depending on the U.S. and toeing its line is the only way out for them. They should come to their senses and seek a way out from the standpoint of attaching importance to the nation and giving priority to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should bear in mind that now is the time to make a proper option at the present when various issues between the north and the south are high on agenda.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and south Korean authorities should always remember that the army and people of the DPRK together with the world people are watching with high vigilance their anachronistic reckless military moves."
