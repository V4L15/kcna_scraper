He named the company which tended the tree with good care the Korean Poplar Company. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n Noting that all units including this company have brought about signal changes in the era of Songun, he said that these praiseworthy changes are the precious fruition of the noble patriotism displayed by the servicepersons of the People's Army. He added that noble, indeed, is the spiritual world of the KPA which fully inherited the ardent patriotism and revolutionary spirit of the anti-Japanese guerrillas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n He watched the training of the soldiers of the company. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  \r\n He was greatly pleased to learn that all soldiers have grown to be indomitable fighters staunchly struggling for the security of the country and its people.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Seeing the heaps of compost of grass collected by the company for the sideline farming next year, he praised it for having done a good job. The KPA is displaying the might of the revolutionary army capable of doing anything in the defence of the country and socialist construction and setting an example to be followed by society and playing a pioneer's role in idea, culture and all aspects of struggle and life, he stressed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n He gave the servicemen of the company a pair of binoculars and an automatic rifle as gifts before having a photo session with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by KPA Generals Hyon Chol Hae and Ri Myong Su.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Under this condition, to expand and disseminate the agro-forestry is an important lever to guarantee the food safety, improve the people's living standard and achieve a comprehensive development of the countryside. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The basic environment has been made in the country to introduce and expand the agro-forestry, a sustainable land management system, which makes it possible to enhance the environmental protection function of the ecosystem and to get a maximum economic profit from it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to realize the policy of making best use of mountains and to green the whole country, the government has set a period of general mobilization for land management and undertaken a nation-wide campaign for land management. And it has taken measures to build well sapling nurseries and to strengthen the functional ability of the land and environmental protection and forestry institutions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Based on it, the government lets the local areas combine new agro-forestry technology with the experience gained in the cultivation of trees and crops adapted to the climatic and soil conditions of the given sloping areas while making an effective use of the experience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is allowed to use the slopping lands in such a manner as to ensure profits of the local people while planting trees and creating bio-protection belts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Efforts are being exerted to international cooperation and exchange for expanding and disseminating agro-forestry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Ministry of Land and Environment Conservation started to carry the slopping land management project into practice in close contact with the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation in the DPRK from Juche 93 (2004). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In these years, the effectiveness of the agro-forestry has been proved and a model for the slopping land management created in Suan County, North Hwanghae Province. Meanwhile, the organizational ability of all provinces, cities and counties has also been raised so as to manage sloping lands in an environmentally safe way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The country is increasing the cooperation scale by expanding the slopping land management project to the overall areas of North Hwanghae Province from this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Colorful events including the national workshop on agro-forestry are sponsored in the country to expand and disseminate the agro-forestry.   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Terms Lee Myung Bak Traitor to Nation \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, August 6 (KCNA) -- Japan has become all the more undisguised in its moves to seize Tok Islet since a conservative \"government\" appeared in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lee Myung Bak is encouraging the Japanese reactionaries in their territorial ambition through his mean acts of treachery to serve Japan, thus inviting misfortune. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No sooner had he taken the \"presidential\" office than he trumpeted about a \"new era of future-oriented relations between south Korea and Japan.\" In less than five months after coming to power he visited Japan two times and held three \"south Korea-Japan summit talks\". He raved that he would not ask about Japan's past and boost relations with Japan from a \"pragmatic stand\" on several occasions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the Japanese chief executive clarified Japan's intention to mark Tok Islet as Japan's territory on textbooks on July 9, Lee, far from reacting to it from a tough stand, behaved so foolish as to implore him to wait in a concessionary manner, saying that it was difficult to handle the issue at the moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lee, already referring to Japan's \"claim to the islet\", argued that \"it was not an issue to be strongly reacted to out of momentary emotion\". Shortly ago he went the lengths of asserting that \"the issue of Tok Islet should not be dealt with too politically.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a mean behavior little short of shuffling off upon others the responsibility for what one has done and a perfidious act of conducting a bargaining over part of the cradle of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no such a big issue as the one of Tok Islet at present as it is an acute issue related to the territorial sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lee Myung Bak is patronizing the Japanese robbers, kowtowing to them even though they are making far-fetched assertion that Tok Islet, an inviolable part of the territory of Korea, belongs to it, much less redeeming its past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is foolishly dreaming of seizing Tok Islet with the help of Lee Myung Bak identical to the five traitors of 1905. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is evidenced by the fact that though the Japanese authorities are at loggerheads with several neighboring countries over territorial and historical issues at present, it is not reacting to them in a such brazen-faced and arrogant manner as it does over the issue of Tok Islet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries deem the seizure of power by Lee Myung Bak as a golden opportunity as they seek to make their own Tok Islet, a springboard from which they can make military advance to the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Asia and a key area for securing huge natural resources. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the long run, it is exactly traitor Lee Myung Bak who instigated the Japanese reactionaries to lay down the so-called \"principle\" that \"Japan should not be ambiguous in its stand on the issue of Tok Islet\" at present and take even a measure to teach Japanese in the \"dominium\" over the islet, although it was universally recognized as part of the inviolable territory of Korea from long ago on the basis of historical and legal evidence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No wonder even Japanese media, covering Lee Myung Bak's despicable acts of treachery to serve Japan, painted him as the \"first rare pro-Japanese president of south Korea.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It would be impossible to defend the territory of the nation, much less safeguarding its dignity, if such traitor as Lee is allowed to live in the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fellow countrymen will never pardon such traitor to the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
