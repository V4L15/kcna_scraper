It said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Environmental pollution, rape, murder and harm to the lives of the Korean people -- This is what the U.S. Forces have done on this land.

The U.S. seeks to galvanize the public opinion over the DPRK's nuclear issue and the issue of biological and chemical weapons in a bid to evade the responsibility for having ditched the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework and justify its moves to provoke a war of aggression against the DPRK. But such method will never work on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose forces are well advised to face up to the reality and stop making anti-DPRK remarks.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

If you have a true willingness for a dialogue, you should conclude a non-aggression pact with the DPRK so as to achieve peace between North Korea and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. refusal to conclude non-aggression pact goes only to prove that its ambition to swallow up the DPRK still remains unchanged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north-proposed non-aggression treaty has no unilateral demand as it is based on mutual respect.    \r\n\r\n"

We doubt whether the humanitarian issue is used for the political purpose of dishonest forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the issue of hometown visit by Japanese women in the DPRK is concerned, it has long been suggested by the Japanese side as a humanitarian issue and Japanese women visited their hometowns three times under an agreement reached between the Red Cross organizations of the DPRK and Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan made much ado about humanitarianism when the opportunity presented itself in favor of it. Japan's turning down such elementary humanitarian issue as hometown-visit shows what the much-talked humanitarianism is like.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
