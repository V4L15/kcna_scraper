It is going hectic to establish \"Theatre Missile Defence\" system in the wake of its launch of  spy satellites. This is the real picture of Japan, a criminal and defeated state in the second world war.\r\n   In utter disregard of others' views on Japan it is taking issue with the DPRK   over the mideast missile issue which has nothing to do with its \"security.\" this is clear evidence of its anachronistic way of thinking and arrogance.\r\n   The DPRK  has made clear its stand on missile issue more than once and this remains unchanged.\r\n   The DPRK  and the United States are discussing the missile issue as an outstanding one.  Japan is trying to use the missile issue in achieving a sinister political  purpose of fostering distrust between the DPRK  and those countries which have traditional relations of friendship with it. This may throw a grave obstacle in the way of the on-going DPRK -U.S. negotiations.\r\n   With no desperate efforts can the Japanese ultra-rightist reactionaries can ever keep the DPRK   from developing friendly and cooperative relations with Arab countries  in the efforts to build a new peaceful and  impartial world, the shared goal of humankind, in the idea of independence, peace and friendship.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "\"Measure for multi-faceted channel toward north\" flailed \r\n     Pyongyang, April 2 (KCNA ) -- The South Korean authorities recently announced a \"measure for multi-faceted channel toward the north\" which allows nongovernmental organizations to have economic cooperation and exchange  with the north their own way through \"multi-faceted channels,\" instead of the unified channel of red cross.\r\n   Commenting on it, Rodong Sinmun today says:\r\n   The \"measure\" is a trite deceptive trick of anti-national separatists who do not want economic cooperation between fellow countrymen and improved north-south relations in true sense.\r\n   Though clamouring about \"multi-faceted channel,\" the South Korean authorities have set self-flattering standard in their favour. By the standards some nongovernmental organizations are allowed to conduct economic cooperation their own way but organizationally strong and big bodies such as the (South) Korean Federation of University Student Councils and financially strong economic organizations are not permitted to undertake such activities. \r\n   The fact proves the \"multi-faceted channel\" is the other side of \"unified channel.\"\r\n   In actuality the South Korean rulers have no stake in the sincere economic cooperation between the fellow countrymen, though vociferating about \"multi-faceted channel\" and \"economic cooperation,\" the news analyst says, and goes on:\r\n   The \"measure\" is a product of their sinister intention to tone down the voices of the fellow countrymen demanding an early implementation of priorities for inter-Korean dialogue, which were laid down at the joint meeting of the DPRK  .\r\n   If they think they can use this poor \"card\" called \"multi-faceted channel\" in implementing the priorities it is a miscalculation. \r\n   The South Korean rulers should not fool the fellow countrymen with such childish play, but implement at an early date the priorities which should be done for the improved north-south relations.    \r\n \r\n"

            "content": "R.S. on contrasting views and stands of Germany and Japan toward past history\r\n     Pyongyang, April 2 (KCNA ) -- Rodong Sinmun today carries its commentator's article entitled \"On Japan's irresponsibility, shamelessness and immorality\" which shows the contrasting views and attitudes of Germany and Japan toward the past history.\r\n   The article says:\r\n   Both Germany and Japan are responsible for terrible disasters inflicted upon humankind. However, they are clean different from each other in their admission and views on this.\r\n   The German government officially admitted its responsibilities for the past war and has apologized and compensated for what it did in the war.\r\n  Germany admitted that its government and people should take responsibilities for the war started by Nazi Germany and prohibited practices of their denial by law.\r\n   The German government has made dlrs. 60 to 80 billion compensations since the second world war ceased. As voices demanding compensation got louder, it announced in February that a \"fund for commemoration, responsibility and future\" aimed at compensating victims would be set up.\r\n   Facts eloquently show that Germany is making sincere efforts to act as a full-fledged member nation of the international community by winning confidence from other peoples and promoting reconciliation, free of guilty conscience, on the basis of completely resolving its past. \r\n   This stands out in sharp contrast to what Japan has done.\r\n   Compared with such a sincere stand and attitude of Germany toward the past history, Japan's attitude and stance toward its past crimes are too irresponsible and shameless.\r\n   Japan's responsibilities for calamities inflicted upon humankind cannot be said to be lighter than those of Germany. On the contrary, they are more serious.\r\n   The Japanese imperialists committed unimaginably heinous crimes against the Asian peoples including those of China and other southeast Asian countries.\r\n   Worse still, they illegally occupied Korea and enforced the colonial rule for nearly half a century. In this period, they forcibly drafted more than six million Korea n people, killed as many as one million, reduced nearly 200,000 women to sex slaves and destroyed or looted enormous resources and cultural assets from Korea .\r\n   Indeed, their crimes were so monstrous and cruel in human history.\r\n   More than half a century has passed since then. But, the Japanese authorities still refuse to admit the history of aqgression and crimes.\r\n   Japan has negated its history woven with murder and plunder. Not content with this, it is making no scruple to justify and beautify this history.\r\n   At the utmost, it uttered nothing but \"owabi\" in a bid to deceive and flout the world public.\r\n   Such jugglery of words cannot substitute for the expression of apology for its past crimes.\r\n   Nothing similar to Germany's views and admission of the past history can be found in Japan.  Worse still, Japan lags far behind Germany in this aspect.\r\n   Why is Japan so adamantly and shamelessly refusing to admit, apologize and compensate for the past crimes?\r\n   It is not ascribable to its deep-seated evil habits but to its ill-gotten intention to repeat the past history of aggression and crimes.\r\n   Japan has pushed ahead with preparations for reinvasion on a full scale, swearing revenge for its defeat in the war. \r\n   At present, it is hellbent on gratifying its ambition with the strength it has cultivated for more than 50 years.\r\n   Another cunning estimation of the Japanese authorities is that if they get along  refusing to admit the past history woven with aggression and crimes and apologize and make up for them, its past will be buried in oblivion of history or fade from the memory of the people any time.\r\n   No matter how many years may pass, the wrath of the Korea n and other Asian peoples against the Japanese imperialists can never be allayed.\r\n   If it had followed the precedent of Germany even a little although its act was not on its own initiative, Japan would not have been criticised by international public for its irresponsibility, shamelessness and immorality that have reached their height.\r\n   Japan must clearly know that any country which refuses to discharge its responsibility and moral obligation under international law cannot win international confidence nor have any qualification to exist on the earth.\r\n   The only way for Japan to win international confidence and live in peace as others is to make proper compensation for its past.\r\n   Such foolish people as the South Korean puppets might pardon Japan for its crimes for a small amount of money. \r\n   But, the Korea n people will not pardon Japan for refusing to liquidate its past.\r\n   The Korean people will certainly make Japan pay for the humiliation, misfortunes, sufferings and disasters imposed upon them by the Japanese imperialists generation after generation.    \r\n \r\n"

It is not difficult to guess what this means.\r\n   After all, the U.S. attempt to provoke a nuclear war to invade the DPRK   has turned out to be a fait accompli and it is a matter of time.\r\n   The DPRK neither wants a war nor fears it,  the commentary says, warning that the U.S. conservatives should drop their policy of aggression against the DPRK   if they do not want to sustain the same miserable defeat as what they did in the last Korean war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
