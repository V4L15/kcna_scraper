The south Korean puppet forces are trembling with fear that when the barrage of fire would be showered on their heads.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under this situation Western media recently asserted that the \"theory of collapse\" of the DPRK does not sound plausible and the best way is to settle the issue by the way of co-existing with the nuclear DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An article posted by Christopher Black, a judicial figure of Canada, on GLOBALRESEARCH. CA on March 21 said that the U.S. is busy with military drills aimed to \"bring down the social system\" in north Korea while applying no sanctions against Israel which reportedly had access to nuclear weapons. Strong counteraction against them is the legitimate right of north Korea for self-defence, it noted, adding that in order to bring peace to the Korean peninsula it is necessary to give up \"pressure\" on it, approach its government with dignity and open the door of dialogue with it so that justice and logic may reign.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Reddit and other media of the U.S. and its experts on Korean affairs said that the solution to the nuclear issue of north Korea through \"collapse\" and \"regime change\" that has been sought by the U.S. so far is outdated and impossible, its Korea policy reached the limit and diplomatic method through negotiations is the only way for settling the issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As commented by the media, the U.S. should properly judge the reality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is the military power possessed of strong nuclear treasured sword of Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The frantic anti-DPRK war exercises being staged by the U.S. and the puppet group of traitors are adventurous acts of precipitating their self-destruction out of their megalomania about force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Once the DPRK is determined, the Korean-style operation for preemptive attack will be staged the way the world has never seen to blow up all the bases of aggression, big and small, at once.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The best way for the U.S. to protect its mainland from nuclear radioactivity is to halt its nuclear war games on the Korean peninsula."

This is a strategic line to achieve the final victory, not a temporary countermeasure to cope with the fast-changing situation. \n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Friday says in an article in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's line of simultaneously developing the two fronts is crystal of the WPK's steadfast faith and will to finally conclude the confrontation with the U.S. by bolstering up the nuclear force for self-defence in every way which reflects the transparent idea of national independence and the Songun revolutionary leadership history of President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il and to build the best power and people's paradise on this land as early as possible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The WPK laid down the above-said strategic line at a time when the U.S. imperialists and their followers were putting the political and military pressure unprecedented in the history upon the DPRK. This was something which no one could ever do.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the last period, some countries attempted to develop nuclear weapons, but finally yielded to the collective pressure of the U.S. imperialists and powers in collusion with them.

            "content": "Comentarista de IAPIC revela parcialidad de actual orden politico mundial\r\nPyongyang, primero de abril (ACNC) -- El comentarista del Instituto de Asuntos Politicos Internacionales de Corea (IAPIC) publico un articulo que revela la parcialidad del actual orden politico mundial. \n\t\t\t\t\tEl articulo senala que la palestra politica mundial de hoy se ha convertido en la escena caotica violenta en torno a las potencias donde predominan la injusticia, el despotismo, la hegemonia, las arbitrariedades, la agresion y la dominacion y se desprecian hasta los principios mas elementales de las relaciones internacionales, y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas atroces fuerzas imperialistas acaudilladas por Estados Unidos violan explicitamente la soberania y el derecho a la subsistencia de los paises debiles y pequenos cometiendo la dominacion e intervencion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas fuerzas \"privilegiadas\", que se fingen duenos en la escena internacional incluso la ONU, pisotean flagrantemente las demandas independientes y los intereses de la mayoria de los paises en vias de desarrollo, y tratan unilateralmente todos los problemas conforme a sus gustos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa evolucion de la situacion tirante en torno a la RPDC constituye el microcosmo y el testigo mas evidente de la politica mundial que se hace extremadamente parcial y corrupta. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora EE.UU. y sus satelites ejercen a la RPDC la sancion economica y la presion militar sin precedentes describiendola como \"origen del mal\" y ente intolerable de la sociedad internacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn los ultimos tiempos, insisten abiertamente en el \"cambio del poder\" y el \"derrumbe del regimen\" de la RPDC, calificando de \"seria amenaza\" y \"provocacion\" a la paz y estabilidad del mundo su declaracion sobre la posesion de bomba de hidrogeno minimizada y sus medidas militares autodefensivas, y movilizan inmensos medios de ataque nucleares y los efectivos de operaciones especiales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn cuanto a la posesion de armas nucleares de la RPDC en controversia por las fuerzas hostiles, es una justa opcion de autodefensa para defender la soberania, la dignidad y el derecho a la subsistencia frente a las tentativas agresivas de EE.UU. que durante varios decenios vino ejerciendole la amenaza y chantajes nucleares, las sanciones de toda indole y la presion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs irrazonable que EE.UU. y sus satelites censuren el lanzamiento de satelite artificial de la RPDC como \"prueba de lanzamiento de misil balistico\" y \"violacion de la resolucion de la ONU\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos satelites artificiales cargados por los cohetes transportadores de EE.UU. y de otros muchos paises se lanzan hacia el espacio. Sin embargo, las fuerzas hostiles persisten en que solo el cohete transportador de la RPDC amenaza la paz y seguridad del mundo, lo cual es una terquedad y sofisteria bandidesca. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo mas problematico es que ocurren oficialmente los casos sucios inimaginables en que hasta algunas potencias que abogan tanto por la importancia de la apariencia y la obligacion, obedecen a la vil coaccion y exigencia de EE.UU. y bailan al son que les toca la prostituta proyanqui.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUn pais intenta pisotear la justicia y la verdad con los supuestos resultados inventados en contubernio secreto con tal o cual pais abandonando sin vacilacion hasta las relaciones de amistad preciosa, conquista comun lograda a precio de la sangre.  Ante esta realidad tragica volvemos a conocer al dedillo de la imagen virtual de la politica mundial y la verdad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora, la estructura de la politica mundial va corrompiendose completamente en el turbio juego de azar donde bajo el mando de EE.UU., algunas potencias conspiran o rechazan entre si segun los intereses de ellas mismas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara encubrir su naturaleza agresiva y hegemonica, EE.UU. pone la ONU al frente de la politica mundial y por nominacion, preconiza que los 5 paises miembros permanentes del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU discuten, determinan, ejecutan y controlan todas las cosas grandes y pequenas ocurridas en todos los lugares de la Tierra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, al investigarlo, este hecho mismo es muy absurdo y anormal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFrancamente dicho, queremos preguntar si los 5 paises autodenominados como potencias, tienen la calificacion o el derecho a representar otros paises en la escena politica internacional, o sea en la ONU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNadie les solicito resolver o decidir algo en lugar de si mismo. Y ellos mismos no tienen la capacidad de hacerlo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora la humanidad se encuentra en el dilema de abrir con la independencia y la justicia una nueva era de desarrollo de la historia o retroceder de continuo a la epoca primitiva tenebrosa donde reinaba la ley de la selva.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay que renovar con audacia el orden politico mundial tan parcial e injusto, en lugar de lamentarlo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi en este mundo existen la conciencia, la cordura y la aspiracion a la veracidad y justicia, es preciso oponerse rotundamente a la actual politica internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTeniendo el disuasivo nuclear como remedio todopoderoso para la defensa de la justicia y la paz, la RPDC estara al frente de la lucha por rectificar el parcial orden internacional, establecido por EE.UU., y el proceder de los paises grandes o pequenos que tratan de \"adiestrarse\" en ello a ciegas, y construir una autentica e imparcial sociedad humana donde se aseguren la soberania e igualdad de todos los paises y naciones y cooperen entre si en el principio de la confianza y respeto mutuos."

            "content": "ACNC aboga por desmantelar campana de guerra nuclear en Peninsula Coreana\r\nPyongyang, primero de abril (ACNC) -- En la actualidad, Estados Unidos y la banda traidora de Park Geun-hye libran los ejercicios militares conjuntos de gran tamano destinados a derrumbar el regimen de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea diciendo del \"golpe a modo de pinzas\" y \"operacion de avance al interior\". Precisamente en este momento, la RPDC manifiesta a todo el mundo su poderosa capacidad de guerra real y poderio de las autoctonas fuerzas armadas nucleares dispuestas a arrasar de un golpe a los enemigos.\n\t\t\t\t\tLo comprueban el entrenamiento de lanzamiento del cohete balistico a manera de explotar la ojiva nuclear en la altitud fijada de los supuestos puertos enemigos, el ruido de los tanques y otros pertrechos ultramodernos  y la prueba de ambiente para reentrada de cohete balistico en atmosfera.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnte la sucesiva contraofensiva de autodefensa de la RPDC, la capa belicista estadounidense dice perpleja que \"el sistema antimisil de EE.UU. no testimonio la capacidad capaz de defender el territorio principal desde el ataque de misiles del Norte\", mientras los titeres surcoreanos estan muy inquietados sin saber cuando puedan recibir una lluvia de proyectiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo tales circunstancias, los medios de prensa occidentales insisten en que el \"rumor de derrumbe\" de la RPDC es sospechoso y lo mejor es resolver el problema con el metodo de coexistir con la RPDC pertrechada con las armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa personalidad del circulo juridico de Canada, Christopher Black, publico el 21 de marzo en la pagina web de Internet GLOBALRESEARCH.CA un articulo intitulado \"Corea: logica de la paz y la guerra\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn su nota el subrayo que EE.UU. no ejerce una sancion a Israel, pero recurre a los ejercicios militares encaminados al \"derrumbe del regimen\" del Norte de Corea. Prosiguio que el Norte de Corea se le enfrenta con super-intransigencia, lo que es su merecido derecho de autodefensa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPuntualizo que para llevar la paz en la Peninsula Coreana, hay que renunciar la presion contra el Norte de Corea, tratar con consideracion al gobierno coreano y aceptar la justicia y la logica a traves del dialogo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl sitio web de prensa de EE.UU., Reddit y otras publicaciones y los especialistas de los asuntos coreanos, insisten en que el remedio para resolver el problema nuclear del Norte de Corea mediante el \"derrumbe\" y el \"cambio del poder\" perseguido hasta ahora por EE.UU., es viejo e imposible en este tiempo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSubrayaron que la estrategia de EE.UU. sobre el Norte de Corea ha llegado al limite y el remedio para la solucion del problema nuclear del Norte de Corea es nada mas que el metodo diplomatico a traves de las negociaciones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo la opinion publica evalua unanimemente, EE.UU. debe juzgar bien la realidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC es la potencia militar que poseyo las poderosas fuerzas armadas nucleares de Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos freneticos ejercicios belicos de EE.UU. y la horda traidora del Sur de Corea son la locura aventurera que acelera su autodestruccion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi una vez decidimos, la operacion del ataque preventivo al estilo coreano para aniquilar todos los nidos grandes y pequenos de la agresion se cumplira como relampago con el modo desconocido por todo el mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSera la mejor medida abandonar la campana de guerra nuclear en la Peninsula Coreana para evitar  que el territorio principal de EE.UU. se convierta en la zona contaminada por radiactividad nuclear."
