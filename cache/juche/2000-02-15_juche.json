            "content": "Japan urged to repeal \"bill on prefectural suffrage\" \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 15 (KCNA) -- The Korean Democratic Lawyers Association on Monday issued a statement assailing the presentation of the illegal \"bill on prefectural suffrage\" to the diet by some political parties of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"bill\" introduced by the Japanese reactionaries is an extremely illegal one ignoring the requirements of the international law as it is intended to assimilate Koreans in Japan to Japanese, the statement said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"bill\" stipulates that if they are to be granted \"suffrage\", the Korean citizens in Japan should change the Korean nationality into other nationality. This is a breach of the universal declaration of human rights which says that no state and no organization can force an individual to abandon or change his or her nationality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The statement bitterly denounced the \"bill on prefectural suffrage,\" a product of the collusion and tie-up between the Japanese reactionaries and the South Korean ruling quarters, as an open challenge to the international law, another hostile act against the DPRK and Chongryon (General Association of Korean Residents in Japan). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan should not pursue such a policy of national alienation as fanning up the anti-DPRK confrontation of the South Korean ruling quarters or chiming in with them but honestly repent of  and compensate for the crimes committed against the Korean people in the past and immediately withdraw the \"bill\", the statement said, expressing the expectation that all the international judicial organizations and lawyers of all countries would extend positive support to Chongryon, Koreans in Japan and all the Korean people in their just struggle against the moves of the Japanese reactionaries and the South Korean authorities to adopt a legislation on \"suffrage.\" \r\n\r\n"

Korean chief executive's utterance \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, February 15 (KCNA) -- The South Korean chief executive in a recent interview with the Japanese Tokyo TV asserted that it was \"effective to pursue the engagement policy based on a firm security system\" and \"Japan should approach the talks for establishing diplomatic relations with the north with the initiative to lead it to reform and opening.\" And he also argued that \"it was a most desirable policy during the tenure of his office to follow the engagement policy towards the north through the South Korea-U.S.-Japan cooperation and joint efforts of the four countries of the U.S., Japan, China and Russia.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"engagement policy\" advocated by him is a policy of confrontation and war against the north, the policy aimed at stepping up the arms buildup, war preparations and the establishment of a fascist dictatorial system under the pretext of \"security\" in a bid to overpower the north. At the interview he revealed his sinister attempt to pursue the policy with increased frenzy in collusion with the U.S. and Japan and other foreign forces veiled with the phraseologies of \"joint efforts\" and \"cooperation.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean chief executive, kowtowing to Japan, the sworn enemy of the Korean nation, spoke highly of its \"Emperor\" and made sheep's eyes at it, saying that his visit to South Korea would \"mark the climax in the South Korea-Japan friendship.\" And this time he wooed Japan to take the \"initiative\" to lead the DPRK to \"reform and opening.\" All this goes to prove that he is a wicked flunkeyist and traitor who does not have even an iota of Juche character and national identity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean nation has experienced the tragedy of division for over half a century because of the foreign forces, flunkeyist traitors and separatist forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the South Korean chief executive truly regards the \"termination of Cold War and reconciliation between the north and the south, etc. as his supreme goal,\" he should think of the independent and peaceful reunification of the country before any other things and amend his policy towards the north for the sake of great unity of the whole nation in order to achieve the reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If he continues to chant the \"engagement policy\" in a bid to prolong his remaining days depending on the foreign forces, he will meet the same miserable end as his preceding dictators did. \r\n\r\n"

Korean ruler condemned \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, February 15 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today carries a signed commentary on the criminal, flunkeyist and treacherous jargon hostile toward the fellow countrymen and flattering the foreign forces made by the South Korean chief executive in an interview with a Japanese TV some days ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the interview, the South Korean chief executive, referring to the issue of \"relations with the north,\" said that the \"engagement policy\" should be pursued under the \"firm security system.\" His utterances betray his anti-national attempt to do harm to and isolate the DPRK in league with the foreign forces, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His ulterior intention was more clearly pronounced when he asked Japan to \"induce\" somebody to \"reform and opening\" through the talks for establishing diplomatic relations between the DPRK and Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"engagement policy\" is, in essence, a strategy for aggression with no gunfire against the north to realize a wild ambition for \"unification through invasion of the north\" by disintegrating the DPRK ideologically and disarming it mentally through the false \"dialogue\" and poisonous \"exchange.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is disgusting that the South Korean chief executive entreated the Japanese emperor to visit South Korea, praising relations with Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His active pro-Japanese treacherous act is aimed at stifling the DPRK politically and militarily by making a compact with Japan, his master, in return for selling off the interests of the country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His act is an unpardonable challenge and provocation against the people of the DPRK, who are regarding socialism as their lifeline and faith and valuing the dignity and sovereignty of the country like their life and soul. The DPRK can never remain an onlooker to it, the commentary stresses. \r\n\r\n"
