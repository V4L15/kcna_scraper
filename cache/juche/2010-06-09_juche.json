If the United Nations Security Council, as an organization of such a mission, is in its genuine wish for peace and security on the Korean Peninsula, where a touch and go situation has been created due to the incident of \"Cheonan\", it should take, first of all, measures that can lead the U.S. and south Korea to receive the inspection group of the National Defence Commission as already proposed by the DPRK, the victim, to help verify the \"investigation result\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By doing so, the United Nations Security Council should give utmost priority to bringing to light the very truth of the incident, on an impartial and objective basis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In case the unilaterally forged \"investigation result\" is put on the agenda of the United Nations Security Council and open to be debated without the verification of the directly victimized party, it will be more than clear that the sovereignty and security of the DPRK is infringed upon, and by then no one would dare imagine how serious its consequences would be with regard to the peace and security on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On this occasion I would like to enclose herewith a copy of the answer by the spokesman of the DPRK Foreign Ministry dated 4 June 2010 and kindly request you to circulate it as document of the United Nations Security Council."

Si el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU desea de veras la paz y la seguridad de la Peninsula Coreana, donde se dio la situacion a punto de explosion debido al incidente de la corbeta \"Cheonan\", debera tomar medidas que conduzcan a EE.UU. y al Sur de Corea a recibir el grupo de inspeccion del Comite de Defensa Nacional, como ya habia propuesto la RPDC, victima del caso, para facilitar la verificacion del \"resultado de investigacion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe esa manera, deberia dar la prioridad a esclarecer la verdad del incidente sobre la base imparcial y objetiva.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn caso de que el \"resultado de investigacion\" impuesto unilateralmente se incluye en la agenda del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU y se abre el debate sin la verificacion de la parte perjudicada directamente, estara muy claro que se verian infringidas la soberania y la seguridad de la RPDC y entonces nadie podra imaginar cuan serias seran sus consecuencias sobre la paz y la seguridad de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En esta ocasion, quisiera adjuntar en esta carta una copia de la respuesta del portavoz del MINREX de la RPDC fechada 4 de junio de 2010 y pedirle la gentileza de circularla como documento oficial del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU."
