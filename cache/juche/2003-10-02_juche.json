General Assembly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that it is important to give priority to raising the position of the NAM in the international arena including U.N. and demonstrate its collective might there, he said that the non-aligned countries should jointly raise and implement in U.N. resolutions adopted at NAM meetings including its recent summits. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As regards the issue of disarmament, he underscored the need to continue strongly urging the nuclear weapons states set out timetables for unconditionally assuring the non-nuclear countries of non-use of nuclear weapons and dismantling nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Turning to the issue of human rights, he called for resolutely opposing any extraterritorial moves to impose particular \"human rights standards\" upon other countries as universally accepted ones and any attempt to use the issue of human rights as a pretext for interfering in the internal affairs of sovereign states. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Underlining the need for the NAM to conduct positive joint actions to reject unilateral and high-handed acts of constantly threatening world peace and security at the session of the U.N. General Assembly this year, he said that unilateral and high-handed acts are, in essence, aimed to establish a world order controlled by the only superpower. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this context he underscored the urgent necessity to thoroughly implement the political initiative of the NAM to regard it as its supreme principle to reject interference in the internal affairs of other countries in the international relations and respect sovereignty. He went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historic North-South Joint Declaration published on June 15, 2000 is a great programme for national reunification in which the north and the south of Korea promised each other to achieve peace and reunification of the country independently by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation. The DPRK will as ever make all efforts to improve the north-south relations and realize the independent and peaceful reunification of the country by implementing the declaration to the letter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S., which draws the world's attention, surfaced as the U.S. administration listed the DPRK as part of an \"axis of evil\" and a target of its preemptive nuclear attack and ditched the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework. It is, therefore, a precondition for settling the nuclear issue for the U.S. to drop its hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will invariably remain loyal to the noble idea and objective of the NAM in order to carry cut the lifetime will of  President Kim Il Sung who dedicated his great life to the global independence and the growth and development of the NAM and the intention of leader Kim Jong Il, successor to his cause, and do all it can to maintain and realize the common stand and view of the NAM at the U.N. general assembly this year.    \r\n\r\n"

One example of this was that the DPRK advanced a landmark bold proposal for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula at the six-way talks in Beijing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the U.S. only insisted on its assertion that the DPRK should scrap its nuclear program first and demanded it move first, shunning all its efforts and reasonable proposals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the problem. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an unreasonable way of thinking unacceptable to anyone for one warring party to demand the other party come out their hands up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. interprets such unilateral assertion as a \"peaceful solution,\" it will only lead to a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has further escalated the international \"blockade and pressure\" upon the DPRK, talking about \"maritime inspection exercise\" and \"human traffic\" since the six-way talks in Beijing. It is preposterous, indeed, for the U.S. to talk about a \"peaceful solution\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This only proves that the Bush administration has no political will to abandon its hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was confirmed that the U.S. does not wish to co-exist with the DPRK in peace but tries to use the six-way talks as a leverage to completely disarm the latter. This compels the DPRK to discard any interests or expectation for the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already clarified, the DPRK has not made any promise regarding the next round of the six-way talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is taking practical measures to steadily beef up the nuclear deterrent force as a just self-defensive means to repel the U.S. nuclear preemptive attack and ensure peace and security on the Korean peninsula and in the region according to the decision of the 1st Session of the 11th Supreme People's Assembly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the most reasonable measure to ensure peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's nuclear deterrent force was built to cope with the U.S. nuclear threat. It is not meant to attack others but to protect itself under any circumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. demand that the DPRK dismantle its nuclear deterrent force first under this situation will only lead to a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is clearly evidenced by the Iraqi situation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Present at the seminar were delegations of the north, south and overseas sides including members of the DPRK Committee for Investigation into the Damage Done by the Japanese Imperialists during Their Occupation of Korea and a Japanese representative. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hong Son Ok, chairperson of the DPRK Measure Committee for Demanding Compensation to Comfort Women for the Japanese Army and the Victims of Forcible Drafting, made a keynote speech at the seminar. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She said that the whole course from the time when \"Ukishimamaru\" was ordered to sail for Pusan to its end is full of inconsistency and suspicion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the testimonies made by survivors and information available through the investigation and discovery made so far suggest that the incident was not an unforeseen accident caused by a mine but a premeditated explosion of the ship deliberately carried out by the military authorities of Japan, she explained the following reasons to say so:\r\n First. \"Ukishimamaru\" left Ominato, Japan with the permission of the Japanese government and by its order. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Second. Boarding of Koreans on it and its departure were forcibly carried out by the Japanese military. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Third. It left for Maizuru Port, not for Pusan, from the outset. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Fourth. The sea route to Maizuru Port was safe as it was free from mines. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Fifth. If it were an explosion by a mine, there should have been some phenomena in the wake of the explosion, but nothing happened or everything turned out to be abnormal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these facts prove that \"Ukishimamaru\" sank when the explosives planted into the ship went off according to the carefully worked out plan for blasting, the reporter said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government has not conducted even an elementary investigation into the incident of \"Ukishimamaru\", stubbornly denying its responsibility for it though half a century has passed since the end of the war. But thanks to the sincere efforts made by some organizations concerned and progressive figures and testimonies by survivors of the disaster, some aspects of the case have been disclosed to lay a foundation of clarifying the whole truth about the incident. \r\n The reporter went on:\r\n We will seek the settlement of this incident to the end and, for this purpose, strongly demand the Japanese government as follows: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n First. The Japanese government should thoroughly probe and clarify the whole aspect of the \"Ukishimamaru\" incident and open to the public as it was. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Second. The Japanese government should admit its state responsibility for the incident and make an apology and compensation to the victims and their bereaved families in the name of the state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Third. The Japanese government should ferret out all the criminals involved in the incident and punish them according to their responsibilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Fourth. The Japanese government should find out the remains of all those killed in the incident, identify them and take practical measures to safely send them to Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to have all these demands met it is important for the organizations and figures in the north and the south and overseas and victims and their bereaved families to pool their strength and wisdom and wage a powerful solidarity struggle. \r\n It is particularly important to bring the crimes committed by Japan against humankind in the past including the \"Ukishimamaru\" case to the U.N. Commission on Human Rights and other international organizations in a bid to let the international community know about them and build public opinion critical of them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The report was followed by speeches made by Kong Myong Song, a section chief of the History Institute of the Academy of Social Sciences, who is permanent member of the DPRK Measure Committee for Demanding Compensation to the Comfort Women for the Japanese Army and the Victims of Forced Drafting, Jon Jae Jin, chairman of the Association for Probing the Truth behind the Blasting of \"Ukishimamaru\", Hong Sang Jin, director of the Secretariat of the Central Headquarters of the Koreans Side to the Group to Probe the Truth behind the Forced Drafting of Koreans, other representatives of the north and the south and overseas and Yuka Anzako, Japanese delegate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They cited concrete facts to disclose the truth behind the explosion of the ship and accused the Japanese government of evading a probe into the case though 58 years have passed since the incident. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then its participants heard testimonies made by those who were forcibly drafted from the north and the south of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They looked round photos exposing Japan's past crimes and a list of 427,129 Koreans out of those who were forcibly taken to Japan, which was newly surveyed and discovered by the investigation group. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A series of documents were adopted at the seminar. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A letter to the acting U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights urged his office to take actions of asking the UN Commission on Human Rights to organize and dispatch an international fact-finding group to fully probe and clarify the truth of the \"Ukishimamaru\" incident and demand the Japanese government take a measure of probing the truth of the incident and make an apology and compensation to the victims. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also requested the office to exercise its influence upon the Japanese government to respect the resolutions and recommendations adopted by the UN and various international organizations as regards Japan's past crimes and take practical measures for their implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A letter to the Japanese government demanded as follows: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n First. The Japanese government should take measures in various aspects to probe and clarify the truth of the incident that remains buried into oblivion, and fully open to the public the results of the investigation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Second. The Japanese government should make sincere efforts to identify those killed in the incident and deliver their remains to Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Third. The Japanese government should strictly punish by law those responsible for the incident on the basis of what has been investigated and confirmed and sincerely apologize to the victims and their bereaved families and make a compensation understandable to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Fourth. The Japanese government should stop at once all sorts of hostile acts toward the Koreans, the victims, feeling guilty conscience and responsibility as an assailant, and take a practical step to respect and implement the basic spirit of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration in which it promised to redress its past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A joint statement of organizations in the north and the south and overseas expressed the firm will to carry on the struggle to the last in order to probe the truth of the \"Ukishimamaru\" case and wrest an apology and compensation from the Japanese government.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
