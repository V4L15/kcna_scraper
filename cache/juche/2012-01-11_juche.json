            "content": "Kim Jong Un Inspects Construction Projects Undertaken by KPA\r\nPyongyang, January 11 (KCNA) -- Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army Kim Jong Un, supreme leader of the Workers' Party of Korea, state and army, inspected various construction projects undertaken by KPA service personnel including the Pyongyang Folk Park and the Meat Shop in Hero Street. \n\t\t\t\t\tHe was greeted on the spot by commanding officers of the units engaged in the construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGoing round various projects for hours, he acquainted himself in detail with the progress made in the construction, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe asked in detail commanding officers at each project about how big amount of work is to be done, what measures are taken to supply building materials and what is knotty problems in the construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMaking the round of the construction site of the Pyongyang Folk Park taking its shape day by day, in particular, he learned about what measures are taken to preserve well the excellent culture and tradition of the Korean nation and how buildings of reduced size such as the Party Founding Memorial Tower, the West Sea Barrage, the Grand People's Study House and the Mansudae Art Theatre are being built to their original state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe was satisfied to learn that commanding officers and soldier-builders have contrived and introduced innovative construction methods for pushing forward the project without letup even under the recent unfavorable weather conditions by pooling creative wisdom and are ensuring both quality and speed by carrying out work in a bold and big manner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe praised the officials of the project command for opening a bright vista for finishing the construction as scheduled and expanding the achievements by minutely working out a plan for each process and properly organizing construction and command in keeping with a high degree of enthusiasm of the soldier-builders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGoing round construction projects, he gave precious instructions to be implemented for constructing buildings in a peculiar manner as monumental edifices in the era of the Workers' Party and the Songun era.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe underscored the need to construct the buildings in a responsible manner and properly level areas to match the landscape of their vicinity as the projects undertaken by the People's Army are important ones for realizing the lifetime wishes of leader            Kim Jong Il who made so much effort to provide the people with more affluent living conditions and highly civilized living environments. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe called for constructing even a single building in such a way as to be impeccable in the distant future, regarding the WPK's Juche-based idea and theory of architectural beauty as a firm guiding principle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Pyongyang Folk Park should be built in such a way as to be in line with the principle of historicism and meet the modern aesthetic need and to enable the people and the school youth and children to have good rest and acquire ample knowledge, he noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe also underlined the need to thoroughly implement the Party's policy of putting architecture on a formative artistic basis and thus complete all the projects at the best level so that they may look like spectacular not only when viewed from distance but at close range.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe underscored the need to introduce reasonable and scientific construction methods to push ahead with the project without interruption and successfully build facilities to view buildings as the construction of the park is a hard project requiring a lot of effort and is beset with technological and engineering bottlenecks. He took a benevolent measure for this.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe emphasized the need to build the Meat Shop in Hero Street in such a way as to provide the best conveniences to the customers as the shop will be frequented by them, adding that to this end it is necessary to thoroughly embody the serve-the-people spirit and kindness in the construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe called on the relevant units to minutely ensure a timely and sufficient supply of building materials, transport means, etc.  necessary for construction in keeping with the rapid progress of the project. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe expressed great expectation and conviction that the soldier-builders would fully display the stamina of the general offensive in the revolutionary soldier spirit and in the spirit of conducting an offensive under the motto \"At one go\" and thus complete their construction projects as scheduled."

The U.S. promised to offer 500 000 tons three years ago. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt the beginning the U.S. asserted that food aid had nothing to do with politics as it is a humanitarian issue. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S., at the DPRK-U.S. high-ranking talks started in July 2011, proposed to take confidence-building steps such as suspension of sanctions as well as food aid in case the DPRK takes similar steps such as temporary suspension of uranium enrichment the former asked. After all the U.S. itself raised this problem as political. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBut, the U.S. has drastically changed the amount and items of provision contrary to the originally promised food aid of more than 300 000 tons. So, the DPRK cannot but have doubt about the U.S. will for confidence building, and this compels the former to return to the boundary discussed in May 2011. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe will watch if the U.S. truly wants to build confidence."

Not long ago, a peace monument was erected in reflection of the unanimous demand of south Koreans of different social standings. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe monument reflects the grudge of the Korean women who were taken to be sexual slaves for the Imperial Japanese Army. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan, however, is shameless enough to call for the removal of the monument in disregard of the atmosphere of the international community critical of the sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan had committed the most heinous crimes against ethics in history during its 40 odd-year-long colonial rule over Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt forced 200 000 Korean women into sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army. This was the most despicable and cruel crime in terms of barbarous and organized nature and scale. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat should not be overlooked is that the Japanese reactionaries have become evermore undisguised in their attempts to deny the above-said crime in recent years when the international community is becoming more vocal demanding Japan's settlement of its past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey went the lengths of blustering that \"Japan does not feel guilty of any wrongdoing during World War Ⅱ\". Moreover, they called for amending the statement made by Chief Cabinet Secretary Kono in 1993 in which he admitted Japan's responsibility for \"comfort women\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is the present reality of Japan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan is the most impudent and brazen-faced country in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan is shrewd and self-interested. But there is one thing Japan cannot go without settling. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan has evaded its responsibility for its past crimes up to this date. For this it has not shaken off the disgrace of being a political pigmy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMore than 60 years have passed since the end of World War Ⅱ, but  the international community still regards Japan as an untrustworthy state as it has not yet settled its past. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis amounts to the biggest political loss to Japan, several hundred dearer than the economic price it has to pay for its past wrongs. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan's denial of its crimes against ethics in the last century which make even animals blush is only adding to its past crimes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan would be well advised to come down to earth and opt for settling its crime-woven past."

            "content": "Truth behind of Warship \"Cheonan\" Sinking Disclosed\r\nPyongyang, January 11 (KCNA) -- Sin Sang Chol, a former member of the joint team for investigation into the warship \"Cheonan\" sinking, posted an article disclosing the truth behind the case on an internet website of south Korea on Monday. \n\t\t\t\t\tIn the article he had already made a conclusion that there was no explosion that sent the warship into the bottom of the sea, adding he denied the fact that a torpedo went off below the ship. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThat is to say, there was no torpedo at all, he stressed, and went on: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDiscussion on the torpedo itself is a fabrication. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Defense Ministry described the case as \"sinking by explosion\" and made an official announcement. Little over 15 days later, the joint investigation team announced that a thorough survey of the seabed of the waters close to the point where the stern of the ship sank resulted in discovering a torpedo. Then it opened the design of the torpedo and its photo to media. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBut, the torpedo made public by the Defense Ministry for the first time touched off a dispute soon. There were many suspicions. Measurement of the design was not right. Why was the numerical value cm? The style of written language was not north's. Why is the torpedo so old as it had been under water just for 50-odd days? With what evidence do they prove the torpedo is from the north? \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs these suspicions were made, the joint investigation team opened the \"north's torpedo No. 1\" in a glass box on May 20, 2010. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe appearance of the torpedo produced as a real thing, not one in photo, made the world attention distant from the photographed torpedo made public five days ago. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBut, what mattered was the second. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA scrutiny into the torpedo in the photo and the second torpedo in a glass box shows they were not identical to each other. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt a glance, the second torpedo looks similar to the first torpedo. But it is not hard to clarify the fact that the comparison of every part with those of the torpedo produced earlier suggests that they are quite different from each other. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere were clear traces proving much effort was made to make the torpedo produced for the second time look similar to the first torpedo opened to media. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe results of the close photographing of the torpedo showed such clumsy work that traces of the work done by a press to make the parts of the controversial torpedo look similar to the old rusted parts in the center of the torpedo were clearly visible.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe consulted the two different torpedoes with lawyers and submitted its results to the court bench as evidence along with convincing opinions on them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere were clear traces of rubbing rust to write \"No. 1.\" How do you think about the fact that there were not one but two torpedoes, an indication of the height of fabrication?"
