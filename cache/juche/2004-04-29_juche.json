Japan seeks to wrest a sort of concession from the DPRK over the nuclear issue and the \"abduction case\" by putting pressure upon it. It is for this purpose that Abe clamored for passing the above-said bill through the Diet irrespective of Japan-DPRK discussions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's mean racket of economic sanctions against the DPRK has touched off fiercer hatred and wrath at Japan among the Korean people. Japan would be well advised to stop the dastardly campaign of economic sanctions against the DPRK, bearing in mind that it would have to pay a very high price, if it dared do harm to the DPRK, dancing to other's tune.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

So, they should share the pains of disaster together and tide over it by various forms of compatriotic assistance, the statement said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Pusan Solidarity for Implementing the South-North Joint Declaration in an emergency statement recalled that in the 1980s the DPRK sent various kinds of aid materials such as rice and cloth to south Korea when the latter found itself in difficulties after a big typhoon and in the middle of the 1990s a movement for helping compatriots in the north was launched in south Korea when the flood and drought damages reached their height in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement proposed to all the people to conduct a large-scale \"all-people fund-raising campaign\", saying that the day of reunification will be brought much earlier, if the national disaster is overcome by the nation's own efforts resourcefully when it is greeting the era of reunification with the rejuvenation of multi-faceted exchange and cooperation after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Headquarters of the Movement for Withdrawal of the U.S. Troops from South Korea in a commentary said the south Korean authorities should quickly send things necessary for recovery from the accident of explosion and the civic and public organizations should also conduct aid activities immediately through a massive fund-raising movement and various other ways.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
