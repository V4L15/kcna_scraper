            "content": "Responsabilidad de la tension de Peninsula Coreana recae sobre EE.UU., insiste ACNC\r\nPyongyang, 13 de abril (ACNC) -- Los belicistas estadounidenses enviaron a la zona maritima cercana a la Peninsula Coreana los dos portaaviones nucleares supertamanos Nimitz y Stennis hablando de la supuesta \"provocacion\" de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea y volvio a infiltrar el submarino nuclear Cheyenne en la zona maritima alrededor de la misma Peninsula, fomentando al maximo el ambiente de guerra. \n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. viene recurriendo durante varios decenios a los ejercicios de guerra nuclear contra la RPDC. Pero, es la primera vez que moviliza los medios de ataque nuclear de todos tipos a la campana de aplastamiento a la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa realidad demuestra que los tejemanejes de EE.UU. tendentes a desatar la guerra nuclear en la Peninsula Coreana entran en etapa aventurera.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido a tal campana de guerra nuclear de EE.UU., la situacion de la region se halla en la fase peor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa responsabilidad de la tension actual de la Peninsula Coreana recae enteramente sobre Estados Unidos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl imperio yanqui se desespera para lograr de todos modos el desarme nuclear de la RPDC considerando que la fuerte capacidad militar de ella acabara con su politica hostil que posibilita el cumplimiento de la estrategia de hegemonia mundial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn este contexto, fabrico las \"resoluciones de sancion\" de la ONU cuestionado el lanzamiento de satelite y la tercera prueba nuclear subterranea de la RPDC realizados en diciembre del ano pasado y en febrero del ano en curso, respectivamente, y desarrolla con frenesi los ejercicios de guerra nuclear de gran envergadura sin precedente. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTrazo junto con los titeres surcoreanos el \"plan de operaciones conjuntas para hacer frente a la provocacion local\" no ocultando su intento de extender la provocacion del ejercito titere a la guerra total nuclear contra la RPDC bajo la injerencia de sus tropas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLlega al climax en su brutalidad la campana anti-RPDC que libra EE.UU. movilizando toda su capacidad politica, economica y militar. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTales hechos evidencian que EE.UU. es el responsable de la tension tirante de la Peninsula Coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPese a ello, intenta imponer a la RPDC la responsabilidad del caso con el fin de ejercerle la presion internacional y justificar su brutal politica hostil a la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, no puede doblegar con nada la decision antiyanqui del ejercito y pueblo coreanos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSon justas las superintransigentes contramedidas de autodefensa de la RPDC tomadas frente a los actos hostiles de EE.UU. que perturba la paz y estabilidad de la region y es cierto el triunfo de la primera. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito y pueblo de la RPDC continuaran con intransigencia la batalla antiyanqui para eliminar completamente la brutal politica hostil a la RPDC del imperio norteamericano."

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun denuncia ejercicio artillero conjunto en Sur de Corea\r\nPyongyang, 13 de abril (ACNC) -- El dia 9, los belicistas surcoreanos perpetraron en la costa oriental de la provincia de Kangwon del Sur de Corea el entrenamiento artillero conjunto de gran envergadura contra la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea movilizando numerosos pertrechos belicos de las fuerzas terrestres, aereas y navales, tales como los canones autopropulsados K-9, los lanzacohetes reactivos, los radares anti-artilleria, los destructores y KF-16 y F-15K.\n\t\t\t\t\tEn un comentario individual insertado hoy, el diario Rodong Sinmun revelo que agrava mas la tension esa maniobra encaminada a acatar de manera tridimensional a la RPDC y realizada coincidiendo con el entrenamiento Foal Eagle en el suelo surcoreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana se torna mas peligrosa y tensa que nunca, senala el diario y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTomando el actual estado creado en la peninsula como buena oportunidad para lograr su ambicion de agredir al Norte, los titeres surcoreanos desarrollan diariamente los ejercicios de guerra en confabulacion con su amo yanqui.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo de siempre, ellos utilizaron esta vez tambien el pretexto de hacer frente a la supuesta \"provocacion del Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDado que el estallido de guerra nuclear en la Peninsula Coreana se hace hecho consumado por la culpa de EE.UU. y los titeres surcoreanos, es natural que la RPDC pase a las acciones militares practicas para frustrar tajantemente las brutales campanas agresivas en su contra movilizando generalmente su disuasivo de autodefensa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo habra piedad en la guerra total para dar punto final a la imprudente amenaza militar y las maniobras agresivas de EE.UU. y los titeres, defender firmemente la soberania y la maxima dignidad del pais y cumplir el historico deseo de reunificar la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi los enemigos se atreven a atentar contra la RPDC, no se hara esperar el poderoso ataque nuclear de la RPDC que reducira lo todo a cenizas y escombros."
