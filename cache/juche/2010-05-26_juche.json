Side's Psychological Warfare\r\n Pyongyang, May 26 (KCNA) -- As already reported, the south Korean puppet military gangsters have carved slogans for anti-DPRK psychological warfare on walls of MP posts in the Demilitarized Zone along the Military Demarcation Line and are busy resuming the loudspeaker propaganda as part of the said warfare.\n\t\t\t\t\t The head of the north side delegation to the north-south general-level military talks Wednesday sent the following notice to the south side as regards the reckless moves of the bellicose forces of the puppet military to resume the psychological warfare against the DPRK:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently the south side frantically conducted the operation to distribute anti-DPRK leaflets despite our side's repeated warnings and, not content with this, is going reckless to resume even the said anti-DPRK broadcasting in the frontline area. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such act is nothing but a deliberate and premeditated provocation aimed to push the daily aggravating inter-Korean relations to the brink of war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south side persists in scattering leaflets and resumes even the above-said broadcasting, the Korean People's Army will be compelled to promptly take its strong counter-actions including physical actions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south side sets up even loudspeakers in the frontline area to resume the broadcasting, in particular, the KPA will take military steps to blow up one by one the moment they appear by firing sighting shots because such action will be tantamount to a blatant abrogation of the north-south military agreement and a military provocation against the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Moreover, measures will be taken to totally ban the passage of personnel and vehicles of the south side in the zone under the north-south control in the western coastal area.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet war-like forces would be well advised to act with discretion, bearing deep in mind that such measures of the KPA will not end in an empty talk."

            "content": "KCNA: Who Got Benefit from \"Cheonan Case\"\r\n Pyongyang, May 26 (KCNA) -- The United States is taking the lead in disturbing the world after the south Korean puppet authorities announced \"the results of investigation\" into the sinking of warship \"Cheonan,\" a sheer fabrication.\n\t\t\t\t\t When a certain crime occurs, it is an elementary logic in the investigation into it to look into who will benefit most from it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The warship of the south Korean navy broke into two pieces and went down to the bottom of the West Sea of Korea. It is the U.S. and its \"allies\" in the Asia-Pacific who fished in troubled waters in this case, the U.S. being the biggest beneficiary. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is universally known that the DPRK has been focusing all efforts on an all-out offensive to open the gate to a thriving nation in 2012.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the light of the common sense that development presupposes peace, the DPRK at present requires peaceful external environment more than ever before. Precisely for this reason the DPRK advanced a proposal for establishing lasting peace-keeping regime on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This being a hard fact, Americans are floating misinformation that the DPRK got the same political \"benefit\" from the above-said case as it did by \"closely rallying its ranks.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is nothing but an excessive logical jump and far-fetched assertion made by those to do harm to the DPRK. They might mistake their subjective desire for reality, obsessed by their strong desire to bring down the system in the DPRK or worked hard to cover up the stark reality in the DPRK where all efforts are concentrated on building an economic power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whoever has logic may understand well that the DPRK would get nothing by orchestrating such case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the case is quite different with the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. seems to have a complacent smile of satisfaction. It considers the case as a golden opportunity for loudly trumpeting about the \"theory of threat from north Korea\" in a bid to tighten its grip on its \"allies\" in the Asia-Pacific region, contain big powers and escalate the offensive for stifling the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a matter of fact, the Obama administration is straining the situation in a bid to beef up its forces in the region and tighten its military domination over it as evidenced by the order issued by it to its forces in south Korea to be combat ready to cope with another Korean war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the U.S. manipulation, the south Korean puppet group and the Japanese authorities openly expressed their strong displeasure with the development of the DPRK-China relations and are becoming more zealous than ever before in escalating the moves to stifle the DPRK by imploring the countries around the DPRK to recognize the hypocritical \"results of investigation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese government had been seeking a chance to deceive the people in Okinawa Prefecture under the U.S. pressure over the issue of the transfer of the U.S. forces airfield in Futenma. It willingly accepted the U.S. request, raising a hue and cry over \"security uneasiness\" allegedly created this time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This made the U.S. raise a shout of joy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The May 24th issue of the New York Times in an article described Japan's decision to transfer the U.S. forces' airfield from Futenma to the Camp Schwab coastal area, as requested by the latter, as a U.S. victory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak group of traitors has greatly benefited from the case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It made public \"investigation results\" and then the \"statement to the people\" with the \"June 2 elections to local self-governing bodies\" just around the corner, maximizing the effect of its conspiratorial farce in the elections. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has launched a wholesale political terror campaign to ensure an unchallenged domination of the Right-wing conservative group by kicking up an unprecedented atmosphere hostile to the DPRK in the south Korean society and purging pro-reunification progressive forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has completely frozen exchange and cooperation between the north and the south and brought the inter-Korean relations back to those before the publication of the June 15 joint declaration, pushing the situation on the Korean Peninsula to a war phase in a moment. By doing so the group of traitors pleased its master more than ever before and created conditions favorable for its stay in power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As seen above, the fact that American master and his south Korean servants benefited more than any others from the case of \"Cheonan\" that claimed the lives of 46 soldiers of the puppet army clearly proves that the  \"the story about the north's torpedo attack\" is nothing but a lie faked up by the U.S. and the south Korean authorities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The international community should pay attention to the fact that the \"Cheonan\" case presages the full-fledged commencement of the U.S. \"war on terrorism\" for aggression in Northeast Asia as it is the Asian version of \"September 11 incident\" cooked up by it with the south Korean puppet authorities involved in a bid to turn the politico-military environment in the Asia-Pacific region, strategic hub in the 21st century, decisively favorable to it."
