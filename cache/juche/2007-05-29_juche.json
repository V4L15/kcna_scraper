            "content": "Stubborn Struggle for Peace Called for  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- Guaranteeing durable peace on the Korean Peninsula serves as a precondition for achieving reconciliation and cooperation between the north and the south and national reunification. Rodong Sinmun Monday says this in a signed article. It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of reunification of Korea is the issue of rejoining the blood ties of the nation artificially severed by foreign forces and achieving national harmony. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whenever the danger of war increased and military tension mounted on the Korean Peninsula, this would impede the process of national reconciliation and unity and the movement for reunification and put them in the mire of ordeals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The same can be said of the undertakings for inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation and the movement for independent reunification in the June 15 era of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history and reality eloquently prove that as long as the U.S. imperialists and their followers persist in their policy of war of aggression against the DPRK, it is hardly possible to achieve peace on the Korean Peninsula nor is it possible to expect peaceful reunification and prosperity common to the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Due to the war moves of the war-like forces at home and abroad the situation still remains tense in Korea. North-targeted ceaseless joint military exercises with foreign forces and arms buildup are going on in south Korea. Their adventurous war moves going against the desire of the nation and the trend of the times have created on the peninsula so dangerous situation that a nuclear war may break out there any moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unless those moves of the war-like forces at home and abroad are frustrated, the peace of the country will be disturbed and the Koreans will suffer from a disaster of a nuclear war to be started by foreign forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The national reunification and prosperity of Korea are possible only when it has a nation and territory. The defence of peace can guarantee safety of a nation and its bright future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One should not ask others to protect one's peace. It can be defended only through a stubborn struggle against aggression and war moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun politics serves as a treasured sword of the justice and a banner of patriotism as it helps to prevent aggression and war and defend security of the nation and peace of the country, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The DPRK is defending the sovereignty of the nation with credit, delivering decisive counter blows to the high-handed interference and aggressive moves of the U.S. imperialists, depending on its mighty military force. It is thanks to Songun that the DPRK is throwing its rays as a bulwark of independence and its people are displaying their dignity all over the world. Songun is immediately the life and dignity of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Korean socialism represents a man-respecting society in which the popular masses are put up as the foundation of society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the DPRK the lines and policies of the Workers' Party of Korea and the state are drawn up in response to the demand and will of the popular masses and each production base is designed and built with the interests of the people in view. It is the principle of the WPK that a construction project, however important it may be, must not be undertaken, if it causes inconveniences to the people in their living and that all economic considerations must be cast aside, if it is beneficial to the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our socialism is the cradle of worthy human life which brings the creative talent and zeal of the people into full bloom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It opens before all the people a broad avenue of steadily developing their creative ability to suit their talent and attainment. In the DPRK everyone fully enjoys the right to learn under the most superior system of free compulsory education provided by President Kim Il Sung and fosters creative wisdom and displays it to the full in social relationship of helping and leading each other along.   \r\n\r\n\r\n"
