He chose its site and instructed the KPA to undertake the project.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was informed in detail of the progress made in the construction by commanding officers of the unit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching the gatepost of the Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Memorial Tower under construction, he underscored the need to construct it well. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Examining the design for greening the education ground, he said that it would look nice when completed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He praised the soldier-builders for the work done by them, noting that they removed frozen earth and pavement of thousands of square meters under hard conditions in winter and completed the project for creating a turf area in a short span of time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underscored the need to arrange environment such as planting trees in good season and properly establish irrigation and drainage systems.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Seeing the design for the out-door weaponry exhibition, he set forth tasks to be fulfilled to construct the new exhibition.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Commanding a bird's eye-view of the construction site, he repeatedly expressed satisfaction. He said the museum is located in a very good place and its design is done well.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching the statue \"Victory\", the main theme of the tower for a long while, he said the longer one watches it, the more splendid it looks and asked about the creator of the statue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After learning about the production of stone needed for construction and stonework, Kim Jong Un specified ways for doing it well.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t While looking round the construction site of a dock which will host the U.S. imperialist spy ship \"Pueblo\" captured by the navy of the Korean People's Army after intruding the territorial waters of the DPRK, he clarified issues arising in its construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round the main building of the Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the main lobby that will host the statue of Generalissimo Kim Il Sung, he examined the design for the main building and appreciated its good design.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Looking round the hall on the second floor and a round exhibition hall, he underlined the need to build them well in line with the appearance and nature of the museum.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said the museum serves as a base for anti-U.S. education as it equips service personnel, working people and youth and students with the Juche idea, the anti-imperialist revolutionary idea, outstanding commanding art, and military strategic tactics and war methods of President Kim Il Sung.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He called for winding up the construction of the museum before the 60th anniversary of the victorious Fatherland Liberation War so as to glorify for all ages the immortal exploits performed by Kim Il Sung for the victory of the war and the spirit of devotedly safeguarding the leader and defending the country displayed by the army and people in the 1950s.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Vice-Marshal Choe Ryong Hae, director of the KPA General Political Bureau."

They also teach the truth that the U.S. nuclear blackmail should be countered with substantial countermeasures, not with compromise or retreat.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The resolute stand of the DPRK that it will take tougher countermeasures in succession if the U.S. goes hostile to it is based on the present-day's stark situation and the historical lesson.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's substantial countermeasures based on justice and truth will continue till it wins a final victory."

This indicates that the moves for territorial expansion are being pushed forward in an organized and systematic manner by the state as they are undisguised agitation of aggression by the Japanese authorities. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan has escalated its moves to grab Tok Islets, part of the inalienable territory of Korea, in a more cunning and despicable manner year by year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In a bid to make its claim to Tok Islets a fait accompli Japan brought up the issue of Tok Islets for discussion on 126 occasions before and after its ratification of the convention of the UN Law on Sea in 1996 and the conclusion of the Japan-south Korea \"fishery agreement\" in 1998.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's scenario to grab Tok Islets was put into practice with increased zeal in the new century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries prodded the Shimane Prefectural Assembly into instituting and proclaiming the \"Day of Takeshima\" and observing it as an annual event. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan made public a decision to use textbooks in which Tok Islets are mentioned as part of its \"territory\" at all elementary schools last year for the purpose of convincing the young Japanese of its claim to the islets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently the Tokyo Metropolitan Education Committee made it clear that it would sharply increase the description about Tok Islets in the history textbook for Metropolis-run high schools from this spring. The textbook contained such new additions concerning Tok Islets, an indication of Japan's territorial ambition, as \"in the middle of the 17th century Japan established dominium on Tok Islets and its intention of such dominium was reconfirmed by the decision of the Cabinet meeting in 1905.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The only reason for Japan to claim dominium on Tok Islets is that in 1905 when the Japanese imperialists illegally occupied Korea, Shimane Prefecture issued what it called an official gazette on bringing Tok Islets under its jurisdiction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the Japanese imperialists' aggression of Korea itself was an illegal and high-handed one, Shimane Prefecture's farce of bringing Tok Islets under its jurisdiction was a grave infringement upon the territorial sovereignty of the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The disposition of the Samurais desperately making their eyes at others' territories will never change.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan should draw a proper lesson from the shameful defeat the Japanese imperialists sustained while going wild to realize territorial aggrandizement."

Now their descendents are working desperately to cover up the unprecedented sexual slavery.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Abe was born with the disposition of a philistine peculiar to island country Japan which does not make any scruple of profoundly confusing the right and the wrong to meet its own interests. Abe said that he regards it as extremely regretful that he failed to pay visits to Yasukuni Shrine during the first Abe cabinet period, stunning the world people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Question is what Japan aims in categorically denying the past crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Analysts seriously view the Japanese reactionaries' moves of whetting sharp the sword of reinvasion, an indication that they still harbor the ambition for becoming a military giant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese authorities have already decided to reexamine \"defense program guidelines\" which were adopted under the Democratic Party government in the wake of Abe's revelation of his intention to expand and reinforce troops and arms and equipment of \"Self-Defense Forces\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At a full-dress session of the House of Councilors, Abe openly disclosed his idea to revise the constitution in order to retool the \"Self-Defense Forces\" as the \"national defense forces\". He even instructed reexamining detailed kinds that would allow the exercise of the right to collective self-defense.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries' persistent and brazen-faced moves of negating the past crimes are prompted by their sordid plan to realize the old dream of \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\" and become the \"leader of Asia.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries should make sincere repentance of their dirty past crimes, clearly understanding that their moves to become military power and launch reinvasion will only invite another defeat."
