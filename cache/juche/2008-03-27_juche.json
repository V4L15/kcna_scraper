The present Japanese authorities had better draw a lesson from this and stop their reckless acts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Wednesday urges this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Of late media of Japan are working hard to build up public opinion that the Japanese government should not lift the \"sanctions against north Korea\" unless there is progress in the way of settling the nuclear issue and \"abduction issue.\" In another development, such senior officials as the chief cabinet secretary and the foreign minister are busy letting loose similar outbursts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The sanctions expected to remain in force for six months after the repeated extension since October, 2006 under the pretext of the DPRK's missile launch and nuclear test are set to expire on April 13. The story about the extension of these sanctions now afloat in this connection should never be overlooked. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's farce of extending the above-said sanctions is nothing but a reckless move to put a brake on the process of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula as it does not help settle the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is contemplating extending the sanctions against the DPRK, persistently raising a hue and cry over the \"abduction issue\" which had already found a solution as it is absolutely irrelevant to the mission and purport of the six-party talks. This only betrays Japan's political imbecility, diplomatic immaturity and ill-natured character. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan seeks to attain its sinister aim by tightening the harsh sanctions against the DPRK under the pretext of the \"abduction issue\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the ulterior intention of the Japanese reactionaries to seize the building of Chongryon and keep the embargo on the ship Mangyongbong-92 through the sanctions in a bid to physically destroy Chongryon and tear compatriots in Japan off the care of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is an inhuman criminal act quite contrary to the spirit of humanitarianism and requirements of human rights as it is a mean act of wantonly abusing the rights of Koreans in Japan and their rights to existence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's attempt to browbeat someone and fish in troubled waters through the above-said farce is nothing but a stupid ploy of the political dwarfs.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
