But, as a result of the weakening of faith in socialism among people, it failed to check anti-socialist moves of the reactionaries.\r\n   Those who have no faith cannot defend their own idea and interests= they play into the hands of others, making havoc with the revolution.\r\n   Socialism in east European countries, in essence, was not socialism which they built with their own faith and strength but an \"imported socialism\".\r\n   Because they fell short of faith and failed to maintain independence, they sided with \"reforms\" and \"restructuring\" carried out by the former soviet union, without giving thoughts to whether the trend was in their favour or not.\r\n   As seen above, if one has no faith, he will be deprived of the gains of the revolution made at the cost of blood and socialism, even if it is scores of years old, will collapse. \r\n\r\n"
