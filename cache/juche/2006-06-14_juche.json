            "content": "Dangerous Military Collusion between U.S. and Japan under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 13 (KCNA) -- The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are becoming undisguised in their moves to expand their theater of operation on a global scale, while tightening their military alliance further still.\r\n Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun in a signed article Tuesday says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States and Japan are getting overheated in strengthening military alliance and cooperation, talking glibly about the revision of \"the guideline of U.S.-Japan Defence Cooperation\". This is a move to round off the U.S.-Japan offensive system targeted against the whole of Asia including Northeast Asia and ignite a war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The relocation of their forces in Japan by the U.S. imperialists is a military step geared to a plan for a new war of aggression in Korea. In the relocation, they seek to bring into shape a unified operational command system of the U.S. and Japan in preparation for a new Korean war. For this very purpose, the decision was finalized at a recent meeting of diplomatic and military authorities of Japan and the U.S. to bring into Japan the 1st army corps command of the U.S. Army from the U.S. mainland. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are reposing big hope in Japan in starting a Korean war. In the last period the U.S. regarded Okinawa as the main base for the U.S. forces in Japan. But it is at present going to turn the whole Japanese islands into a strategic vantage and the \"most important stronghold\" for an aggressive preemptive attack. This explains why the U.S. is putting spurs to the military integration with Japan involving a strengthened military alliance with Japan, completion of a joint operational command system and joint use of military bases. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarists, on their part, intend to gratify their wild ambition for the reinvasion of Korea and the rest of Asia with the help of the U.S., their senior ally. To this end, they are beefing up their aggression forces in real earnest, while unifying the arms and the information and communication systems of the U.S. forces and the \"Self-Defence Forces,\" zealously capitalizing on the war policy of the U.S. imperialists. Now, the military collusion of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are going beyond the danger line and becoming the root cause of a renewed Cold War in Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' relocation of their forces in Japan and the moves for tightening the U.S.-Japan military collusion aimed at aggression and war pose a grave threat to the peace and security of the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Asian people should heighten vigilance and wage an intensive common struggle to frustrate those acts.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "DPRK FM Spokesman Exposes Japan's Moves to Internationalize \"Abduction Issue\" \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 13 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued a statement on June 13 as regards the fact that the Japanese authorities are driving the DPRK-Japan relations to the worst phase in history by persisting in their moves to internationalize the \"abduction issue\" already resolved between the DPRK and Japan.\r\n This year alone, in April and May, they made a big fuss, deciding to beg countries having diplomatic ties with the DPRK for official cooperation in the settlement of the issue and sending Megumi Yokota's family to the United States and south Korea for \"soliciting\" help. As if this is not enough, they are trying to take the issue to the UN Human Rights Council and G-8 summit, says the spokesman, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In trying to \"internationalize\" the \"abduction issue,\" which had been solved, by deliberately bringing it into bold relief, the Japanese authorities seek to isolate the DPRK by taking advantage of the U.S. hostile policy toward it and craftily evade its obligation to settle their past crimes by distorting the keynote of the DPRK-Japan relations as if it is the \"abduction issue.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The relations between the DPRK and Japan are, in essence, those between a victim and an assailant. Therefore, the latter ought to make due apology and compensation understandable to the victim if the bilateral relations are to be settled. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has imposed upon the Korean people immeasurable human, material and mental pain in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, Japan has not yet made any honest apology to the Korean people with a humble bow. On the contrary it has neither admitted its criminal acts nor thought of compensating for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the light of the order for the settlement of those crimes and from the moral point of view, Japan should begin with apologizing and compensating for the most hideous crimes it committed against humanity in the last century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already clarified by the DPRK more than once, the \"abduction issue\" had been completely settled thanks to its sincere efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK sent \"abductees\" and their children to Japan and provided Japan with nearly 50 hours to hear testimonies from those who experienced or witnessed some \"abductees\" died to help it confirm their death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And the DPRK has done everything possible including the handing to Japan of even the things left behind by the deceased and their remains. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In November 2004, the Japanese government, too, officially expressed thanks, manifesting its understanding of the DPRK's sincere efforts made for the settlement of the \"abduction issue\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This being a hard reality, the Japanese authorities are so cunning as to avoid making public the above-said facts at home until now. They are claiming that there exist some \"issues to be settled\" in a bid to mislead public opinion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are working hard to abuse the above-said issue for the realization of their political strategy from A to Z. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By internationalizing the issue they seek to isolate the DPRK and get their \"leadership ability\" estimated at home and instill a new \"view on the state\" based on ultra-nationalism into Japanese and thus justify their policy of militarization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities would be well advised to ponder over the serious impact the current situation will have on the overall relations between the DPRK and Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter how hard they may peddle the \"abduction issue\" in a bid to hide the crimes committed against all the Koreans, our people will blame Japan for all its past crimes and force it to pay for them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n"

Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 13 (KCNA) -- The pro-U.S. conservative forces including the \"Grand National Party\" in south Korea are a stumbling block in the implementation of the June 15 joint declaration.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Tuesday in a signed article says this, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation has drawn a lesson from the past 6 years since the adoption of the joint declaration that it is impossible to successfully implement the June 15 joint declaration as long as the pro-U.S. conservative forces remain within the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The pro-U.S. conservative forces including the GNP have persistently denied the June 15 joint declaration, a milestone of reunification common to the Korean nation, and stood in the way of its implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is none other than the GNP gentries who refused to be a member of a Pyongyang-visiting group, discontented with the publication of the April 8 agreement on the historic Pyongyang summit. They are blocking the way of national reunification, depending on the U.S., not on the Korean nation itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP and other pro-American conservative forces have desperately tried to turn the June 15 era of reunification back to the past era of confrontation, swimming against the trend of national history toward the implementation of the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They forced the authorities to republish the white paper on defence which specifies the \"theory on principal enemy\", openly describing the fellow countrymen as an \"anti-state organization\", an \"object to be overthrown\", openly declared fellow countrymen \"principal enemy\" in a \"policy statement\" and burnt a flag of the DPRK, a dignified symbol of our people, to incite confrontation with fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is obvious that the GNP forces, which totally denied the June 15 joint declaration, will never allow inter-Korean economic cooperation to progress smooth. They were trying to bar inter-Korean cooperation, describing it as \"drain on resources\" and \"payment of tributes\" and checked the provision of humanitarian aid materials, blaring that they may be used for military purpose and strengthen the system in the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They were desperately keen on blocking inter-Korean economic cooperation by means of \"special inspection\" under the pretext of \"suspicion of remittance to the north\". Their reckless acts prove that they are traitors to the Korean nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
