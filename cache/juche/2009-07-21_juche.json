The main obstacle to ensuring peace in the peninsula is the U.S. troops stationed in south Korea, he pointed out.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe held that the U.S. forces should be withdrawn from south Korea in order to realize the peaceful reunification of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBanou Keita, chairman of the Guinea-Korea Friendship Association, in his statement on July 11 referred to the fact that the U.S. launched the most barbaric and destructive war of aggression on the DPRK on June 25, 1950, in a purpose to realize its domination over the whole of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. instigated the United Nations Security Council to adopt a \"resolution on sanctions\" against the DPRK over its second nuclear test in another attempt to stifle the Korean people, he said, demanding that the rulers of the U.S. not forget the lesson of history."

Then he pointed his finger at a place in front of the hospital and instructed officials that the area should be built up as a park.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Officials gave a dubious look.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As for the place, it was planned to construct important buildings there and the ground-making project made a fair progress.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Entering into their feelings, he said to the following effect: As our people feel shy much as yet, husbands would not present bouquets to their wives before the eyes of others. A thickly-wooded park, therefore, should be laid out so that they may enjoy happy time, husbands giving bunches of flowers to their wives and holding newborn babies in arms out of sight.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSo, the park of love, which even young couples had not an idea of, came into being in front of the hospital."
