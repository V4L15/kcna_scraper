Lurking behind its moves is a sinister aim to retain its grip on south Korea under the pretext of \"security commitment\", fan up war phobia among south Koreans, block the process of confidence building between the north and the south, deter Koreans from building the structure of their confrontation with the U.S. at any cost and create conditions for a preemptive attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration seeks to monopolize the arms market in south Korea in a bid to win support from the U.S. munitions monopolies in the presidential election. The US relocation of its forces in south Korea is rendering the situation on the Korean peninsula and in the rest of Northeast Asia more complicated and seriously threatening and disturbing peace, security and stability there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. troops, the main source of war and aggression, should not be relocated in south Korea but be withdrawn from it.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

All of them serve as encyclopedic ones as they give perfect answers to new questions arising in accomplishing the socialist cause in the present times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun idea and Songun revolutionary line serve as a main source that helped the DPRK stand as an invulnerable socialist fortress and remain a single-heartedly united country despite  any political, military, ideological and cultural offensive and psychological warfare of the U.S. imperialists and bring about precious successes and remarkable changes in the revolutionary onward march to build a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The greatness of his leadership also finds a clear manifestation in the fact that he has consolidated the unity of the Party and the revolutionary ranks as an unbreakable one with the People's Army as a model, unrolled a plan for building a great prosperous powerful nation and has wisely led the drive to implement it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As long as there is Kim Jong Il's Songun leadership Korean style socialism is sure to always triumph and fully demonstrate its validity and invincible might.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman on Six-way Talks \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 29 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK today gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA as regards the six-way talks held in Beijing:\r\n The six-way talks on the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. took place in Beijing from February 25 to 28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We attended the talks with expectation that a frank discussion on ways of seeking a solution to the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. would open a certain prospect of settling the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hence, we showed greatest magnanimity, clarifying its transparent will to scrap its nuclear program according to a proposal for a simultaneous package solution aimed to denuclearize the Korean peninsula and advancing fair and flexible proposals for implementing measures for the first-phase actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n China, Russia and other participants in the talks, therefore, expressed support and understanding of our reasonable proposal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. again insisted on its old assertion about the DPRK's abandoning its nuclear program first, saying that it can discuss the DPRK's concerns only when it completely scraps its nuclear program in a verifiable and irreversible manner. This threw a big hurdle in the way of the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also absurdly asserted that it can not normalize relations with the DPRK unless missile, conventional weapons, biological and chemical weapons, human rights and other issues are settled even after its abandonment of all its nuclear programs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The attitude of the U.S. side towards the talks increased our disappointment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. side unhesitatingly said that it was not willing to negotiate with the DPRK, far from showing any sincere intention to settle the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The head of its delegation only read the prepared script without stammering and showed no sincerity, giving no answer even to the questions raised. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. did not show any stand to co-exist with the DPRK in peace as it did during the six-way talks held  in August last year but once again disclosed its ulterior aim to persistently pursue its policy of isolating and stifling the DPRK, wasting time behind the scene of the dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seems to calculate that the DPRK will collapse of its own accord if it wastes time, putting pressure upon the DPRK undergoing economic difficulties. This is little short of a behavior of a bat-blind person who knows nothing of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The socialist system of Korean style which is guided by the Juche idea and where the entire army and all the people are single-heartedly united, true to the Songun politics, will never shake in any tempest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seems to waste time in a bid to attain its political purpose but any delay in the solution of the nuclear issue would cause nothing unfavorable to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This would give us time to take all necessary measures with an increased pace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any further six-way talks will not prove helpful to the solution of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. unless the U.S. shows its will to make a switchover in its policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In spite of this situation we consented to the time to open the next round of the six-way talks and to the issue of organizing a working group proceeding from the sincere and patient stand to seek a negotiated peaceful solution of the nuclear issue at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is difficult to expect that any further talks would help find a solution to the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The settlement of the nuclear issue will entirely depend on the change in the U.S. attitude.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The DPRK will react to Japan's move with the toughest countermeasure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's adoption of this legislation would ban the entry of the DPRK's ships at Japanese ports. This would mean sanctions and pressure upon the DPRK much stronger than \"the amendment to the law on foreign exchange\" which can only ban remittance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an ulterior aim sought by the Japanese reactionaries to escalate hostile policy toward the DPRK and bring down the socialist system in the DPRK, pursuant to the U.S. imperialists' offensive to tighten the economic sanctions against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' noisy call for economic sanctions against the DPRK is only touching off bitterer hatred and resentment of Koreans at Japan.

This barbarism clearly proves that the present US administration is the most inhuman regime in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the right to life and existence are considered to be an urgent issue in terms of human rights, how should one interpret the U.S. action of brutally killing people and putting up the signboard of \"defence of human rights\" after forcing a sea of blood upon civilians ?\r\n If a trial is to be staged to judge human rights abuses, the U.S., an extra large group of human rights violators, should sit in the dock. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The trite rigmarole about human rights spelled out by the U.S., the arch perpetrator of massacre and the worst violator of the right to existence, can frighten nobody but only betrays its shamelessness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We can not but disclose the ulterior aim sought by the U.S. in kicking up the anti-DRPK human rights racket. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@The U.S. pulled up the DPRK over the human rights issue at a time when it is resorting to the blockade against us under the pretext of the fictitious \"enriched uranium program.\" This is intended to impair our image by adding the human rights issue to the nuclear issue and isolate and stifle us internationally. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is seriously mistaken. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The harder the U.S. works to bring about what it called \"regime change\" or \"a collapse of the system\", the stronger our army and people will become in their will to resolutely defend their benevolent socialist system which protects and looks after their destiny.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
