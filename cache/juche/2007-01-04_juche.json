The cause of independence of the popular masses has run into mounting troubles due to the blatant challenge of the imperialist forces. The prevailing situation calls for a more dauntless struggle against imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present era is an exciting era of Songun. It is an era in which the destiny of the country and the nation and the destiny of the cause of independence of the popular masses mainly depend upon the military might, the might of arms, an era in which the danger of war is averted and a durable peace is achieved with arms. This era of Songun is a new, higher stage in the accomplishment of the human cause of independence. \r\n The victory in the struggle for independence lies in unity. Unity based on independence is the source of invincibility and the key to victory. The idea of independence is sure to be brought to victory by the struggle of the united people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Socialism is the ideal and future of humankind. Only socialism can guarantee the realization of the independence of the popular masses and the building of an independent, peaceful and friendly new world. The aspiration of humankind for independence and socialism and the orientation of the development of history toward them never change. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Inexhaustible is the strength of the people desirous of independence and, accordingly, no force on earth can block their struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The struggle of the people for independence will gather strength and develop as the days go by and the imperialist and dominationist forces are fated to suffer destruction. \r\n The Workers' Party of Korea and the people of the DPRK this year, too, will positively contribute to the victorious advance of the cause of independence and the cause of socialism of the popular masses under the uplifted banner of independence.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
