This agitation conducted by them at production and construction sites inspires working people to the drive to glorify this year as a year of fresh leap and overall revival. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Dear general, where are you?\", the enduring song of comradeship, was very popular in the 20th century and will remain a favourite song in the 21st century. This song has instilled strong worship and reverence for the leader and intense loyalty into the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The song fully reflects absolute trust in the leader and firm confidence of victory in the revolution. It truthfully represents comradeship displayed by Korean revolutionaries with the faith that they should honour the pledge once made without vacillation or hesitation despite trials and difficulties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also deals with noble comradely trust, love and sense of obligation between the leader and soldiers who share their destiny on the road of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The song was sung more loudly when the country was beset with stern tempest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A woman soldier of the Korean People's Army sang the song reflecting her burning determination to reach the supreme headquarters come what may while covering thousands of miles to escort wounded soldiers through forests behind the enemy lines in the period of the Fatherland Liberation War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Her singing encouraged the faltering soldiers to rise up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was this song that inspired the people in Jagang Province to launch before others a march to bring about prosperity even under the difficult conditions where they are hard pressed for everything. It also inspired young people to build the over 40 km-long youth hero motorway with empty hands and KPA servicemen to hold arms more tightly to devotedly protect the leader and take charge of both the defence of the country and socialist construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are now advancing confidently to achieve higher aims, considering the song as an ideological and mental pabulum in the revolutionary struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The song \"dear general, where are you?\" is resounding through the country as a song of confidence.    \r\n\r\n"
