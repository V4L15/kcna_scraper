            "content": "KCNA on DPRK's Stand to React to Japan's Blockade and Sanctions with Toughest Stand\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 28 (KCNA) -- Japan is reportedly considering examining and adopting the bill on \"economic sanctions against north Korea\" at a regular Diet session while talking about tightening control over export and import, part of its measure for economic blockade against the DPRK.\r\n This is a disturbing development as it may lay a stumbling block in the way of a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue, harass peace and security on the Korean peninsula and escalate the military tension in the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are now set to prevent the DPRK from having trade with other countries and stifle it economically in wanton violation of the UN Charter and international law which provide for economic progress and normal business transactions of sovereign states. This goes to clearly prove that their moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK have reached their height. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Richard Perl, a policy maker for the U.S. war against Iraq who is now working at an advisory body in the U.S. Defense Department, and a former special adviser to President Bush co-authored a book in which they called for taking comprehensive aerial and sea blockade against north Korea and taking decisive measures beginning with blocking all its sea routes and international air routes and preventing its business transaction with south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters here is that the Japanese reactionaries are acting a shock brigade in implementing this strategy for blockade and sanctions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have constantly applied all forms of economic sanctions against the DPRK as evidenced by the prevention of remittance to north Korea and the voyage of Mangyongbong-92 in the past. They are now attempting to fully legislate on the \"economic sanctions against north Korea\" at a regular Diet session from the outset of the year. This can not but be a green light to their all-out offensive to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even Tokyo Metropolitan Governor Ishihara at a recent annual meeting of the World Economic Forum asserted that the Japanese government should impose economic sanctions upon north Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a blatant perfidy to the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration which calls for liquidating the unhappy history of relations between the DPRK and Japan and establishing fruitful political, economic and cultural relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world progressives want Japan to drop its hostile policy toward the DPRK and clarify its willingness to fully redeem huge damage and pain it brought to the Koreans in the basic spirit of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration and thus put an end to their hostile relations this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But Japan is challenging this call of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Sanctions and blockade are never all-cure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will react to the Japanese reactionaries' blockade and sanctions with the toughest stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries should not act rashly, clearly mindful that blockade and sanctions against the DPRK will only precipitate its own self-destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This international situation calls upon the UN to positively discuss and settle the human rights abuses committed by Japan before its foundation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is, first of all, because Japan's forcible drafting and crimes related to \"comfort women\" for the imperial Japanese army in the past were crimes against humanity as they were in breach of Paragraph C of Article 6 of the rules of the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal and Article 5 of the rules of the Tokyo International Far East Tribunal. Japan. Those crimes, therefore, can never escape the UN discussion. They should be taken up by the U.N. in the light of the statutory limitations under international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The convention on the non-applicability of statutory limitations to war crimes and crimes against humankind, which was adopted at the UN General Assembly session on November 26, 1968, clearly stipulates that those limitations shall not be applied to crimes against humanity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Paragraph A of Article 17 of \"Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance\" which was adopted at the UN General Assembly session on December 18, 1992 stipulates that acts constituting enforced disappearance shall be considered as a continuing offence as long as the perpetrators continue to conceal the fate and the whereabouts of persons who have disappeared and these facts remain unclarified. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government is very uncooperative in confirming the forcible drafting committed by the Japanese imperialists in the past and fate and whereabouts of the victims. This should be considered as a continuing offence and, accordingly, relevant organizations of the UN should continue to discuss and settle Japan's forcible drafting and crimes related to the \"comfort women\" for the imperial Japanese army in the past till the day when the fate and whereabouts of those missing are confirmed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's hideous human rights abuses including the forcible drafting in the past are crimes to be discussed and settled at the UN for their criminal nature, content, gravity and durability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The UN should take practical measures to immediately deal with and settle Japan's human rights abuses committed before its foundation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
