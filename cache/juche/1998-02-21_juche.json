No. 3 project for flow-control is nearing completion.\r\n   Officers and soldiers from Kim Hi Yun's Unit have carried out the underwater ground excavation in the severe cold last year. A great deal of work including the dam concrete tamping has been brought to completion in less than one year except the installing of generating facilities.\r\n   Kim In Gol's and Pak Kwang Ryop's units have built production units to make tools needed for tunnelling. They operated drilling and other machines at full capacity to finish the intake tunnel project on time.\r\n   With the beginning of the new year the soldiers are registering spectacular achievements in their work. Kim Song Dae's Unit set an all-time record in tunnelling in their New Year campaign.\r\n  The soldiers who are undertaking no. 4 Flow-Control Project made the best use of production potentials and introduced technical innovation proposals to save a lot of work force and materials while carrying out concrete tamping each day, that is a two-fold increase compared with a day's work last year.\r\n   Yang In Guk's and other units are concentrating all their efforts and means on their projects with a view to completing the overall project as soon as possible.    \r\n  \r\n"

It is also manipulating the IMF behind the scene.\r\n   Flattery and mendicant diplomacy cannot save the puppets from the destruction at all. The U.S. will make the puppets more dependent upon it than before by taking advantage of the crisis. The lot of the puppets bereft of the Juche character and national character will be more miserable.    \r\n\r\n"
