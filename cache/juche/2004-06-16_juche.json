            "content": "KCNA Refutes U.S. Call for DPRK's CVID \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 15 (KCNA) -- The international community is getting ever more critical of the U.S. arrogant and high-handed attitude with regard to the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S.\r\n A radio of Russia in a commentator's article on June 3 said the U.S. unreasonable approach to the nuclear issue between it and the DPRK is only complicating the situation on the Korean peninsula as it baffles the 6-way talks and infinitely prolongs the discussion on the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a just and appropriate comment that no body can deny. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The acute phase of confrontation over the nuclear issue today is due entirely to the fact that  the Bush administration is refusing a peaceful and fair solution to the issue by coming out with \"complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement\" (CVID), that is, \"scrapping the nuclear program first\" on the part of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. demand that the DPRK should abandon its nuclear program first is, in essence, a brigandish claim to totally destroy even the latter's nuclear program for peaceful purposes and disarm it and, eventually, override it as it did Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has built up its nuclear deterrent in face of the U.S. escalated nuclear war threat. It would mean surrender if the DPRK accepted disarmament by scrapping its nuclear program first when the U.S. is intensifying its moves to stifle the former without the slightest intention to abandon its hostile policy. An independent sovereignty state, the DPRK in particular, can never allow this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the immovable stand of the DPRK that all the issues with the U.S. must be solved on the principle of simultaneous actions and it must be thoroughly prepared both for confrontation and dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has conceived the fiction of the DPRK's \"enriched uranium,\" which has met with a rebuff, in an effort to justify its call for scrapping the nuclear program first on the part of the DPRK, and thus reduced the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework to a dead letter. And now it is spreading even rumors of \"secret sale of uranium hexafluoride.\" But this only brings the weakness of the Bush administration, a group of tricksters, into a bolder relief. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs of China Zhou Wenzhong on June 8 said: \"We know nothing about the uranium program. We do not know whether it exists. So far the United States has not presented convincing evidence of this program.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Facts clearly prove that the main obstacle in the way of the settlement of the DPRK-U.S. nuclear issue is the persistent call of the Bush administration for CVID. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seems to be intending to while away the time, flying the flag of CVID, an offspring of its diehard hostile policy against the DPRK, which stands no chance of realization. But time is not favorable only to the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn the meantime, the DPRK will promote all necessary countermeasures with increasing vigor.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

S. forces in south Korea..\r\n The statement says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Toward the end of April marks indicating the storage of chemical weapons were found in a powder magazine of the guards belonging to the \"U.N. Forces Command\" controlling the demilitarized zone in Panmunjom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Attached to the powder magazine were three marks designated in the U.S. forces' regulations on explosive materials. The second mark among them demanded the wearing of overalls for protecting the whole body from toxic chemicals and the third one banned contact with water indicating that there were chemical weapons antipathetic to water. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The weapons applicable to the yellow protective overalls are all weapons banned under the international convention signed by the U.S. and they are extremely dangerous weapons which were proclaimed to be banned by the U.S. forces themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is none other than the United States which is developing, producing, deploying and proliferating the biggest amount of mass destruction weapons in the world while gravely threatening the destiny of humankind, brandishing them as main means of pursuing its policy of strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U. S. is the first target of denunciation in the matter of mass destruction weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north, the south and overseas bitterly denounce the United States for its storage of quite dangerous mass destruction weapons and its war preparations, branding this as moves to destroy the Korean nation and a prelude to a war of genocide threatening the existence of humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that if the U.S. ignited a new war on the Korean peninsula, it would use not only nuclear weapons but also biochemical weapons against the Korean nation. The Korean nation has the legitimate right to resort to any means and deterrent to defend the nation's right to existence in face of the grave moves of aggression of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the unshakable will and staunch stand of the People's Army and people of the DPRK to decisively counter the U.S. nuclear threat with strong nuclear deterrent and its biochemical weapons with retaliatory means of unlimited capability to bring them under control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States should stop acting without discretion, looking its adversary in the face, and withdraw its nuclear weapons and biochemical weapons from south Korea without delay, the spokesman says.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 15 (KCNA) -- Papers Tuesday dedicate editorials to the fourth anniversary of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration.\r\n Rodong Sinmun says that the Pyongyang meeting and the adoption of the joint declaration, the first of its kind in the history of national division spanning more than half a century, marked great events in the history of the nation as they instilled into the 70 million Koreans hope and conviction of independent reunification and made the whole of Korea seethe with the joy at those events for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation is faced with weighty tasks to check the moves of outsiders and anti-reunification forces, protect the sovereignty of the nation and peace of the country and firmly uphold and implement the historic north-south joint declaration so as to open a decisive phase for independent reunification, it notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea of \"By our nation itself\" and the spirit of national independence are the keynote of the Pyongyang meeting and the joint declaration. The joint declaration invariably serves as a landmark for national reunification and an immortal programme of independent reunification as it calls for solving the issue of the country's reunification independently by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation responsible for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National cooperation means patriotism and cooperation with outsiders treachery and division. National cooperation alone makes it possible to force the U.S. forces to withdraw from south Korea and successfully implement the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Most ardent patriotism can be manifested in the struggle for national reunification at present.  Those who remain indifferent to or a passive onlooker to the struggle for national reunification will be condemned by the nation for all ages. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north and the south and overseas should positively support and uphold the great Songun politics which protects the destiny and future of the nation and guarantees the implementation of the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should not read the outsiders' faces but adhere to the principle of independence as regards the issue of reunification. Toeing the foreign line means violation of the joint declaration and challenge to the desire of all the Koreans for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to give momentum to reconciliation and cooperation between the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Stance and attitude toward the joint declaration and national cooperation based on our-nation first spirit are a touchstone distinguishing between patriotism and treachery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson in an editorial says victory is certain for the Korean nation as it has the great Songun politics, strong will to live independently and the joint declaration, a landmark for unity and reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Forces Command\" controlling the demilitarized zone in Panmunjom toward the end of April, according to the June, 2004, issue of the south Korean magazine \"Mal\".\r\n  This clearly proves that chemical weapons are actually stored at a powder magazine of the U.S. guards in the DMZ and testifies irrefutably that they are going to start a biochemical war against the DPRK with them concealed from the public eyes, says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary. It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The biochemical weapons are \"weapons of devils\" whose production, introduction and possession are banned worldwide as they are mass destruction weapons against humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is now staging a farce like a thief crying \"Stop thief!\" while trying to build up public opinion about others \"mass destruction weapons.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAnd it is not difficult to see its ulterior intention. It is evidently a criminal scheme to aggravate its relations with the DPRK and stifle the latter by mobilizing all the nuclear and chemical weapons available. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is seeking to unleash the second Korean war under the pretext of the nuclear issue just as it started the Iraqi war under the excuse of \"mass destruction weapons\" and even use biochemical weapons along with nuclear arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is the criminal that must be condemned over the matter of the mass destruction weapons and it is the very criminal that must be put in the dock for its anti-human act in plotting a biochemical war. The U.S. scheme of biochemical war can never be pardoned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Neither the nuclear weapons nor the biochemical weapons of the U.S. can work in the DPRK where the all-powerful banner of Songun is flying. The United States should shake off its war fever and approach the situation with cool judgment and reason and   pull out of south Korea without delay with its mass destruction weapons and aggression forces.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
