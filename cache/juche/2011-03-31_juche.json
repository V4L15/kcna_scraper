            "content": "NDC Inspection Group Spokesman Re-clarifies Principled Stand of DPRK\r\n Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the inspection group of the DPRK National Defence Commission issued the following statement on Thursday:\n\t\t\t\t\t One year has passed since warship \"Cheonan\" sank in the waters off Paekryong Island in the West Sea of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the south Korean authorities and military warmongers, hell-bent on the inter-Korean stand-off and steeped in distrust in compatriots,  are still linking the warship \"Cheonan\" sinking case with the DPRK and passing  the buck for the Yonphyong Island shelling on it, escalating confrontation with it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The inspection group of the NDC of the DPRK has already opened to the public the truth of the two cases twice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the outset of the occurrence of the \"Cheonan\" warship sinking case, the DPRK expressed regret at those who suffered the disaster from the viewpoint that they are members of the Korean nation though they were soldiers of the south Korean army who leveled guns at the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the south Korean authorities and military warmongers floated investigation results without any scientific ground and objective nature in a bid to deliberately lay obstacles in the way of achieving national reconciliation and unity and block the way of achieving peace and prosperity desired by all the fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They have become evermore sinister and brazenfaced in their reckless anti-DPRK confrontation rackets with the first anniversary of the occurrence of the case as a momentum, in particular, only to touch off burning resentment of all the Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This situation compelled the inspection group of the NDC of the DPRK to re-clarify its principled stand internally and externally.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. The south Korean authorities and military warmongers should no longer perpetrate such reckless act as linking the \"Cheonan\" warship sinking case with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Explicitly speaking once again, the DPRK has nothing to do with the case. This means something irrelevant to it can never be anything in which it is allegedly involved no matter how much water may flow under the bridge.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Any attempt to deliberately link the DPRK with the case while shunning this stark reality would only serve as a living testimony that they are only seeking to escalate confrontation with fellow countrymen and deteriorate inter-Korean relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean side walked out of the venue of the preliminary contact for opening the north-south high-level military talks without any patience. But it falsified the fact, claiming that the north was the first to walk out of the venue. They should stop such folly at an early date and no longer link the DPRK with the above-said case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The further they bedevil inter-Korean relations while spreading the \"story about the north's involvement\" full of lies and fabrications, the deeper pitfall of history they will find themselves.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The inspection group of the NDC will probe the truth about the \"farce\" by issuing the third and fourth statements till the above-said story has disappeared. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. They should no longer work hard to pass the buck for the Yonphyong Island shelling on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tExplicitly speaking, the above-said shelling incident was an unsavory case which occurred as they preempted a provocation against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Had they not preempted firing shells into the inviolable territorial waters of the DPRK, there would not have occurred the shelling on the island.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Various forms of firing exercises and drills targeted against the DPRK have frequently taken place in the areas of south Korea and waters around it for more than six decades since the division of the country. But the army of the DPRK has not taken any physical counteraction against them even once.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Any attempt to conceal the criminal preemptive shelling and shift the responsibility for it onto the other is an act of deceiving not only themselves but all the fellow countrymen and an anti-peace act little short of pulling the wool over the eyes of the whole world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If they do not want to suffer the same disgrace as they did through the Yonphyong Island shelling incident, they should broad-mindedly halt such shameless act as shifting their blame onto the other and have a proper attitude to settle the issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their oft-repeated talk about someone's responsibility for the Yonphyong Island shelling would only harden the DPRK's determination to protect the fair and aboveboard extension of the Military Demarcation Line in the West Sea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 3. The present south Korean authorities and military warmongers should stop the reckless anti-DPRK hysteria under the pretence of the two cases. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey are resorting to anti-DPRK confrontation rackets and reckless psychological warfare, anxiously waiting for \"contingency\" of someone to occur, and staging various forms of military exercises and drills, stoking a war atmosphere. But they should bear in mind that their much anticipated \"contingency\" is bound to take place in the south, not in the north.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their anti-DPRK confrontation hysteria kicked up by them under the pretexts of the two cases is as foolish an act as shaking fist in the back lane after being hit hard in a street. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is nothing but a thoughtless and traitorous action to calm down the distrust in the two cases shown by different circles of south Korea, settle the ever-growing \"discord\" in the south, adhere to the nonsensical \"theory of principle\" in dealing with the inter-Korean relations and stick to the wrong hard-line policy towards the north. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The inspection group of the National Defence Commission regards their anti-DPRK confrontation campaign being staged on the lapse of one year since the occurrence of the warship \"Cheonan\" sinking case as no more than a farce of \"counting the age of a dead child\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK wishes more ardently than anyone else to see the tension defused on the Korean Peninsula and achieve peace through the improved relations between the north and the south and this process leading to peace and prosperity of Northeast Asia and the rest of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Precisely for this reason the DPRK proposed on its own initiative comprehensive dialogue and negotiations and has made every possible effort of goodwill to put them into practice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality indicates that the nation is standing at the crossroads of detente and increased tension and peace and prosperity and war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the stand of the Korean People's Army to have bold dialogue or fight a real war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present south Korean authorities and puppet military warmongers should properly understand that they are standing on the crossroads of dialogue and war."

Las actuales autoridades y los belicistas de la capa militar del Sur de Corea deben dejarse de la locura de vincular el caso de \"Cheonan\" con la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tVolvemos a poner en claro que no tenemos nada que ver con el caso de \"Cheonan\". Este hecho sera invariable aunque pase mucho tiempo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi ellos dan espaldas a esa realidad y vinculan el caso de \"Cheonan\" con nuestra parte, esto sera la prueba de sus pretensiones de enfrentarse con la connacional RPDC y empeorar las relaciones con ella. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el contacto previo para las conversaciones militares de alto nivel Norte-Sur, la parte Sur se retiro primero sin saber controlarse y distorsiono luego la verdad como si la contraparte hubiera hecho esa accion grosera. La parte Sur debe separarse cuanto antes de tal cinismo y dejar de vincular el incidente con nuestra parte. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCada vez que ellos empeoren las relaciones entre ambas partes coreanas difundiendo el rumor erroneo de que \"el Norte esta relacionado con el caso de ´Cheonan´\", se aproximaran mas al basurero de la historia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl grupo de inspeccion del CDN de la RPDC aclarara hasta el final el secreto del complot dando a la publicidad la tercera y cuarta actas de revelacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Las actuales autoridades y los belicistas de la capa militar del Sur de Corea no deben intentar imputar por mas tiempo a la parte Norte la responsabilidad del canonazo en la isla Yonphyong. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEvidentemente dicho, este caso es el otro ignominioso causado por las primeras provocaciones de ellos contra la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi no hubiera el primer fuego hacia las sagradas aguas jurisdiccionales de nuestra parte, no se habria desatado la batalla de la isla Yonphyong. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA mas de 60 anos de la division territorial del pais, en el suelo surcoreano y en la zona maritima de su contorno se desarrollaron a menudo los ejercicios de golpe con fuego real contra la RPDC, pero nuestro ejercito nunca habia respondido fisicamente. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImputar a la contraparte su responsabilidad de haber abierto primero el fuego deviene un acto antinacional y antipaz que engana a si mismos, a toda la nacion y a todo el mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi no desean repetir la afrenta sufrida en la batalla de la isla Yonphyong, deben abandonar con audacia el cinismo de imputar a otro su responsabilidad y tomar la posicion correcta para resolver el problema. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras ellos hablen de la responsabilidad de alguien por el canonazo en la isla Yonphyong, se tornara cada vez mas firme la decision de nuestra parte de mantener la justa linea de demarcacion militar en el Mar Oeste. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Las actuales autoridades y los belicistas de la capa militar del Sur de Corea han de parar su demencial campana anti-RPDC que lanzan pretextando los dos incidentes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ellos deben tener bien presente que la \"situacion de emergencia\", que esperan con ansia, no se dara en el Norte sino en el Sur de Corea si recurren mas al enfrentamiento y a la guerra psicologica contra la RPDC y fomentan el clima de guerra con ejercicios militares de toda indole.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Sus alborotos conflictivos con la RPDC justificados con dos incidentes dan lo mismo que una estupidez de recibir golpes de cara en cara y esgrimir punetazos en un callejon sin que lo vea su rival.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Igualmente, devienen la descabellada accion vendepatria encaminada a atenuar las sospechas de distintos sectores del Sur de Corea sobre los dos incidentes, remediar las cada dia mas graves \"discrepancias sur-sur\" y defender su erronea politica intransigente sobre el Norte manteniendo la \"teoria de principios\" hipocritas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El grupo de inspeccion del CDN considera como \"contar la edad de un nino muerto\" la irracional campana de confrontacion contra la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea que libran las actuales autoridades y los belicistas de la capa militar del Sur de Corea con motivo del primer aniversario del incidente de \"Cheonan\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Deseamos mas que nadie que se alivie la tension de la Peninsula Coreana y se logre la paz a traves del mejoramiento de las relaciones intercoreanas, de modo que ellas den lugar a la paz y la prosperidad del Nordeste Asiatico y el resto del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por esta razon, hemos propuesto con iniciativa el proyecto de dialogo total y negociaciones y realizamos todos los esfuerzos de buena fe por ponerlo en practica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La realidad demuestra que ambas partes estan en estas encrucijadas: el alivio de tension o agravacion de ella y la paz y prosperidad o la guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El Ejercito Popular de Corea se mantiene en la posicion de dialogar ampliamente si la contraparte lo acepta y hacer una guerra de verdad si el rival la quiere.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Las actuales autoridades y los belicistas de la capa militar titere del Sur de Corea deben saber que les toca escoger una variante de esa disyuntiva."
