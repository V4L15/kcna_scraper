It was a historic event that realised the centuries-old desire of Koreans in Japan to live a worthy life under the care of the homeland. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Thanks to his idea of the Juche-based movement of overseas compatriots and superb leadership the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea took a step to welcome Koreans in Japan home any time and provide them with living conditions, through a statement of the foreign minister issued in December Juche 44 (1955) and cabinet order no. 53 of the DPRK made public in June 1956. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK Red Cross Society and its Japanese counterpart signed an \"agreement on the repatriation of Koreans in Japan\" in Calcutta of India on August 13, 1959. The return home of Korean nationals in Japan thus came true. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The first ship carrying returnees to the socialist homeland left Niigata port, Japan, on December 14, 1959, and arrived at Chongjin port on December 16, 1959. More than 100,000 Koreans have since returned home in 187 batches over the past 40 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They were given a worthy life and happiness in the homeland. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Ko Kun Yong presented a bunch of flowers to the great leader upon the arrival in the homeland aboard the first repatriation ship. He has worked as chief of the chair of the physics department of Kim Il Sung University after graduating from the university. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Kwiguk Dong, who was born aboard second repatriation ship, is a party worker in Songchongang district, Hamhung city, South Hamgyong Province. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The great leader dropped in at newly-married Ri Yong Am's family to show paternal love for it and tell him to study hard. After graduating from Kim Chaek University of Technology ri has become a labor hero, academician, professor and doctor. A musician of the Mansudae Art Troupe Jang Jae Ok became a member of the Worker's Party of Korea and a People's Artiste thanks to the deep political trust of the respected Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Among the returnees who devotedly work for the country, people, society and the collective are Kim Il Sung Order winners, including Jang Chol, a two-time winner of Kim Il Sung Order, labor hero and vice-chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly, and winners of Kim Il Sung Prize, Kim Il Sung Youth Honor Prize and those who had an honor of being given citations of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, their autographic letters and thanks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Chief engineer of the March 4 Factory Ju Chang Hoe and at least 100 returnees have been elected deputies to the Supreme People's Assembly and those to power bodies at all levels to work as faithful servants of the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Choe Hyon Thae, Jong Sil and nearly 40 returnees have been awarded titles of hero and heroine for their distinguished services for the country and people. About 40,000 returnees have been honored with high state commendations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Among the returnees who graduated from universities under the free compulsory schooling in the socialist homeland are more than 30,000 persons with academic degrees or titles, technicians and experts including academicians, professors, doctors and masters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Ku Pon Thae, vice-Minister of Foreign Trade, Kim Tong Sun, vice department director of the Pyongyang city party committee, and at least 2,000 other returnees are working  at party and power organs and working people's organizations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Some 7,000 returnees are working at scientific, educational and public health institutions and some 1,000 returnees in the fields of physical culture and sports, culture and arts. And hundreds of returnees are active at industrial establishments and on cooperative farms as leading officials. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At least a hundred returnees have been awarded various titles of honor such as people's scientist, people's sportsman, people's artist. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The ardent patriotism and noble dedication displayed by the returnees from Japan are recorded in the shining history of our people who demonstrated the might of Juche Korea to the world, over the last 40 years. \r\n\r\n"

It is a groundless line which ignores the right of 12 mile territorial waters and even the elementary requirement of the international law on the principle of equidistant from islets off the coast of each side. It is, indeed, a totally illegal and brigandish line unilaterally set by the U.S. forces side in the territorial waters of the DPRK in breach of the Korean Armistice Agreement and the international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As the illegality of the \"Northern Limit Line\" has been clearly confirmed, the U.S. and the South Korean authorities should withdraw at once this brigandish line which is gravely encroaching upon the sovereignty and territorial waters of the DPRK and escalating the inter-Korean confrontation and the danger of war against the DPRK. \r\n\r\n"

What merits particular attention is  that regional integration which has been stepped up mostly in the economic field such as formation of a single market and shaping of a common economic policy, etc. has now reached a high level involving political, economic and military fields. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Meanwhile, Japan has become so crafty as to take advantage of the international trend towards multi-polarization. It claims that it along with the U.S. and Europe and other big powers has become one polar of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    A strict precaution should be taken against the U.S. unipolar world strategy which may spark a new cold war and moves of Japan which has emerged a dangerous force of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is an essential need for humankind to make the international community independent and democratic.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt will be the unanimous wish of humankind in the new century that all the nations, irrespective of the size of territory or the level of development, will take a position as an equal member of the international community. \r\n\r\n"
