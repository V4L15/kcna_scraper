The Japanese reactionaries are trying to remark on the road of overseas expansion, blinded by their wild design to recover their past defeat and realize reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   For Japan to liquidate her past is not simply an issue of making an apology and compensation. It is a yardstick showing whether Japan is willing to repent of its criminal past and turn over a new leaf or not and whether it is qualified to become a full-fledged member of the international community or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   That is why the peace-loving people of the world are strongly demanding Japan's liquidation of the past and the Japanese people, too, are urging its authorities to liquidate its colonial rule over Korea and open the diplomatic relations between the DPRK and Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese authorities are well advised to properly see the trend of the times and think twice before acting. \r\n\r\n"
