Rodong Sinmun Saturday says this in a signed article.\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative forces' organizational merger is a reactionary offensive aimed at holding in check the just advance of the popular masses and blocking the progressive development of the society, the article notes, and goes on: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The pro-American conservative regime appeared in south Korea at a time when the south Korean people were dynamically pushing ahead with the movement for national reunification under the banner of the June 15 joint declaration in demand of a new policy and a new life. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative forces of south Korea have pursued a treacherous policy, crying out for recovering the \"lost decade\", thereby rendering the south Korean society more dependent on the U.S., reviving the fascist dictatorial system and getting frantic with the moves to escalate confrontation with fellow countrymen and provoke a war against the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"Solidarity of Hope for Future's\" decision to join the ruling forces in their treacherous moves threw graver hurdles in the way of the struggle of the south Korean progressive and democratic forces to achieve independence, democracy and reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A big alliance of conservatives, the reactionaries of history, is a product of their sinister plot to tide over their ruling crisis and lay a springboard from which to stay in power. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Finding it hard to weather the crisis and stay in power with the force of the GNP only, the group of traitors opted for bringing the solidarity into its fold.
