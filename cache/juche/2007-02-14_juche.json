Truth to tell, a military entity threatening the security of the U.S. is nowhere to be seen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. connects everything related to the MD with the DPRK. By finalizing the MD targeted against the DPRK it seeks to lay a foundation for a preemptive attack and, through it, establish its military control over the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The hectic push of the U.S. for the MD is a serious criminal act of gravely threatening and wrecking peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and other parts of the world and leading to a new arms race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With no amount of artifice can the U.S. conceal its true colors as the chief criminal fostering and aggravating the new arms race and harassing world peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to stop at once its arms buildup, pondering over the catastrophic consequences it would entail.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Branding this as a deliberate and premeditated act to push the situation on the peninsula to the brink of a war, a Rodong Sinmun analyst Tuesday says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is self-evident that it is impossible to expect sound negotiations in the war atmosphere and, even if negotiations are held, they cannot substantially contribute to ensuring peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Contacts and talks through various channels are now underway for the settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula.
