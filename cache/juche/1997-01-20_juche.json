This is no more than a last-ditch effort to save the \r\n\"government\" from the serious crisis, shuffling off upon the \r\npeople the responsibility for political unrest and overall \r\neconomic bankruptcy caused by their dependent economic \r\npolicy and anti-social rule.\r\n   The letter expressed the belief that the south Korean \r\npeasants will join workers in the struggle for the \r\nwithdrawal of the fascist laws and  overthrow  the \"civilian-\r\nveiled\" Kim Young Sam fascist clique, who have cut off the \r\nlifeline of the peasants by totally opening domestic rice \r\nmarket to outsiders, and surely win the democratic freedom \r\nand vital rights.\r\n   The central committee of the Korean journalists union, in \r\na letter to the pressmen in south Korea, called upon them to \r\nmake a positive contribution to achieving national \r\nreconciliation and the  peaceful reunification of the \r\ncountry as well as to the righteous struggle of the south \r\nKorean workers.\r\n   The letter expressed the expectation that they will \r\nsternly expose and condemn the anti-national, anti-\r\nreunification moves of the Kim Young Sam \"government\" and \r\nfully support the workers' struggle for social democracy and \r\nhuman dignity and rights. \r\n"
