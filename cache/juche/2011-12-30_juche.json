            "content": "Lee Myung Bak Group of Traitors Accused of Thrice-cursed Crimes\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\t Pyongyang, December 30 (KCNA) -- The National Defence Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea Friday released the following statement:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK lost the father of their large family on December 17 so suddenly and so early to their regret.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their sorrow over the loss was so bitter and unbearable that the whole country turned into a veritable sea of mourners and even the mountains, rivers, plants and trees seemed to wail. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is because leader Kim Jong Il was the great leader recognized by the world, iron-willed brilliant commander who defeated even the formidable enemies and tender-hearted father who brought up the servicepersons and people under his loving care.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now not only the Korean people but the whole world will more keenly realize as the days go by what great and distinguished man they lost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We feel grateful to the heads of state and party leaders, governments, organizations and personages of many countries of the world and compatriots at home and abroad for expressing profound condolences, sharing sorrow with us, and sending sincere sympathy and encouragement during the mourning period. We will never forget them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the whole nation is overcome with grief over the great loss, only the south Korean puppet group committed thrice-cursed crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK National Defence Commission, above all, discloses before the world and the nation the truth about those crimes of the south Korean puppet group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Though the country remains divided into the north and the south due to foreign forces, we are one nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK, though suffering pain resulting from the division, have valued this homogenous nation more than anything else, always regarding as their faith the truth that the nation is above the ideology and system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But this time the south Korean puppet group perpetrated such rash act as hurting the grief-stricken compatriots and rubbing salt into their wounds, determined to stop remaining as part of the nation of its own accord.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No sooner had the important report of the DPRK been released than the south Korean puppet group convened an emergency \"state security meeting\" and \"state affairs meeting\" and put even overseas missions on emergency alert duty, kicking off rackets to create the impression that a \"contingency\" was created as expected, and a \"golden opportunity\" presented itself to lead the north to \"system change\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities put the three services of the puppet army on an emergency alert and ordered them to adopt combat posture, creating a war-like atmosphere on the ground and in the seas and air. They let over 30 right-wing conservative reactionary organizations flock to the forefront areas to scatter anti-DPRK leaflets whose content was hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and inciting disturbance. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Traitor Lee Myung Bak spearheaded all these operations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He sought to attain his foolish goal by taking the advantage of the mourning period, and if that fails, to lead the DPRK to \"contingency\" and \"change of system\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From the olden times, it was considered inhumane to raise one's fist at the neighbor visited by misfortune and seek profits.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even a foreign country which has no diplomatic relations with the DPRK stopped the planned military exercises being considerate of the sorrow of the army and people of the DPRK and set a mourning period to express condolences. In the light of this, the traitorous group's bullying acts can not but be viewed as one defying human ethics and morality. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee group's stepped-up show of enmity toward the DPRK culminated in its act of blocking south Koreans who wanted to visit Pyongyang to mourn the demise of leader Kim Jong Il. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Koreans from all walks of life upon the news of Kim Jong Il's demise that came like a bolt from the blue strongly called for expressing condolences and dispatching mourners group regardless of whether they belonged to progressive or conservative camps and ruling or opposition parties. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The traitorous group of Lee turned down all the demands and described the south Korean people's request to mourn the demise of Kim Jong Il as \"sympathy to citizens separated from the north regime\". It banned the dispatch of mourners' group talking about \"chaos of south Korean society\". It foolishly tried to estrange the popular masses of the DPRK from its headquarters on one hand and totally ban the Pyongyang visits much hoped by broad south Koreans by taking the measures of \"selected visits\" and \"restricting mourners groups\" on the other hand. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Shared sorrow lessens while shared pleasure increases. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Expressing condolences and sending condolatory messages have been good manners and customs and ethical tradition peculiar to the Korean nation from the ancient times. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is for this reason that we brand the evil act of the Lee group as treason bereft of elementary human reason and morality. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group dared try to link the \"final responsibility\" for the warship \"Cheonan\" sinking and shelling on Yonphyong Island with the supreme leadership of the DPRK. They let loose such reckless remarks that the DPRK must present justifications for south Korea to move if it wants to have the \"May 24 measure of the authorities\" retracted and the north-south relations mended this time. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is hideous crime that can never be pardoned in any case to dare hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK over its army's self-defensive shell-firing on Yonphyong Island for coping with preemptive provocation in the wake of the \"Cheonan\" warship sinking case which is not related to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of traitors even hatched a plot to prompt the DPRK make a \"change\", while talking about its non-existent \"contingency\" and \"instability\" of its dignified system and regime. This evildoing adds to the said crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Upon joint authorization of the Party, state, army and people of the DPRK, the DPRK National Defence Commission clarifies the following principled stand on the group of traitors' hideous crimes committed at the time of the great misfortune of the nation:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already declared, the DPRK will have no dealings with the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors forever.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To company with them is a disgrace for the clear and honest-minded Korean nation as they are ignorant in politics, vulgar in morals and lack elementary human nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will surely force the group of traitors to pay for its hideous crimes committed at the time of the great national misfortune.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The veritable sea of tears shed by the army and people of the DPRK will turn into that of retaliatory fire to burn all the group of traitors to the last one and their wailing into a roar of revenge to smash the stronghold of the puppet forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative media of south Korea would also face due punishment as they are backing and following the group of traitors in its treacherous act against humanity through false report, fabrication, speculation and presumption, oblivious of their mission to be fair speaker for the public and pioneer of true public.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppets and world reactionaries should no longer make a fool of themselves in their bid to lead the DPRK to \"contingency\" and make its \"system instable\", something unimaginable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll the soldiers and people of the DPRK turned out to mourn the demise of leader Kim Jong Il since the announcement of his demise, an indication of the great unity of the party, army and people behind the headquarters of the revolution in single mind and invincibility of the Korean-style socialist system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will unswervingly keep to the path of Juche indicated by Kim Jong Il true to the intention of President Kim Il Sung.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Taking this opportunity, we solemnly declare with confidence that the south Korean puppets and foolish politicians around the world should not expect any change from the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will keep to the path of improving north-south relations and achieving peace and prosperity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Mended north-south relations we want are not improvement based on \"high-handedness\" and \"flexibility\" as touted by Lee Myung Bak group of traitors or on crafty gimmick of those rhetorics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK wants to improve relations with the south and bring peace and prosperity through the nationwide drive to implement the historic June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration under the banner of independence, peace and reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world will see how the army and people of the DPRK win the final victory after turning their sorrow and tears into strength and courage, closely rallied behind the dear respected Kim Jong Un."

Democratica de Corea hizo publica el dia 30 una declaracion sobre los grandes crimenes cometidos por la banda de traidores surcoreanos durante el periodo de gran duelo nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl pasado dia 17, el ejercito y el pueblo de la RPDC perdieron tan inesperadamente, tan lamentablemente y tan temprano al Dirigente   Kim Jong Il, Padre de la gran familia nacional, comienza la nota y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas lagrimas ante esa gran perdida forman un mar y los clamores hacen temblar la tierra porque      Kim Jong Il es gran Dirigente reconocido por todo el mundo, general insigne de acero quien doblegaba a los enemigos poderosos y padre generoso quien abraza en su regazo a todo el ejercito y el pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el transcurso del tiempo, la nacion coreana y el mundo entero sentiran cada vez mas cuan grande y extraordinario fue el Dirigente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAgradecemos y no olvidaremos nunca a los jefes de Estado, los lideres de partido, las personalidades de gobiernos, entidades y distintos estratos de varios paises del mundo y a los compatriotas en ultramar, que durante el duelo nacional, expresaron profundas condolencias, sincero consuelo y estimulo compartiendo nuestra tristeza.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSolo los titeres surcoreanos fueron los unicos que cometieron en ese plazo grandes crimenes de traicion que no seran expiados nunca. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl CDN de la RPDC revela sobre todo esas maldades a la vista del mundo y la nacion coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAunque el pais fue dividido en el Norte y el Sur por las fuerzas foraneas, somos una sola nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPese al tremendo dolor que sufren a causa de division nacional, el ejercito y el pueblo de la RPDC aprecian mas a la nacion unificada tomando siempre como su credo la verdad de que ella esta por encima de la idea y el regimen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, los titeres surcoreanos, decididos a dejar de vivir como connacionales, cometieron la canallada de acuchillar a los compatriotas adoloridos y heridos de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTan pronto como fue publicada la informacion importante sobre el deceso del Dirigente, convocaron la \"reunion emergente de seguridad nacional\" y el \"consejo de ministros\" y ordenaron a las representaciones surcoreanas en el extranjero pasar al estado de servicio emergente como si hubieran llegado la \"situacion de emergencia\", que esperaban tanto, y la \"oportunidad\" de inducir el \"cambio de regimen\" en la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDecretaron el estado de alerta y la guardia de emergencia a las unidades terrestres, navales y aereas del ejercito titere surcoreano y crearon en la tierra, el mar y el cielo el clima conflictivo a punto de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor otra parte, despacharon a las zonas del frente a mas de 30 entidades ultraderechistas, conservadoras y reaccionarias que lanzaron varias veces los volantes de contenido anti-RPDC que calumniaban la maxima dignidad de esta y agitaban la rebelion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl frente de todo eso, estuvo el traidor de pesima calana Lee Myung Bak.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Las referidas fechorias de la camarilla de Lee partieron del malvado intento de alcanzar sus estupidos objetivos aprovechando el clima de condolencias e inducir, si no saliera con la suya, el supuesto \"estado emergente\" y el \"cambio de regimen\" en la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde la antiguedad, se consideraba como actos inhumanos exacerbar las desgracias del vecino o sacar provechos de ellas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHasta en el pais extranjero, que no establecio relaciones diplomaticas con la RPDC y tiene diferente lengua y raza, suspendio los ejercicios militares previamente programados tomando en consideracion los sufrimientos de militares y civiles coreanos y fijo el periodo de recordacion expresando condolencias.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi se tiene en cuenta tal gesto de cortesia, la locura de los traidores surcoreanos es el comportamiento de los bribones que faltan a las mas elementales normas de etica y moralidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa fechoria de ellos llego al climax cuando impidieron la expresion de condolencias de los compatriotas surcoreanos y desautorizaron sus viajes al Norte (RPDC) para el mismo fin.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInformados de la triste noticia sobre el fallecimiento del Dirigente Kim Jong Il, las personalidades y habitantes surcoreanos de diferentes sectores, sean progresistas o conservadores y de los partidos opositores o del partido en el poder, se mostraron entusiastas en expresar condolencias y demandar el envio del grupo de condolencias.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLejos de tomar medidas correspondientes, la banda del traidor Lee desoyo esas demandas y bajo el nivel de las condolencias en representacion de la opinion publica como \"consuelo a los habitantes separados del regimen norcoreano\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn cuanto al pedido del envio del grupo de condolencias, lo rechazo pretextando los supuestos \"disturbios de la sociedad surcoreana\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTratando de separar al pueblo de la RPDC de su Direccion por una parte, bloqueo totalmente el viaje al Norte de diferentes sectores, que quisieron expresar pesame ante el feretro del Padre de la nacion, en virtud de la medida para la \"visita selectiva\" y el \"envio restringido del grupo de condolencias de respuesta\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa tristeza se disminuye compartiendo y la alegria se aumenta celebrando juntos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor eso, expresar condolencias y realizar visitas para lo mismo han sido desde la antiguedad una bella costumbre y tradicion etica de la nacion coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe ahi que calificamos las maldades de la banda surcoreana como tremendos actos antinacionales que estan fuera del juicio y moralidad del ser humano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara colmo, la banda del traidor Lee se atrevio a vincular con la maxima dignidad de la RPDC la \"responsabilidad final\" del incidente de hundimiento de la corbeta surcoreana \"Cheonan\" y del caso de canonazos en la isla Yonphyong perorando que esta vez, la RPDC debe dar a las autoridades surcoreanas la justificacion de anular las \"medidas del 24 de mayo\" y mejorar las relaciones con el Norte. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAtentar contra la maxima dignidad de la RPDC cuestionando el incidente de \"Cheonan\", que no tiene nada que ver con la RPDC, y las contramedidas del EPC frente a la provocacion cometida primero por la parte Sur en el caso de la isla Yonphyong, constituye otro archicrimen que no se puede perdonar en ningun caso.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Habria que sumar a eso el complot que urdieron los traidores surcoreanos para inducir el supuesto \"cambio\" hablando de la inexistente \"situacion de emergencia\" de la RPDC y de la \"inestabilidad\" del muy digno regimen de ella.   \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Si se ajusta la cuenta de todos esos crimenes, no tendran salvacion los traidores surcoreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn relacion con el crimen sin precedente perpetrado por la banda de Lee Myung Bak en contra del gran duelo nacional, por encargo conjunto del partido, el Estado, el ejercito y el pueblo, el CDN de la RPDC declara la posicion de principios como sigue: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa hemos declarado, nunca tendremos relaciones con la banda traidora de Lee Myung Bak.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTener relacion con esta banda, ignorante en lo politico, vil en lo moral y carente de la moralidad elemental humana, sera una verguenza de la nacion coreana recta y honesta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tContaremos hasta el fin el tremendo crimen de la banda traidora perpetrado en contra del gran duelo  nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl mar de lagrimas de sangre derramadas por el ejercito y el pueblo de la RPDC sera el mar de fuego de venganza para quemar el origen de esta banda traidora y el lamento funebre de ellos sera el canonazo de venganza para derrotar el bastion de los titeres.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, seran castigadas severamente las prensas conservadoras surcoreanas que abrigan y apoyan los actos antinacionales y antieticos de la banda traidora con el engano, la falsificacion, la presuncion y la suposicion olvidando la mision del portavoz equitativo de la opinion publica y precursor de la verdadera opinion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos titeres surcoreanos y los reaccionarios del mundo no deben actuar absurdamente para crear el \"estado de emergencia\" y la \"inestabilidad del sistema\" de la RPDC que no habian ni habran existido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante el gran duelo nacional todo el ejercito y todo el pueblo mostraron ante el mundo el aspecto de la gran unidad monolitica del partido, el ejercito y el pueblo de la RPDC en torno a la Direccion de la Revolucion y la inquebrantable invencibilidad del regimen y el sistema socialista al estilo coreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito y el pueblo de la RPDC avanzaron, avanzan y avanzaran invariable y directamente por el camino del Juche indicado por el Dirigente Kim Jong Il en pleno acato al proposito del Presidente Kim Il Sung.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAprovechando esta ocasion, declaramos con solemnidad y seguridad a los titeres surcoreanos y otros politiqueros necios del mundo que no esperen ningun cambio de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito y el pueblo de la RPDC avanzaran a pasos firmes en el futuro tambien hacia el camino de mejoramiento de relaciones intercoreanas, paz y prosperidad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl mejoramiento de relaciones intercoreanas, que deseamos, no es el que se basa en la \"intransigencia\", la \"flexibilidad\" y otras astutas expresiones de la banda del traidor Lee Myung Bak que combinan ambas cosas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl mejoramiento de relaciones intercoreanas y la gran causa de reunificacion, paz y prosperidad, que queremos lograr, son las empresas a ser cumplidas a traves de la lucha pannacional por ejecutar la historica Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio y la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre bajo la bandera de independencia, paz y reunificacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl mundo vera claramente como lograran la victoria final el ejercito y el pueblo de la RPDC que unidos firmemente en torno al Maximo Dirigente  Kim Jong Un, convirtieron la tristeza en el coraje y las lagrimas en las fuerzas."
