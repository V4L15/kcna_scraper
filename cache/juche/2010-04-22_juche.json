He highly praised the soldier-builders and constructors in Moranbong District for having turned the park into a wonderful recreation ground for people by displaying the spirit of devoted service for people and extended thanks to them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Looking for a long while at the happy working people and school youth and children having pleasant rest by use of the best recreation facilities, he was very pleased that it has become possible to provide people with ample cultural recreation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that the youth park at the foot of time-honored Moran Hill is visited by many working people and school youth and children and set forth important tasks which would serve as guidelines for operating the park.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underscored the need for the officials and employees of the park to improve the management of equipment and technical control in the spirit of devoted service to people and steadily update its operation in an effort to give full play to the advantages of the socialist system centered on the popular masses in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is nice to see the park ornamented with lamplights, he said, stressing the need to more beautifully decorate the park with lamplights suited to the topographical conditions of the park and the peculiarities of its equipment so that the park may stand distinctly gorgeous at night, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the modern Kaeson Youth Park is a good one that meets the requirement of the new century, he called for sprucing well all parks and recreation grounds including the Mangyongdae Fun Fair and the Taesongsan Pleasure Park like the youth park to provide people with better conditions for a cultural life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that it is important to protect the natural environment in managing parks and recreation grounds, he underlined the need to preserve even a single stone and tree in the recreation grounds as they are and take thorough measures to prevent the pollution in the mountains and rivers, in particular.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underscored the need to conduct the work for creating woodland and greenery under a long-term plan in Pyongyang, in particular, in such a manner as to make the whole city form a huge park and enable the capital city to always preserve its beautiful appearance as a \"city in the large park\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The slogan \"We Serve the People!\" fully reflects the unshakable will and determination of the WPK to devote everything to the happiness of the people, placing the people's interests above anything else, he noted, calling upon all the officials to live and struggle like true servants for the people."

F-16 fighter bombers and copters with different missions mounted a preemptive attack on the \"enemy's position\" to put it under their control and tanks that had been hurled into the \"rear\" seized the \"enemy's trench,\" supported by copters, and \"advanced\" towards \"the enemy's position,\" firing live shells.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson Thursday observes in a signed commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is crystal clear to all that by the imaginary enemy's position in the war exercises the warmongers meant the position of the Korean People's Army and the above-said war exercises were, in the final analysis, undisguised war saber-rattling targeted against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is that the U.S. and the south Korean conservative group staged the war exercises on April 15.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They must be well aware that this Day of the Sun is significantly commemorated not only by the Koreans but by all other progressives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This being a hard reality, they fixed this day for staging exercises for firing live shells at \"enemy's position\" with so huge armed forces and various type ultramodern military hardware involved.
