Security Council at the session of the 56th U.N. General Assembly, deliberately linking the issue of the SC reform with the issue of anti-international terrorism. \r\n In this regard Minju Joson today in a signed commentary observes: this daydream self-exposes how indiscreet and brazen-faced Japan is. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The SC permanent membership is not given to any country according to its wishes.    A country can sit on it only when it is trusted by the international community and it is qualified for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is not qualified to be its member at all. It is the only country in the world which has not yet honestly repented of the war crimes committed against humanity in the past though half a century has passed since its defeat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In terms of global peace and stability Japan has only done harm to mankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's bid for the SC permanent membership is aimed at emerging as a political power in keeping with its moves to become a military power and realizing its ambition for overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is well advised to drop its ill-intention if it is to do something for the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should honestly admit all the crimes committed in the past, apologize for them and compensate the victims for them. This is not only a moral obligation of Japan but a prerequisite for it to get trust of the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is well advised to do what it should do, paying heed to the demand of the international community.         \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The national sovereignty exercised by members of the nation in one part of the country only cannot be called full national sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reunification of Korea should be an undertaking to establish national sovereignty throughout Korea under any circumstances. Reunification is the only way of adding shine to the nation's dignity and honour and achieving prosperity because it is the cause of achieving national unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The strength of a nation lies in its unity. Only when a nation goes united, can it exist under any difficult conditions, display its dignity and honor and achieve prosperity of the country and nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National reunification presupposes the great unity of the nation and it leads to reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Reunification can also provide practical conditions and possibility for the development and prosperity of a reunified country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the country is reunified, all the fellow countrymen in the north and the south and overseas will be able to pool wisdom and energies and use all resources and economic potentials of the north and the south in a uniform manner to build a rich, powerful and prosperous country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to add shine to the nation's dignity and honor and build a prosperous reunified country it is necessary to set store by the spirit of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and implement it to the letter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation can do anything when it gets united. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nobody can stop the dynamic movement of the Korean nation for reunification under the uplifted banner of the declaration.    \r\n\r\n"

Ri received training at Songnam primary school in the city of Hamhung, and began her professional career at a leading Korean team. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n People's athlete Ri Pun Hui is working as a sports advisor after graduating from the Korean University of Physical Education, while merited athlete Kim Song Hui is still active in the sport. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They married in Juche 81 (1992) and now have a son.    \r\n\r\n"
