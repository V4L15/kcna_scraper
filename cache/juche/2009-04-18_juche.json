            "content": "Kim Jong Il Provides Field Guidance to Newly Built Nyongwon Power Station\r\nPyongyang, April 18 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il provided field guidance to the newly built Nyongwon Power Station.\n\t\t\t\t\t After being briefed about the power station in front of the panoramic map, he acquainted himself in detail with the assembly of equipment and electricity production there, going round an electric generator room and an electric distribution room. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Expressing satisfaction over the fact that the workers of the Taean Heavy Machine Complex manufactured advanced generators of high efficiency in a short span of time with their wisdom and enthusiasm and sent them to the power station and that its employees have since kept electricity production going by conducting well equipment and technological management, he highly appreciated their efforts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that it is an admirable success that the soldier-builders have built the modern large-scale hydro power station with their own efforts by giving full play to the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude during the \"Arduous March\", the forced march, he highly appreciated the shining feats performed by them by providing the eternal wealth for the prosperity of the country and the happiness of posterity and extended thanks to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He noted that the successful completion of the power station is a striking demonstration of the might of the tremendous mental power of the servicepersons of the DPRK who know nothing impossible and the great potentials of the self-supporting national economy and another great victory won by the army and people of the DPRK in their struggle to valiantly shatter the vicious moves of the imperialists and reactionaries to isolate and stifle it and defend and further glorify Korean-style socialism centred on the popular masses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that President Kim Il Sung might have been very much pleased if he had seen this shining success today as he personally initiated the building of the Nyongwon Power Station and worked heart and soul for its construction, he remarked with excited tone that the President's behests have been successfully carried out at last thanks to the heroic struggle of servicepersons of the Korean People's Army intensely loyal to the Party and the leader.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went on to say that the country would always remember the brilliant exploits performed by the soldier-builders before the country and the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He indicated important tasks which would serve as guidelines in increasing the electricity production of the country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that it is difficult to build hydro power stations, but once they are built, they become not only edifices of eternal value but also more beneficial than thermal power stations and atomic power plants in various aspects.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to build more generating capacity, it is necessary to actively find out promising reserve sites for power stations to massively construct hydro power stations, he said, underlining the need to mobilize the whole Party and entire army and all the people to the completion of the construction of the Huichon Power Station in a short span of time at the highest level, in particular. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underscored the need for workers in the field of the power industry to play a vanguard role in building a great prosperous and powerful nation by effecting a leap forward.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  He was accompanied by Kim Ki Nam, secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, Jang Song Thaek and Pak Nam Gi, department directors of the WPK Central Committee, and Hyon Chol Hae and Ri Myong Su, generals of the Korean People's Army."

            "content": "KPA General Staff Spokesman Blasts Hostile Forces' Anti-DPRK Racket\r\nPyongyang, April 18 (KCNA) -- As already clarified, the Korean People's Army will consider sanctions to be applied against the DPRK under various names over its satellite launch or any pressure to be put upon it through \"total participation\" in the PSI as a declaration of undisguised confrontation and a declaration of a war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the General Staff of the Korean People's Army declared this in an answer given to a question put by KCNA on April 18 denouncing the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors for doing evils over the DPRK's launch of the satellite for peaceful purposes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The news that the DPRK scientists and technicians correctly put the satellite Kwangmyongsung-2 into orbit at one go by a multi-stage carrier rocket Unha-2 is being unanimously praised and hailed not only by all the Koreans in the north and the south and abroad but by progressive humankind, stirring up the world, the spokesman said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is only the U.S. and Japanese aggressors and the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors that are making uproar over the DPRK's successful satellite launch as if a nuclear bomb had been dropped over their own lands and kicking up an unprecedented anti-DPRK racket, raising a hue and cry over the violation of a UN resolution, sanctions and the like.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group of traitors is so hateful as to take the lead in such racket in particular.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It found itself frustrated in the racket it kicked up after dispatching even a destroyer of the puppet navy in a bid to intercept the DPRK's satellite together with interceptor warships of the U.S. and Japanese aggressor forces. This group is unhesitatingly revealing its sinister intention not to rule out even a war, setting in motion even the bellicose elements of the puppet military to cry out for sending a strong and unanimous worldwide message to the DPRK and blustering that a practical pressure would be put upon the DPRK through south Korea's \"total participation\" in the PSI.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a far-fetched logic of traitor Lee Myung Bak and the bellicose elements of the puppet military that either a satellite launch or a rocket launch is a violation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There are not a few countries in the world that launched satellites. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But none of them has put a satellite into space by blowing, instead of using a rocket. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of traitors is ridiculously asserting that the satellite launches by its masters U.S. and Japan do not pose any problem but the one launched by the DPRK where its fellow countrymen live is problematic. This is nothing but vituperation and sophism which can be let loose only by traitors steeped in flunkeyism and submission to the marrows of their bones. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group should have sincerely hailed the admirable event to be proud of in the history of the nation as it demonstrated the dignity and wisdom of the nation to the world. It is, however, working hard to stifle fellow countrymen in collusion with outsiders, the sworn enemies of the Korean nation. This is an unpardonable crime against the nation, reunification and peace. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that the group officially declared confrontation and war against the DPRK, its revolutionary armed forces will opt for increasing the nation's defence capability including nuclear deterrent in every way, without being bound to the agreement adopted at the six-party talks. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army of the DPRK has never pinned any hope on the six-party talks from their outset but closely followed the moves of the U.S. and Japanese aggressors and the Lee group of traitors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK are always keeping themselves fully ready to go into action any moment to mercilessly punish anyone who encroaches upon the sovereignty and dignity of the DPRK even a bit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is no limit to the strike to be made by the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group of traitors should never forget that Seoul is just 50 km away from the Military Demarcation Line.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The persistent anti-DPRK confrontational racket kicked up by the group over the DPRK's satellite launch will only bring disgrace and destruction to it."

Seguridad contra la Proliferacion\" (PSI en ingles) y otras cosas devienen precisamente la abierta declaracion de confrontacion y guerra contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t  Asi destaco el portavoz del Estado Mayor General del Ejercito Popular de Corea en una entrevista concedida este sabado con la Agencia Telegrafica Central de Corea con motivo de que ultimamente, la camarilla del traidor Lee Myung Bak se porta de mal en peor en cuanto al lanzamiento de satelite artificial con fines pacificos por parte de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nuestros cientificos y tecnicos pusieron exactamente de una vez en la orbita planeada el satelite artificial \"Kwangmyongsong no. 2\" lanzado a bordo del cohete transportador de varios cuerpos \"Unha-2\", comenzo el portavoz y prosiguio:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Esta noticia conmueve no solo a los compatriotas del Norte, el Sur y en ultramar sino tambien a la humanidad progresista que elogia unanimemente y envidia ese suceso.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Sin embargo, unicamente, los agresores norteamericanos y japoneses y la banda del traidor Lee Myung Bak escandalizan el exitoso lanzamiento de satelite artificial por nuestra parte como si hubiera caido una bomba nuclear en el patio de su casa y libran una campana anti-RPDC sin precedente hablando de la violacion de la resolucion de la ONU y de la sancion, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Al frente de esta campana esta la abominable camarilla del traidor Lee Myung Bak, que se fue en vacio de sus ajetreados movimientos como el envio de un destructor de las fuerzas maritimas titeres para que interceptara nuestro satelite junto con los buques interceptores de las tropas agresoras norteamericanas y japonesas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En estos dias, esa horda expone abiertamente, por conducto de los elementos belicistas del circulo militar titere, su siniestra intencion de desatar hasta la guerra diciendo que se debe enviar a la RPDC \"un fuerte y unanime mensaje mundial\" y ejerceran la presion practica mediante la \"participacion total\" en la PSI.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Partiendo de su logica estupida, el traidor Lee Myung Bak y los belicistas del ejercito titere insisten en que suponen una violacion tanto el lanzamiento de satelite artificial como el de cohete.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En este mundo no son pocos los paises que han lanzado el satelite artificial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Por supuesto, ninguno de ellos lo habra hecho a soplos sin utilizar un cohete.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La insistencia absurda de la banda del traidor Lee en que no son problematicos los satelites artificiales que lanzan sus amos norteamericano y japones,  pero si lo son cuando fueran lanzados por nuestro pais, es un rumor manoso de ese colectivo enviciado de servilismo y sumision a grandes potencias y su disparate de caracter vendepatria y chovinista nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No se puede perdonar de ninguna manera el crimen antinacional, anti-reunificacion y antipaz de esa horda que se mueve desesperadamente para atropellar a los connacionales cooperando con las fuerzas extranjeras y hasta con los enemigos jurados, lejos de aplaudir sinceramente ese acontecimiento digno de registrarse en la historia nacional, que mostro a todo el mundo la dignidad y la inteligencia de la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Dado que fueron declaradas oficialmente la confrontacion y la guerra contra la RPDC, nuestras fuerzas armadas revolucionarias optaran por fortalecer por todos los medios el poderio defensivo del pais, inclusive el disuasivo nuclear, sin comprometerse al acuerdo de las conversaciones a 6 bandas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Desde el principio, el EPC no cifro ninguna esperanza en esas negociaciones sino vino vigilando agudamente los movimientos de los agresores norteamericanos y japoneses y la banda del traidor Lee Myung Bak.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Al igual que en el pasado, nuestras fuerzas armadas revolucionarias se mantienen todo el tiempo en la disposicion de movilizacion para castigar implacablemente a cualquiera que atente, aunque en lo mas minimo, nuestra soberania y dignidad,

Bak no debe olvidar nunca que Seul esta apenas a 50 kilometros mas o menos desde la Linea de Demarcacion Militar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Si ella recrudece la campana de confrontacion con la RPDC acusandola de continuo de lanzamiento de satelite artificial, sufrira la verguenza y la ruina mas amargas."
