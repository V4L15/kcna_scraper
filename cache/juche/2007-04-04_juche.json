That is why the Japanese authorities are not willing to honestly admit, repent of and apologize for the past war crimes. Lurking behind this behavior is an ambition for reinvasion. The Japanese ruling quarters' moves to tamper with the history are prompted by their idea of revenging Japan's defeat and ambition for reinvasion. Herein lie the gravity and danger of the Japanese reactionaries' moves to distort the history and evade the responsibility to settle the past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Abe forces made up of political imposters are denying and playing down the past crimes, hyping and internationalizing the \"abduction issue\" which had already found a solution in a foolish bid to prolong the remaining days of their dirty political life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But such stupid act will only put them in a more difficult position. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are well aware of how wicked the Japanese authorities are. We will never tolerate their denial of the past crimes and their insult to the Korean nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
