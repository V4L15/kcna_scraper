Unity based on respect for independence is the fundamental guarantee for the continued progress of the movement and the ultimate realization of the noble idea of independence against imperialism.\r\n Close economic cooperation among those countries is an important way of cementing the unity and solidarity of the movement and solving difficult and complicated problems arising in the building of a new society. South-South cooperation based on collective self-reliance is the only way for them to achieve independent development and socio-economic progress, free from the economic pressure and exploitation and pillage by the imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The non-aligned countries must never be involved in any bloc nor allow such abnormal acts as causing antagonism and distrust in the movement and spoiling its purity. The movement will pick up momentum and its might grow when all the non-aligned countries act in accordance with its basic idea and principle of activities and make positive efforts to assure its purity and unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The most important task facing the movement at present is to frustrate the moves for aggression and war committed by the U.S. imperialists under the pretext of \"combating terrorism\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over the past years the DPRK has remained faithful to the idea and principle of NAM and made energetic efforts for its development. A dignified member of NAM, the DPRK will uphold the purity and principle of the movement and fulfill its obligation and role for its development and triumphant advance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The non-aligned countries should bend joint efforts to increase the action capacity of the movement and enhance its position and role. NAM will be invulnerable and its idea will become a living reality.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Urged \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 1 (KCNA) -- Had the United States not occupied south Korea, Korea would not have been divided into two and had the U.S. not stood in the way of Korea's reunification, the Korean nation would have already achieved it long ago.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Thursday observes this in a signed article. It goes on:\r\n The Korean nation achieved the historic cause of national liberation from the colonial rule of the Japanese imperialists on August 15 60 years ago. But for the U.S. occupation of Korea, the Koreans would have already built a unified independent sovereign state and established national sovereignty throughout Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. occupied the south of Korea, not a defeated country, by force of arms, interfering in its affairs, though it made no contribution to the cause of Korean liberation. This brought the tragic partition of Korea into the north and the south and this disgraceful history has lasted for 60 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is a cancer-like entity as it has stood in the way of the uniform development of the Korean nation, pursuing a policy of colonial subjugation in south Korea for 60 years.\r\n The 60-year-long history and the present reality clearly prove that the U.S. policy of domination over south Korea is one of evil as it has savagely trampled down upon the destiny of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is the chieftain of aggression and war as it has obstructed the reunification of Korea and threatened the security of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has staged ceaseless large-scale war exercises for aggression on the DPRK while making the outbreak of the second Korean war an established fact and steadily modifying and supplementing its scenarios for a war of aggression, far from drawing a lesson from a bitter defeat it sustained in the last Korean war. \r\n The Koreans should not allow the U.S. to perpetrate any more high-handed and arbitrary practices. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The 70 million Koreans in the north and the south and overseas should unite as one under the banner of \"By our nation itself\" to drive the U.S. imperialists out of south Korea and bring about the second August 15 liberation as early as possible.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

At that time, a diplomat of that country recommended him to study at the university after his graduation from the senior middle school. But Kim Jong Il told him he wanted to study at Kim Il Sung University in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The answer fully reflected his boundless loyalty to the President and ardent love for the fatherland and the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many years ago, Kim Il Sung, too, refused to study in a foreign country.\r\n When he was engaged in energetic revolutionary activities after the release from the Jilin prison, Comintern advised him to go to Moscow for study.
