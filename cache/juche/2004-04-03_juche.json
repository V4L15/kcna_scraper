            "content": "Anniversary of Kim Jong Il's Work Marked \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 2 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today carries an article dedicated to the 30th anniversary of leader Kim Jong Il's famous work \"On Some Questions in Understanding the Juche Philosophy\" by Academician, Prof. and Dr. Kim Hwa Jong.\r\n Kim Jong Il's work serves as an immortal monumental work as it ascertained in depth the originality and the truth of the Juche philosophy as a man-centered philosophy, the first of its kind in the human history of philosophical thought, and a great landmark as it made a great contribution to formulating the Juche philosophy on a scientific and theoretical basis and systematizing it in a comprehensive way, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He in his work clearly elucidated that the Juche philosophy is a unique and original man-centered philosophy fathered by President Kim Il Sung. \r\n As clarified by him in his work, it is the Juche philosophy fathered by Kim Il Sung that scientifically clarifies the viewpoint, outlook and stand on the world with the man in the center of the philosophical study for the first time in history. The Juche philosophy formulated the man-centered viewpoint, outlook and stand on the world by proposing from a new angle the issue of a position and role of man in the world as a fundamental question of philosophy with man at its centre and giving a perfect answer to it, given that an answer to the issue of the origin of the world was given by the preceding philosophy of the working class. This means that the Juche philosophy is a completely new and original philosophy as it is fundamentally different from the philosophical ideas in the old times and it can never be understood within the framework of dialectical materialism, a preceding philosophy of the working class, and a great philosophy that has brought a signal turn in the human history of philosophy, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il in his work clarified in depth the need to correctly understand the originality of the Juche philosophy as a man-centered philosophy. The Juche philosophy is a man-centered philosophy. This does not mean that it is just similar to human philosophy that studied the human issue and gave an answer to it. The human philosophy denies the original mission of philosophy as a science giving an outlook on the world and mainly deals with such issues as what human being is and what his life is like. The Juche philosophy is quite different from it. It proposed the issue of a position and role of man in the world as a fundamental issue of philosophy and clarified the philosophical principle that man is the master of everything and decides everything. The fundamental issue of the Juche philosophy is not a simple human issue but the issue of relations between the world and man and the Juche philosophical principle does not simply clarify the outlook on human life but elucidates the outlook on the world. The Juche philosophy clarifies the man-centered outlook on the world, a Juche-oriented outlook on the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il clarified for the first time in history that man is a social being that has independence, creativity and consciousness and gave a profound scientific answer to the issue of the intrinsic nature of man as a social being. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a historic event that will remain specially recorded in human history of philosophical thought that he clarified the intrinsic nature of a social being on a scientific basis. The scientific and theoretical clarification of the man-centered outlook on the world, the first of its kind in history, brought about a radical turn in the development of the human philosophical thought and provided correct guidelines for studying and disseminating the Juche philosophy. Herein lies the tremendous ideological and theoretical significance of his work.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "\"Conception of Northeast Asian Security Organization\" Termed Premature\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 2 (KCNA) -- Recently the United States and some other countries concerned came out with a \"conception of the Northeast Asian Security Organization\" with the six-way framework for the solution to the nuclear issue in mind. But it is a premature idea as it is far removed from the reality. Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The immediate task for security in Northeast Asia is to build bilateral confidence among the regional countries through the removal of hostile relations and mistrust. The debate on creating the Northeast Asia security organization is an issue which may be taken up in a distant future when this crucial task has been carried out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an armchair argument to discuss this at the present stage in the light of the historic experience in building the multilateral security organization in the past and the peculiar situation in Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Confidence-building serves as a cornerstone in the collective security. The abnormal reality in Northeast Asia characterized by the long-standing relations of serious mistrust and confrontation makes it impossible to ensure the balance of forces and trust among the regional countries, much less thinking about the building of a regional security organization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There exist in Northeast Asia only contradiction and competition between the U.S. seeking regional hegemony by relying on its huge armed forces in the region and the strategic forces opposed to it. These are the forces standing in rivalry with each other in the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This proves that mistrust can never be wiped out among the regional countries unless the U.S. troops are withdrawn from Japan and south Korea. The U.S. forces should be pulled out of south Korea, first of all, if the U.S. adventurous moves to unleash a nuclear war are to be checked and peace and security ensured on the Korean peninsula, the biggest hotspot in the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and Japan are hell-bent on the preparations for a war of aggression against the DPRK and the danger of war is increasing owing to them. It is quite senseless to think under this dangerous situation that diplomatic relations can be established between the DPRK and the U.S. and between the DPRK and Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The complicated situation in the region tells that this conception is nothing but a subjective ambition ignoring the objective reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will not pay any attention to \"the conception of the Northeast Asian Regional Security Organization\" far removed from the reality but make every possible effort to increase the capacity for self-defence to effectively cope with the U.S. and Japan's immediate threat of aggression.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

A typical example is the case of Jong Sun Dok, a woman unconverted long-term prisoner who is at the gate of death in her advanced age, lying unconscious with the paralysis of marrow function and pneumonia. She is now on the brink of death without medical fee or means of acquiring blood in a critical condition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She is, however, left without care in south Korea, though she is waiting for the hour of death, utterly forsaken. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is an instance proving that south Korea under U.S. domination is the worst barren land of human rights where elementary freedom and right of humanity are ruthlessly trampled upon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States and the rightist conservative forces of south Korea should stop crying over others' \"human right issue\" and solve their own serious human rights problems including the issue of unconverted long-term prisoners.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It implied that if other nations in this region continue pursuing pro-U.S. policies, they could also enjoy the U.S. political and military \"protection\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To this end, the United States has invited Israel, Egypt, Jordan and other nations in the Middle East to the NATO Summit to be held in Turkey in June and is now lobbying other NATO nations to establish relationship of \"partnership\" with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While going ahead with the plan to turn Iraq into a down-the-line pro-U.S. state, the United States is openly pressurizing Syria, Iran and other anti-U.S., independent nations to reform their political system and open their society, groundlessly charging them with providing weapons and training centers to \"terrorist organizations\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The facts indicate that the United States, with Iraq as a foothold, intends to \"readjust\" surrounding nations one after another and totally dominate the Middle East, thus using this region, which takes 65 percent of the world's oil resources, as a base for executing its strategy for world supremacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also prompted by this goal that the United States is pushing ahead with an ambitious plan to station its forces in the Middle East indefinitely and establish its military installations in the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is noteworthy in the U.S. moves to dominate the Middle East is the \"plan for democracy in the Middle East\" made public by Bush in early February. The key point of the plan is to reform the political system of the Mideast nations and introduce American-style democracy there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States has sent high-ranking officials to Mideast and European nations to drum up support for its plan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the United States has been baffled in its Mideast strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Iran and Syria has officially stated that they would resolutely cope with U.S. sanctions, while the anti-U.S. resistance has been escalated in Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As soon as it was made public, the \"plan for democracy in the Middle East\" was rejected by all the nations belonging to the League of Arab States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Protest against the arrogant plan came out in the emergency conference of foreign ministers of the League of Arab States held in Cairo on March 1 and the general meeting of the Arab Parliamentary Union in Damascus on February 2. The plan has been castigated by Arab media, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. anachronistic Mideast strategy, categorically rejected by the Arab people, is destined to go busted.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
