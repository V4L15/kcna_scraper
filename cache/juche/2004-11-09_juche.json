The U.S., jointly with Japan, is working round the clock in its preparations for a war to invade socialist Korea behind the scene of the six-party talks, he added, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is trying to inveigle Japan still deeper into its war moves and bring the DPRK to its knees through naval blockade coupled with a smear campaign against the DPRK such as the adoption of the \"North Korean Human Rights Act\". \r\n The DPRK has taken determined counter measures including the increase of its military deterrent in order to defend the sovereignty and security of the country and the nation from the criminal moves of the U.S. imperialists and their followers for a war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We bitterly condemn the criminal war game of the U.S. and Japan for aggression and unconditionally support the DPRK's counter measures, he stated.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Blasts S. Korean Authorities' Political Plot \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 8 (KCNA) -- Choe Song Yong, chairman of the \"Association of Families of North Korean Abductees,\" an anti-north plot breeding organization, recently let loose a string of rubbish about the so-called \"issue of abduction \" by the north, according to south Korean MBC.\r\n He was shameless enough to tell the following sheer lie: Old woman named Ri Ju Im, who had been \"abducted\" by someone and taken to the north during the last Fatherland Liberation War, wished to return to south Korea from long ago. She succeeded in crossing to Dandong, China from Sinuiju by a smuggling boat on Oct. 4. She was admitted to a hospital there due to worsening myocardial infarction and bronchitis on Oct. 14. But on Oct. 25 she was \"abducted\" by a \"special operative of the north\" from the hospital before putting her under virtual house arrest at a Chinese company in Dandong. He urged the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of south Korea to start negotiations with the Chinese government for her early return to south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, an official of the Ministry made the claim an established fact even before probing the truth about the case. He went the lengths of pledging himself to do his best to bring Ri back through \"diplomatic negotiations\" with the Chinese government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is, to all intents and purposes, nothing but a foolish and mean political farce and an anti-national crime of those hostile to the north as it is aimed to tarnish the international authority and image of the dignified DPRK and create psychological confusion within its society in a bid to destroy its unbreakable unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the above-said organization claimed does not deserve even a passing note as it is made up of those who are steeped in bitterness and consciousness of confrontation with the north to the marrow of their bones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBut the north is compelled to clarify truth because even the south Korean authorities are involved in the smear campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri Ju Im, 73 if she is alive, studied at the nurse course of Seoul Medical University after the liberation of the country. After joining the volunteers corps during the Korean war she bravely fought against the U.S. imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She graduated from Pyongyang Medical University in the north as she wished and worked at the Tongrim County People's Hospital in North Phyongan Province. Afterwards, she led a happy life with her children and died of an incurable disease at an advanced age on Oct. 13 last year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In her lifetime anti-north plot-breeding organizations of south Korea conducted \"a secret operation\" to lure her into \"defecting\" to the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBut it proved futile due to her stubborn refusal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This being a hard fact, the above-said organization used the dead woman for its despicable false propaganda only to provoke the world people's laughter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is the promise made by the south Korean authorities as regards the ridiculous farce staged by the above-mentioned organization before making any confirmation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a customary method employed by the south Korean authorities to stage a ridiculous charade by painting the dead as a living person to attain their political aim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Last year the south Korean authorities floated the story that Kil Jae Gyong, former vice-director of a department of the C. C., the Workers' Party of Korea, \"sought asylum in the U.S.\" only to suffer bitter shame because he lies in state at the Patriotic Martyrs' Cemetery in Sinmi-ri after his death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The latest fabricated case of abduction of Ri suffices to indicate what extent the moves of the anti-north elements and the south Korean authorities have reached. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This smear campaign goes to clearly prove that the south Korean authorities' much talk about \"new era of inter-Korean relations,\" \"national reconciliation and unity\" and \"cooperation for national prosperity\" is nothing but hypocrisy and they have an axe to grind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north can never remain a passive onlooker to the political farce orchestrated by the south Korean authorities, timed to coincide with the evermore undisguised U.S. plots against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should make a proper apology to the north.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Lambastes LDP's Anti-DPRK Moves\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 8 (KCNA) -- The Liberal Democratic Party of Japan at a meeting of \"Headquarters for measures to settle the issue of abduction by north Korea\" on Nov. 5 approved an interim report submitted by a team for mock test for applying economic sanctions against north Korea, which calls for economic sanctions at five phases. The party also confirmed its policy to demand the reexamination of such issues as exempting the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) and its related facilities from fixed property tax and subsidizing its related institutions apart from the economic sanctions.\r\n The Japanese ultra-right reactionary conservatives have manipulated the party to take such measures for applying economic sanctions against the DPRK at a time when the inter-governmental working talks between the DPRK and Japan are fast approaching. Such moves have aroused deep apprehension as to the prospect of the bilateral relations and compelled the DPRK to think over the adverse impact such moves will have on the results of the talks as they hamstring the effort to improve the bilateral relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The relations between the two countries are fraught with serious discord as the ultra-right conservative forces of Japan are pushing the bilateral ties to the phase of crisis quite contrary to the spirit of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is entirely attributable to the hostile policy the ultra-right reactionary forces of Japan have pursued with extreme bitterness toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are persistently raising unimportant issues in dealing with the issues of bilateral relations and working hard to institute such domestic laws as one calling for economic sanctions against north Korea, an infringement upon the sovereignty of the DPRK. This is an extreme provocation against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has already demanded the immediate disbandment of the team for mock test for sanctions, branding the deceptive and arrogant mode of effective pressure sought by it as a deliberate move to bedevil the hostile relations between the two countries. However, the ultra-right reactionary forces of Japan have persistently insisted on the one-sided hostile policy toward the DPRK, calling for tougher sanctions against the DPRK and escalating its moves against Chongryon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If these things are allowed to go on, they may lead to a dangerous situation in the relations between the two sides and it will be hard to expect any improvement in the bilateral relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whether the DPRK-Japan relations make a U-turn in the direction of their normalization to meet the expectation of the international community and the wishes of the two peoples in the new century or keep to the road of abnormal confrontation entirely depends on Japan's attitude.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
