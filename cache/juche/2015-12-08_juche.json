Para realizar la estrategia de reequilibro de carácter agresivo en la región de Asia-Pacífico, agrava periódicamente la situación de la Península Coreana negando la firma del convenio de paz con la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl hecho evidencia que no se resolverán el problema nuclear de la Península Coreana y otros asuntos regionales mientras que EE.UU. no abandone su maligna intención ni retire la política de hostilidad a la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs infructuosa la política de \"paciencia estratégica\" de EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe cambiar con audacia su política sobre la RPDC sin recurrir a la anacrónica política hostil anti-RPDC y a las imprudentes maniobras de agresión."

Ahora, el imperio norteamericano tiene interés imprescindible en la resucitación de militarismo en Japón.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. quiere tomar en su mano el Japón para usarlo como brigada de choque en la realización de su política de agresión a Asia. EE.UU. calcula que si introduce a Japón en sus maniobras para materializar la estrategia de reequilibrio en Asia y el Pacífico, podrá practicar sin dificultades la agresiva política sobre Asia y ganar el dinero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe actuar con prudencia teniendo presente de que sus actos criminales antipacíficos arriba mencionados le traerán al fin y al cabo el trágico resultado."
