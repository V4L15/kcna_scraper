            "content": "U.S. urged to accept DPRK's proposal for concluding non-aggression treaty \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 5 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary accuses the United States of describing the DPRK's proposal for concluding a non-aggression treaty as \"brinkmanship tactics\" to get a sort of \"reward\" from it.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's proposal for concluding a non-aggression treaty with the U.S. is aimed to provide a legal binding force to keep the U.S. from posing a nuclear threat to  the DPRK and it has nothing in common with \"brinkmanship tactics.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is bored with hypocritical U.S. promises devoid of any legal binding force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the 1990s the then U.S. President sent a message of assurances to the DPRK. But later, the U.S. threw it away like a pair of old shoes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Moreover, the Bush administration says that it has no intention to invade the DPRK but its words do not match with its deeds. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It turned down the DPRK's proposal for holding dialogues, while paying lip-service to the \"peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue,\" and it said that it is not in a position to legally assure the DPRK of non-aggression despite its assertion that it would not invade the DPRK by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter how many security assurances that lack any legal binding force the Bush administration may give to the DPRK, it is not interested in them at all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That's why the DPRK calls for concluding a non-aggression treaty with a legal binding force to be approved by U.S. Congress. What we need is a legal guarantee to be provided by a treaty as valid as international law. The U.S. should not flee from its heavy responsibility for spawning the nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula but promptly opt for direct talks with the  DPRK to conclude a non-aggression treaty with the DPRK, the most aboveboard and reasonable proposal to provide the best solution to the pending issues between the two countries.    \r\n\r\n"

No one can deny that such moves are the dangerous escalation of their military actions against the DPRK and undisguised moves for aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a serious attention is that the Foal Eagle is timed to coincide with the Rsoi war exercise. No one can predict when the U.S. will go over to a preemptive nuclear attack while staging the adventurous test nuclear war to stifle the DPRK under the pretext of its nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States has unhesitatingly opted for a nuclear war against the DPRK after discarding such deceptive signboard as the \"peaceful settlement\" of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and thus revealed its true colors as the author of the nuclear crisis, war maniac and empire of evil. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The further the U.S. imperialists increase their military threat and pressure upon the DPRK, the stronger counter-action the army and people in the DPRK will take against them, pursuant to the army-based policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States and the South Korean belligerent forces should not act rashly.    \r\n\r\n"

It obtained from the Fact-Finding Group for Probing the Truth Behind the Forcible Drafting of Koreans to Hyogo Prefecture.\r\n The results of the investigation have confirmed the following facts. A Korean by Japanese name of Yoshu Matsumoto on the list is now alive in Nyongbyon county, North Phyongan Province. His name is Pak Yong Su and he was born on March 22, 1923. Another man whose Japanese name is Meishun Kaneyama is also alive in Wiwon county, Jagang Province. His name is Kim Myong Jun and he was born on February 7, 1923. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  They testified to more facts about the forcible drafting of Koreans for forced labor at the Harima Shipbuilding Co. Ltd. of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The measure committee issued a report on the results of the investigation on March 4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The report says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The company (Harima Ishigawashima Heavy Industry Co. Ltd.  at present) was built in Aioi city, Hyogo Prefecture, Japan in 1912. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was selected as the first munitions company in January 1944 to build warships and transport ships for war as the Japanese imperialists decided to escalate the war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to testimonies made by Pak and Kim, they were forcibly taken to the company after threats were posed not only to their existence but to that of their families and mental and physical pressure was put on them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The draftees had to do slave labor under the supervision of military police. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Young and middle-aged Koreans were driven to do earth work for building a new dock and build ships there. Accidents often occurred, killing many Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A lot of them were killed during the U.S. air raid at around 7:00 on July 28, 1945. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The crimes related to the forcible drafting of Koreans and forced labor imposed upon them were state-sponsored crimes against humanity the government and the military of imperial Japan committed in close collaboration with businesses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTherefore, the Japanese Government should own due responsibility for these crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent reinvestigation into Japanese Government documents confirmed the fact that the Japanese imperialists forcibly drafted more than 8.4 million innocent Koreans from 1938 to 1945. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese Government has the international obligation to admit its legal responsibility for the forcible drafting of Koreans by the Japanese imperialists for forced labour on the basis of war laws and regulations and on the principles of international law  on humanitarianism and human rights and take effective measures to restore the honor and dignity of those who fell victim to such crimes in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan wants to live as a full-fledged member of the international community, though belatedly, it should sincerely apologize for the crimes against humanity the Japanese  imperialists committed in the past and probe the truth behind them and immediately take appropriate measures to restore the rights of the millions of victims trampled down by the Japanese imperialists.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
