            "content": "Crimes Committed by Unification Minister Exposed\r\n Pyongyang, July 14 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea Wednesday released an article dealing with the crimes committed by traitor Hyon In Thaek, puppet minister of Unification of south Korea, against reunification and the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t The most hideous crime committed by him was that he wantonly violated and scrapped the historic north-south declarations, the article points out, and continues:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No sooner had Hyon held the post as puppet minister of Unification than openly denied the inter-Korean declarations at the \"National Assembly\" hearing, asserting that the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration were the documents which were not ratified by the NA and the south was not duty-bound to implement them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He did not allow the utterance of word declaration in the ministry and retrogressively revised all kinds of laws and regulations enacted during the preceding regime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe is the author of watchwords \"no nukes, opening and 3,000 dollars\", an anti-DPRK confrontational policy, and an arch criminal who drove the inter-Korean relations to a catastrophe. He blustered that to expect any improvement in the south-north relations and cooperation from the north possessed of nukes is as foolish an act as trying to obtain fish from a tree.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This traitor dropped a check bar on the north-south dialogue, contacts, exchange and cooperation that had been brisk since the publication of the June 15 joint declaration. Hyon slandered the DPRK's sincere efforts for improving the inter-Korean relations as a \"change in its tactics\" and \"lack of sincerity\" and scuttled all the hard-won dialogues and contacts under the pretext of \"adhering to the principle.\" He got frantic in the confrontation with the DPRK under the pretext of the puppet warship case, completely derailing even the NGO cooperation projects which had been barely kept afloat. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This die-hard confrontational maniac has zealously involved himself in the anti-DPRK confrontational racket with extreme bitterness toward fellow countrymen. He raved that the \"north is not a fair-minded neighbor\" and \"the south cannot co-exist with the north in this bright world.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A particular mention should be made of the fact that he has gone reckless to realize his wild ambition for \"unification under liberal democracy\" in a bid to bring down even the system of the DPRK, talking about \"contingency\" and the like.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He, far from feeling guilty conscience for the prevailing grave situation in which the inter-Korean relations are facing a catastrophe, made a mockery of the public opinion by vociferating about \"upright south-north relations\" and the \"south-north relations heading for normal orbit.\" He even cried out for invariably maintaining the mainstay of the confrontational \"policy toward the north.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Koreans and all other Koreans have already passed a death sentence on traitor Hyon and he is fated to be ousted from his office sooner or later. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He will keenly realize what high price he will have to pay for his acts of treachery."

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun critica la gira americana de Lee Myung Bak\r\nPyongyang, 14 de julio (ATCC) -- Durante su reciente gira por paises americanos, el traidor Lee Myung Bak suplico la \"cooperacion internacional\" y el \"apoyo\" en el tema de hundimiento de la corbeta surcoreana \"Cheonan\" y fraguo la llamada \"declaracion especial\". \n\t\t\t\t\tEn un comentario individual divulgado el dia 14 al respecto, el diario Rodong Sinmun califico tal proceder de los titeres surcoreanos de expresion de su cronico servilismo a grandes potencias y fanatismo por la confrontacion fratricida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsa sucia accion hostil a la RPDC se encamina a endurecer la sancion y la presion contra esta en contubernio con las fuerzas extranjeras, precisa el comentarista y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl incidente de hundimiento de la corbeta surcoreana \"Cheonan\" no es un asunto a ser discutido en las afueras del Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste caso inventado por los mismos titeres surcoreanos suscita una fuerte censura y burla dentro y fuera del pais por ser un complot de punta a cabo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU finalizo el debate de ese tema limitandose a publicar hace poco una declaracion del presidente carente del correcto juicio o conclusion por el respecto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa situacion comprueba que la internacionalizacion del caso del \"Cheonan\" no es la solucion del problema.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSigue invariable la posicion de la RPDC de esclarecer hasta el final la verdad de ese incidente, puesto que las fuerzas surcoreanas en el poder se obstinan en vincularla con el incidente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo estas circunstancias, la solucion del problema esta en que las autoridades surcoreanas admitan al grupo de inspeccion del Comite de Defensa Nacional de la RPDC y realicen la investigacion conjunta entre ambas partes coreanas."

            "content": "RPDC esclarecera caso de la corbeta \"Cheonan\", subraya Rodong Sinmun\r\nPyongyang, 14 de julio (ATCC) -- Recientemente, el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU hizo publica la declaracion del presidente senalando que presta atencion a la posicion de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea de no tener nada que ver con el caso de hundimiento del buque de guerra \"Cheonan\" del Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t Esto deviene el fracaso de la diplomacia intrigante de las fuerzas hostiles a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Asi senala el periodico Rodong Sinmun en un comentario individual del dia 14 y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Desde el principio, el incidente del \"Cheonan\", farsa inventada por los titeres surcoreanos a instigacion de Estados Unidos, fue sospechado seriamente y produjo un revuelo dentro y fuera del pais por ser muy dubitativo y contradictorio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Mediante esa farsa, EE.UU. intentaba realmente llevar al borde de guerra la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Es imposible que la sociedad internacional se deje llevar por EE.UU., Japon y las autoridades titeres surcoreanas que tildan injustamente a la RPDC de \"sospechosa\" sin presentar ninguna prueba cientifica y objetiva.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  No se puede ganar nada con falsificaciones e intrigas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En fin, aunque se movieron con mucho jaleo para calumniar a la RPDC pretextando el caso del \"Cheonan\", los conspiradores no pudieron conseguir nada mas que la verguenza y el cansancio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En el mundo claro de hoy, la mentira y la falsificacion no podran salir con la suya mientras la inocencia y la justicia ganaran la opinion publica y la victoria. Esta verdad y leccion las graba ahora en su mente la sociedad internacional viendo en desenlace del incidente del \"Cheonan\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La RPDC, victima del caso, aclarara hasta el fin la verdad y ajustara la cuenta."
