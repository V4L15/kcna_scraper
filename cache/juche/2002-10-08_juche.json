            "content": "Kim Jong Il gives field guidance to construction in Samjiyon county \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 8 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Il said that there are many revolutionary battle sites, important bases of education in the revolutionary traditions in Samjiyon and Taehongdan counties and other areas of Mt. Paektu and to build up the battle sites well is a sacred work to resolutely defend and carry forward the revolutionary traditions, an eternal treasure of revolution..\r\n He gave field guidance on Monday to the construction in Samjiyon county, a time-honored land of revolution which has turned into a large open-air museum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was greatly satisfied to see the Paektu museum of educational significance built in Samjiyon township as one more splendid base of education in the revolutionary traditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said that the museum should be arranged better and run effectively to give purposeful education because it is an important educational site which will greatly contribute to imbuing visitors to the revolutionary battle sites with the revolutionary traditions of the party. And he indicated tasks and ways to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Looking round the Chonji Health Complex and a hotel, new service establishments, he said that even a house should be built best to meet the need of the new century and everything be constructed as required by the era of the workers' party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He visited the new house where the family of Jon Jang Ryong lives. He said that the house was designed and built well to suit the features of the highland and such more modern dwelling houses should be built for the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He looked round new buildings and set forth the tasks which would serve as important guidelines in the construction in Samjiyon county. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He noted with great satisfaction that the members of the party propaganda officials' shock brigades from ministries, national institutions and all provinces have brought about such leaping advance and innovations as changing the appearance of Samjiyon with intense loyalty in a matter of one and half years since volunteering to build up better Samjiyon county which has many historic sites of President Kim Il Sung's revolutionary activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHe highly praised their proud achievements. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   \r\n"

General Assembly on October 2.\r\n Holding that an \"anti-terror war\" should not be waged to attain the strategic objective of a specified country, he stressed that attempts to escalate this war into different parts of the world without any reasonable ground are only rendering the world more unstable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Singling out a number of countries as targets of preemptive attack and attempting to carry out even undisguised armed intervention after listing them as members of an \"axis of evil\" and \"terror-sponsoring states\" under the pretext of \"anti-terror\" to meet one's own interests is, in fact, a form of state-sponsored terrorism, he noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-terror struggle should be led by the U.N. under any circumstances. It should be strictly based on the purpose and principles of the U.N. Charter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the consistent stand of the DPRK government to oppose all forms of terrorism and any support for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will strongly denounce and reject all forms of terrorism including acts of organizing, supporting, inciting and conniving at it in the future, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He expressed the hope that the meeting would have exhaustive discussions on realistic ways to combat terrorism and reach an agreement on them in line with the aim and principles of the U.N. Charter.    \r\n\r\n"

Looking it for a while, the president said to officials to bring it to professionals for correction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The officials concerned invited an old man who had a profound knowledge of calligraphy and requested him to correct it without saying who wrote it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After studying it, he rose up from the seat and politely said: \"I have never seen such a wonderful calligraphy. It was written by a great man. It is not proper for me to correct it.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the officials requested another calligrapher, he also said same words.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
