Korea\r\n Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- The South Korean puppets are reportedly seeking to strengthen the \"wartime recruitment system,\" making the provocation of a new war a fait accompli.\r\n   It is illustrated by the ongoing \"military restructuring.\"   \r\n   The \"Ministry of National Defense\" formed the \"committee for the promotion of military reforms\" allegedly to coordinate the structure of the puppet army modelled after the U.S. aqmy in conformity with the present situation.  It intends to work out a bellicose plan to mobilize all the human and material resources in South Korea for the provocation of a new war.\r\n   The plan, on the premise that a new war is certain to be unleashed on the Korean peninsula, envisages that the existing \"wartime recruitment system\" will be expanded and instituted as one of enlisting all the related resources including organizations and manpower.\r\n   The \"Minister of National Defense\" in a press interview on April 6, cried for \"military restructuring,\" saying it makes it possible to use civilian resources as war potentials in emergency.\r\n   The plan is being accelerated now when provocative utterances against the north come from the upper echelons of the military. The fact makes us doubtful about the present South Korean regime's willingness for dialogue and reunification.\r\n   The South Korean rulers should draw a proper lesson from the disgraceful ends of the former dictators who pursued confrontation and war against the north, depending on outsiders.    \r\n\r\n"

The nature does not change at all because aggression and plunder are a basic attribute of imperialism and its mode of existence.\r\n   Modern imperialism is a main obstacle to the trend toward independence in our era. It, realigned as allied forces headed by the united states, is  trying more desperately than ever before to block the trend toward independence and maintain the old international order of domination and subjugation.\r\n   The imperialists, who are driven into a serious political and economic crisis, are further revealing aggressiveness and belligerency to find a way out in war. They are also trying to bring to their knees the world progressive people by means of military threat and blackmail, economic subjugation and ideological and cultural disintegration, with nuclear weapons in one hand and dollars in the other.\r\n   In order to realize global independence, it is necessary to oppose domination and subjugation of the imperialists, establish a fair international order based on independence, check and frustrate their moves of aggression and war and defend peace and security of the world. To this end, all the forces of independence should adhere to the principled stand against imperialism and direct a sharp edge of attack to it. \r\nAnd they should shatter the imperialists' moves of division and alienation and strengthen friendship and unity of the world progressive people.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The whole water area is inhabited by a variety of insects and caddis flies and many kinds of living things such as gastropoda, corbicula and freshwater  fish propagate themselves. \r\n   Following such food chain, the number of fish living in clear water, such as mandarin fish, minnow, bitterling and gray mullet is on the increase and various kinds of water-birds fly in.\r\n    The air in the river basin is very clear and fresh. \r\n    According to the measurement of density of floating dust, the average annual value per cubic metre of the air is 0.08 mg and is lower than the permissible limit by the environmental standard.\r\n   Flora in the river basin is also diverse. In Pyongyang greening is under way every year. The green belt for each citizen is now 58 square metres.\r\n   As woods are exuberant and all parts of the city are ablaze with flowers, so many birds and bees fly in. \r\n   Pheasant, goldfinch, blacknaped oriole, woodpecker and pigeon that like the fresh air and quiet places build their nests in trees on Moran Hill in the central part of the city. More than 200 species of birds find their way into the area of the West Sea Barrage to inhabit there. Among them are black-faced spoonbill, yellow beaked white heron, red-cheeked cormorant and other rare birds that are sensitive to the ecological environment and small in number in the world.\r\n   The time when acacia flowers are in full bloom is a nice season for the beekeepers.

And he ushered in a great heyday of army building by training the KPA as the main force of the Juche revolutionary cause.\r\n   All the servicemen have prepared themselves to be a-match-for-a-hundred combatants and the KPA's equipment has become more powerful and modernized. So, the revolutionary armed forces of Korea have become invincible forces equipped with both powerful attack and defence means capable of defeating any formidable enemy at a stroke.\r\n   The worker-peasant red guards, the young red guards and other civilian armed forces have been prepared not only to carry out joint operations with regular armed forces but to annihilate the invaders in any place by themselves and reliably defend their workplaces and villages in emergency. \r\n   All areas of the country have turned into unconquerable fortresses.\r\n   Korea's defence industry has been able to satisfactorily meet by itself the demand for efficient military equipment suitable to modern war.\r\n   The Workers' Party, army and people of Korea, which constitute an integrated whole, have defended socialism and exalted the dignity and might of Juche Korea and Kim Il Sung's nation, undaunted by the imperialists' blockade, acute situation and severe trials. It is the victory of General Kim Jong Il's great leadership and a historic miracle which can be wrought only in Korea under His outstanding and tested leadership.\r\n   Owing to the reckless arms buildup and war preparations by the separatists at home and abroad, the situation of the Korean peninsula has been rendered very strained.\r\n   Our revolutionary armed forces are exercising utmost vigilance against the escalating war preparations by the U.S. and South Korean warmaniacs and keeping themselves in full combat readiness.\r\n   If the warmongers continue fostering confrontation and ignite a war in defiance of our repeated warnings, the Korean army and people will annihilate all the enemies with merciless strikes and uproot the source of war on the Korean peninsula.\r\n   The South Korean authorities and politicians should draw a proper lesson from the grave consequences of the successive rulers' dependence on outsiders and anti-north confrontation policy. And they should have a stand of national independence and seek uniting with the fellow countrymen in the north and shaping the destiny of the country and the nation together with them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
