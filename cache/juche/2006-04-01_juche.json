Under socialist society the popular masses lead a worthwhile life as the proud master of the state sovereignty and means of production, creating and enjoying material wealth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n People demand that they glorify their social and political life and live amid the love and trust of social collectives. It is possible only under the socialist society in which the popular masses take the position of master. It is because socialism embodies the relations of comradely unity and cooperation, love and trust in all fields of social life.\r\n Only socialist society makes it possible to strengthen the unity and cooperation of the collectives, enhance the creative enthusiasm of all members of the collectives and sufficiently meet the independent demands of the collectives and individuals altogether.\r\n The advantages of socialist society can be seen in the reality of the DPRK. The advantages of Korean-style socialism centering on the popular masses have their essential source in the might of the single-minded unity of the leader, the Party and the masses. The Korean army and people, single-heartedly united around the headquarters of the revolution, have devoted their all to the prosperity and rosy future of the country. It is the features of Korean society that all the people form a big harmonious family to help and lead forward each other and devote themselves to society and the collectives. Korean-style socialism is the advantageous socialism in which all the people become the master of everything, everything serves them and their independent and creative life is kept in full bloom.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They will never barter Korean-style socialism, their life and soul, for anything else.\r\n The Juche idea is a militant banner that helped Korean-style socialism shine as the socialism of national independence firmly guaranteeing independence of the country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our Party and people have built socialism our own way according to our independent viewpoint and faith under the banner of Juche, not relying on any existing theories or others' experience. Thus they could successfully build in this land a powerful socialist state, independent in politics, self-supporting in economy and self-reliant in national defence, which defends independence of the country and the nation.\r\n The Juche idea is a powerful ideological weapon which provided the firm revolutionary forces enough to defend and accomplish the cause of socialism to the end.\r\n The Songun idea of the Party with its root on the Juche idea serves as a militant banner which made Korean-style socialism shine as an invincible socialism with everlasting viability. As the Songun idea illuminates the road ahead, in our country the unity of the army and people based on the revolutionary soldier spirit has been firmly materialized, the single-minded unity of the Party and the revolutionary ranks strengthened on a high level and powerful military capacity provided to firmly defend the gains of socialism achieved with blood.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The new premix promotes metabolism, digestion and absorption of animals and makes them produce large amounts of essential amino acids in their bodies so as to raise fattening and egg-laying rate, he added.\r\n The premix additive has been applied to the Hungju Chicken Farm and various other poultry farms of the country where meat and egg production has remarkably increased.\r\n For the chickens which were fed with the new premix for over 40 days, their egg-laying rate rose by 85.4 percent and the survival rate by 95 percent in the average. And for the ducks, the survival rate rose by 98 percent and their egg-laying rate by 80 percent. The weight increment of the pig fed with the new premix is 1.2 kilograms a day.\r\n The blood test of the animals shows that the numbers of red corpuscle, hemoglobin, platelet and GPT went up by 30.6, 32.7, 59.9 and 12.5 percent respectively.\r\n Meanwhile, a factory with a capacity of producing thousands of tons of new premix a year has been built to supply it to poultry farms throughout the country.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They show that the then people angled for various kinds of fishes, big and small, in rivers and seas.\r\n Many angling places have come into being in different parts of the country and rivers and reservoirs are teeming with fishes. Angling fans are growing in number day by day and national angling contests are organized every year.
