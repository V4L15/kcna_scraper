Paektu under leader Kim Jong Il's army-based guidance to bring earlier the ultimate victory of the revolution of Juche.\r\n This tradition comprehensively represents the great army-based idea and theory, leadership exploits and experience of the three generals of Mt. Paektu and serves as the most valuable revolutionary treasure of Kim Il Sung's nation, which is decisive of the victory of the revolution of Juche, the editorial says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The give-priority-to-the-army tradition in the Korean revolution was established by President Kim Il Sung in Mt. Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a tradition of directing utmost efforts to the army building, considering arms as the most powerful means for the victory of revolution, and a tradition of winning one victory after another as it makes it possible to overcome grave difficulties and push ahead vigorously with the overall cause of revolution in reliance upon revolutionary armed forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tradition has been successfully carried forward and developed by Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His great leadership finds its expression in the fact that he laid down the army-based line as the guiding line of revolution for the victory of the cause of independence and adopted the army-based policy as the main political mode of socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His wise leadership provided to glorify the tradition lies in that he built up the driving force of the revolution with the people's army as a model and is ushering in a new era of national prosperity with the people's army as a main force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The social foundation of the DPRK is growing strong and a fresh leaping advance is now being made in the building of a powerful nation. The credit for this goes to Kim Jong Il who has successfully carried forward and developed the tradition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The social foundation of the DPRK will always remain solid and a powerful nation will surely emerge earlier than expected as long as the tradition is given steady continuity.     \r\n\r\n"
