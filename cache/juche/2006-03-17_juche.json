            "content": "U.S. Moves to \"Spread Democracy\" Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 16 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists' \"spread of democracy\" is intended to quell the popular masses' desire for independence and block their progress, wreck the global peace and security and Americanize the world community.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. much publicized \"offer of democracy\" is nothing but a sinister trick to use it as a political and military lever for intervention and aggression on other countries, the article points out, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. reactionary ruling quarters talk much about \"freedom\" and \"democracy\" not to protect the interests and rights of the popular masses but to maintain and strengthen their reactionary political system and exploit and plunder the masses in a more crafty way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The process of reconciliation, cooperation and peace has become a trend of the times. The U.S., however, is working in real earnest to attain its aggressive and predatory aims under the signboard of \"spread of democracy\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reactionary nature of the U.S.-touted \"establishment of a democratic order\" finds its expression in the fact that the U.S. imperialists are fighting the \"war on terrorism\" in a more legitimate manner, claiming that it is to protect \"democracy\". The \"war on terrorism\" is, at present, one of their principal methods for spreading the American-style \"democracy\" worldwide. \r\n The \"color revolution\" is another method for \"export of democracy\" invented by the U.S. to dominate the world. The U.S. seeks to destabilize those countries which are not listed as targets of the \"war on terrorism\" by orchestrating that \"color revolution\" and set up pro-American governments there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. moves for \"export of democracy\" are little short of its interference in other countries' internal affairs and a violation of their sovereignty. It is pressurizing other countries and nations to accept and introduce the American political mode and lifestyle. Herein lies the reactionary nature of its moves for the \"establishment of a democratic order\" and \"spread of democracy\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration's smear campaign against the DPRK's political system and its persistent \"human rights\" offensive against it are intended to spread the American-style \"democracy\" to the DPRK with an aim to destabilize and bring down Korean-style socialism.       \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The gentries of the GNP, descendants of the successive fascist dictators, are getting frantic in their moves to revive the period of the past fascist dictatorship with a lust for power, far from apologizing to the nation and quitting the political arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the past history of treacheries is left intact and the criminals remain unpunished, it would be impossible to prevent the repetition of the crime-woven history, to say nothing of the advance of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The pro-U.S. conservative forces including the GNP are the main target of the struggle to \"liquidate the past history\" in south Korea. The GNP group and conservative media in conspiracy with them are dead set against the struggle of the progressives for reform and other people to \"liquidate the past history\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality shows that only when the south Korean people spearhead their struggle to the GNP and smash the challenges and obstructive moves of the pro-U.S. conservative forces can they clearly liquidate the past history of crimes and realize their desire for independence, democracy and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people from all walks of life should continue to wage a dynamic struggle to \"liquidate the past history\" to the end in order to deal a sledge-hammer blow at the GNP, a mass of crimes, build an independent and democratic new society and put spurs to the movement for national reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

So we are quickening our steps in order to learn from the lofty intention of young Kim Il Sung, who made the above-said journey when he was eleven years old.\"  This was what the head of the group of participants in the study tour from Yonpho Middle School in Kim Hyong Jik County, Ryanggang Province, said when interviewed by KCNA. \r\n The above-said study tour is an annual event in the DPRK. The first contingent of participants in the study tour is now heading for Mangyongdae, the cradle of the revolution, after leaving Phophyong, a historical place, on March 1.\r\nThey are visiting various revolutionary sites, loudly singing songs. They are also conducting colorful political and cultural activities to deeply grasp the immortal revolutionary exploits performed by President Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nYoung Kim Il Sung set out on the 250-mile journey for learning from Badaogou in China on March 16, Juche 12 (1923), true to the lofty idea of his father Kim Hyong Jik, an indomitable revolutionary fighter, that a man born in Korea should know it without fail.\r\nHe crossed steep mountains and arrived at Mangyongdae, his native place, via Kanggye, Hyangsan, Kaechon and other places. During this long journey he witnessed the miserable life of the people in the homeland and hardened his resolution to defeat the Japanese imperialists and liberate the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary faith he cherished during his 250-mile journey for learning prompted him to make a 250-mile journey for national liberation two years later. And thanks to this faith he could liberate the country and build a socialist state centered on the popular masses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe participants in the study tour are firmly determined to learn from the revolutionary idea of the President and become strong pillars in the Songun era who would exalt the dignity and honor of the country and the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
