Such things are often to happen in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was in the latter half of April that a worker with serious burns was hospitalized to the Hospital attached to the Ministry of Railways. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was in a critical condition owing to a third-degree burn on the 62 percent of his whole body and laryngeal edema caused by windpipe burn.\r\n Medical workers of the hospital buckled down treatment to bring the patient back to life. They held an emergency consultation and took concrete measures. And they put their heart and soul into the treatment day and night. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the day when the third skin grafting operation was held, the director, officials, doctors and nurses and even a 70-year old doctor of the hospital donated pieces of their skin to the patient. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to the 18 times of blood transfusion, application of various medicines, 8 times of surgeries, big and small, and warm care shown by doctors and nurses, the patient grew better and had his health recovered some 150 days after his hospitalization.\r\n Choe Po Sun, vice-director in charge of technology, told KCNA that the efforts of the collective which is united with the same idea and will wrought such a miracle and the resurrection of the patient could be seen only under the Korean-style socialist system in which the people's life is valued most.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

A spokesman for the Central Committee of the KSDP issued a statement Thursday in this regard.\r\n Vehemently denouncing the GNP as a group of anti-reunification traitors, the statement continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KSDP has long been recognized as a political party as it has waged a ceaseless struggle for the prosperity of the country and its independent and peaceful reunification against flunkeyism and dogmatism since its foundation.\r\n Such being a hard fact, Jong did not hesitate to let loose such vituperation against the KSDP. This was prompted by his sinister intention to falsify truth and mislead public opinion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His reckless remarks can not be viewed as his personal view. They reflect the view of the GNP keen on inciting confrontation between the fellow countrymen and breeding plots against the country's reunification and the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will never pardon the GNP keen on hatching plots against the north and inciting confrontation with it while hurling mud at the dignified political system in it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He learned in detail with the progress made in the project, looking down on a vast reservoir and going round the construction site. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The project has reached a final stage though it is not long since the construction of the power station started, he said, adding that this signal success is a striking demonstration of the persevering spirit and will of the officials and other working people in Jongphyong County which has a tradition of an indomitable struggle.\r\n He highly appreciated the achievements made by people in the county, noting that they have built a lot of structures by highly displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, turning the county into a place better to live in. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He underscored the need to successfully build the power station into a structure of lasting value and set forth tasks and ways to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The next leg of his guidance was the Kwangpho Duck Farm.\r\n Making the round of the newly built processing shop, he sent high appreciation and thanks to the builders and employees of the farm for having devoted themselves to the prosperity of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ducks belong to poultry of great economic value as it is easy to raise them and they provide highly nutritious meat and eggs, he said, stressing the need to raise ducks in a big way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that it is important to satisfactorily solve the problem of feed in order to keep the production of duck going at a high rate, he underlined the need for those cooperative farms in charge of feed for this farm to steadily boost the yield of grains.\r\n He called for earnestly conducting researches into ducks of good stock which grow fast while consuming less feed and developing them and widely applying technology for putting the breeding on a scientific basis to suit the physiological characteristic of ducks. \r\n The Kwangpho Duck Farm is a historic farm associated with the great efforts made by President Kim Il Sung who was so considerate of the work to provide the people with a lot of meat and eggs, he said, stressing the need to continue energetically pushing ahead with the process of modernizing and scientizing the farm and dynamically going ahead with a long-term plan to boost the production capacity and thus set a model for the production of livestock products. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While providing field guidance to South Hamgyong Province, he set forth tasks to be undertaken to put the economic work in the province on a higher stage.\r\n South Hamgyong Province has a great role to play in the nation's economic development as it has many key industries including chemical, machine-building and mining industries, he noted, expressing expectation and conviction that the province would perform a vanguard role in making a breakthrough towards a fresh leap forward. \r\n He was accompanied by Hong Song Nam, chief secretary of the South Hamgyong Provincial Committee of the WPK, Kim Phung Gi, chairman of the South Hamgyong Provincial People's Committee, Kim Ki Nam, secretary of the Central Committee of the WPK, Pak Nam Gi, department director of the C.C., WPK, and Jang Song Thaek and Ri Jae Il, first vice department directors of the same.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
