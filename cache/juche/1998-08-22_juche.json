Worse still, they are  employing every conceivable means to block even their humanitarian assistance.\r\n   Such behaviour of the South Korean authorities shows that \"separation of politics from economy\" and \"encouragement of non-governmental cooperation\" on their lips are an empty talk and an advertizement to curry favour with businessmen and people of South Korea.\r\n    It cannot be a policy for cooperation and exchange with the north.\r\n    Theirs is a criminal anti-north, anti-reunification policy which opposes exchange and cooperation and totally blocks the desire of the nation for reunification.\r\n   \"Separation of politics from economy\" advertized by them is  hypocrisy. Their scheme to poke their nose into non-governmental cooperation  reveals that it is a variant of \"politics-economy fusion\".\r\n   If the \"government\" meddles in the non-governmental cooperation, the \"Agency for National Security Planning\" and \"the Ministry of National Unification,\"  headquarters of anti-north plots, will poke their noses in to this affair.  \r\nThen, non-governmental cooperation will be frustrated.\r\n   If the South Korean authorities truly want exchange and cooperation with the north, they should no longer obstruct non-governmental cooperation.\r\n   We will watch their attitude.    \r\n\r\n"

But this is a sophysm to cover up the aggressive nature of the exercise, the news analyst of the paper says, and goes on:\r\n   The exercise is a three dimensional offensive operation drill to make a forestalling attack on the DPRK. Involved in it are huge armed forces enough to wage a war of aggression.\r\n   It is a dangerous adventure to examine, master and perfect the war scenario  they have already worked out against the DPRK. This revealed that \"improvement of inter-Korean relations\" and \"reconciliation and cooperation\" on the lips of the South Korean authorities are no more than hypocrisy.\r\n   The enemy must not be mistaken. If warmongers dare to pounce upon us, we will shower thunderbolts of revenge on them with self-defence power.\r\n   The United States should reexamine its anachronistic Korea policy and refrain from  egging the South Korean authorities on to confrontation and war against the DPRK.  \r\n\r\n"

To cope with this, steps have been taken to increase agricultural production as well as to take substitute food.\r\n   Detailed arrangements have been made to produce substitute food through introducing science.\r\n   The Ministry of Food Administration delivered several tons of seed of amaranth to provinces early this year. \r\n   Officials from the ministry went down to all provinces to find its wider application in close cooperation with local technicians.\r\n   An exhibit concerning the cultivation of amaranth presented by Wang Song Thae, a teacher at the Samsok college of agro-mechanics, was awarded a special prize at the 13th National Science and Technology Festival held in May.\r\n   Its cultivation has stood the test and it is now in wide use in people's diets.\r\n   Amaranth is processed into noodle, bread, pancake, cake, sweets and confectionery, soy and beanpaste.\r\n   An exhibition of over 120 kinds of food drew public attention in Kangso district, Nampho. These food items were made of 100 tons of amaranth, the first crops this year.\r\n   The foodstuffs which were made at the proportion of five amaranth to five grain powder, including maize and wheat, or three to seven, were popular  at the exhibition.\r\n   Other plants are also in wide use for substitute food.\r\n   Those at the Phyongsong City Food Administration Agency collected various species of plants to produce substitute foods and supply them to the people. They decomposed the fibroid material, neutralized the poisonous elements and enriched the albuminous substances. At the proportion of 60-50 to 40-50 maize powder, foodstuffs are being processed.\r\n  Dr. Kim Sok Gun and other research workers have recently completed the research into the production processes and methods of chlorella.      \r\n \r\n"
