The Japanese Sankei Shimbun is busy echoing their assertions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Tuesday observes in a signed commentary in this regard: This is nothing but a despicable diatribe which can be staged only by the ill-famed paper on the payroll of the Japanese reactionary forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not the first time that the Sankei Shimbun staged a false propaganda against the DPRK, backed by the Japanese reactionaries. By echoing the sophism of the Japanese right-wing conservatives denying the crimes related to the \"comfort women\" for the imperial Japanese army the paper stripped bare once again its ugly colors as a venal trumpeter and a reptile paper. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Objectivity, impartiality and truth are the life and soul of the media in their activities. No media bereft of them can ever win the trust of the public. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That is why the unbiased public is spitting at the despicable act of the Sankei Shimbun and suspecting its ulterior design. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Judging from its precedents, it might have released such misinformation in return for a petty amount of money provided to it by the Japanese right-wing conservatives or at their prodding. It is beyond doubt that the Japanese reactionaries were behind the false propaganda staged by the Sankei Shimbun as regards the above-said crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The more frequently Abe's forces use such reptile media as the Sankei Shimbun for spreading misinformation intended to persistently deny and misrepresent the above-said crimes, swimming against the trend of the times, the more saliently it will disclose their black-hearted intention.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Paektu and serves as an effective treasured sword for protecting the country and nation as it guarantees the sovereignty of the country and nation and their right to existence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to protect the sovereignty and independence it is necessary to counter the military hegemony of the U.S. imperialists by force of arms. This is the truth taught by the historical experience of the Korean revolution and the present times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aggressive and predatory nature of the imperialists will remain unchanged as long as they are alive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If a country and nation make a concession to invaders, they will allow their sovereignty and right to existence to be wantonly violated by those enemies as they are seized by the ambition for domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialist aggressors' \"protection\" by force of arms always serves as a lever for interference in others' internal affairs, as a means of threat and blackmail and a source of national dissension. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a stark reality of modern colonies that are subject to national disgrace and insult, deprived of any right to say what they want under the jackboots of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the strong army that guarantees the invincible spirit of reacting to the imperialists' high-handed stand with the toughest one and the independent determination to handle all matters according to an independent judgment and resolution, decisively frustrating any foreign pressure and interference. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some countries, each with vast land and rich resources, were unable to beat back the military invasion by the enemies and their peoples are languishing in the mire of destitution and poverty.  The lesson taught by them goes to prove that an army is the most precious treasured sword for ensuring the existence and development of any nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A rosy future is in store for the people, who though not fed well, give priority to the development of the defence industry, build their army into a strong one and convert their whole country into an impregnable fortress in order to guarantee the existence and prosperity of the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The song sings of the morning star which rises in the dark sky of Korea and sheds bright rays all over the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In particular, Kim Jong Suk, an anti-Japanese war hero, regarded defending Commander Kim Il Sung shouldering the destiny of the Korean nation as the first and foremost duty of the army and devoted her all for it.  Her meritorious deed is a paragon for the army and people today in defending the leader with their very lives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The self-sacrificing spirit displayed by the O Jung Hup-led 7th regiment to protect the revolutionary headquarters during the anti-Japanese armed struggle serves as a living example in arming the whole army with spirit of defending the leader at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the hard-fought Fatherland Liberation War, a great number of servicepersons including Ri Su Bok, Kang Ho Yong, Ri Tae Hun and An Yong Ae dedicated their lives for their leader, fatherland and people, as the first generation of the revolution did. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the 1990s when imperialists intensified the moves to stifle the DPRK in an unprecedentedly vicious way, the KPA discharged its honorable duty and mission as the revolutionary armed forces for defending the revolutionary leadership with very life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The great love and trust shown by Supreme Commander Kim Jong Il for the soldiers on his continued Songun inspection tour to safeguard the destiny of the country were the great driving force to train the whole army as the vanguard unit for devotedly defending the leader and the crack death-defying corps for protecting the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the KPA officers and men are full of a firm resolution and spirit to defend at all costs Kim Jong Il who shoulders the destiny and future of the nation.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
