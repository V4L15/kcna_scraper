            "content": "How far will Japan go in immoral conduct?\r\n Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- Japan is openly inciting militarism among people, while going ahead with legislative arrangements related to the \"Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation Guidelines\" aimed at dominating Korea and the rest of Asia with military force.\r\n   Japanese right-wingers have described Japan's history of aggression as a \"just cause,\" released a movie praising top-class war criminals as \"heroes\" and deceived the rising generation into believing that massacres committed by the Japanese imperialists in Asian countries are \"groundless.\"\r\n   Surprisingly, they have alleged that some 200,000 women of Korea, china and other countries who were forced to serve as sex slaves for the Japanese army \"responded to civilians' call for recruitment voluntarily or for money.\"\r\n   Does the allegation stem from the Japanese rightist politicians' shamelessness and ignorance or did Japan really carry out  \"just cause of liberating Asia\" from the whites' domination?\r\n   The answer has already been given by the stern judgement of history.\r\n   The Japanese imperialists' aggression of Korea and China and the following pacific war were an unheard-of immoral crime prompted by Japan's ambition for conquering Asia and emerging as \"world empire.\"\r\n   For that purpose, the Japanese imperialists committed slaughters in southeast Asian countries. Especially, their crime against the Korean people is beyond human ken.\r\n   During the occupation of Korea, they abducted and took away some 6 million young people and forced mediaeval labor on them and killed more than one million people in cold blood.\r\n   Nearly 200,000 Korean women were kidnapped and forced to serve as sex slaves for the Japanese army. Many of them were dismembered or burnt to death.\r\n   After the war, the far eastern international tribunal, on the basis of collected documents and witnesses' testimonies and on the principle of international law, judged the war started by the Japanese imperialists as a horrible, immoral crime for reducing Korean and other Asian people to slaves and as a brutal, predatory war and punished Tojo and other top-class war criminals.\r\n   Are the Japanese statesmen and conservative politicians who are styling themselves \"intelligent people\" really unaware of this? They must be well aware of it. Their behavior is an act of brazen-faced militarists, a mockery of history and a challenge to the international community.\r\n   Then, why are the rightist reactionaries of Japan embellishing the crime-woven history, totally challenging human morality?\r\n   This is because they have still harboured the ambition for repeating the history of aggression and settling the \"deep-seated grudge.\"\r\n   Actually, Japan has frantically revived militarism over the past 50 odd years after the war in the hope of being revenged for its defeat.\r\n   Japan, which has already become the second largest country in military expenditures, was provided with assurances by the united states through the review of the \"defense cooperation guidelines\" in September last year, the assurances of allowing it to militarily interfere in all issues of whole Asia, going beyond the far east. Now it is pushing ahead with legislative arrangements.\r\n   Japanese militarism is not a departed spirit but already began revealing its true colors as aggressor and emerged as a dangerous hotbed of aggression in Asia.\r\n   The militarists want to satisfy the century-old ambition for \"Greater East Asia Coprosperity Sphere\" at any cost.\r\n   This is why the reactionaries have persistently negated the history of aggression and incited militarism.\r\n   By doing so, they also seek to avoid a state compensation for the immoral crime committed by Japan in the past.\r\n   Japan is a war criminal state which plunged Asia into disasters. In view of international law and morality, it is an unavoidable responsibility and obligation of the war criminal to make an apology and compensation to the victim.   \r\n   In the past, Japan's high-ranking authorities expressed \"regret\" and \"repentence\" when they visited Asian nations. \r\n   But it is clear that such an empty talk which has been repeated over the past five decades is not enough to remove distrust of the international community and victims.\r\n   What angers the international community is the attitude of the Japanese authorities steadily evading the state responsibility for the crime related to the \"comfort women\" issue.\r\n   The issue should be solved in relationship between the  Japanese government, which is the perpetrator, and the \"comfort women\" who are victims. However, the Japanese authorities had the audacity to set up the \"national fund\" and try to flee from all the responsibility for the crime.\r\n   This is the real features of Japan, which is boasting of its strong economy and seeking to become a political power.\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries must clearly know that the settlement of the past is not a matter which they can handle willfully.\r\n   Their continued immoral acts and delays in the settlement of the past will only aggravate the distrust of the international community and enlarge their compensation.    \r\n   \r\n        \r\n\r\n"

Korea\r\n Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- A few days ago, the South Korean puppets arrested students of Inje College and its graduates on the strength of the \"National Security Law\" for the mere reason that they formed a campus organisation called \"independence ranks\" with the Juche idea as the platform.\r\n   Branding this arrest as an unjustifiable suppression of ideology, a fascist infringement upon free learning, a news analyst of Rodong Sinmun today says:\r\n   The immortal Juche idea is a great ideology which indicates the road of human liberation and national emancipation. Accordingly, it is a worldwide trend to study this idea.\r\n   It is only too reasonable and natural for South Korean people to learn the Juche idea.\r\n   However, the South Korean puppets are trying to prevent people from learning the Juche idea. Theirs is a foolish misdeed.\r\n   They are hell bent on the suppression of the followers of the Juche idea, feeling fearful of this idea, an ideology of the world.\r\n   This clearly proves that they have no prospects.\r\n   We consider the brutal suppression of the Juche idea followers to be a challenge to and provocation against us.\r\n   We will never remain a passive onlooker to this suppression.    \r\n\r\n"

It is indeed an infringement upon my human rights.\r\n   I denounce the misdeed of the \"ANSP\" as an unbearable infringement upon human rights and morality.\r\n   I well know about the plot-breeding tool.\r\n   I think that by doing so, the \"ANSP\" has fully revealed its despicable colors as a group of anti-north plotters and its immorality.\r\n   The fact proves that the \"ANSP\" engaging in anti-north plots should be dissolved totally and immediately as demanded by all fellow countrymen.\r\n   But the South Korean authorities are not only keeping it intact in such a way as renaming and readjusting it but planning to upgrade its position. This treacherous act adds to the crime.\r\n   I, availing myself of this opportunity, lodge a strong protest with the south.\r\n   It is the \"ANSP\" that committed the crime, but the south blames me and the north for it in connection with the \"north wind.\" such a behavior of the south is really despicable.\r\n   I urge the south to make an apology for the plot and stop the anti-north confrontation it is intensifying under the pretext of the case.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
