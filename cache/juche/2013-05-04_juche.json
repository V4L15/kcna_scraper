            "content": "Japan Warned of Rapidly Veering to Ultra-right: News Analyst\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, May 4 (KCNA) -- The Abe government is leading the Japanese society to veer to the ultra-right, reminiscent of a war state more than 70 years back.\n\t\t\t\t\t It is regarding it as its basic strategy for winning the July Diet election to rally conservative forces through the society's lurch to the ultra-right.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prime minister openly chanted the slogan \"Long live the emperor\", stirring up an atmosphere of militarism in the \"era of empire\". Visits of ministers and lawmakers from the ruling and opposition parties to Yasukuni Shrine have become more frequent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe so-called \"ceremony for restoring sovereignty\" has been held in Japan as a non-governmental event of right-wing organizations for 17 years. But it was held at a governmental level for the first time this year. The Abe cabinet has become more undisguised in its attempt to revise the Constitution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Before and after taking office as prime minister, Abe said \"he would begin his work by revising Article 96 of the Constitution\". At a press conference held on April 19 he expressed again his will to revise the article aimed to ease the necessary requirements for proposing the revision of the Constitution. Abe's intention to rewrite the relevant article defining the norms for the constitutional revision is aimed to revise Article 9, the core article of the Constitution by lowering the threshold of the revision. Article 9 bans Japan from possessing combat forces and exercising the right to participate in a war and that to collective self-defense. Its revision would make it possible for Japan to have a war constitution and help provide a legal and institutional mechanism for turning Japan into a military giant and launching overseas aggression. Then, Japan will be able to send its aggression forces to any region of the world for military operations, unhindered by its domestic l\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t aw.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the scenario of the present Japanese ruling forces to liquidate the \"Pacifist Constitution\" by rewriting Article 96 and totally revising Article 9. Now no one would question in which direction Japan is going.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters is that the ultra-right conservative forces are exercising ever-increasing influence on the process of veering to the Right and that of turning itself into a military giant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ultra-right forces of Japan are desperately pushing forward the process to consolidate the power and fascistize the society, going beyond the phase of exercising influence on the authorities' policy making. A war constitution may appear in Japan any time. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's rapid lurch to the ultra-right means, in essence, the conversion into a war state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The militarist ambition of the Japanese rightist reactionaries is expanding worldwide, going beyond East Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The danger of war is increasing day by day due to these rightist reactionaries who openly call for reviving the \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere.\" This is posing a great threat to global peace and security.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Revived Japanese militarism is bound to bring a horrible war disaster again not only to Asia but to the rest of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The despicable behavior of the Abe government pushing Japan's society to the ultra-right is arousing serious caution and concern among the people of countries and regions in East Asia and the rest of the world."

Therefore, this can not be a bargaining chip, says Rodong Sinmun Saturday in a bylined article.\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For nearly seven decades after the first manufacture of nuclear weapons in the world, there have been many wars, big or small, in different regions of the world. It was only nuclear weapons states that evaded military aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No aggressor will dare make an attack on a country that is equipped with nuclear weapons of precision strike capabilities no matter wherever their bases might be on earth. The stronger nuclear strike abilities will present greater strength for deterring aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Peace and prosperity as well as the happy life of the Koreans are guaranteed by the powerful nuclear force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Peace has been preserved on the Korean Peninsula, the most unstable hotspot in the world. It is thanks to the efforts of the DPRK which has bolstered up the deterrent for self-defense in the face of the evermore undisguised war moves for aggression on the part of the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the DPRK had not held up the banner of Songun and failed to build the powerful war deterrent, a nuclear war might have broken out on the peninsula long ago.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the puppet regime, afraid of the DPRK's smaller, lighter and diversified nuclear deterrence, are making desperate efforts to remove it at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation goes to clearly prove that the DPRK's nuclear deterrence serves as the first and foremost means for defense to completely contain the U.S. imperialists and the puppet warmongers and ensure the peaceful circumstances and stable conditions for the development and prosperity of the country and the nation."
