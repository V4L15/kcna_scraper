            "content": "National Meeting Marks Kim Jong Il's Start of Work at WPK\r\n Pyongyang, June 18 (KCNA) -- A national meeting was held at the People's Palace of Culture on Saturday to mark the 47th anniversary of general secretary Kim Jong Il's start of work at the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK). \n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Ki Nam, member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the WPK Central Committee, made a report.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il started his work at the WPK Central Committee on June 19, Juche 53 (1964), reflecting the noble intention of President Kim Il Sung and the unanimous will and desire of the party, army and people, the reporter said, and continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the early period of his work at the WPK Central Committee, Kim Jong Il established a firm ideological and leadership system of the President throughout the party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He made sure that revolution and construction were conducted as intended by the President and the way he did, enabling the WPK to firmly preserve its revolutionary character as a party of the President and opening a sacred history of accomplishing the cause of perpetuating his memory on this land.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He formulated the Songun politics in the 1990s as a main political mode under socialism and a revolutionary leadership mode of the WPK, further strengthening it. This is of really weighty significance in the history of its construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reporter went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The military parade and other celebrations of the 65th birthday of the WPK in the last significant year were a striking demonstration of his outstanding leadership ability as he explored the unique way of party building by organically combining politics with military affairs, party with the army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK are dashing ahead at the speed of Songun Korea, a new Chollima speed, towards the eminence of a thriving socialist nation with the immutable truth that the decision of Kim Jong Il, the decision of the WPK, leads to gigantic practice. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reporter underscored the need to firmly preserve and defend the immortal exploits Kim Jong Il has performed while leading the party for nearly five decades and conduct the party building and activities strictly on the basis of ideas and theories and methods of Kim Jong Il and thus develop the WPK into the eternal party of the President.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He called for further increasing the politico-ideological and military and technological might of the People's Army, completing the work to put all people under arms and turn the whole country into a fortress on a higher level, safeguarding the country as firm as an iron wall through the concerted efforts of the army and people and dynamically pushing forward socialist construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will never pardon the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors who drove the north-south relations into an uncontrollable phase, launch a nation-wide all-out offensive to put an end to its anti-DPRK confrontation moves and achieve the historic cause of national reunification without fail.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will boost friendly and cooperative relations with the countries friendly to it in the idea of independence, peace and friendship and make positive efforts to achieve world peace and realize the independence of humankind, he concluded.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was attended by senior party, state and army officials, officials of party, armed forces and power organs, social organizations, ministries and national institutions, servicepersons of the Korean People's Army and the Korean People's Internal Security Forces, officials in the fields of science, education, culture and arts, public health and media, labor innovators and working people."

It enacts acts concerning them and uses exchange and cooperation as levers for its political domination and economic plunder of other countries and stamps out their languages on their strength.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Imperialists advocate \"use of multi-languages\", a reactionary theory, and deliberately complicate the language issue in multi-nationality states. By doing so, they spark and stir up conflicts among nations, tribes and religions in a bid to use linguistic contradictions and friction for achieving their purposes of dominating and subjugating other nations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are also pressurizing the homogenous nations to use their languages overtly or covertly in a bid to mar the pure and unique nature of their national languages or deprive them of this nature and precipitate the split of nations and make them heterogeneous.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For instance, south Korea is prevalent with the use of medley words and the tendency of using foreign words. Being grave consequences entailed by the U.S. imperialists' moves to stamp out national languages, they are depriving the Korean language of its purity and unique nature and seriously affecting the uniform development of the advantageous Korean language.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is one of the main factors which perpetuate the division of the Korean nation and facilitate the process of making it heterogeneous, concludes the article."

Por ejemplo, EE.UU. inventa \"leyes\" referentes a estos y toma el \"intercambio\" y la \"cooperacion\" como remedios del dominio politico y saqueo economico a otros paises y un aparato por el exterminio de su lengua  nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Al preconizar la reaccionaria \"teoria de uso comun de multi-lengua\", los imperialistas complican intencionalmente el problema linguistico de los estados multinacionales para crear las confrontaciones entre las naciones, tribus y sectas y aprovechan el antagonismo y el desacuerdo linguisticos a dominar y subyugar a otros paises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ellos, al propagar astutamente sus idiomas entre las naciones homogeneas, destruyen la pureza y la homogeneidad de la lengua nacional y  promueven la division y la heterogeneidad de la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Por ejemplo, el uso de la lengua hibrida y extranjera que se difunden en la sociedad surcoreana es el resultado de las maquinaciones norteamericanas para exterminar la lengua nacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Su consecuencia hace desaparecer la pureza y la homogeneidad de la lengua coreana e impedir mucho su desarrollo unificado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Esto es uno de los factores principales que hacen fijar la division nacional y acelerar la heterogeneidad de la nacion coreana."
