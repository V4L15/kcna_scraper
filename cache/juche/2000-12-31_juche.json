They report whatever favorable to them and sidestep issues or fabricate fictions. This is just part of the habitual practices of reptile Japanese media. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is more serious is the Japanese government's crafty and shameless act of zealously patronizing and inciting such sinister actions of Japanese media. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government instructed the media to ignore the tribunal before its opening for fear that its responsibility for the past crimes might be more clearly proved and it might prove unfavorable to evading responsibility for those wrong doings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is nothing but a folly which can be committed only by Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government can never shirk its responsibility for Japan's past wrongdoings. Its attempt to evade its responsibility for the past crimes, far from redressing them, will only add to its crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should ponder over the ensuing consequences and its media are well advised to come to their senses.    \r\n\r\n"
