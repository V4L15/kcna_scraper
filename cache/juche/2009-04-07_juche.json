Newspapers Tuesday observe this in signed commentaries.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun says:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group is misleading public opinion trying to give impression that there exists the \"issue of human rights\" in the DPRK. This, however, will get it nowhere as it is a nonsensical ploy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Very wicked is the Lee group's frenzy over \"human rights\" racket against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group is making desperate efforts to tarnish the bright image of Songun Korea to which the world progressive mankind desirous of independence is looking up and create an atmosphere hostile toward the DPRK at home and abroad but in vain. This is as foolish an act as trying to sweep the sea with a broom.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group's persistent \"human rights\" racket against the DPRK only compels it to harden its will not to deal with the group at all but to settle accounts with it to the last. If the Lee group persists in such reckless moves against the DPRK as now, it will be forced to follow in the disgraceful footsteps of traitor Kim Young Sam who was thrown into the dustbin of history, not having had a dialogue between the north and the south even a time during the whole period of his office being keen on confrontation with fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group would be well advised to act with discretion, clearly understanding that its \"human rights\" racket against the DPRK will bring only a disgraceful ruin to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson says that to do harm to the DPRK through the \"human rights\" racket against it is a foolish and stupid act which can never be realized. The Lee group should bear in mind that the said racket is as adventurous an act as lifting the axe to drop it on its own foot, the daily stresses."

Korea Blasted\r\nPyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- The commander of the U.S. forces in south Korea at a recent hearing of the U.S. House of Representatives Armed Services Committee blustered that the military muscle of north Korea poses threats to the region and the world and that north Korea is a world's major exporter proliferating ballistic missiles and relevant technology and conventional weapons. He went the lengths of letting loose such vituperation that north Korea perpetrates provocative acts of threatening the U.S. and its allies, while describing its satellite launch as a long-range missile launch.\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on this, Minju Joson Tuesday observes:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His accusation made against DPRK over its military capability only reminds one of a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is rounding off its strategy for a preemptive attack on the DPRK by waging war exercises under various codenames after setting the establishment of military hegemony on the Korean Peninsula as the core of its strategy for putting Asia-Pacific under its domination and amassing aggression troops and sophisticated military hardware in and around the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As for the military power of the DPRK, it is just for self-defence as it is aimed to defend its sovereignty, dignity and security from the U.S. ever-more pronounced hostile policy toward the DPRK and its attempt to stifle the DPRK by force of arms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. bellicose forces' smear campaign against the DPRK over its military capability was prompted by their sinister design to justify their policy for stifling the DPRK by force of arms and build up international public opinion necessary for forcing the DPRK to disarm itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This proves that dialogue and improved relations oft-repeated by the U.S. is, in actuality, set to solve the issues with the DPRK by force. Now that the U.S. persistently sticks to its hostile policy toward the DPRK backed by military force, the latter is compelled to take strong countermeasures.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. warlike forces had better behave with discretion, pondering over the serious consequences to be entailed by their military option."
