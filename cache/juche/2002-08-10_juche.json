            "content": "Anniversary of Kim Jong Il's Russian visit observed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 10 (KCNA) -- The United States should honestly honour its commitments and duties as the party chiefly responsible for the Korean issue. It should definitely drop its anachronistic anti-DPRK policy and stop doing anything obstructive to the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea. We do not want to regard the U.S. as our sworn enemy but hope to see improved DPRK-U.S. relations. This is a clear stand of General Secretary Kim Jong Il of the DPRK, said the Russian newspaper Pravda in an article observing the 1st anniversary of his Russian visit.\r\n It is pointed out in the Russia-DPRK Moscow declaration that the DPRK's missile plan is of peaceful nature and it, therefore, does not pose a threat to any country that respects the sovereignty of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The declaration also says that the U.S. troops' withdrawal from South Korea is an urgent issue in ensuring peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and in northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. made a negative response to the peaceful initiatives for the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Asia taken in Moscow. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. President Bush in his belligerent speech included the DPRK in an \"axis of evil.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His reckless remarks came as a shock to many politicians and evoked resentment among the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For nearly half a century since the ceasefire in Korea the DPRK has advocated national reunification based on the principle of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity as its main target. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il said that the military confrontation between the north and south of Korea may spark only distrust and misunderstanding between Koreans, cause them not to trust and get reconciled with each other, increase the tensions and bring a holocaust to the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the south Korean authorities make a positive change in practice to meet the expectation of the whole nation away from their policy of confrontation against the nation and reunification in the future, we will open-heartedly negotiate with them any time on the issue of the nation's destiny and work for national reunification together with them, he noted, adding that the countries concerned should respect the sovereignty of our nation and its will for reunification and positively cooperate with it in solving the issue of national reunification independently and peacefully.     \r\n\r\n"

Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 10 (KCNA) -- The Seoul District Federation of University Student Councils reportedly called a press conference at Yonsei University on Wednesday at which it declared that it would launch students' struggle to stop Ri Hoe Chang from running for the presidency.\r\n A declaration of students calling for a struggle to stop Ri Hoe Chang, who has disturbed the implementation of the June 15 joint declaration and engaged himself in irregularities and corruption, from running for the presidency was issued at the press conference on behalf of the headquarters for anti-Ri Hoe Chang struggle of the federation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A press release read out at the conference said that a struggle should be launched against Ri because he is an anti-reunification element who did not bother to let loose reckless remarks against the joint declaration and, not content with that, undisguisedly stood against national reunification when he cried out for its abrogation shortly ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also charged that Ri, utterly indifferent to the nation's destiny, does not hesitate to support the U.S. war moves while begging for the permanent presence of its troops in south Korea, adding: we are opposed to Ri's running for the presidency because if he is allowed to take presidential office, the nation can never escape from a war holocaust, much less achieving reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We are opposed to Ri also because he is keen to turn back the history while insisting on the preservation of the security law and the definition of \"principal enemy\", leftovers of the Cold War era, ever in this 21st century and, moreover, he is the kingpin of irregularities and corruption, noted the press release. \r\n\r\n"
