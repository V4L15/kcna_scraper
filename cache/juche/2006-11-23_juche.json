            "content": "KCNA Urges U.S. to Stop Trumpeting about \"Human Rights Issue\" \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, November 22 (KCNA) -- The U.S. and the EU and other hostile forces railroaded an anti-DPRK \"resolution on human rights issue\" through the meeting of the 3rd Committee of the 61st session of the UN General Assembly.\r\n The DPRK vehemently refutes this as it is nothing but a politically motivated plot based on sheer lies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The authors of this fraudulent document describe the misinformation provided by betrayers of the country and the nation as \"truth,\" the stereotyped method employed by the U.S. in attacking other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and its followers are using the same \"human rights diplomacy\" as done against the former Soviet Union and other socialist countries in the era of the Cold War in a bid to damage the prestige of the DPRK and bring about any \"change\" there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are now becoming evermore vociferous about \"the Helsinki process\" in the former Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. The recent poor charade orchestrated by them at the UN is an extension of this propaganda. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should not mistake the DPRK for any other country. It is foolish for them to force it to bring about any change with the \"resolution\" which has neither legal validity nor plausibility. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. turned the world into one engulfed in a war on terrorism, bringing humankind all sorts of misfortune and pain and set up prisons reminiscent of \"Oswiecim Concentration Camp\" in various parts of the world to perpetrate medieval torture of prisoners. The U.S. and those countries which overlook and incite those crimes are not entitled to talk about human rights issues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The so-called \"civilized states\" should feel ashamed of seeking a political aim by dancing to the tune of the U.S., ill-famed for being the world's worst human rights abuser. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the voting almost all developing countries and other member states of the UN voted against or abstained from voting or boycotted the session, manifesting their principled stands. This indicated that they dismissed such resolution as same ridiculous and poor document as the U.S. \"annual human rights report\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and other hostile forces would be well advised to face up to the reality in the DPRK, awake from hallucination.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "National Meeting Held to Mark Anniversary of Kim Jong Il's Work \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, November 22 (KCNA) -- A national meeting was held at the People's Palace of Culture here on Wednesday to mark the 20th anniversary of Kim Jong Il's celebrated work \"Let Us Step Up the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement\". The work is a letter he sent to those attending the national meeting of the vanguard of the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement on November 23, Juche 75 (1986).\r\n Present there were senior officials including Yang Hyong Sop, members of the Cabinet, officials of party and power organs, social organizations, ministries, national institutions, scientific, educational, cultural and art, public health and media institutions and working people in the city. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Choe Yong Rim, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the C.C., Workers' Party of Korea and secretary general of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly, made a report at the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said that the letter is a monumental work comprehensively dealing with the ideas and theories on the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement, a socialist mass movement involving all the people, and serves as highly important guidelines which should be always adhered to in the above-said movement. Kim Jong Il initiated the movement in Juche 64 (1975) when the Korean revolution entered a period of new historic turn under the programme of modeling the whole society on the Juche idea, the reporter noted, adding that this was a historic event of weighty significance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since the very start of the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement, a mass movement for ideological transformation, technical innovation and cultural reeducation, the movement has gripped the hearts of the broad masses of the working people for its validity, rapidly spreading to all sectors and units of the national economy and displaying its great vitality in the practice of socialist construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to further develop in depth this gigantic all-people movement on the basis of the achievements made for 10 years after its start Kim Jong Il convened a national meeting of the vanguard of the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement and sent the above-said letter to its participants, providing an epochal occasion in developing the movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He has given energetic guidance to the work to ensure that the movement raged all over the country to serve as a powerful engine dynamically pushing ahead with the socialist construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His distinguished guidance to the movement found its expression in the fact that he developed it in depth as required by the Songun revolution in the days when the Korean revolution was undergoing most severe trials, thereby making it possible for the movement to make a great contribution to defending socialism and building a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The political and ideological power of the Korean revolution has radically increased and signal changes have been made in the socialist economic and cultural construction and the defence upbuilding under his outstanding leadership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Stressing the need to intensify the movement whose vitality has been fully confirmed in the practice of the Korean revolution, the reporter said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to intensify the movement with main stress on the ideological revolution so that it can fully display its might as an all-people movement for training true personnel required by the Songun era, powerfully arouse the masses of people to effect a great revolutionary upswing and speed up the general march of the Songun revolution.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This proves that they talk about \"independence\" but act under the U.S. pulls and pressure and put more importance to the outside forces than to the fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their action has laid a new obstacle in the way of improved inter-Korean relations, which casts doubt on the need to have a dialogue with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they continue toeing the American line against the nation and reunification and taking the road of confrontation with the fellow countrymen, they would not be pardoned by the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

However, they massively used them themselves and, seeking to execute their criminal Mid-east strategy without much difficulty through Israel, transferred them to it to be used against civilians at random, thus bringing miserable calamities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Human rights abuses can never be overlooked. The U.S. imperialists and Israel must be brought to the international human rights court and sternly punished.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
