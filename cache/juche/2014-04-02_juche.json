Paektu and to blow up all strongholds of the U.S. imperialist aggressors and other hostile forces once an order is issued. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A letter to all the service personnel of the KPA was adopted at the meeting. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On the same day Kim Jong Un had a photo session with the commanding officers of the combined units who took part in the study tour."
