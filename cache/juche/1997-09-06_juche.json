Accordingly, it is a grave challenge to mid-east countries which aspire after peace.\r\n   During his south Korean tour, the Israeli Prime Minister clamoured about \"DPRK's export of missiles to Mid-East nations\" and urged the south Korean authorities to join hands in blocking the export.\r\n   This is a foolish effort to justify the military tieup between Israel and south Korea.\r\n   The DPRK is following the dangerous military tieup between south Korea and Israel with sharp vigilance.\r\n  \r\n"
