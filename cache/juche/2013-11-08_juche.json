Jo was a revolutionary comrade-in-arms of leader Kim Jong Il and prominent official of the party, state and army.\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un, who is also supreme commander of the Korean People's Army (KPA), had a look at Jo's photos and mementoes displayed in the hall.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that November 6 was the third anniversary of Jo's death.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Jo was a close comrade-in-arms of Kim Jong Il, he said, adding he missed Jo so much and visited the hall on the occasion of his death anniversary.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The feats Jo performed for the party, revolution, country and people will shine long along with the advance of the revolutionary cause of Juche, he noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He then went round the hall.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that the hall displays photos of President Kim Il Sung's and Kim Jong Il's lifetime comrades-in-arms who protected the party with arms by staking their destiny on the party and leader.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was thanks to the harmonious whole and revolutionary comradeship between the supreme commander and his comrades-in-arms that the Korean revolution made triumphant advance despite all sorts of trials and difficulties, he noted. Commanding officers of the KPA, remaining infinitely loyal to the party and revolution, shared the same idea, intention and destiny with the supreme commander.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They were staunch revolutionaries and true soldiers who dedicated themselves to laying solid foundations for comradeship, pride of the Korean revolution and source of invincible might, and to developing the KPA into invincible revolutionary armed forces, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He gave an important instruction to renew the hall.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underscored the need to rebuild the hall to showcase the faith, obligation and feats of the revolutionary soldiers, who dedicated themselves to the party, leader, country and people, to help service personnel and people get a good knowledge of their noble ideological and mental world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Choe Ryong Hae, Kim Su Gil, Ryom Chol Song, Ri Jae Il and Hwang Pyong So."

            "content": "CPRK Spokesman Raps S. Korean Authorities' Anti-DPRK Moves\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, November 8 (KCNA) -- These days the south Korean puppet group is becoming more desperate in its moves to abduct inhabitants of the DPRK and hatch plots against it by use of defectors from the north. \n\t\t\t\t\t In this regard, the spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea issued a statement on Friday.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Agents of the puppet Intelligence Service (IS) of south Korea are now working with bloodshot eyes to lure and abduct inhabitants of the DPRK by infiltrating members of such plot-breeding organizations as \"Turi Hana\" into its northern border area. They are, at the same time, bribing those who had been taken to south Korea before sending them back to the DPRK with the mission to gather information about it and destabilize it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, the puppet Foreign Ministry set up what it called a \"cooperation team\" tasked to lure and abduct inhabitants of the DPRK overseas and established similar teams in south Korean embassies in neighboring countries and Southeast Asian countries. The number of members of such teams is now on the sharp increase. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet Ministry of Unification shaped a budget to \"finance river-crossing\" and is going busy with operations to lure and abduct inhabitants of the DPRK, providing funds through the \"Foundation for Defectors from North\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is wooing defectors from the north to stage performances on payment condition, thus using them for false propaganda against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The chief executive, prime minister and other heavyweights of the south Korean regime are zealously putting forward human scum, praising them as \"fighters for independence.\" The south Korean regime is operating even a \"course for training leaders for defectors from north\" overseas after creating an organization called \"academy of leaders of young defectors from north for unification.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The operations to lure and abduct inhabitants of the DPRK being carried out with various ministries and agencies and bosses in power involved and the conspiratorial racket kicked up by use of defectors from the north are something unprecedented. This clearly indicates what reckless phase they have reached. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said operations and conspiratorial ruckus are nothing but hysteric frenzy to tarnish the international prestige of the DPRK and break the single-minded unity and achieve their sinister purpose, taken aback by the stirring reality of the DPRK in which its people are making steady leap forward and winning victory after victory. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world knows no such brutal villains and depraved guys, obsessed with confrontation with fellow countrymen, as the south Korean puppet group which lures and abducts compatriots in broad daylight in wanton violation of sovereignty of other countries and international law, with all \"government\" institutions and human scum involved. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet regime's terrorism and conspiratorial plots are, in fact, hideous provocation against the people and social system of the DPRK and declaration of a war against it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The CPRK upon the authorization solemnly declares the following decisive practical actions to cope with the evermore undisguised abduction operations and conspiratorial plots of the puppet regime: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Those involved in the abduction of inhabitants of the DPRK and flesh traffic, participants in the smear campaign against the DPRK and violators of its sovereignty and human rights of its inhabitants will be on the list of merciless punishment, regardless of whether they are agents or servants of the IS. Namely Nam Jae Jun, director of the IS, the center of plot-breeding operations, will be its primary target. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. The decisive actions to physically liquidate the despicable criminals and human scum will immediately kick off the moment they were declared. These decisive measures for national security and the guarantee of human rights of inhabitants are an exercise of due rights under the law of the DPRK and they are just and aboveboard in the light of international law. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whoever challenges the inviolable dignity and social system of the DPRK and abuses the human rights of its inhabitants will find no room to stay on this land. -0-\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean puppet group should know that they would get nothing with such foolish acts as sweeping the sea with a broom but self-destruction and denunciation at home and abroad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean authorities and those on the list of punishment should keep in mind our ultimatum is not the warning of words anymore."

This is irresistible. \n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Friday says this in an article:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world today urgently requires the creation of a peaceful environment in the international relations and the promotion of development in the new century, the article notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the imperialists' war of aggression and military intervention have caused complicated issues in the international relations and laid a serious hurdle in the way of the people's cause of independence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  It is a particularly important issue to maintain independence in foreign relations if all countries of the world are to ensure the dignity and rights of the popular masses and achieve social progress and the development of civilization under this situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the unanimous desire and aspiration of mankind to lead an independent life free from all sorts of domination and subjugation by the imperialists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The people's desire and wishes for independence are growing stronger as the days go by and social development is making rapid progress. This reality today calls for establishing the international relations between countries on the principle of respect for their sovereignty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a basic principle to be adhered to in establishing sound international relations to maintain independence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean people will as ever make positive efforts to develop relations with all countries that respect the sovereignty of the DPRK and are friendly towards it, true to the idea of independence."

Korean Puppet Forces' Moves to Join in U.S. MD \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, November 8 (KCNA) -- The south Korean authorities recently blustered that they would purchase several types of missiles including THAAD from the U.S. and set up a ballistic guided-missile operation control center by the first half of next year to interlock it with the TMD operation control center of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t It is reported that THAAD intercepts missiles of the opposing side at a falling phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson Friday observes in a commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This indicates that the puppet forces' advertisement of the \"MD of south Korean type\" is, in fact, nothing but a deceptive artifice to cover up their sinister plot to join in the U.S. MD.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group which reneged on its election commitments under the pretext of \"financial shortage\" is going to spend 4 trillion won for buying THAAD to hurt fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What merits a serious attention is that the puppet regime is getting evermore undisguised in its moves to join in the U.S. MD after its adoption of the \"tailored deterrence strategy\" in collusion with the U.S., the commentary notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet forces are the arch criminals disturbing peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in the region and escalating tension there as they are frantically stepping up the preparations for preemptive strike at the DPRK in league with the U.S. and getting busy with moves to prevent its retaliatory blows.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the puppet group will not be able to escape forlorn wandering spirits the moment they launch a war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet forces would be well advised to behave themselves, bearing deep in mind that their start of a war against the north in league with the U.S. is as foolish act as digging their own graves, warns the commentary."
