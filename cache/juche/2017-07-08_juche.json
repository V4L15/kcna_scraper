Quiza la politica de \"maxima presion\" sea aceptada facilmente para los norteamericanos, pero casi no tiene posibilidad de cambiar la accion del Norte de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBenette Ramberg, ex investigador de la politica perteneciente a la administracion Bush, senalo en su comentario que EE.UU. y el Sur de Corea deben reconocer la realidad del problema nuclear del Norte de Corea y buscar la manera de coexistir con este dejando su absurda ilusion de hacerle renunciar el arma nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDoug Bandow, investigador superior del Instituto Cato, asesor especial del ex presidente estadounidense Ronald Reagan y experto de la politica exterior, publico un comentario que expone la siguiente opinion:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debera reexaminar la promesa de \"seguridad\" dada al Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDespues del fin de la guerra coreana, EE.UU. no tiene ningun motivo para seguir protegiendo hasta ahora el Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. podra tomar la opcion de anular por etapas el estacionamiento de sus tropas en suelo surcoreano y la promesa de \"seguridad\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo importante es que la retirada de tropas norteamericanas puede tachar el nombre de EE.UU. en la lista de blancos de ataque del Norte de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe hecho, sacar la mano del problema de la Peninsula Coreana es el metodo mas sencillo para eliminar la preocupacion de EE.UU. por los misiles norcoreanos que apuntan el territorio norteamericano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo vale la pena que EE.UU. se hunda cada vez mas en el peligro nuclear de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl director encargado del plan de seguridad internacional de un instituto en Sydney opino que para Washington, coexistir con el Norte de Corea, que tiene el misil nuclear de largo alcance, es el unico remedio hasta que trague la medicina amarga.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa situacion se cambia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa es el tiempo en que EE.UU. deje su infructifera politica de hostilidad anti-RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl ver bien la corriente historica de hoy, EE.UU. debera cambiar su politica sobre Corea y cumplir con su responsabilidad asumida en el aseguramiento de la paz de la Peninsula Coreana, lo cual convendria a si mismo tambien."
