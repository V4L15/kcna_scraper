But proper measures are not taken against them and the UN is abused for justifying such practices, he said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Typical of them is the fact that important pending issues are deliberately handled according to political purposes and interests of some specified states at the UN Security Council.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Illegal armed invasion and air raids of super powers against sovereign states and the resultant killings of civilians are connived whereas legitimate and peaceful measures of developing countries for protecting sovereignty and achieving development are considered as a threat to global peace and regarded as problematic. This is the reality today.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Attempts are going on to expand the authority of the UNSC to the issues irrelevant to global peace and security.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This consequently weakens the authority of the UN General Assembly which should speak for the will of all its member states and upsets equilibrium among major bodies of the UN and, moreover, creates confusion in the overall work of the UN.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is necessary to take immediate measures to do away with such practices as abusing the principle and purpose of the UN Charter which stipulates the principle of respect for sovereignty, equality and non-interference of internal affairs of other countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To this end, the DPRK delegation is of the view that there should be a regime whereby the UNSC should be responsible for its work at the UNGA. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said the ad hoc committee should promptly discuss and settle some already submitted proposals and continue to work out new proposals so that it may make a tangible contribution to increasing the roles of the UN Charter and bodies including the UNSC reform.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is prerequisite for increasing the roles of the UN Charter and bodies to put an end to the history in which the UN is abused by individual countries at present.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"UN Command\" in south Korea is typical of the abuse of the UN by an individual country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Former UN secretary generals clearly testified to the fact that the command fabricated by the U.S. exists to command the U.S.-led army, not UN forces and the UN does not take any responsibility for political, military and financial matters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The command is used as a tool for carrying out the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Unless the command is dismantled, the UN cannot shake off the shame of being abused by the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK delegation strongly calls for dismantling the command without delay in line with the resolution of the 30th UNGA Session and put an earliest possible end to the history in which the UN is abused by individual nations."

At last, he came to have  belief that Korea's revolution should be made to get the Japanese imperialists out of the country and build a new society in which popular masses enjoy wellbeing. He also came to have an idea that all affairs should be judged and settled in an independent way and popular masses should be awakened and aroused to the struggle for independence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On the basis of this belief, he formed the DIU, a vanguard organization of young communists of new generation, advancing the immediate tasks and ultimate object of the Korean revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since then, the Korean revolution has taken to the road of independence."

The Korean revolution could dynamically advance along the straight road of victory as the idea of DIU was applied in all fields of revolution and construction from party building to building of armed forces, economy and culture.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Leader Kim Jong Il gave steady continuity to the tradition of DIU, regarding it as his lifelong mission to carry forward and accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche. He ushered in a new era of history in which the whole party and society were imbued with Kimilsungism and laid a firm foundation for prosperity while adorning a heroic epic of the anti-imperialist struggle. Under his leadership the DPRK proudly emerged an invincible political, ideological and military power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All victories and wealth gained in the Korean revolution would be unthinkable without the tradition of DIU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The faith in independence enshrined in the hearts of the service personnel and people of the DPRK stemmed from the roots of DIU. The single-minded unity, the invincible might of Korean-style socialism, is based on the spirit of DIU and the idea and principle adhered to by the DPRK are also based on the idea of DIU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the steadfast will of the service personnel and people of the DPRK to dynamically advance toward the eminence of socialism, holding aloft the red party flag of Juche associated with the idea of DIU as the colors of revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson calls on all service personnel and people to struggle more staunchly for the final victory of the cause of building a thriving socialist nation and the revolutionary cause of Juche under the leadership of the dear respected Kim Jong Un, more loudly singing the song \"Fly High, Our Party Flag\" as the march of the era."

The flame was kindled again in the same area in 1979. This struck the U.S. imperialists and their stooge \"yusin\" dictator to horror and encouraged south Koreans to renewed actions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their strenuous actions culminated in the end of \"yusin\" fascist dictator Park Chung-Hee on October 26, 1979.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Scores of years have passed since the resistance but there still go on sordid moves to call back the departed soul of the \"yusin\" dictator in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"presidential\" candidate from the \"Saenuri Party\" who defended the May 16 military coup and \"yusin\" dictatorship as an inevitable \"historical option\" has recently asserted that it was unavoidable to deter the north's \"threat of southward invasion\" and defend \"security\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural that all people were shocked by the shamelessness of the candidate who pulled up others for the revival of the \"yusin\" dictatorship.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This amounts to an open declaration that when they come to power they will keep trumpeting \"threat of southward invasion\" and \"provocation by the north\", a trite method used for fascist suppression during the period of the \"yusin\" dictatorial rule.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Koreans suffered from the fascist rule by the \"yusin\" dictator who was vocal about the non-existent \"threat of southward invasion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During the 18-year tenure of office of Park Chung-Hee, a total of 14 million innocent people were arrested, thrown into prison or killed, 700 000 to 800 000 on an annual basis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A number of south Koreans were subject to whole gamut of persecution and suppression and were forced to meet deaths at home and abroad. A typical example is a politician of an opposition party who was kidnapped abroad in broad daylight and was almost thrown into the sea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea was a barren land devoid of genuine politics, democracy, civil rights and freedom of speech under the \"yusin\" dictatorial rule.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t How can the shuddering nightmare under the \"yusin\" rule be forgotten and how can its crimes against south Korean society and its people be pardoned despite the lapse of many years?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The revival of the \"yusin\" dictatorship is a betrayal of history and the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In case the \"yusin\" dictatorship is allowed to come back, this will fuel the fascistization of south Korean society and escalate north-south confrontation and the danger of a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Koreans should not be taken in by the \"Saenuri Party's\" crafty trick and never allow the revival of the second \"yusin\" dictatorship."
