Nevertheless, he was painted as a \"savior of Koreans\" and his statue was erected in South Korea. This is bitter disgrace and tragedy of the nation. \r\n\r\n"

This is fully revealed in Bush's remarks about the \"axis of evil\" and his undisguised order to overthrow the legitimate regime in Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is more clearly evidenced by the integration of the space command and the strategic command projected by the U.S. Defense Department. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the international community allows the reckless war moves of the U.S. warmongers not only peace and stability of humankind but the long-standing human civilization will suffer a total destruction in the worldwide thermonuclear war in the 21st century.     \r\n\r\n"

The number of civilians killed by them during the Korean war reached millions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In just 50 days of their stationing in Sinchon county after the Korean People's Army made a temporary strategic retreat GIS massacred more than 35,380 civilians or a quarter of its population. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The thrice-cursed crimes against humanity were perpetrated by the U.S. imperialist aggressors in the Korean War in wanton violation of international wartime laws and rules including the 1949 Geneva convention on wartime protection of civilians. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThey killed Koreans in cold blood wherever they went in Korea, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They even used germ weapons and chemical weapons to kill Koreans in violation of human morality and international conventions. they went the length of killing POWs of our side indiscriminately in gross breach of international laws and rules on POWs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are still watching for a chance to ignite a war against the DPRK, the article says, warning that if they finally start a war of aggression, the army and people of the DPRK will deal deadly retaliatory blows at them to wipe them out on this land to the last man and make them pay a thousand-fold price for the blood shed by Koreans.     \r\n\r\n"
