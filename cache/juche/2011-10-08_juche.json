            "content": "North Side to Inter-Korean Military Talks Warns South Side to Behave Itself\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\t Pyongyang, October 8 (KCNA) -- The Korean Peninsula is now standing on the crossroads of dialogue or confrontation and peace or war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Public at home and abroad affirmatively appreciate the atmosphere of a series of dialogues created with much effort and hope to see the north-south relations improved and national reconciliation and unity attained on this occasion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The military warmongers and other puppet conservative forces of south Korea, however, are getting frantic with the moves to escalate the confrontation with the DPRK as evidenced by intrusions into the north side's waters in the West Sea of Korea and the scattering of leaflets over areas along the front, a blatant challenge to the national aspiration and the demand of the times. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In September alone, more than 80 warships of the south Korean navy intruded into the waters of the north side in the sea while anti-communist rightwing conservative organizations scattered a lot of leaflets and undesirable USBs and pamphlets into areas of the north side. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A particular mention should be made of the fact that anti-communist elements under the Federation of the Movement for Freedom in the North unhesitatingly opened to public their plan to scatter anti-DPRK leaflets from the Rimjin Pavilion on the anniversary of the Workers' Party of Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reckless actions of the anti-DPRK confrontation elements to slander the headquarters of our revolution and the socialist system have reached an intolerable phase. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The head of the DPRK side delegation to the north-south general-level military talks sent the following warning notice to the south side on Saturday in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south side has become reckless in its intrusion into the waters of our side and scattering of anti-DPRK leaflets over areas along the Military Demarcation Line, going against the trend of the favorably developing situation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK have so far watched with vigilance what the south side is seeking after its reckless actions, repressing their growing anger. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Explicitly speaking, the south side's provocations which have gone beyond tolerance limit are such crimes against the nation and peace as chilling the atmosphere of reconciliation which has begun to return, an open perfidy of all the agreements between the north and the south which they promised to implement before the nation and a total breach of the Armistice Agreement signed in the eyes of the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south side will never deny the fact that the intrusions into the waters of the north side and scattering of leaflets against it are not simple provocations but open war actions against it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The north side reminds the south side once again that the army and people of the DPRK are compelled to make a physical retaliation against the south side's ceaseless provocative war moves as already clarified before the world and keeping themselves fully ready for it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south side should face up to the prevailing situation and take a wise option on the crossroads of reconciliation and cooperation or physical confrontation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south side would be well advised to think twice over the final notice of the Korean People's Army."

For the WPK, the leader's idea means the idea of the party and the leader's leadership the one of the party. The history of building a revolutionary party of the working class knows no such party as the WPK which holds in high esteem the great founder and builder of the party as the eternal leader and which firmly ensured the uniqueness of the idea and the leadership generation after generation and led the socialist cause to victory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The party's leadership is the lifeline of the uninterrupted revolution. There is no other road for us than carrying out the revolution to the last under the uplifted red flag of socialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Juche-oriented socialism advancing under the leadership of the party is a science and victory. Steadfast is the faith of the army and the people as they are ready to keep to the road of revolution started by the President under the leadership of Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The paper calls upon all of them to get united around the WPK Central Committee headed by Kim Jong Il, powerfully demonstrate the spirit of Songun Korea and make the DPRK shine more brilliantly as the socialist power of Juche."

The murder of the queen was a crime against humanity rare to be found in history and wanton violation of sovereignty and dignity of Korea and hideous state-sponsored crime against the Korean nation. It was worked out and executed according to Japan's policy for aggression on Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After their illegal occupation of Korea early in the 20th century the Japanese imperialists enforced harsh colonial fascist rule for more than four decades, imposing untold misfortunes and sufferings upon the Korean people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 66 years have passed since the Japanese imperialists' defeat. However, Japan is still resorting to cunning moves to escape from the responsibility for its past crimes, far from making an apology and reparation. What is more serious is the Japanese reactionaries' distortion of the past crimes of the Japanese imperialists in the history textbooks. This is aimed to imbue the younger generation with militarism and put forward them as a shock brigade for a new war and thus realize their old dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These moves on the part of the Japanese reactionaries only harden the determination and will of the army and people of the DPRK to settle accounts with Japan to the last. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan should clearly understand the hatred of the army and people of the DPRK for Japan and the national independent spirit of the Koreans and opt for redeeming its past at an early date. The settlement of the past is a key to the improved relations between the DPRK and Japan and herein lies the future of Japan."

Korean Authorities' Human Rights Abuses Denounced\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\t Pyongyang, October 8 (KCNA) -- The south Korean conservative authorities at a recent trial on appeal held at the puppet Suwon Local Court sentenced Hwang Kil Gyong, who posted an article praising the DPRK on an internet homepage, to ten months in prison, branding his deed as \"an unpardonable act of going beyond the limit of blindly following the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson Saturday observes in a bylined commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a serious violation of human rights as it is infringing upon the freedom and rights of a human being and brutal suppression of ideology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their assertion is preposterous, indeed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their vicious anti-DPRK campaign is barring the south Korean people from properly knowing about its reality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  For this reason Hwang opened an internet website \"Cyber national defence headquarters\" and posted articles on it, helping south Koreans know about the DPRK's reality. His deed deserves people's praise as it was a righteous action for the country and the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What merits a serious attention is that the conservative group suppressed Hwang by linking his act with the DPRK. This is an undisguised challenge to the DPRK and an unpardonable treacherous and anti-reunification act as it blocks the reconciliation and unity of the nation and the improvement of the inter-Korean relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the ulterior intention of the conservative group to create terror-ridden atmosphere in the south Korean society through such brutal fascist suppression in a bid to keep the people from longing for the DPRK or turning out in the struggle for the independent reunification of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As facts prove, the conservative authorities have no will to improve the inter-Korean relations but are keen to escalate the confrontation with compatriots."
