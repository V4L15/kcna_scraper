In the course of this, a deadly, political and military blow was dealt at the Japanese imperialist aggressors and the revolutionary forces were built up for Korea's liberation.\r\n   The struggle for national liberation was conducted more powerfully in the '40s.\r\n   In August Juche 29 (1940) President Kim Il Sung advanced the policy of training a large number of military and political cadres, converting large-unit operations  of the Korean people's revolutionary army into small-unit operations and intensifying the underground struggle and preparations  for a popular uprising, so as to actively prepare for a great event of national liberation.\r\n   Under this policy the main unit of the KPRA engaged itself in military and political training such as political study and exercises of ordinary and special arms to successfully ensure the operation for national liberation.\r\n   Scores of small guerrilla units and teams dispatched to different areas built temporary secret camps and, relying on them, conducted assaults and other military actions against the enemy as well as mass political work.\r\n   At that time many people were  joining in various kinds of struggle against plunder and forced labour and military drafting by the Japanese imperialists and the anti-Japanese armed struggle.\r\n   The President ordered  the KPRA units on August 9, Juche 34 (1945) to launch the final attack for national liberation.\r\n   On this order, KPRA units liberated Rajin, Chongjin and other parts of the country, expanding  the fruits of battle. \r\nAs a result, the Japanese imperialists surrendered unconditionally on August 15 and the Korean people were liberated from the colonial rule of nearly half a century. \r\n\r\n"
