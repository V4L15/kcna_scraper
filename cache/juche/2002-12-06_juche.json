This is pushing the situation on the Korean Peninsula to an extremely dangerous phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is getting more clamorous about the \"nuclear threat\" from the DPRK because it calculates that its row can help internationally ostracize the DPRK as a dangerous state and a criminal responsible for nuclear proliferation and carry out its policy to isolate and stifle it with ease as the nuclear issue is a sensitive one of the world's deep concern. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the U.S. is wholly to blame for unilaterally scrapping the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework it seeks a way out in escalating its racket over the \"nuclear threat from North Korea,\" i.e. its \"nuclear development.\" This is also designed to save its face as regards the issue of the Korean Peninsula and thus turn the situation in the region favorable for its purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many countries of the world are supporting and welcoming the developments on the Korean Peninsula and promoting their interests swimming with the trend of the times. But it is only the U.S. which has pursued confrontation. This is rendering the U.S. further marginalized in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was against this backdrop that the U.S. kicked up a racket over the \"nuclear threat from North Korea\" in a bid to tarnish the DPRK's international authority and prestige and create an environment for internationally isolating and pressurizing it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. mad-cap nuclear ruckus is, in the final analysis, a premeditated and mean operation to justify its moves to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK and create favorable conditions for its military domination over the Korean Peninsula under the pretext of its \"nuclear issue.\"    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
