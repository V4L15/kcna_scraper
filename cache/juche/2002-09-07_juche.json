But these efforts have proved futile owing to the obstructive moves of the U.S. keen on its troops' permanent presence in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was the U.S. anti-DPRK moves that compelled the movement for national reunification to seesaw even after the publication of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is not pleased to see the north-south relations warming up and an atmosphere of reconciliation and cooperation and the desire for national reunification growing stronger on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is forced by the trend of the times to welcome the north-south dialogue and the improved inter-Korean relations. In reality, it works hard to stop the north and the south of Korea from dealing with major issues, confined to having simple exchange. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Precisely for this reason the U.S. keeps calling for a \"preemptive attack\" after singling out the DPRK as part of an \"axis of evil\" and recently staged the \"Ulji Focus Lens\" joint military exercise in a bid to chill the atmosphere of reconciliation and cooperation between the north and the south and deliberately strain the military situation on the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts clearly prove that the U.S. troops stationed in south Korea are not \"protector\" of the regional stability but a wrecker of peace and reunification and a cancer-like existence in the peninsula and the root cause of national division and sufferings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If true peace and stability are to settle on the Korean Peninsula and the rest of northeast Asia and the independent reunification of the country is to be achieved by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation, it is necessary to put an end to the U.S. interference in the issue of the north-south relations and drive the U.S. troops out of south Korea without delay.    \r\n\r\n"

But they were at a loss what a from, content and colors they should choose for the flag and what a proportion of colors should be. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Guessing their difficult position, the president advised them to make the flag perfectly unique in its form and content peculiar to Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He told them that it would be better to use red, white and blue colors on the flag. he said the red color of the flag would symbolize the blood shed by the anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters and revolutionaries of Korea for the freedom and independence of the country and the revolutionary ranks closely rallied behind the party, its white colour the homogeneous Korean nation with brilliant and time-honored national culture and its blue colour the spirit of the Korean people fighting for socialism and the sovereignty of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One day in January in 1948 he called officials again to show them several flag designs made by himself and asked them to give their opinions about the designs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Teaching them in detail the proportion of colors on the flag, he asked them to draw a five-pointed red star within a white circle to represent the future of shining victories to be won by the Korean people in their advance as heirs to the revolutionary traditions established in the period of the anti-Japanese struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The national flag of the DPRK was thus completed under his meticulous care and guidance.
