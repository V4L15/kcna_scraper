It is also keen to give impression that Japan can host Olympics. This is enough to make a cat laugh. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is the only country that has not yet shaken off its ill-fame of an enemy state in the political field. It is a country having bubble economy as it has nothing indigenous. As far as security is concerned, this country is plagued with hooliganism. This being a hard reality, Japan is so keen on the sponsorship of the Olympics. This only indicates that politicians and those concerned with sports in this country know little where it stands. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is not in a position to host Olympics. It is branded as a \"Pandora's box\" and has not yet been recognized as an \"ordinary and normal state\" by the world people as it has not yet redeemed its past but worked hard to revive militarism and committed such crimes as luring and abduction operations and human rights abuses at home in the new century, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japanese politicians do not stoop to any infamy to attain their political purposes, just as their country does. They are political dwarfs and dregs in the sports circle as they behave in breach of even the pure sports spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is clearly proved by the fact that Japan prevented DPRK players from participating in the 2006 Synchronized Swimming World Cup and the 15th East Asia Junior Table-Tennis Championships. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that the Japanese reactionaries will put pressure upon those countries which incur their displeasure and prevent them from participating in the Olympic games at the instruction of their masters, the stereotyped method whereby they refused to issue visas to the DPRK players and completely blocked their entry, citing a certain \"clause\" as a pretext for the refusal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan instigated the organizing committee of the East Asia Junior Table-Tennis Championships to send to the DPRK a notice requesting the DPRK side to refrain from sending its players due to the concern about their safety under the prevailing situation.\r\n How can Japan be called a \"law-governed state\" when it says it can hardly guarantee the safety of those participants in the junior championships from a few East Asian countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan keeps its economy going through plunder of other countries and overseas expansion and increased dependence on big powers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such country instable in political, economic, security and all other aspects makes a strong bid for hosting Olympiad, unaware of its real position. This cannot but be a height of folly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Explicitly speaking, the Japanese reactionaries' bid to make Olympics their political plaything is nothing but a serious insult to the sacred Olympic Charter and its idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Olympic Charter stipulates that the Olympics shall contribute to improving people's health, enhancing their noble morality and promoting international friendship and thus preserving world peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan will invite international isolation if it makes a bid for hosting Olympics without a proper view and attitude toward international sports games.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean Authorities' Crackdown on \"NGEU\" Flailed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 7 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea Saturday made public a statement denouncing the south Korean authorities' crackdown on the \"National Government Employees' Union\" (NGEU) as an unpardonable anti-democratic, anti-national crime.\r\n The south Korean authorities recently sent the police to close office rooms of the \"NGEU\" and detain more than 60 hard core members of the union, charging that it is an illegal organization which is doing \"illegal actions\" demanding a halt to the south Korea-U.S. joint military exercises and so on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities' suppression of the union is an undisguised move to stamp out the progressive movement organization and a wanton infringement upon human rights, the statement said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The demand of \"NGEU\" for ensuring the three rights of labor and a stop to the south Korea-U.S. joint military exercises can neither be called in question nor be an object of suppression as it is a very righteous struggle to achieve democratic rights and freedom and defend national dignity and sovereignty from the outside forces' aggression and interference. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should squarely see the aspiration of the people and the trend of the times, immediately stop the suppression of the union and immediately release those unionists detained without condition.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "\"Reorganization\" of U.S. Forces in S. Korea Condemned\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 7 (KCNA) -- The ongoing \"reorganization\" of the U.S. forces in south Korea is part of the arms buildup and a prelude to a war of aggression against the DPRK. A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland declared this in a statement Saturday.\r\n The \"reduction\" and \"reorganization\" of troops in south Korea being carried out by the United States are prompted by its sinister design to accelerate arms buildup and war preparations in the Korean Peninsula by reorganizing the forces into a task force and use south Korea as a shock force in carrying out a new war, the statement pointed out, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Due to such moves the situation is getting tenser and the danger of a nuclear war is further increasing on the Korean Peninsula as the days go by. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is the fact that the bellicose forces in south Korea are stepping up the arms buildup and north-targeted war preparations, while openly asserting these are meant to strike it, pursuant to the U.S. scenario for a war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is an intolerable crime against the nation as it breaches the June 15 joint declaration and drives the inter-Korean relations to a phase of catastrophe and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean war-like forces are bound to face punishment by the nation and self-destruction as they are hell-bent on the war moves bringing the nation to ruin, serving the U.S. in its moves to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should pull its aggression forces out of south Korea and its vicinity at once.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
