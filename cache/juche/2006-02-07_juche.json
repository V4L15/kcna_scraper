It continues: \r\n Socialism of Korean style was chosen and built by the popular masses themselves in conformity with the actual conditions of the country. It is socialism which the popular masses have become the master of everything and everything serves them. The source of the invincibility and vitality of socialism lies in the popular masses' undisputed support and trust in it and their dedication to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people consider socialism dearer than their lives. This revolutionary spirit has grown stronger in the course of their protracted and arduous struggle.\r\n The Korean people have covered a really rugged path to build socialism. But their faith in socialism has never shaken in face of any trend and tendency of the times. They have kept to the road of socialism despite manifold difficulties and ordeals. The defence of socialism would mean its victory but the abandonment of it would lead to death. This is the voice of faith that can be heard from the Korean people who regard socialism as their life and soul. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said spirit will always remain noble for the Korean people who have to wage an arduous struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people's unshakable faith and revolutionary spirit of regarding socialism as their life and soul serve as a most powerful mental weapon for smashing the U.S. imperialists' moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK and a source of the energy to bring about a fresh upswing in the building of a great prosperous powerful nation.\r\n Underlying the strong patriotic enthusiasm of the Korean people to make the country richer and more prosperous and demonstrate its might to the whole world is their firm faith that Korean style socialism is best. The editorial calls on all the people to deepen their faith in socialism and hold higher the banner of socialism of Juche in order to meet the increasing challenges of the imperialists, deal resolute retaliatory blows at their moves and continue to give full play to the spirit displayed in the period of \"the Arduous March\".    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 6 (KCNA) -- It was recently disclosed in south Korea that the \"East Berlin case\" during the Park Chung Hee military fascist dictatorship was a sheer fabrication.\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun Monday runs a signed commentary, which says:\r\n This brings to light the truth behind the monstrous crimes of the predecessors of the Grand National Party who stamped out justice and patriotism and punished or killed innocent people in a bid to keep the heinous one-man fascist dictatorial system in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In 1967 the then \"Central Intelligence Agency\" under the Park Chung Hee fascist regime made public the \"East Berlin case\" that stunned the world, alleging that more than 190 artistes, professors and doctors including Yun I Sang had conducted the operations for communizing south Korea with East Berlin as their stronghold. More than 30 overseas Koreans related to the big spy case were forcibly taken away to south Korea and harshly tortured. And others related to the case underwent brutal punishment beyond human imagination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The gentries of the GNP are working hard to cover up the past crimes. In order to completely liquidate the crime-woven past characterized by flunkeyism and treachery, fascist dictatorship, anti-DPRK plots and the confrontation with the fellow countrymen and redress the wrong history in south Korea, the GNP, a group of traitors, should be punished, to begin with, for desperately checking the movement to set right the history.\r\n Minju Joson Sunday in a commentary says that the gentries of the GNP should apologize to the whole Korean nation for the crimes committed by their predecessors.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean Authorities Urged to Stop All Joint Military Exercises with Outsiders\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 6 (KCNA) -- The south Korean authorities should unconditionally stop all the joint military exercises with outside forces which would bring dark clouds of a nuclear war if they truly desire progress in the north-south relations and peace on the Korean Peninsula.\r\n A spokesman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland demanded this in an answer given to a question raised by KCNA today blasting the south Korean authorities for contemplating staging with the U.S. joint military exercises under the simulated conditions of invasion against the north this year, too. \r\n He said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On Feb. 1 the south Korean minister of Defence at a regular press conference blustered that all the exercises under this year's plan as well as the south Korea-U.S. joint military exercises due in upcoming March would be staged as scheduled.\r\n This announcement of the plan to stage the joint military exercises with the U.S. this year too, came at a time when the north-south military authorities' talks that had been arranged with much effort are just around the corner. This is a very provocative act of negating the military talks themselves and pushing the situation on the Korean Peninsula to the brink of war pursuant to the U.S. moves to start a war of aggression against the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities staged with the U.S. extremely dangerous war exercises against the north in the era of the Cold War and now they intend to go ahead with those exercises even in the June 15 era of independent reunification.  This is a challenge to the desire of the nation and the trend of the times and an action against peace and reunification as it is aimed at bedeviling the inter-Korean relations and scrapping the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean military authorities called for north-south military talks before negotiators of the north, talking about \"building military confidence\" and \"detente.\" But they have disclosed their intention to go on with joint military exercises against the fellow countrymen with the outsiders behind the scene. This is an intolerable mockery of the dialogue partner and an artifice to fool the public opinion. \r\n The south Korean military authorities should clarify whether they stand for reconciliation and cooperation or for confrontation and war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
