This deprived the IAEA of the qualifications to intervene in the DPRK's nuclear activities. But it has not yet come to its senses. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIAEA has not voiced concerns over the nuclear programs of other nuclear states. It only expressed concerns over the DPRK's nuclear program, an indication of its partial approach toward the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIAEA and the U.S. should not try to view the prevailing situation with the old standard in the period when the DPRK's nuclear activities were confined to the peaceful purposes only.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK, which legitimately accessed nukes to cope with the U.S. persistent hostile policy, has its own standard on which IAEA's function is not workable as the function mainly deals with non nuclear states.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIAEA and the U.S. should act with discretion, clearly facing up to the situation."

But this is a sheer lie.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe misrepresentation of facts which is a mockery of the good faith shown by the DPRK increases the suspicion as to the Japanese side's abuse of the issue of remains for meeting its sordid political purpose.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK has approached the issue of the remains of Japanese in good faith and with magnanimity from the humanitarian stand and will keep doing so.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBut if Japan keeps seeking an ulterior political purpose, it will adversely affect the DPRK-Japan inter-governmental talks."

They even aired what the anti-DPRK hostile forces reported in the past to malignantly slander the inviolable social system and policy of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGenerally, it is international usage and commercial ethics to settle disputes that occurred in the course of economic relations in line with the relevant arbitration item of the contract.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBut the media have kicked off massive propaganda campaign, defying international usage and commercial order. This cannot be interpreted otherwise than an act of fanning up the dishonest forces in their moves to drive a wedge between the two countries in their economic cooperation and chill the atmosphere for investment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs far as the procedures for the signing and implementation of the contract between the DPRK Ryongbong Corporation and the Steel Co. Ltd., of the Group and the bilateral disputes are concerned, the Group is also to blame for the abrogation of the contract. In the light of the process of implementing the obligations under the contract, the Group is chiefly to blame from the legal point of view.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt has carried out only 50 percent of its investment obligations though almost four years have past since the contract took effect.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSo the two contracting parties again sat together only in vain over the timeline for the completion of the first-phase investment and commissioning.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs for 16 provisions which the Group set forth as the major issue of the disputes, it is the legal obligation of the Group related to the contract to implement them according to the mutual contract in which both sides agreed on the article that \"two sides sign it on the basis of the DPRK Law on Joint Venture\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs regards the dealing of sales price of trial products, the Group insisted on its self-opinionated proposal for settling its debts within the boundary of China, in disregard of the procedures in price dealing pursuant to the relevant financial management norms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMedia should comply with the standards for fairness and objectivity, create an atmosphere helpful to settling the disputes between the two contracting parties and refrain from an act that can be misused by the hostile forces for their vicious propaganda.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe will in the future, too, improve and round off the investment environment to further expand the international investment relations to meet the demand of the developing times and the lawful requirement of the international investment relations under the condition that the security of the country is guaranteed by dint of Songun. We will also ensure the legitimate rights and interests of all investors willing to develop international investment relations on the principles of mutual respects, equality, reciprocity and law-observance."

Trabajo de Corea, Primer Presidente del Comite de Defensa Nacional de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea y Comandante Supremo del Ejercito Popular de Corea, visito con su esposa      Ri Sol Ju a las familias de los trabajadores que se mudaron a la avenida Changjon.\n\t\t\t\t\tEn primer lugar, estuvo en la casa de Sim Tong Su, profesor de la Universidad de Maquinaria de Pyongyang, quien vive en el apto. no. 1 del tercer piso del vestibulo no.1 de la primera unidad de vecinos del barrio Jongno.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDijo que el Dirigente Kim Jong Il prestaba profunda atencion a la construccion de las nuevas viviendas en la avenida Changjon, en particular, definio el solar y examino hasta el diseno y la ejecucion de la obra, y agrego que si el estuviera vivo, las habria visitado primero. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Mariscal paso revista a todas las habitaciones y departio sentado en el suelo con los familiares de Sim. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPregunto con carino si les gustaba la nueva casa diciendo que si bien recibio el parte de los cuadros de que los habitantes estan satisfechos de sus nuevas viviendas, no pudo venir temprano porque no le alcanzaba el tiempo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDijo sentirse despreocupado al escuchar la respuesta de los familiares de Sim de que les gustan todas las cosas tanto la estructura de cuartos como los muebles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs una costumbre nacional regalar una caja de fosforos a los inquilinos de nueva casa, dijo y agrego que ademas de fosforo, trajo otros articulos de uso domestico. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTambien entrego las \"antologias de famosos cuentos infantiles del mundo\" diciendo que las guardaran bien y se las dieran a los nietos que van a nacer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEnseno minuciosamente que las televisoras de gran tamano afectan la vista si las ven de cerca y sonrio viendo a los familiares de Sim que se pusieron alegres por el juego de vasijas regalado. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPregunto si Sim tenia solo las hijas y escucho satisfecho la respuesta de que el hijo esta pasando el servicio militar en el Ejercito Popular de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando supo que la esposa y las hijas de Sim son profesoras, dijo que esta familia es la de educadores. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo no se ven las raices de arboles gigantescos, la abnegacion de los profesores no salta a la vista ahora, pero se refleja en las generaciones futuras que contribuiran a la prosperidad de la patria, dijo y agrego que esta familia es la de patriotas que forman a los futuros trabajadores de la patria con conciencia limpia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInvito a un brindis a los familiares deseando exitos en sus trabajos y se fotografio con ellos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLuego, Kim Jong Un visito la familia de Pak Sung Il, obrero de la Empresa de Embellecimiento Urbano del Municipio Jung, quien vive en el apto. no. 2 del tercer piso. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstrechando las manos de los familiares de Pak, que le saludaban emocionados, pregunto sus ocupaciones y dijo que todos ellos son obreros. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAveriguo con afecto paternal las condiciones de vida y departio con los familiares asentados en la nueva y moderna casa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Mariscal sento al segundo hijo de Pak sobre sus rodillas y le acaricio preguntandole en que escuela estudia, cuantos anos tiene y si tiene hermanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tExpreso lastima al escuchar que no ha regresado todavia de la escuela el primer hijo que cursa en el tercer grado de la secundaria. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el dormitorio y la habitacion de estudio de los ninos, el Mariscal vio los dibujos hechos por el segundo hijo y le enseno carinosamente lo que le falta para perfeccionarlos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEscucho con satisfaccion a los familiares quienes le dijeron que vivian antes en la casa de un cuarto y les parece increible vivir ahora en esta casa de 5 habitaciones y les gustan mucho los muebles finos y otros utensilios domesticos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn nuestro regimen socialista son absolutos los intereses del pueblo y sirven para este todas las politicas del partido y el Estado, dijo y agrego que si hubiera visto esta realidad, cuan alegre se habria puesto el Dirigente Kim Jong Il. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl recibir el saludo del primer hijo quien regreso pasado algun tiempo, le pregunto con carino por que ha tardado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl escuchar la respuesta de que estuvo en el circulo de futbol, le bendijo su futuro de futbolista. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Mariscal y su esposa ofrecieron brindis al matrimonio de Pak y dejaron regalos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRi Sol Ju regalo los platos cocinados personalmente para que los alimentara a los ninos y enseno minuciosamente los metodos de cocina. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDeseando que la familia obrera de Pak Sung Il y Jang Sun Nyo tenga una vida feliz en la nueva casa, el Mariscal tomo una foto de recuerdo con ellos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor ultimo, el estuvo en la familia del matrimonio recien casado de la Heroina del Trabajo Mun Kang Sun, obrera de la Fabrica Textil Kim Jong Suk de Pyongyang, quien vive en el apto. no. 1 del segundo piso. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTras informarse de que ella celebro la boda en mayo pasado y recibio la nueva casa a los dos meses, le pregunto sonriendo como pasaba la vida conyugal y cuantos hijos quiere tener. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe rio a carcajadas al escuchar la respuesta del esposo de que quiere tener un hijo y una hija parecida a su madre, tejedora heroina. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Mariscal dio brindis al matrimonio obrero, tomo una foto de recuerdo y dejo como recuerdo los utensilios domesticos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTomando las manos de ellos con ojos humedecidos, dijo que vivieran felizmente y volveria a visitarles cuando pase por la avenida Changjon para ver al bebe que van a tener ellos."
