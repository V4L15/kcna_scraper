This is, indeed, a far-fetched assertion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's activities for developing outer space for peaceful purposes were compelled to cover an untrodden difficult path owing to the U.S. and other forces disturbing them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and other hostile forces, regarding the DPRK, an independent country, as a thorn in their flesh, used to term its satellite liftoff for peaceful purposes a \"long-range missile\" launch and force the UN to meet their brigandish demands.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No article of the UN Charter allows the UNSC to deprive any country of its right to peaceful use of outer space stipulated in international law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Should the DPRK's satellite launch be called into question, all the countries including the U.S. which launched satellites should be taken to task.
