            "content": "S. Korean Government's Decision to Send Troops to Iraq under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 27 (KCNA) -- The Reunification Solidarity of south Korea reportedly made public a statement on June 19 denouncing the government and the Uri Party for reconfirming the decision to send troops to Iraq at a time when the movement against the troop dispatch to Iraq is under way worldwide.\r\n At last the government and the ruling party have opted for joining in the war of aggression in defiance of the people's demand, the statement said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It demanded the present political camp immediately stop deceiving the people aspiring after independence, peace and reunification and withdraw the decision to send troops to Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Labor organizations and students' organizations of south Korea also published statements on June 21 rapping at the government's decision to send additional troops to Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean Confederation of Trade Unions in a statement noted that the decision of the government to send additional troops to Iraq without any justification and benefit is an unjustifiable and disgraceful action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Federation of (south) Korean Trade Unions in a statement held that the government should immediately reexamine its decision to send additional troops to Iraq, though belatedly, and withdraw from Iraq the south Korean troops already dispatched there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean Federation of University Student Councils in a statement noted that the government and the ruling party should be held fully responsible for the decision and strongly urged them to stop at once the moves to send more troops to Iraq and pull out of it the forces already there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The General Students Council of Yonsei University issued a statement declaring that the real criminal that is driving the south Koreans to death was none other than the U.S. that started the Iraqi war of aggression and the government that decided to send troops there toeing the U.S. line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean Federation of University Student Councils called an emergency press conference in front of the building of \"National Assembly\" on June 19 and read out a statement. The statement denounced the government and the Uri Party for taking the lead in implementing the decision to send troops to Iraq, thus bringing an indelible disgrace to the people desirous of progress and reform.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on U.S. Attempted Use of Nuclear Weapons during�@Korean War \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 27 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists' moves to stifle the DPRK over the nuclear issue is an extension of the nuclear war strategy pursued by them during the Korean war, says Rodong Sinmun Sunday in a signed article giving a detailed account of the attempts made by the U.S. imperialists to mount a nuclear attack on the DPRK during the war.\r\n The article continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. developed A-bomb in July 1945 and worked out a plan to make the first use of the bombs in the Korean war at the instruction of the then U.S. President Truman before the war. It had in place hundreds of A-bombs and strategic bombers, their delivery means, just before the outbreak of the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After making preparations for the nuclear war the U.S. warhawks launched the Korean war and attempted to use nukes whenever they found themselves in a difficult situation. McArthur, the then commander-in-chief of the U.S. forces in the Far East, proposed the issue of using A-bombs in the Korean war to Truman on July 7, 1950. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He convened a special meeting of the National Security Council and a meeting of the Defense Department one after another on November 29, 1950 at which he raised the same issue and even issued a statement titled \"Use A-bombs in North Korea.\" The U.S. imperialists then deployed strategic bombers carrying A-bombs in their air force base in Okinawa. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialist warmongers loudly talked about the use of A-bombs so as to conduct the adventurous \"containment offensive\" in January 1951. They contemplated dropping the bombs in \"iron delta zone\" linking Cholwon, Kimhwa and Phyonggang, while making preparations for an adventurous \"big offensive\" from April. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n 232-page book \"Modern History of U.S. Diplomacy\" published by Pibong Publishing House of south Korea in 1998 said \"according to a recent confirmation, 30 or 40 nuclear warheads had already been introduced and stored in south Korea in 1951. And targets were also designated at one time.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From December 2 to 5, 1952 soon after he was elected president, Eisenhower flew into south Korea and asserted the use of A-bombs as part of \"the counter-strategy to settle the military stand-off in the Korean war.\" In his first \"state of the union address\" made on February 2, 1953 he proposed the use of nuclear bombs in the \"new offensive\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to a scenario worked out by him, the meeting of Joint Chiefs of Staff held on April 20, 1953 made a plan to use A-bombs in case they fail to reach an \"honorable ceasefire\". On May 19, 1953 the Defense Department again instructed the Joint Chiefs of Staff to propose the issue of using A-bombs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe chiefs of staff of the three services of the U.S. forces submitted the proposal for a wide use of A-bombs for strategic and tactical purposes to the National Security Council and got its approval. Timed to coincide with this, Dulles who was appointed as State Secretary blustered that the U.S. would use A-bombs in Korea, opening to the public the results of the test of nuclear weapons, in a bid to make its counterpart meekly accept its demand at the truce talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Disclosing the persistent attempts made by the U.S. imperialists to mount a nuclear attack on the DPRK during the Korean war, the article says that the danger of a nuclear war is increasing on the Korean peninsula due to the bellicose Bush group's adventurous moves to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. imperialists pursue the strategy to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK, misjudging its strength, they will sustain an irrevocable defeat and death, the article stresses.    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n"

Korean Civilian in Iraq \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 26 (KCNA) -- It is the way of preventing the recent tragedy in Iraq to put an end to the U.S. occupation of Iraq and the south Korean authorities' withdrawal of the decision to dispatch troops to Iraq, says Rodong Sinmun Saturday in a signed commentary as regards the recent murder of a south Korean civilian by a resistance force in Iraq.\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was, of course, unpardonable that this force kidnapped an innocent civilian as a bargaining chip and murdered him. But what matters is that south Korea failed to prevent such tragedy though it might not have occurred. There have been already several cases of abduction and attack against the dispatch of south Korean troops to Iraq. The south Korean authorities should have drawn a lesson from them and withdrawn the decision on the troop dispatch to Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is a rumour in south Korea that the abduction took place in late May but the U.S. and the south Korean authorities concealed the fact for fear that it might put a brake on the additional troop dispatch to Iraq. Anyway, the tragedy took place owing to the south Korean authorities' plan to send additional troops to Iraq, yielding to the U.S. pressure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent incident as well as all the tragic incidents in Iraq is chiefly due to the U.S. as it unilaterally provoked a brigandish war of aggression against Iraq in disregard of international law and the United Nations and imposed huge damage upon the Iraqi people. If the U.S. had not provoked the Iraqi war nor forced south Korea to join it the recent tragedy would not have occurred. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. aggression is the root cause of the attacks of the resistance forces on foreigners and foreign troops in Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should immediately withdraw the decision on additional troop dispatch to Iraq as demanded by the people.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Day of Struggle against U.S. Marked \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 26 (KCNA) -- On June 25, the day of struggle against the U.S. imperialists, all parts of the country shook with people's shouts evincing their firm resolution to take revenge upon the U.S. imperialist aggressors, the sworn enemy of the Korean people, a thousand times and demonstrate the national dignity and the will to win in the confrontation with the U.S.\r\n The spirit of waging a fierce struggle against the U.S. ran high across the country that day, 54 years since the U.S. imperialists ignited the Korean war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At least a million Pyongyangites from all walks of life staged anti-U.S. demonstrations in streets and held a mass rally at different plazas and squares here despite heavy rain that day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the rallies they reaffirmed the firm conviction and spirit of the People's Army and people of Korea that if the U.S. warhawks ignite a war at any cost in the inviolable territory of Korea despite its repeated warnings, the army and people of the DPRK will mobilize its entire war deterrent force to wipe out the aggressors to the last man and achieve a shining victory in the showdown with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At a meeting of young soldiers of the Korean People's Army held in Sinchon County, South Hwanghae Province to vow their revenge they resolved to get fully prepared for do-or-die battles with the U.S. imperialists with the death-defying spirit and the Juche-oriented viewpoint on war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun, the organ of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, carried an editorial on June 25 warning that if the United States starts another war in this land, not away from \"strength-almighty doctrine\" and vertigo of war, the People's Army and people of the DPRK and all other Koreans will give vent to the pent-up bitter grudge, mercilessly wipe out the aggressors and finally conclude their confrontation with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Seen in the streets and villages were slogans such as \"Let's make the U.S. imperialists pay for the blood shed by Koreans a thousand times!\" and \"Let's win one victory after another in the sacred struggle against the U.S. with the might of Songun!\" and anti-U.S. posters which fully reflect the growing bitterness of the Korean people towards the U.S.\r\n Media devote a lot of space and time every day to dealing with the firm will of the Korean people to frustrate the moves of the U.S. imperialists for aggression and war and pave the way for reunification with the might of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Loud singing of songs \"Leader, Just Give Us Your Order\", \"We Will Hold Rifles More Tightly\", \"Give Death to U.S. Imperialist Aggressors\" and others are ringing out from radios and TVs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people have undergone misfortune due to the country's division for over five decades. That is why they are keenly aware of the need to courageously wage nationwide resistance against the U.S. for the sake of an independent life and the prosperity of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Moreover, the U.S. warmongers are persistently spreading fictions about the DPRK's \"enriched uranium program\" and \"sale of nuclear substance\" in a bid to find a pretext for mounting a military attack on it, while advertising that \"north Korea is the next target after Iraq\". This lashes the Korean people into fury. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the United States seeks to completely disarm the DPRK while putting increased pressure upon it over the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, the army and people of the DPRK are all out in the life-and-death confrontation with the U.S. imperialists to demonstrate their do-or-die will and strong national self-respect. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to the war deterrent force for self-defence that has grown remarkably stronger under the Songun policy the Korean people are fully displaying their heroic spirit and mettle in the acute confrontation with the U.S.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It was nothing but a cynical ploy to galvanize the world public opinion and put pressure upon the DPRK, taking advantage of the U.S. moves to charge the DPRK with the nuclear proliferation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently the U.S. has increased its pressure upon Iran to open to public the \"nuclear activities including its secret nuclear weapons program\" while putting in motion some Western countries and the IAEA. It is now foolishly attempting to deliberately link the DPRK to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In February the U.S. met strong public criticism for having faked up the story about the \"transfer of technology for the development of nuclear weapons\" to the DPRK by a Pakistani nuclear scientist. Far from drawing a proper lesson from this precedent, the U.S. cooked up and floated the fiction about Iranian-north Korean \"joint test of detonating devices for nuclear bombs\" only to reveal its true colors as a centre for hatching despicable plots. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. backtracked from the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework after fabricating the story about the DPRK's \"enriched uranium program.\" It is now throwing a hurdle in the way of settling the nuclear issue, persistently insisting on this issue at the six-party talks, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Sankei Shimbun can never escape public condemnation for having released such a false report to join the U.S. in its smear campaign and operation to isolate and stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This newspaper has not yet dropped its bad habit of seeking its own interests by sowing seeds of dissension among other countries and nations. \r\nThis time, too, it openly spread sheer misinformation in a bid to fool the world public opinion and fish in troubled waters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese society and media need to deplore its wrong doing before anybody else and to be cautious about this practice of telling sheer lies to speak for the U.S. though it professes to be an influential paper in Japan.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
