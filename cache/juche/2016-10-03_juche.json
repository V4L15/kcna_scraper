            "content": "Periodicos critican a Park Geun-hye por suplicar cooperacion en campana anti-RPDC\r\nPyongyang, 3 de octubre (ACNC) -- Los periodicos centrales de Corea publicaron la vispera los comentarios individuales burlandose de la horda de Park Geun-hye que solicita obstinadamente la sancion y presion anti-RPDC en la ONU y otros escenarios internacionales.\n\t\t\t\t\tEsos imbeciles no saben como se ha cambiado la corriente de la historia debido a la posesion de armas nucleares por la RPDC, critica el diario Rodong Sinmun y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo pudo conseguir nada la camarilla de Park Geun-hye aunque abogo tanto por endurecer la \"sancion contra el Norte (de Corea)\" y suplico la cooperacion extranjera en su campana nuclear contra esta parte connacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLlego el momento de que ellos reconozcan y se adapten a la cambiada posicion estrategica de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs muy ridiculo que los titeres surcoreanos censuren de una manera u otra las fuerzas armadas autodefensivas de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEllos no podran debilitar nunca la posicion estrategica de la RPDC y seran condenados al fin tragico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl periodico Minju Joson senala que causa mas risa burlona que indignacion el comportamiento de la bruja de Chongwadae que reclama tanto la cooperacion extranjera en su campana para sancionar y atropellar a la RPDC divulgando el ya aburrido rumor de \"provocacion\" y \"amenaza\"."
