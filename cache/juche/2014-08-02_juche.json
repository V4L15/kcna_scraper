Korean Puppet Minister of Defense\r\n Pyongyang, August 2 (KCNA) -- It is just a month since Han Min Gu took the office of the south Korean puppet minister of Defense. But his reckless behavior is becoming a matter of serious concern. \n\t\t\t\t\t Two days after his appointment as puppet minister of Defense Han visited Yonphyong Island, the most acute hotspot in the West Sea of Korea. There he cried out for \"destroying bases of provocation and supporting and commanding forces in the north\". Shortly ago, he appeared at the missile command of the puppet ground force, where he called for \"possible strike at the whole of the north\" and \"high-precision attack\". Not content with this reckless behavior, he made a TV appearance and shouted hoarse that \"the north should be aware of the danger to the existence of its social system\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Han, a descendent of a pro-Japanese lackey, is a diehard confrontational element.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t So, it is not exaggeration to say that he is a psychopath steeped in the inveterate repugnancy toward the compatriots in the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When he was the chairman of the puppet joint chiefs of staff, he asserted that \"the north's nukes and WMDs were the worst factor of creating instability in the region\". As regards THAAD, he recently behaved so meanly as to claim that \"the U.S. deployment of THAAD in south Korea would help counter the north's nukes and missiles and improve security on the Korean peninsula\", uttering he would not rule out the possibility of introduction of THAAD to the U.S. forces in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All what Han uttered is nothing but outbursts let loose by the confrontational maniac keen on saber-rattling against the compatriots in the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is deplorable for the puppet regime to have picked such war-like element as Han as the military chief.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a matter of fact, Han has just a few aging missiles provided by his master U.S. to imitate their test-firing. However, the puppet regime is prodding him to cry out for \"striking\" and \"punishing\" someone only to provoke public laughter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean public had better guard against such insane confrontational maniac blinded with extreme bad blood towards the compatriots in the north and war hysteria. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such reckless tongue-lashing may spark off a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The traitor is bound to perish. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such rabid dog as Han is not worth thing to be killed by soldiers of the Korean People's Army. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Han, cancer-like being to the nation, should be eliminated before it is too late.
