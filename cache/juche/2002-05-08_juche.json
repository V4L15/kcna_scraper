Korean conservative media's smear campaign under fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 8 (KCNA) -- Some South Korean media are now making much ado about the \"danger of possible collapse\" of the dam of the Anbyon Youth Power Station in the DPRK, citing a U.S. satellite picture. Conservative media are busy asserting that the issue should be \"discussed\" at the meeting of the committee for the promotion of north-south economic cooperation.\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This ridiculous fuss is intended to chill the atmosphere of inter-Korean reconciliation and divert the mindset of the South Korean people favorable for achieving reunification through an alliance with the north back to confrontation with it. \r\n This much ado about the dam is an intolerable insult to the servicemen of the people's army in the north who have shed blood and sweated for the prosperity of all the generations to come and a serious provocation aimed to drive the situation to inter-Korean confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This raises a question as to whether it is not a premeditated move of the anti-reunification forces in and outside South Korea to strain the situation by egging media on to launch a smear campaign and then instigating the authorities to join it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the authorities and media of the south side truly want peace and reunification, not confrontation and war, they can not do such an act as chilling atmosphere of reconciliation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a serious attention is that such anti-north racket for confrontation in South Korea is timed to coincide with a string of piffles let loose by such guys as Choe Song Hong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is very wrong for the south side to use a forged material provided by foreign forces for a smear campaign because they do not want reconciliation and reunification of the Korean nation.
