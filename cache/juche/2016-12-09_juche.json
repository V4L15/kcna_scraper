This proves that the south Korean authorities are a group of inhumane criminals whose main job is abduction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights made public the above-said \"report\" at the time when the south Korean authorities are hit hard from all sides for the \"Park Geun Hye scandal\". This is the unreasonable action taken by the Office away from the principle of objectivity and impartiality, which keep the Office alive, following the south Korean authorities keen to seek a way out in escalating the north-south confrontation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the Office is truly concerned for the solution of the issue of the divided families and relatives, it should bring charges against the chief executive of south Korea resorting to undisguised agitation of \"defection from the north\" and the gangsters of the Intelligence Service of south Korea that lured and abducted a group of women citizens of the DPRK in broad daylight, to begin with, and demand the south Korean authorities send back those to the DPRK at once."
