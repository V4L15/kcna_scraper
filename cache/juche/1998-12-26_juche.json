            "content": "U.S. should discard bad habit of taking issue with others\r\n   Pyongyang, December 26 (KCNA) -- Of late U.S. President Bill Clinton took issue with the DPRK over human rights problem.\r\n   At a ceremony held to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights, he said that the DPRK \"needs to improve a human rights record.\"\r\n   His provocative remarks are nothing but an absurd sophism aimed at finding a pretext for u.s. Interference in the internal affairs of the DPRK.\r\n   The U.S. is a publicly-recognized country of human rights violations. In the U.S. tens of millions of jobless people are roaming from place to place and millions of homeless people are frozen to death. People are shot to death in broad daylight and the black people and ethnic minorities are subjected to all hues of maltreatment in the U.S.\r\n   The U.S., however, acting like a \"judge of human rights,\" takes issue with other countries over \"human rights problem.\" it is foolish of the U.S. to do so.\r\n   The U.S. anti-DPRK diatribe over \"human rights problem\" is part of its vain pressure  within the framework of anti-DPRK campaign which is getting all the more pronounced with each passing day.\r\n   The American viewpoint of human rights does not go down with us who have genuine human rights of Korean style.\r\n   The Korean people absolutely trust the anthropocentric Korean socialist system which fully guarantees their human rights, and regard it as their life and soul.\r\n   The U.S. would be well-advised to discard its bad habit of taking issue with others. If it refuses to discard the bad habit, it will only find itself disgraced and isolated.\r\n   \r\n"

Japan is hell-bent on moves to become a nuclear giant and the South Korean authorities are threatening the north with a large number of nuclear weapons introduced from the United States.\r\n   The South Korean authorities and the Japanese reactionaries will be judged by history for their crimes.\r\n   They should stop their frantic anti-DPRK campaign and act with discretion.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n"
