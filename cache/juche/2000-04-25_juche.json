It is the consistent stand of the DPRK that it will send members of the \"Red Army\" back to Japan any time if the Japanese authorities provide them with freedom of their political activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As far as those members of the \"Red Army\" are concerned, they sought asylum in the DPRK for political reasons. To protect political exiles is in line with the universal declaration on human rights and is a legitimate right of a sovereign state recognized by the international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The historical facts have proved that those members of the \"Red Army\" who had taken refuge in our country have not been engaged in any terrorism but the U.S. has been hell-bent on the smear campaign against the DPRK under the pretext of that issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Nevertheless, the U.S. continues pushing for the \"extradition of terrorists.\" This is an unpardonable deliberate act to keep the DPRK listed as a \"sponsor of terrorism\" in a bid to tarnish its international authority and isolate and stifle it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is the world's biggest kidnapper as it has kidnapped and allured a large number of people from different countries before disguising them as \"exiles.\" Yet, the U.S. is shameless enough to keep the DPRK, which has nothing to do with terrorism, listed as a \"sponsor of terrorism.\" This is all the more intolerable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S., which lured even a diplomat of other country into \"exile\" in broad daylight, dares to meddle in the issue of members of the \"Red Army\" raising a hue and cry over \"terrorism.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This imprudent behavior of the U.S. suggests that it is arrogantly acting an \"international gendarme.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is well advised to properly judge the situation and drop its bad habit to do harm to other countries under unreasonable pretexts. \r\n\r\n"
