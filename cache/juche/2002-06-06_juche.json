            "content": "Kim Jong Il gives field guidance to mines and co-op farms \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 6 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il gave field guidance to mines in Tanchon district and cooperative farms in Pukchong county of South Hamgyong Province on June 4 and 5.\r\n Visiting the Komdok Mine, he acquainted himself in detail with the modernization process and production. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He noted with great satisfaction that the miners of the Komdok Mine have laid solid material and technological foundations to bring about an epochal turn in the mineral production and firmly established cultured practice in production by displaying patriotic devotion and mass heroism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Seeing the dressing plant and the carriage systems inside the pit that have been modernly rebuilt on an expansion basis, he said that such grand edifices could be built indigenously as there is the Juche-based independent national economy built by the people tightening their belts, underscoring the need to build a prospering socialist land of bliss on this land at an early date by making the best use of the inexhaustible economic potential. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to sharply increase the mineral production, it is necessary to carry through the WPK's policy of giving definite priority to prospecting and tunneling and of massively mining and transporting minerals and pay primary attention to the supply service for the workers, he said, advancing highly important tasks facing the mine.\r\n He met with the members of mining workteam no. 3 of the April 5 pit and gave a pep-talk to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They were born in 1961 when President Kim Il Sung gave on-the-spot guidance to the mine. Since the formation of their workteam, they have played the vanguard role in the production by displaying mass heroism. They honored their yearly plan as of May 20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While having a cordial conversation with them, he learned in detail about their work and life and highly praised such an admirable deed as reliably taking charge of the revolutionary post, succeeding to their parents. He showed deep loving care for them.\r\n He appreciated together with them a performance given by the mobile art squad of the mine. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After hearing the songs sung by its members with all their hearts, he said that the Korean revolution is invincible as there is a large contingent of the workers who uphold the WPK with pure conscience despite any ordeal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The next leg of his inspection was the Ryongyang Mine. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the mine he said that in order to drastically increase the production at the mine with a rich deposit, it is imperative to push ahead with the work of turning the mine into a huge and modern one on the basis of advanced science and technology and steadily improve the mining equipment to keep pace with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the Ryongyang Mine is of weighty significance in developing the country's economy and improving the standard of people's living, it should steadily boost the mineral production and improve the quality of ores, he noted, setting forth the tasks before the mine. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He climbed the one thousand and several hundreds of metres high mountain top of the Taehung Youth Mine from where he feasted his eyes on vast open mining sites. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the Taehung Youth Mine has a very good prospect of development, it is necessary to concentrate big efforts on actively developing the mine, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then he inspected the Munhwa Cooperative Farm in Ryongjong-ri, Pukchong county. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that Ryongjon-ri where the historic Pukchong enlarged meeting of the presidium of the WPK Central Committee was held is a significant place where Kim Il Sung opened the country's new history of fruit-growing, Kim Jong Il noted that the immortal revolutionary feats of Kim Il Sung who exerted enormous efforts to provide our people with fresh fruits in all seasons will shine forever. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that since the Pukchong enlarged meeting orchards have been created in all areas of the country and all kinds of fruits produced there, he stressed that this great change clearly proves the validity and vitality of the WPK's policy on massively developing the fruit-growing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then he moved on to the Chonghung Cooperative Farm in Pukchong county. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said that farming should be done on a scientific and technological basis as required by the Juche method of farming and the principle of proper crop in proper area and proper crop in proper time should be strictly observed to raise the grain yield and the farm should massively produce stone-leek growing well in water to supply it to people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Going round the newly-built modern houses on different farms in Pukchong county including Chonghung-ri, he said that it is very gratifying that the county has built cozy dwelling houses good to live in by its own efforts and highly praised the county officials and builders for their achievements. \r\n He went round the Songjon Revolutionary Site in Chonghung-ri. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songjon village in Chonghung-ri is a place where Kim Jong Suk, an anti-Japanese war woman hero, went in July and September 1937 and guided a revolutionary struggle, putting forward the tasks to be fulfilled by the revolutionary organization in the Pukchong area. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the revolutionary site is an important centre to learn from the indomitable revolutionary spirit of the anti-Japanese forerunners, Kim Jong Il said that the site should be effectively used to educate party members and other working people and school youth and children. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by Kim Kuk Thae and Kim Ki Nam, secretaries of the WPK Central Committee, and Ju Kyu Chang, its first vice department director.     \r\n\r\n"

In this regard Rodong Sinmun today carries a signed commentary, which says:\r\n Japanese chief cabinet secretary Fukuda said at a press conference that Japan may have nuclear weapons if for exclusive defence. His remarks are as much as nullifying the \"exclusive defence\" and the three non-nuclear principles and declaring nuclear armament. \r\n Some time ago, the Japanese government approved \"a bill on emergency\", a bill on war for overseas aggression, at a cabinet session and handed it over to the diet examination, in a bid to pass it through the diet during its current session continuing till June 19. It is an ill-boding act that at this time the Japanese ruling quarters are all clamouring for nuclear armament. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are aiming to take the good opportunity of overseas expansion to have nuclear weapons, in other words, to become a nuclear power in the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarists, buoyed up by the idea of revenge and ambition for overseas expansion, are keen to realize their criminal aim with nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their main arrow is turning toward Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarists are well advised to behave with discretion, mindful of what disaster their reckless moves for nuclear armament will bring.    \r\n\r\n"

And today it is launching wars of aggression against this or that country as it pleases under the pretext of \"combating terrorism\" in disregard of the UN. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. imperialists are allowed to commit reckless acts of aggression and war under the pretext of \"combating terrorism\", the international community will meet disasters and world peace will be harassed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world peace-loving people should never overlook even the slightest military action on the part of the U.S., well aware of the seriousness and gravity of the situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation where the U.S. hawkish forces are keen to launch another war against the Korean people compels the DPRK to increase its combating capability in every way and keep itself in full combat posture.     \r\n\r\n"

His question took representatives of the city administration by surprise. Because such question could be raised by no one but experts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They were greatly admired by his words that by putting a few questions he could know well about products at the Leningrad Metal Plant, the biggest turbine producer in Russia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is another anecdote about the extraordinary enthusiasm with which he worked. He stayed for 6 hours in Khabarovsk on August 17 on his way home. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That day he laid a wreath before the tomb of the unknown soldier in Slava square, visited the folk museum before calling at the veterans' hall to wish them good health. Then he moved on to the childrens' foodstuff combine and a department store to acquaint himself with varieties and prices of goods and the enterprises producing them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While cruising in the River Amur aboard a boat together with senior officials of the maritime territory, he asked about tigers, bears and sturgeons in the area. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He energetically worked without a moment's rest touring other units. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the entire period of his Russia visit he spent over 400 hours working day and night on the train.     \r\n\r\n\r\n"
