They, together with the south Korean army, are launching the dangerous Ulji Focus Lens joint military exercise throughout south Korea from August 18 to 29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is still persisting in all sorts of war provocation moves against the DPRK, which clearly shows that their clamors for \"assurance of peace\" or \"talks\" are a sheer lie and that through the six-way talks they are seeking to disarm the DPRK completely and, in case it is impossible, to control it by force of arms, the information bulletin stressed, and added: If the U.S. takes the road of war against the north behind the curtain of dialogue, not withdrawing its hostile policy towards the DPRK, we will never give up nuclear deterrent force and settle accounts with the aggressors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should not commit a rash act, seeing the will of our army and people to annihilate the enemies.

Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 23 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialist aggressor troops' occupation was illegal and brigandish as it had no justification in view of international law, says Rodong Sinmun in an article today.\r\n The Cairo talks in November 1943 stipulated that Korea should be a sovereign and independent country and the Moscow meeting of foreign ministers of three countries in December 1945 adopted as an international convention a decision that called for eliminating the 38th parallel and establishing a democratic sovereign and independent state in Korea, but the United States nullified the decision and occupied south Korea on September 8, 1945, in pursuance of its criminal policy of domination over Korea, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The continued U.S. military presence in south Korea is a wanton violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Paragraph 60 of Article IV of the AA stipulates that within three (3) months after the Armistice Agreement is signed and becomes effective, a political conference of a higher level of both sides be held by representatives appointed respectively to settle through negotiation the questions of the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Korea, etc. The U.S. imperialists laid an artificial stumbling block in the way of the negotiation to be held in accordance with the article to foil it on purpose, though. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The AA remains dead as a dodo on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. keeps its military presence in south Korea in utter disregard of a resolution of the UN General Assembly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the facts clearly prove that Yanks are the aggressors who are desperately keeping the Koreans from independently reunifying the country and posing a grave threat to peace and security in the peninsula, Asia and the rest of the world and a group of devils defying the UN Charter, international law and world public opinion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should be mindful that its unabated efforts to aggravate the situation in the peninsula will lead itself to helpless self-destruction and act with discretion and pull its aggression forces out of south Korea at once.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
