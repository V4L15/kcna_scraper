            "content": "U.S. Imperialists Will Face Final Doom: DPRK NDC\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, February 4 (KCNA) -- Obama announced new \"additional sanctions\" on the DPRK through a \"presidential executive order\" at the outset of the year and slandered it as \"the most isolated, severed and cruel dictatorial state\" on Jan. 22.\n\t\t\t\t\t Not content with it, he cried out for bringing down the DPRK at an earlier date though information inflow by cyber warfare, saying such regime would collapse with passage of time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, politicians and military bosses of the U.S. have vied with each other in calling for tightened siege and blockade against the DPRK through re-listing of sponsor of terrorism and \"high-profile additional sanctions\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Typical of this is that the U.S. decided to stage war drills it planned in south Korea and its vicinity, including the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military exercises under the pretext of \"keeping alliance system\", held a secrete confab to disable the nukes and missiles of the DPRK at the command of the special operation force in Florida State, and then formed even the U.S.-south Korea joint division to put it into practice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this regard the National Defence Commission of the DPRK in a statement on Feb. 4 clarified the following principled stand of its army and people:  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 1. Now that the brigandish U.S. imperialists' hostile policy toward the DPRK is getting extremely ferocious, the army and people of the DPRK will take stronger counteraction of justice to shatter it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Once the U.S. policy makers were so impudent that they had no hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But, Obama revealed himself that the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK is the harshest hostile policy and it is chiefly aimed to \"bring down\" the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As long as the U.S. imperialists' hostile policy towards the DPRK is getting evermore ferocious at an extreme phase, its army and people will indefinitely ratchet up its retaliatory action of justice to counter the mounting mud-slinging of the Obama group at them, its escalating harsh sanctions and pressure and the ever-expanding scale and scope of war drills against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should clearly know it is long since the words that the U.S. imperialists are the sworn enemy became phraseology commonly used by all people and the whole army of the DPRK and the resolution to take revenge upon the U.S.  under the slogan \"Let's wipe out and annihilate the enemy and give death to him!\" shaking this land is now growing so strong that they are ready to dash ahead like the wind towards the center of the U.S., the cesspool of crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 2. Now that the gangster-like U.S. imperialists' military strategy towards the DPRK is inching close to the stage of igniting a war of aggression, the just counteraction of the army and people of the DPRK will be focused on inflicting the bitterest disasters upon the United States of America.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By origin, the U.S. imperialists are a group of gangsters accustomed to making profound confusing of right and wrong and unleashing a war on the basis of plots and lies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was none other than the U.S. which escalated the Vietnam war of aggression by faking up the Bac Bo Gulf case and occupied Iraq by orchestrating a farce called \"operation to eliminate weapons of mass destruction\". It was again the U.S. which ignited the Korean war under the pretext of \"southward invasion\" in the 1950s.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Today the Obama group is going so foolish as to try to \"bring down\" the DPRK through a cyber warfare by fabricating the non-existent \"human rights issue\" of the DPRK and floating the fiction about its \"cyber attack\" on the Sony Pictures Entertainment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under this dangerous situation the army and people of the DPRK have decided to write the last page of the U.S. history of shameful defeat about its final ruin exactly on the U.S. land by dint of Paektusan arms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. ignites a war of aggression against the DPRK by conventional forces, it will fight it by conventional forces of its style, if the former unleashes a nuclear war against the latter, it will counter it through its own nuclear strikes, and if the former tries to bring down the latter through a cyber warfare, it will react to it with its own preeminent cyber warfare and will thus bring earlier the final ruin of the U.S. This is a decisive option of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. had better clearly know that the DPRK's smaller, precision and diversified nuclear striking means and ground, naval, underwater, air and cyber warfare means will be used through the service personnel and people's display of the strongest mental power and indomitable ideology and will which the gangster-like U.S. imperialists can never think of and by the Juche-oriented strategy and tactics and unique war methods unprecedented in human history of wars.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 3. It is the decision of the army and people of the DPRK to have no longer need or willingness to sit at negotiating table with the U.S. since the latter seeks to stamp out the ideology of the former and \"bring down\" its social system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Obama group is so impudent as to claim repeatedly that the DPRK should be led to changes and \"collapse\" of social system through \"two-way strategy\"--\"pressure\" and \"dialogue\" by force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since the gangster-like U.S. imperialists are blaring that they will \"bring down\" the DPRK, oblivious of its poor plight facing adverse fate, the army and people of the DPRK cannot but officially notify the Obama administration of the USA that the DPRK has neither need nor willingness to sit at negotiating table with the U.S. any longer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should no longer talk under the eyes of the world such nonsense that dialogue will be impossible before \"change\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The tradition of eternal victory for the DPRK and disgrace and defeat for the U.S. imperialists, recorded in the past history of showdown between the DPRK and the U.S., will be carried forward forever.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Running high are the extraordinary spirit and readiness of the army and people of the DPRK to turn out in the toughest battle to settle accounts with the U.S. imperialists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists, engrossed in the hostile policy toward the DPRK century after century, should be mindful that the time of nightmare is coming nearer when they will meet the most disastrous, final doom on the U.S. mainland."

As the UN arena was reduced to a theatre of anti-DPRK \"human rights\" racket, I hope Your Excellencies will engage yourselves in correcting the situation and, for the immediate future, let all the member states of the UN know that the \"resolution\" adopted at the 69th session of the UNGA is an unlawful one falsely brought up and adopted based on the fabricated information and take due measures to revoke the \"resolution\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. The initiators of the \"resolution\" including the EU and Japan have colluded to forcibly adopt the \"resolution\" by concocting frauds and falsehoods from the beginning and they have not interviewed even a single DPRK citizen while doing so. I hope Your Excellencies will urge them to admit this fact by themselves and to apologize for it to the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The letter noted that it was a mockery of and an insult to the UN to frame up the \"resolution\" based on lies and fabrications, adding that if the \"resolution\" framed up by the hostile forces with information which was fully proven to be false before the international community is withdrawn, the DPRK is willing to actively engage itself in talks and cooperation in the field of human rights."

It is as foolish an act as trying to get the sun eclipsed by palms, and such impudent behavior deserves the punishment of Heaven.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In fact, he is implicated in the case of the massacre of 500 000 people linked to the leftist or labor groups in Indonesia in 1965 committed with CIA help.

Korean Authorities Urged to Take Practical Measures for Dialogue \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, February 4 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea Wednesday gave an answer to a question put by KCNA as regards the fact that the south Korean authorities are spreading the rumor that dialogue has not started due to the north, toeing the line of the U.S. which is displeased with any effort to mend the inter-Korean relations. \n\t\t\t\t\t The spokesman said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These days those of the Ministry of Unification of south Korea talk rubbish that the north should stop making exhausting assertions and come out for dialogue as early as possible if it has the willingness to mend the relations. Timed to coincide with this, the conservative media of south Korea are floating the rumor that it is hard to expect north-south dialogue for the time being due to the north. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an intolerable insult to the DPRK's sincere efforts to bring about a great change in the north-south relations in this significant year and revelation of the clumsy and sinister intention to pass the buck for the daily escalating tension to it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now the rabid dogs of the U.S. obsessed with the anti-DPRK hostile conception are openly barking that they will bring down the DPRK by leading it to \"changes\" in utter denial of its ideology and social system, and obstructing the south Korean authorities in every way so that they may not opt for mending the relations with it. This is well known to the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There are heaps of realistic issues pending solutions between the north and the south but there is not a single problem the south Korean authorities can settle without the U.S. interference. This is the DPRK's judgment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the stark reality that without setting right the abnormal master-servant relations with the U.S. it is hard to expect a fundamental change in the north-south relations. The DPRK can never believe the south Korean authorities' will for dialogue as long as such situation goes on.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should not just pay lip-service to \"dialogue\" and \"confidence\" but make a bold decision to settle national issues and reunification issue with their fellow countrymen through frank discussions, free from the U.S. control, and show the will for the improvement of the relations by taking practical and trust-based measures.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should also stop such acts of doing harm to fellow countrymen and escalating tensions by toeing to the U.S. policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To talk about \"dialogue\" without taking practical measures is not an attitude to truly settle the issue of the north-south relations. Such behavior cannot be interpreted otherwise than a poor charade to make the public at home and abroad believe that they are interested in improving the north-south ties and to shift the blame for the failure to open dialogue on to the DPRK side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As we have repeatedly clarified our stand, we are fully ready to bring about a fresh landmark phase in the north-south relations for the dignity and destiny of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prospect of the north-south relations entirely depends on the attitude of the south Korean authorities."

This clearly proved that the \"resolution\" was a politically-motivated false document and a fabrication.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It also clearly proved that the \"human rights\" campaign kicked up by the U.S. at the UN and other international arenas is an illegal and brigandish act of wantonly infringing upon the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that the falsity and reactionary nature of the \"resolution\" have been fully disclosed, the U.S. is persistently insisting on the \"validity\" of the \"report\" in a bid to justify the \"human rights resolution\" at any cost, far from apologizing to the DPRK for its wrongdoings. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The former chairman and the \"special rapporteur\" of the CI are busy claiming the validity of the \"report\", asserting it is based not only on the \"testimonies\" made by Sin but also on those made by other \"witnesses\" in various countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK would like to ask them whether there was even a single citizen of it among those 300 odd \"testifiers\" they brought to make the \"report\" sound plausible and whether any of them has ever visited the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The countries visited by the members of the CI are the countries hostile to the DPRK such as the U.S. and Japan and those met by them are either citizens of the hostile countries or \"defectors from the north\" under the control of the south Korean authorities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the early period of its establishment, the CI announced that it would conduct an inquiry on the basis of testimonies made by \"defectors from the north\" and satellite photos. The former chairman of the Commission, when interviewed by an Australian broadcasting service on May 7, 2013, told that there were various pieces of information on \"human rights abuses in north Korea\" but problem is lack of information to confirm them. Such utterances should not be overlooked.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, Washington formed the \"Commission of Inquiry\" with Kirby, Biserko and Darusman as its core members and instigated them to fabricate a false document. As far as those guys are concerned, they are all political swindlers who had been involved in the operations of the CIA.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After all, the \"report\" which they claimed comprehensively \"judged\" and \"estimated\" the human rights performance in the DPRK and contain even pieces of \"recommendations\" was worked out in a matter of less than a year. On the basis of it the UN forcibly adopted the anti-DPRK \"resolution\" bereft of scientific accuracy and credibility.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was none other than the U.S. and its followers that let Sin appear as a leading \"testifier\" at the UN and other international arenas in a bid to forge the document peppered with frauds and lies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, those who played a main role in working out the resolution are now asserting that Sin is just one of \"many testifiers\" and the \"testimonies made by him are of no particular value.\" This is, indeed, the height of brazen-facedness.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is not only a wanton challenge to the DPRK highly dignified for its independence as it guarantees genuine human rights of its popular masses but shameless hypocrisy and mockery of the fair-minded world public calling for total nullification of the anti-DPRK \"human rights resolution.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With no rhetoric can those hostile forces misrepresent the true human rights performance in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Truth is bound to be revealed any time for history and the world public.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After Sin made an apology for his false testimonies, Blaine Harden, author and publisher of a book dealing with the story told by him about \"the experience he gained while defecting from the north\", contributed an article to a newspaper in which he admitted he was \"deceived by Sin\" and \"Sin was an incredible guy from the very beginning and there would be more misinformation except for the one confessed by him.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is by no means fortuitous that an Italian lawmaker, who had visited the DPRK, told Radio 24 of Italy that \"all what defector from north Korea Sin Tong Hyok uttered at press conferences was lies meant to make money.\" \"Books containing his lies are being sold and I, therefore, don’t buy book falsifying facts,\" he added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters is that the UN, forgetful of its mission and duty, danced to the tune of the U.S. conspiratorial moves and was abused by it for its anti-DPRK racket.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What the UN did seriously hurt its honor as it was the most disgraceful case in history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a shame on the UN that it is being abused as an unlawful mechanism of mocking at the justice and truth under the control of a specified country called the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The UN should retract the above-said anti-DPRK \"human rights resolution.\""

Puesto que la politica hostil anti-RPDC del gangsteril imperialismo norteamericano se torna cada vez mas imprudente y brutal, sera mas duro el enfrentamiento de justicia de nuestro ejercito y pueblo para frustrarla.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En otro tiempo, los autores de la politica norteamericana decian cinicamente que no tienen la politica hostil anti-RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, Obama revelo por si solo que la politica sobre Corea de su pais es la mas hostil y su proposito principal es \"derrumbar\" a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestro ejercito y pueblo elevaran ilimitadamente el grado de enfrentamiento de justicia mientras se pone mas cruel y extremada la politica hostil anti-RPDC de EE.UU., se recrudece el nivel de sancion y presion y se amplian la dimension y esfera de los ejercicios de guerra contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe conocer bien que desde hace mucho tiempo, en nuestro pais todos los habitantes y miliares estan usando en comun la frase \"el imperialismo yanqui es enemigo jurado\" y que el revanchismo anti-EE.UU., que calienta este territorio llamando a exterminar y dar muerte, se expande ahora hacia el territorio norteamericano, cuartel general de criminales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2.  Ya que la estrategia militar del gangsteril imperialismo norteamericano sobre la RPDC llega a la fase de provocacion de la guerra de agresion, el enfrentamiento de justicia de nuestro ejercito y pueblo se enfocara en hacer sufrir la tragedia mas amarga a los Estados Unidos de America.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde el principio, el imperialismo yanqui es la banda de bandidos enviciados en invertir la verdad y provocar la guerra con complots y fraudes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. es el autor de la escalada de la guerra de agresion contra Vietnam desatada inventando el incidente del golfo Bac Bo y ocupo a Irak con la farsa de \"eliminacion de armas de exterminio masivo\". En la decada de 1950, provoco la guerra de agresion contra la RPDC pretextando la \"agresion al Sur\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy dia, la banda de Obama fabrica el inexistente \" problema de DDHH\" de la RPDC e intenta \"derrocarla\" con la guerra cibernetica circulando el rumor de que el hacking contra \"SONY Pictures\" es \"obra del Norte de Corea (RPDC)\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnte esta circunstancia peligrosa, nuestro ejercito y pueblo decidieron escribir precisamente en el territorio norteamericano con los fusiles del monte Paektu la ultima pagina de arruinamiento definitivo que dara punto final a la historia vergonzosa de EE.UU. que registro solo las derrotas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdelantaremos la caida final de EE.UU. con la guerra convencional, el ataque nuclear y la guerra cibernetica por nuestro estilo si el imperio impone la guerra de agresion con las fuerzas convencionales, provoca la guerra de agresion con las fuerzas nucleares e intenta \"derrumbarnos\" con la guerra cibernetica. Esto es nuestra opcion resuelta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe conocer bien que el minimizado, preciso y diversificado medio de ataque nuclear y los medios de guerra terrestre, maritima, submarina, aerea y cibernetica de la RPDC se aplicaran segun el espiritu invencible, la idea y voluntad indoblegables y la autoctona estrategia y tactica y los particulares metodos de combate de nuestro ejercito y pueblo, sin precedentes en la historia de guerra mundial, los que no puede tener ni imitar el bandidesco imperialismo norteamericano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. No tenemos la necesidad ni voluntad de conversar mas con los tipejos norteamericanos mientras el gangsteril imperialismo norteamericano este desesperado para suprimir nuestra idea y \"derrumbar\" nuestro regimen. Esto es la decision resuelta de nuestro ejercito y pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda de Obama suele decir que se debe inducir el cambio de la RPDC y el \"derrumbe\" de su regimen, a traves de la \"estrategia de dos alternativas\": la \"presion\" con la fuerza y el \"dialogo\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestro ejercito y pueblo anuncian formalmente a la administracion Obama de los Estados Unidos de America que no tenemos la necesidad ni voluntad de conversar y tratarse mas con EE.UU., mientras el gangsteril imperialismo norteamericano con la desventura en su futuro hable del \"derrumbe\" de la RPDC ignorando su situacion miserable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda de Obama debe dejar de decir a todo el mundo los chismes como que el dialogo es posible cuando \"haya primero el cambio\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl igual que el pasado, continuan hoy y continuaran siempre en el futuro la tradicion de victoria eterna de la RPDC y la de verguenza y derrota del imperialismo norteamericano, registradas en la historia de enfrentamiento RPDC-EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLlega al cielo el impetu de nuestro ejercito y pueblo decididos a ajustar las cuentas finales con el bandidesco imperialismo norteamericano mediante la batalla superintransigente nunca vista antes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl gangsteril imperialismo norteamericano, enloquecido siglo tras siglo por la politica hostil anti-RPDC, debe tener presente que se acerca cada vez mas el momento de pesadilla en que sufrira la caida definitiva mas tragica en el territorio propio."

Esperamos que demanden con urgencia a la Union Europea, Japon y otros promotores de la \"resolucion\" a reconocer por si mismos y pedir disculpas ante la sociedad internacional, de lo que la aprobaron mediante la conspiracion y fraudes sin entrevistarse con ninguno de los ciudadanos de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor ultimo, la carta senala que la aprobacion de la \"resolucion\" es la burla e insulto a la ONU y que tenemos la voluntad de realizar activamente el dialogo y la cooperacion en la rama de derechos humanos si se retira la \"resolucion\" inventada por las fuerzas hostiles basandose en los datos falsos revelados totalmente en la sociedad internacional."
