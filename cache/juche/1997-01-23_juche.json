This is a reversed logic and the most vicious \r\nsophism that can be made by the fascist tyrant who has \r\nturned his back on the people.\r\n   His statement that the \"national  assembly may debate on \r\nthe issue of rewriting the two  evil laws\" is not aimed at \r\nrewriting them but to gain time, tide over the crisis \r\nand destroy the labor movement organisations one after \r\nanother.\r\n   Minju Joson says that it is only too natural that the \r\n\"Korean Confederation of Trade Unions\" and other labor \r\nmovement organisations warned that they will mount a more \r\npowerful all-people struggle unless their demands for \r\nnullification of the evil laws are met. \r\n\r\n"
