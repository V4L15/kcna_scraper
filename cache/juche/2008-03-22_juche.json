It was successfully reproduced as \"A Mountain Shrine\"-style revolutionary drama under the guidance of Kim Jong Il two decades back. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The drama makes a truthful representation of the vulnerability of the Japanese imperialists who bluff, betraying their brigandish nature and inner contradictions. Thus, it teaches the truth of the revolution that imperialism is bound to go to ruin and the people are sure to win as they fight in single-minded unity, their hearts burning with the spirit of national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Speakers at the seminar said that the creation of \"Celebration Meeting\" as a masterpiece of the era along with other revolutionary dramas \"A Mountain Shrine\", \"Blood at an International Conference\", \"A Letter from a Daughter\" and \"Three Pretenders\" under the energetic guidance of Kim Jong Il represented a great success that glorified the history of Juche-oriented dramatic art. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They stressed that the ideas and theories expounded by Kim Jong Il while guiding the said drama serve as important guidelines to be held fast to in the creation of revolutionary literary and art works in the era of Songun and a banner encouraging the creators and artistes in their work to produce masterpieces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such works as the revolutionary dramas \"Under the Banner of Victory\", \"Wish\" and \"Woman Comrade of Mt.

But it has put spurs to the moves to round off the preparations for another Korean war by ceaselessly beefing up its aggression forces in and around the peninsula, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists still seek to invade the DPRK by force of arms and put the whole of Korea under their control. To this end, they are leaving no means untried to invent a pretext for materializing the above-said scenario. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whenever there mounted an atmosphere for detente and reunification on the peninsula, the U.S. warlike forces resorted to undisguised moves to vitiate it and fabricated shocking incidents, driving the situation to an extreme pitch of tension. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the U.S. strategic calculation that it is essential to seize Korea in order to put Asia under its control and doing so would help carry out its Asia strategy and, furthermore, the world strategy with ease. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said provocative war maneuvers designed to invade the DPRK were prompted by such strategic objective. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. trigger-happy forces are now raising a hue and cry over the fictitious \"missile threats\" from the DPRK. This is aimed to secure a pretext necessary for mounting a military attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The one-sided hard-line policy toward the DPRK being pursued by them in contravention of the spirit of the six-party talks is aimed at pushing the situation on the peninsula to the phase of acute confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their desperate efforts to provoke a new war on the peninsula in a bid to stifle the DPRK would get them nowhere. Preemptive strike is not a monopoly of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. warlike forces had better drop their one-sided hard-line policy towards the DPRK and stop reckless military actions of harassing peace and security of the Korean Peninsula and thus fulfill their responsibility and commitments for the settlement of the issue of the peninsula.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
