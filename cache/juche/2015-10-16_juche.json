It is trumpeting about \"freedom of religion\" though it has resorted to the moves for toppling the social systems of those countries courting its displeasure and destabilizing them in all parts of the world by abusing the freedom of religion. This is the height of hypocrisy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has already been known well that wicked pseudo \"religious organizations\" at the prodding of the U.S. lured and kidnapped DPRK innocent citizens and reduced them to \"defectors from the north\" and are using them for anti-DPRK operations in a crafty and sinister manner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has not even elementary qualifications to talk about the freedom of religion and religious faith as it indiscriminately bombed Christian churches and killed many religionists during the past Korean war and is fostering contradictions among religions in every part of the world for the purpose of dominating the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is slandering the DPRK under all sorts of absurd pretexts, pursuant to the extreme hostile policy toward it. This is touching off surging hatred and resentment among the service personnel and people of the DPRK who regard Korean socialism centered on the popular masses as their life and soul.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the service personnel and people of the DPRK fully determined to devotedly defend the headquarters of the revolution will strongly react against the persistent \"human rights\" racket kicked up by the U.S. to bring down the social system of the DPRK, obsessed by the inveterate repugnancy and hostility toward it."
