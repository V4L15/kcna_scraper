            "content": "Marshal Kim Jong Un Sends Congratulations to All People's Security Personnel  \r\n Pyongyang, November 23 (KCNA) -- The dear respected Marshal Kim Jong Un on Friday sent a congratulatory message to the participants in the national meeting of chiefs of branch social security stations and all other security personnel. \n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un said in the message that the meeting marked an important occasion in eternally preserving and glorifying Generalissimos Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il's Juche-oriented idea of people's security and their undying leadership exploits and in bringing about a drastic turn in the work for ensuring people's security by increasing the branch security stations' militant functions and roles as required by the new historic era of Juche revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t While a company plays a pivotal role in the People's Army, the branch security station does a similar role at the people's security organ and it is a key link in the chain efforts for bolstering the combat capability of the people's security organ to increase its militancy, the message noted, adding that this is the unique idea of building people's security organ enunciated by Kim Il Sung and \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Workers' Party of Korea has attached importance to the People's Internal Security Forces and paid deep attention to strengthening the branch security stations true to the noble intentions of the great Generalissimos, the message said, and continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The WPK took a measure to hold the national meeting of chiefs of branch security stations as the first meeting in the field of people's security in 2012, the beginning of another century of Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The message highly praised the feats performed by the participants in the meeting and all other security personnel, recalling that they have reliably defended the lifeline of Juche revolution and stood guard over the outpost of the class struggle, holding high the banner of devotedly safeguarding the leader under the leadership of the WPK in the glorious days and trying days.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the determination and will of the WPK to put forward the People's Army and the People's Internal Security Forces on the first line of Songun revolution and build a thriving nation and reunify the country in reliance on their invincible military power, the message said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the People's Internal Security Forces are to discharge their honorable mission and role, it is necessary to strengthen the branch station, a cell and the lowest combat unit of the people's security organ.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The main task facing the branch security stations at present is to consolidate area in their charge into a fortress for devotedly defending the headquarters of revolution by applying Kim Jong Il's patriotism to the security work and creditably protect the socialist system and the people's lives and properties by turning the area into a safe one free from crimes, law-breaking and accidents.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Let us become matchless and stalwart security persons devotedly defending the party, social system and people!\" -- this is the militant slogan to be held high by the security persons and service personnel of the ISF. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is also necessary to beef up security for the factories, enterprises, cooperative farms, public service facilities and major construction sites in the areas in their charge to provide a sure legal guarantee for the building of a socialist economic power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t True to the noble will of Kim Jong Il, who enabled them to go by the word \"people\" in their name, people's security personnel should make it deeply rooted habit to love the people and dedicate themselves to them and thus take care of and protect the Korean people, the best people in the world, so that they may live in peace, enjoying luxury and wealth under socialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Marshal Kim Jong Un expressed firm belief that they would creditably discharge their honorable mission and duty as revolutionary armed forces of the WPK and internal security forces of the supreme commander."
