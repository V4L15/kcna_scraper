            "content": "Anniversary of publication of Kim Il Sun's work marked\r\n Pyongyang, June 24 (KCNA) -- A Pyongyang meeting took place on June 23 to mark the 25th anniversary of the publication of President Kim Il Sung's historic work \"Let us prevent a national partition and reunify the country.\"\r\n   The work was published at the grave time when the nation was exposed to danger of permanent division owing to the \"two Koreas\" plot of the splittists at home and abroad.\r\n   Upset by the sentiment for reunification which mounted on a nationwide scale on the occasion of the publication of the July 4 joint statement early in the 1970s, the South Korean ruling quarters violated the agreed points and principles of the joint statement at the instigation of outside forces soon after they signed it.\r\n   At this time, the President, penetrating the splittist colors of the South Korean puppets, indicated the five-point policy of national reunification in a historic speech on June 23, Juche 62 (1973).\r\n   Director of the secretariat of the committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland Han Si Hae in his report at the meeting said that the President's advancement of the policy, a historic event in removing the danger of permanent division of the Korean nation and opening an epochal phase of national reunification, is a distinguished exploit performed by him in the struggle for national reunification, the reporter noted.\r\n   He continued:\r\n   In order to reunify the country at an early date, it is necessary to improve the acute inter-Korean relations and achieve great unity of the entire nation.\r\n   If the South Korean authorities truly want to implement the north-south agreement, they should not bring forward \"reciprocity\" and \"stage-by-stage unification\" which do not deserve even a passing note, but respect and implement the three principles of national reunification, the common programme of the nation.\r\n   The reporter expressed the hope that political parties, organisations and figures of all social sectors in South Korea and abroad would actively respond to the north's proposal to hold the \"grand festival for national reconciliation, unity and reunification\" at Panmunjom on the occasion of the 53rd anniversary of national liberation.\r\n   Present at the meeting were Yang Hyong Sop, Chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly, Jang Chol, Vice-Premier of the Administration Council, leading officials of public organisations and religious organisations and people of all walks of life.    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n"

Korean authorities blasted for obstructing reunification festival\r\n Pyongyang, June 24 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today accuses the South Korean authorities of trying to check the August 15 pro-reunification festival scheduled to be held at Panmunjom with the participation of compatriots in the north, south and overseas to celebrate the 53rd anniversary of the country's liberation.\r\n   The daily says in a commentary:\r\n   The proposal of the north's political parties and organizations for a grand festival for national reconciliation, unity and reunification mirrored their hope that political parties, organizations and figures of various social sectors in the north, south and overseas  will unite with each other as the same nation, irrespective of difference in ideology, idea and system, and redouble their efforts for the country's reunification.\r\n   As regards the festival, however, the South Korean authorities are alleging that the north does not mind the political barrier existing in the south. This is really a self-seeking view.\r\n   What is more serious is that the South Korean \"Ministry of National Unification\" intends to poke its nose into the non-government festival which has nothing to do with it, and abuse the event for its ulterior purpose.\r\n   The breakdown of the vice minister-level talks between the north and the south was, in the final analysis, attributable to the fact that Kang In Dok, \"Minister of National Unification,\" raised such an irrelevant issue as \"reciprocity\" at the talks in the hope of boosting his public image.\r\n   No progress has been made in non-governmental cooperation also due to obstructions by such popularity-hunters as him.\r\n   If the north and the south are to hold a pro-reunification festival, achieve reconciliation and cooperation and pave a broad way for reunification, it is imperative to immediately eliminate those who are fostering confrontation with the north and seeking only their own honor.    \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n"

Their plan was to occupy the area of Korea north of the 38th parallel.\r\n   The then U.S. President, Truman, instructed the U.S. Far East Army Commander, Macarthur, to work out a plan for a war against Korea in 1949. On this instruction, the  Al-3 plan began to be worked out.\r\n   Macarthur ordered Robert, head of the U.S. military advisory group in South Korea, high-ranking generals of Syngman Rhee's puppet army and military officials of Japan to map out an operation plan for breaking through the 38th parallel. \r\n   They formed forces and combat equipment to break through the 38th parallel. And they planned to deliver the main attack in the Kaesong-Kumchon-Pyongyang direction and make attacks in Ongjin peninsula-Sinchon-Sariwon, Ryonchon-kalma, Hwachon-Kumhwa and Yangyang-Kosong directions. The U.S. Air Force and the U.S. navy were to take part in the operation from the early period of the war and U.S. ground forces (24th, 25th and seventh divisions and first mechanized division) to swiftly join in the war.\r\n   The Al-3  plan for invading Korea was examined by the U.S. President and military officials in autumn 1949 and then discussed and ratified at the U.S. National Security Council.\r\n   The U.S. also mapped out NSC-68 operation plan for their \"special action\" in case the Korean War broke out. This plan was related to the Korean War and became the basic guidelines of the U.S.A. policy.\r\n   All these plans for provoking the Korean War were immediately marked on the operation maps in detail. And the military officials stepped up operation study and preparations based on the plans.    \r\n\r\n"

Asia strategy.\r\n   The Japan-based U.S. Forces are a tool for the U.S. Asia strategy to the core= they are aggression forces, which back the U.S. policy of stifling the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and realiziing its wild ambition for world supremacy. The u.s. Forces present in northeast Asia, including Japan and South Korea, are a possible provoker for the second Korean War and a wrecker of peace.    \r\n\r\n"
