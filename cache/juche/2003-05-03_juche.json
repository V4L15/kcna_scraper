The differing ideas and systems existing in the north and the south can never be a source of a war. The cause of national reunification is, in essence, one of relinking the severed blood ties of the nation and achieving national unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when the north and the south work together to reunify the country by their concerted efforts, placing the common denominators and common interests of the nation above anything else, can they achieve national reunification irrespective of idea and system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The three principles of national reunification serve as a great reunification programme common to the nation as they indicate the way of solving the reunification issue most smoothly and reasonably according to the Korean nation's unanimous wish and will for reunification.    \r\n\r\n"

And he went to the lengths of beautifying Japan's past crimes by justifying the distortion of its history textbooks.\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is working hard to flee from the responsibility for its past crimes at any cost instead of honestly admitting and compensating for them even in the new century. This once again lays bare the brazen-faced nature and moral vulgarity peculiar to Japan before the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The human history records many wars. But it is only the Japanese imperialist aggression troops, which committed most hideous crimes against humanity by forcing a large number of women into sexual slavery even in battlefields. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government, however, is employing all sorts of sleight of hand to evade its responsibility and compensation for Japan's past crimes though more than half a century has passed since its defeat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese ruling quarters are trying hard to abdicate Japan's responsibility for sexual slavery, while doling out a paltry amount of \"solatium\" to survivors of \"comfort women\" for the imperial Japanese army from the \"civilian fund\" created in 1995. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No one can falsify history and truth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' persistent efforts to flee from the responsibility to redress Japan's past crimes with a wrong view on history would only increase the bitterness of the Korean people and other people of the world toward Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will surely force Japan to pay in the new century for the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists in the last century.    \r\n\r\n"
