Kim Jong Il warmly loved the country and the people more than anything else and devoted all his life to the prosperity of the country and happiness of the people, he added. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went on to say:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il's long journey of patriotic devotion undergoing arduous ordeals helped face-lift the country and laid the eternal foundation for a thriving nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His warm love for the socialist motherland and people and self-sacrificing devotion to the prosperity of the country and people's happiness are derived from his absolute trust in his own people and steadfast confidence in justice of the socialist system and victory of socialism. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His warm love and devotion are also prompted by his noble awareness and sense of mission that he was responsible for the destiny of the country and people whom President Kim Il Sung entrusted to him. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Patriotism that he had displayed is the noblest one which can be called after him only in the light of its essence and its tremendous vitality. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This patriotism constitutes the height of socialist patriotism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il's patriotism is the warmest love for our socialist motherland and people and the most energetic and self-sacrificing devotion to the prosperity of the country and people's happiness. It is genuine patriotism as he loved every tree and every blade of grass of the country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il's patriotism is based on the noble outlook on the country, people and posterity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This patriotism is the precious mental legacy and practical example he left to the Korean people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the officials, party members and other working people should actively learn from noble patriotism of Kim Jong Il and embody it into practice just as it is. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should faithfully carry forward and complete all the work Kim Jong Il had planned and tried to realize in his lifetime in order to materialize his idea and wishes in this land. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The greatest patriotism lies in defending the country.

He kept to the road of patriotic dedication to the country and the people till the last moments of his life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The struggle to defend the socialist country was the most acute confrontation with imperialist allied forces and the grimmest struggle in history. Kim Jong Il made a long journey of the arduous Songun leadership in the do-or-die spirit to tide over the grim difficulties faced by the country and defended it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was thanks to the wise guidance of Kim Jong Il that our country which had been deprived of its state sovereignty due to weak military muscle a century ago is now demonstrating its might as a world-level military power equipped with tremendous military capabilities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was also thanks to the long journey of patriotic devotion made by Kim Jong Il covering rugged path all his life that the country has been face-lifted and a solid cornerstone for the prosperity of the country laid.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The land of the country has been rezoned as befitting the socialist country and gravity-fed waterways were built in several regions, turning rural villages into a socialist land of bliss.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lots of modern heavy industrial and light industrial factories have been built and the factories that had existed have been renovated as required by the new century and grand edifices for the prosperity of the country and the happiness of posterity have been successfully built across the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The drive for putting industry on a CNC basis that led to Korean-style industrial revolution in the new century proves the high level of Kim Jong Il's patriotism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the country was undergoing difficulties, Kim Jong Il had valuable funds allocated for putting the country's industry on a CNC basis for the future of the prosperous country even though he worried about the people suffering from the shortage of food.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nothing is more patriotic than to enlist strength for the prosperity and development of the country. Only when the country is strong, can it defend itself and guarantee the happiness of all the generations to come. Kim Jong Il used to shed tears whenever he heard song \"Push Back the Frontiers of Latest Science and Technology\" as the song reminded him of the arduous path he had covered and the pains he had taken to put industry on a CNC basis. His tears reflected his genuine patriotism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His warm love for the socialist motherland and people and self-sacrificing devotion to the prosperity of the country and people's happiness are derived from his absolute trust in his own people and steadfast confidence in justice of the socialist system and victory of socialism. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His warm love and devotion are also prompted by his noble awareness and sense of mission that he is responsible for the destiny of the country and people whom President Kim Il Sung entrusted to him."

To reunify the country is the supreme task of the nation that brooks no further delay. National reunification precisely means patriotism and national division treachery.
