            "content": "Pro-Japanese Sycophantic and Traitorous Remarks Flailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 10 (KCNA) -- Han Sung Jo, co-representative of the Free Citizens Solidarity of south Korea, in a recent article contributed to Seiron, a magazine of the right-wing conservatives of Japan, let loose a string of balderdash that the Koreans were fortunate enough to be under the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule and one should consider it as a blessing rather than feeling resentful at it and should thank the Japanese for it and that it facilitated the growth and development of south Korea.\r\nAgainst the backdrop of the mounting public criticism of these reckless remarks, military critic Ji Man Won, Chief Editor of Wolgan Joson Jo Kap Je ill-famed as a reactionary conservative hack writer, Professor of Seoul National University Ri Yong Mun and other riffraffs told a spate of similar rubbish one after another. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Thursday says in a signed commentary carried in this regard: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe reckless remarks made by these pro-Japanese traitors are an unbearable insult and unpardonable challenge to all the Koreans who are all out in the struggle to force Japan to pay for all the crimes perpetrated by the Japanese imperialists in the past. This is the most shameful act of treachery against the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese right-wing reactionaries and the pro-Japanese traitorous forces of south Korea have so far made not a few nonsensical remarks distorting the history of sufferings imposed by the Japanese imperialists upon the Korean nation. But the outcries made by the group of traitors such as Han Sung Jo this time are something unprecedented. They might have been bribed by the Japanese reactionaries in a bid to calm down the anti-Japanese sentiment of the Koreans that has mounted higher than ever before since the declassification of documents related to the south Korea-Japan agreement, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries would be well advised to stop such a base ruse, clearly understanding that their foolish attempt to use such human rubbish and living dead as Han Sung Jo for justifying their crime-woven past would only trigger off bitterer anti-Japanese resentment among the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people should wage a more dynamic struggle against the outside forces in order to sternly punish the pro-Japanese, pro-U.S. sycophantic traitors selling the dignity and interests of the nation to them and protect the dignity and sovereignty of the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Cancellation of Plan for North-Targeted War Exercises Demanded \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 10 (KCNA) -- The south Korea-U.S. \"Combined Forces Command\" announced that it would stage RSOI and Foal Eagle joint military exercises from March 19 to 25. Rodong Sinmun Thursday observes in a signed\r\ncommentary in this regard:\r\n The U.S.-projected large-scale saber rattling is obviously a grave military threat and provocation against the DPRK and a dangerous test war aimed at stifling it by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aim sought by the U.S. through these war drills is to revive the suspended Team Spirit joint military exercises and examine and round off the overall preparations for a nuclear attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is the fact that the U.S. is set to stage those large-scale war maneuvers against the DPRK while extremely aggravating the DPRK-U.S. nuclear stand-off. The Bush forces pretended to be interested in the settlement of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. while talking about an early resumption of the six-party talks. They, however, slandered the DPRK as an \"outpost of tyranny\" at the outset of the year and have since deliberately bedeviled the DPRK-U.S. relations, keeping the door of the six-party talks closed. The U.S. projected joint war exercises clearly tell what their real intention is. Their talk about \"peaceful settlement\" of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. is no more than hypocrisy as their real aim is to stifle the DPRK by force of arms, come what may. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. ignites a nuclear war, the DPRK will take a merciless counter-action with powerful means and remove all the sources of aggression and war from the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and south Korean bellicose forces would be well advised to cancel at once their plan for north-targeted war exercises which would bring only a disgraceful destruction to them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S.-Advertised \"Freedom and Democracy\" Debunked \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 10 (KCNA) -- The \"commitment to the diffusion of freedom and democracy\" advertised by the U.S. imperialists is a slogan of aggression and interference to gratify their ambition for world supremacy, says Rodong\r\nSinmun in an article today.\r\n The author of the article continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This \"commitment\" is a link in the whole chain of their \"globalization\" maneuvers and its immediate target is to demolish the political systems of the anti-U.S. independent countries and nations by sending the U.S.-style wind into them. What the U.S. seeks in this is to poke its nose deep into the internal affairs not only of the countries and nations falling out of its favor but of all other countries and nations of the world as well and reorganize their political systems on the U.S. pattern. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"commitment\" is intended to realize its global domination by establishing a neocolonial international order, more crafty and veiled. It is the old game of the U.S. imperialists to invade other countries by surprise and get their hand on their affairs while beating the drum of \"freedom\" and \"democracy\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the U.S. means by \"diffusion of freedom and democracy\" is well illustrated by its acts in turning Iraq into an abattoir of people and a barren land of human rights where killing and human rights abuses are rife. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis clearly reveals the real nature of what it calls \"diffusion of freedom and democracy\". It behaves like the \"emperor\" of the world and thinks it is natural for all the members of the international community to live by its political mode. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is south Korea which is subject to the crudest aggression and interference of the U.S. imperialists under the cloak of \"freedom\" and \"democracy\". They have constantly stepped up their moves for a permanent division of Korea and provocation of another war for long six decades since they landed in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. \"commitment to the diffusion of freedom and democracy\" is an offspring of its crisis and it is resorting to a more crafty and vicious method to wriggle itself out of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world people look through the sly ruse of the U.S. in peddling the \"commitment\" and do not allow themselves to be duped by it. With no deceptive and hypocritical means and method can it conceal its aggressive and dominationist colors, concludes the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Kwanmo (2,540 meters high above the sea level) in the northeastern part of the country for such rare animals living in the northern area as the Korean tiger, bear, goral and sable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Researchers of the Central Zoo have made many achievements in the scientific research for proliferation of animals outside the habitats. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Typical of the animals are Korean tiger, bear and Grus japonensis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The government has also taken concrete measures for protecting and propagating crane and spoonbill, each accounting for about 1,000 in East Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the good habitats on the way of the migratory birds have been set up as their reserves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Deep attention has been paid to the proliferation of new ecological species of animals.\r\n Typical of them is Salvelinus malma m. chonjiensis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ichthyologists of the country took fries of char to Lake Chon on Mt. Paektu from rivers to adapt them to the climatic and hydrological conditions and ecological environment of the lake and thus bred a new species of char. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The new one grows as big as over 85 centimeters, far larger than other species of char.\r\n It inhabits in the highest place (2,200 meters above the sea level) in the southern tip of the Eurasian continent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  A deep-going study is being conducted into Salvelinus malma m. chonjiensis as fish protected in the international biosphere reserves.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
