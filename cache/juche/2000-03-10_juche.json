But the constitutional restriction of Japan is a hurdle in its way. Though  the U.S. secured a variety of levers guaranteeing Japan's military assistance to the U.S. in case of \"emergency\", its \"peace constitution\" bans Japan from any war action. So the U.S. is so keen on removing such constitutional restriction of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the ulterior intention of the United States to achieve its aggressive design with less efforts and  with no financial contribution by making Japan shoulder the war burden and bear its brunt within the framework of the shackling military alliance. \r\n\r\n"
