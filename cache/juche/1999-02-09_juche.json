During his on-site guidance he said nothing should be spared for scientists and technicians, the valuable treasures of the nation, adding that the spirit of attaching priority to science should be prevalent in the whole country. \r\n   During his on-the-spot guidance to the academy in Juche 84 (1995) he underscored this spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK has 1.8 million intellectuals armed with the Juche idea, as well as  profound scientific and technological knowledge, including scientists and technicians.\r\n   It considers them the greatest wealth of the country and valuable asset for eternal prosperity of the country.\r\n   It has built modern comprehensive scientific research institutes up and down the country and provided every necessary condition for scientific researches. Scientific results are applied into practice amidst the concern of the whole party and all the people. Rodong Sinmun, the organ of the Workers' Party of Korea, television and other mass media give wide coverage to signal achievements of scientists and technicians.\r\n   Even under a difficult economic situation for several years the state has paid particular attention to the life of scientists and technicians. It has provided every facility, including supply of food and commodities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A hotel manageress in Huichon, Jagang Province, said that scientists and technicians should not feel hungry and served them with food and meat, its sideline products. The manageress and hotel employees have eaten food substitute instead. The manageress was awarded the title of labor heroine last year.\r\n   Moved by this spirit now prevalent in the whole society, scientists and technicians are taking the lead in the onward march with a high pride.\r\n   In recent years they have gained dazzling successes in electronics, heat engineering and bioengineering. Signal successes have been reported from high-tech domains as well.\r\n   The scientific and technological progress is opening a short cut for the building of a powerful nation. \r\n\r\n"
