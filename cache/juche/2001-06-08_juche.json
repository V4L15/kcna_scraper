A lack of national self-respect may lead to the repetition of a flunkeyist history, a humiliating history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people's history of struggle teaches the precious truth that when they live with plenty of guts coupled with high national self-respect, they can defend the sovereignty of the country and the dignity of the people and achieve prosperity and progress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The national self-respect of the Korean people reflects the great national pride and happiness in holding leader Kim Jong Il in high esteem as the great sun of the 21st century and a benevolent father and great national pride of living in the best socialist country centred on the popular masses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No force on earth can break such national self-respect.    \r\n\r\n"

Water of rivers went down, causing an acute shortage of irrigation water and an unprecedented delay in rice-transplanting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Worse still, over 20 m/s Kumgang foehn wind struck Kangwon Province in mid-May, doing damage to nearly all the farmland in Kosong and Thongchon areas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Drought and heat are expected to persist for several days to come owing to continental high pressure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The state is now taking an emergency step to draw even water from seas into rivers within the tolerable limit.    \r\n\r\n"
