Had Obama have even an iota of ethics and morality, he should have postponed or shelved his trip.  The American master and his servant staged the farce of insulting, threatening and blackmailing the DPRK during the former's criminal tour of south Korea utterly indifferent to the sorrow of south Koreans. This was entirely to serve the purpose of collusion and conspiracy in their campaign against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What Park did before Obama this time reminds one of an indiscreet girl who earnestly begs a gangster to beat someone or a capricious whore who asks her fancy man to do harm to other person while providing sex to him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through her ugly behavior Park answered with a war the question put by the DPRK if she wants peaceful reunification based on the inter-Korean reconciliation or a war through the confrontation of the social systems, and fully revealed that her policy of \"confidence- building process\" is just the same policy of confrontation as that pursued by traitor Lee Myung Bak. She, at the same time, declared before the whole world her intention to drive the situation to the worst catastrophe through the confrontation with the DPRK to the last in utter disregard of the north-south relations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She fully met the demands of her master for aggression, keeping mum about the nukes of the U.S. and desperately finding fault with fellow countrymen in the north over their nukes. She thus laid bare her despicable true colors as a wicked sycophant and traitor, a dirty comfort woman for the U.S. and despicable prostitute selling off the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She visited together with Obama even the \"south Korea-U.S. combined forces command\" for the first time as a puppet chief executive and went off confrontation hysteria, crying out for \"deterrence against the north\" and \"resolutely countering provocation from it.\" She even donned a dress unfit for the atmosphere of the mourner's house in the wake of the big tragedy and embarrassedly flattered Obama in a bid to please him, sparking off uproar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The anti-DPRK charade staged by Obama and his servant became a laughing stock of world people as it was nothing but an odd burlesque rare to be found in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The outcome of Obama's south Korean junket clearly proved that the DPRK was entirely just when it judged and determined that it should counter the U.S., the sworn enemy, by force only, not just talking, and should finally settle accounts with it through an all-out nuclear showdown. This, at the same time, only hardens the will and resolution of the DPRK to keep to the road chosen by it. Park's true colors and ulterior motive were brought to daylight. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is no remedy for Park and there is nothing to expect from her as far as the inter-Korean relations are concerned as long as she remains a boss of Chongwadae.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She is steeped in sycophancy and treachery and confrontation with compatriots in the north. Her preoccupation is to realize the dream of confrontation of the social systems. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Genes remain unchanged. Needless to say, her present behavior suggests that her fate will be just the same as that of her father Park Chung Hee who met a miserable death after being forsaken by his master and public while crying out for \"unification by prevailing over communism\" and \"unification by stamping out communism\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will never pardon anyone who dares challenge its dignity, social system and its line of simultaneously developing the two fronts, the statement warned."
