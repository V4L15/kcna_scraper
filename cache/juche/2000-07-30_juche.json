In the long run, this problem can be solved completely only when the independent reunification of the nation is realized. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK government has consistently pursued the policy of establishing diplomatic relations with those countries which were hostile towards the DPRK and at war and improving inter-Korean relations on the principle of respect to sovereignty and right to choice and made sincere efforts to this end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   I take this opportunity to reaffirm that the DPRK government will make active contribution to the joint exploration of the ways for peace and security suitable to the actual conditions of Asia in conformity with purpose and ideal of the forum. \r\n\r\n"
