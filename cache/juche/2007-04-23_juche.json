It is the most precious legacy bequeathed by him to the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President clarified the national problem from a new angle on the basis of the Juche idea, scientifically explained the law governing the development of the nation and the idea and line of the great national unity, thus providing a sure guarantee for the settlement of the national problem, reunification issue, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President, basing himself on a scientific analysis of the existence and development of the nation, originally clarified that the national problem is, in essence, the issue of national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After originally clarifying the essence of the national problem on the basis of the Juche idea, he put forward the most just idea and line of the great national unity essential for the settlement of the national problem. The above-said idea and line comprehensively deal with all the problems arising in achieving the great unity of the whole nation ranging from the basis and principle of the great unity to the tasks and ways to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when all the members of the Korean nation achieve the great unity of the nation from the stand that they are a homogeneous nation though they may differ from each other in ideology, political view and religious belief can they wipe out the distrust and terminate confrontation between the north the south of Korea, achieve the national reconciliation and unity and realize the peaceful reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President advanced the policy of reunifying the country by founding the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo, a reunified state to be set up by federal formula, providing a firm foundation for establishing an independent and reunified national state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reunification of the country by the federal formula presupposes tolerating and recognizing the two systems, two governments existing in the north and the south. Therefore, the great national unity nation serves as a basis for achieving it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The political basis of the DFRK is the unity of all classes and strata forming the nation. The President made the great unity of the whole nation serve as a basis for founding an independent and reunified national state, the federal state, the final goal of the settlement of the reunification issue. Herein lies the justice of the proposal for founding the DFRK set forth by him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President's Juche-oriented idea and line of the great national unity provide a firm guarantee for the achievement of the great unity of the whole nation and the cause of the country's reunification and serve as a precious treasure guaranteeing a bright future of the country and the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S. is staging joint military exercises with Japan and south Korea while reinforcing troops in and around south Korea. This is aimed to commit new state-sponsored terrorism, proxy terrorism against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is imperative to foil the U.S. imperialists' policy of aggression and strategy of terrorism in order to avert a war, defend global peace and defend the sovereignty and security of the country.

Korean Authorities' Anti-DPRK Malarkey Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland issued a statement Sunday accusing the prime minister of south Korea and a judge of the court of letting loose remarks seriously infringing upon the sovereignty of the DPRK. They talked about \"territory\" and \"articles of Constitution\" when dealing with the issue of the origin of goods produced in the Kaesong Industrial Zone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities have let loose vituperations aimed at tarnishing the DPRK's prestige and dignity in the past. But it is the first time that they made such reckless, provocative and traitorous malarkeys. Those remarks are not only a total denial of the June 15 joint declaration but an intolerable insult to the DPRK and a grave challenge to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are little short of a declaration of confrontation to bring the favorably developing north-south relations back to those in the past and war outbursts aimed to harass peace on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will never tolerate the south Korean authorities' anti-reunification act of opposing the June 15 joint declaration and tarnishing the dignity and prestige of the DPRK and certainly make them pay for those remarks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should admit the gravity of the situation and apologize before the Korean nation for the extremely provocative remarks against reunification. They should also immediately dismantle all legal and institutional mechanism going against the June 15 era.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They also decided to persistently apply the sanctions against the DPRK kicked off in October last year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson Saturday observes in a signed commentary carried in this regard: They are more interested in realizing their political stratagem than settling \"security\" and \"humanitarian issues.\" They are deliberately creating complexities and difficulties in the way of the six-party talks by raising at the talks the \"abduction issue\" irrelevant to their agenda. Clear is the aim sought by them through this. Successful progress in the talks would deprive Japan of any justification for its moves to realize militarist overseas expansion and turn Japan into a military power because it has so far used the \"nuclear issue\" on the Korean Peninsula as a good pretext for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The successful settlement of the above-said issue would make it hard for Japan to legitimately push forward any longer its moves to turn it into a military power, as they are banned by law, and precipitate its political and diplomatic isolation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the calculation of the Japanese reactionaries that their insistence on the \"abduction issue\" would help them appear as victims and stir up the national sentiment of the people in a bid to stop the political support rate for them from declining. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They seem to consider this behavior as a \"clever idea\" but others dismiss it as a ridiculous attitude of a political dwarf unable to foresee even an inch. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Frankly speaking, it is the message of the international community to Japan that it would be well advised to properly redeem its past crimes instead of raising a hue and cry over the \"abduction issue\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries had better behave themselves, pondering over the consequences to be entailed by their rash act.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
