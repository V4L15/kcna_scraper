He noted with satisfaction that officials of the province created things out of nothing by devotedly implementing lines and policies of the Workers' Party of Korea in the teeth of the imperialists'  isolation and suffocation moves, years of natural disasters and unfavourable natural and geographical conditions. He said that it is the \"Kanggye spirit\" and took measures for the whole party and all the people to learn from the spirit.\r\n   The Jagang provincial people have optimistically managed economic life by themselves even under the difficult situation. Thus, they have achieved great successes in various domains of the national economy and in the work for improving the people's living.\r\n   Last year alone, they built hundreds of minor power stations by their own efforts and heated many dwelling houses with extra electricity.\r\n   The Huichon General Machine Tool Plant, the Youth Electric Appliance Complex, the Amnokgang Tyre  Factory and other factories and enterprises carried out their production assignments for machine tools, electric goods, generating equipment and rolling stock accessories,  overcoming manifold hardships.\r\n   They  made tens of thousands of hectares of grassland, raised many grazing animals, built new fish farms and hothouses using the heat of the sun and managed land well.\r\n   Having acquainted himself with this Kim Jong Il noted with great satisfaction that Jagang Province could make a cheerful advance, not an \"arduous march\".\r\n  The Kanggye spirit has rapidly spread across the country.\r\n  Great achievements were made in socialist economic construction thanks to the Kanggye spirit.\r\n   The Joint New Year Editorial issued by the party, army and youth league papers said that the Kanggye spirit created in the socialist forced march is the motive power which encourages the whole party and all the people to build a powerful nation.\r\n   This year, the Korean people are turning out as one in the drive to achieve greater successes in socialist economic construction in the high-pitched Kanggye spirit.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Without rapidly developing science and technology, it is impossible to increase the nation's military power and fully display the potentiality of the independent national economy.\r\n   To develop science and technology more rapidly than others will guarantee the prosperity of the country and the nation and a bright prospect of Korean socialism.\r\n   The new era of a powerful nation requires a very high level of scientific and technical development. Only when science and technology are developed rapidly, can vast tasks for the building of a powerful nation be carried out as soon as possible and the dignity of Kim Il Sung's nation fully demonstrated.\r\n   If an upswing is effected in scientific and technical development, such a thing will take place in all sectors of socialist construction and a great turn will be made in the building of a powerful nation this year.\r\n   The daily calls on all the people to devotedly work for scientific and technical development with a strong sense of patriotism.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
