            "content": "70th Anniversary of Victory in Pochonbo Battle Marked \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyesan, June 3 (KCNA) -- A national meeting to mark the 70th anniversary of the victory in the historic Pochonbo battle commanded by President Kim Il Sung was held on the ground in front of the Monument to the Victorious Battle of Pochonbo on June 3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present there were Kim Yong Chun, Choe Thae Bok, Kim Ki Nam and Choe Yong Rim, leading officials of the Party and military organs, working people's organizations, ministries and national institutions, servicepersons of the Korean People's Army, officials in the field of the preservation of revolutionary sites, science, education, culture and art and media, heroes, those who had the honor of being received by the President, persons of merit, members of the June 18 construction shock brigade and officials and working people in Ryanggang Province and Hyesan City. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Choe Thae Bok, alternate member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, made a report at the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Pochonbo battle commanded by Kim Il Sung on June 4, Juche 26 (1937) explicitly told the whole world that the Korean people were not dead but alive and clearly proved the truth of the unique revolutionary idea of attaching importance to arms that fighting against the aggressors with arms alone makes it possible to achieve the sovereignty and independence of the country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The brilliant victory in the Pochonbo battle also taught the whole world the truth that the people deprived of their country can surely emerge victorious only when they fight against the aggressors, thus greatly encouraging the world revolutionary people in their struggle for national liberation and anti-imperialist, anti-fascist struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The victory in the operations for advancing into the homeland including the Pochonbo battle made the august name of the President serve as a beacon for the national resurrection for all the Korean people and the trust and reverence of the whole Korean nation for the President rapidly grew more profound.  Thanks to the leadership of the President the Korean people dynamically turned out in the anti-Japanese resistance, with the firm faith that Korea was sure to gain independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Pochonbo battle recorded a shining place in the history of the Korean people's anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle as it was an event of significance which proved the truth that a people guided by an outstanding leader can emerge victorious in the confrontation with any formidable imperialist enemies if they struggle to carve out the destiny of the country and the nation with the arms of revolution in their hands, proceeding from the firm independent stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fighting spirit displayed in the Pochonbo battle and exploits performed during the battle made great contributions to enriching the revolutionary traditions of Mt. Paektu and serve as a source of strength and a firm foundation which enable the WPK and the Korean people to advance the revolutionary cause of Juche along the road of victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to these glorious revolutionary traditions the army and people of the DPRK could defeat the brigandish Japanese imperialists, accomplish the historic cause of the country's liberation and successfully build a socialist power, independent in politics, self-supporting in economy and self-reliant in defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They put an end to the history of national subjugation and sufferings and covered a victorious road of independence, the path of socialism under the leadership of the President. With Kim Jong Il at the helm of the revolution, they are now creditably burnishing the new era of Juche revolution, the era of Songun, demonstrating the spirit of socialist Korea to the world on the glorious path of upholding his experienced and seasoned Songun revolutionary leadership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the firm will and determination of the WPK to steadfastly carry forward and develop the revolutionary traditions of Juche established by the President and dynamically advance the revolutionary cause of Songun based on the great traditions no matter how the times and situation and conditions of the revolutionary struggle may change. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter called upon all the servicepersons and people to single-mindedly unite around Kim Jong Il and resolutely fight for the building of a great prosperous powerful socialist nation, the country's reunification and the final victory of the revolutionary cause of Juche.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

By doing so, he gave steady continuity to the June 15 era of reunification and enabled not only the people in the north but also the fellow countrymen in the south to live in peace, benefited from the Songun politics. Thanks to the Songun politics of Kim Jong Il, peace on the Korean Peninsula has been firmly protected and the national history is making steady advance towards reconciliation and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il kindly invites whoever stands for national reunification with national conscience to join the ranks of Koreans keen to achieve great national unity, be he a capitalist, an army general or one in the upper crust of the ruling quarters.  This all-embracing policy based on patriotism serves as a key driver in the era of national reconciliation and unity, the June 15 era of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il is, indeed, a great leader of the nation who enjoys the high authority amid the unanimous respect and boundless praise from all Koreans in the north, the south and abroad irrespective of ideology and system as he has made immortal contributions to the sacred patriotic cause for the country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are still many difficulties and obstacles in the way of national reunification.

For this reason, they spend an increasing amount of money every year for boosting the number of reptile media, sharply boosting the quantities of propaganda materials and making them more reactionary and obscene in their contents. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the propaganda materials produced by the imperialists are without exception most reactionary as they diametrically run counter to progressive ideology and culture and play a very harmful role. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their moves for ideological and cultural poisoning adversely affect the struggle of the people for independence against imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The struggle against imperialism precisely means a showdown between forces and ideologies. It is impossible to advance revolution and protect the gains of revolution already achieved unless people are equipped with progressive thought and get working class awareness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The struggle against the capitalist ideological and cultural poisoning means fierce confrontation with imperialists and a struggle to defend the country's sovereignty without gunfire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will thoroughly frustrate the imperialists' vicious capitalist ideological and cultural poisoning with a high degree of revolutionary vigilance, firmly defend the socialist political and ideological position and thus powerfully accelerate the building of a great prosperous powerful nation, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
