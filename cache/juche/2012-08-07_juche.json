Paektu during the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule over Korea, cherished a patriotic will to build a country where the people's happiness would come true after he embarked on the road of revolution, taking as his lifetime task the cause of patriotism started in Mangyongdae and carried forward as the lifeline of revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the first spring after the country's liberation young Kim Jong Il mounted Moran Hill together with Kim Il Sung and anti-Japanese war hero Kim Jong Suk. At that time he made up his mind to green the whole country in the future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During the Fatherland Liberation War he wrote and composed song \"Embrace of Country\", culmination of ardent patriotism, and planted two young pine-nut trees, foreseeing the victory in the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il witnessed the heroic Korean people's determined struggle for postwar rehabilitation and construction and basic socialist construction under the leadership of Kim Il Sung.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He realized an immutable truth that Korean prospering socialism is sure to win as long as there are the outstanding leader and the people rallied close around him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On Sept. 1, 1960 Kim Jong Il entered Kim Il Sung University. That day he mounted Ryongnam Hill on the campus and made an oath to glorify Korea all over the world, upholding the cause of Kim Il Sung.

They did not hesitate to massacre those women in a bid to conceal their horrible crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sexual slavery committed by the Japanese imperialists was a hideous crime against humanity which can hardly be found in human history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the Japanese authorities still refuse to make honest apology and reparation for Japan's past barbarous crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's prime minister takes the lead in it. He has made unethical remarks, claiming that the expression of sexual slavery for the Japanese army was wrong. These thoughtless remarks made by the chief executive are enough to indicate the stand and attitude of Japanese politicians to the issue of post-war handling of Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Openly heard from the Japanese reactionaries are such reckless remarks as branding the sexual slavery committed by the Japanese army as \"deeds of individual procurers for prostitution\" and \"victims' voluntary acts for earning money\".
