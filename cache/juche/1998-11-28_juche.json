It is also essential for providing them with a sound and equal  material and cultural life and firmly defending their independent and creative life.\r\n   Some former socialist countries blindly followed the formula of politics of outdated society.  As a result, state and society were administered by specified persons, not by their masters, popular masses. This produced bureaucrats, paralyzing people's creativity.\r\n   Under the situation renegade socialists attacked the working-class party, alleging that its monolithic guidance over government organ was a source of bureaucracy. And they hamstring the party's leadership over government and introduced bourgeois multi-parties and parliamentary system.\r\n   Consequently, misfortunes, not democracy, befell people, the paper said, and went on:\r\n   Socialist democracy is not mere democracy without dictatorship.\r\n   As they make no secret of their party spirit, communists openly state that socialist democracy assumes a class spirit.\r\n   Socialist democracy provides the broad masses of people including workers, peasants and intellectuals with freedom and rights but imposes sanctions on the class enemies.\r\n   Our people's government should intensify its dictatorial function in order to smash the anti-socialist moves of the imperialists and other reactionaries and defend the interests and safety of the popular masses. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The blame for it rests with the Japanese authorities who brought forward the issue of \"those who divested themselves of their nationality. We, therefore, have no intention to argue about the issue.\r\n   We have already made clear the position that as long as the sworn enemy, Japan, persists in the anti-DPRK campaign, we will no longer have discussions with Japan about the normalization of the relations between the two countries.\r\n   It is the height of impudence for Japan to say this or that about the normalization of the relations.\r\n   Without the normalization of relations with Japan we have lived and will live in the future, too.\r\n   We, however, will square accounts with Japan as regards its crime-woven past in any circumstances.\r\n   If the Japanese authorities want to evade apologizing and compensating to the Korean people for the past crimes of the Japanese imperialists and keep on the anti-DPRK campaign as they do, they should not speak of the normalization of the relations with the DPRK. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
