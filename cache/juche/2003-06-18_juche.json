Korea under fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 17 (KCNA) -- The United States, Japan and South Korea were reported to have held a meeting of North Korean policy coordinating and monitoring group in Hawaii and made public a press statement on June 13.\r\n The statement threatened North Korea, urging it to refrain from aggravating the situation and underlining the need for the three-state coordination on the principle agreed upon at the recent summit talks of South Korea, U.S. and Japan if the situation gets worse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They were so ridiculous as to assert that the relations between the DPRK and the international community would depend on whether the former takes immediate verifiable measures to scrap its nuclear weapons program in a perfect and verifiable way or not, as if they had represented the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This only showed their trite stance of confrontation with the DPRK as they turned away from its just and realistic proposal for settling the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In view of the background against which the meeting took place and its proceedings and outcome it sought sinister aims to internationalize the DPRK's nuclear issue, a product of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK, lay an international siege to it and escalate the moves to blockade it and justify them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement, referring to drug smuggling and counterfeiting of money, said that its participants discussed the issue of cooperating with each other and seeking ways of cooperating with other countries and international organizations to check them. This is part of the ever-more undisguised smear campaign launched by the U.S. and Japan against the DPRK over drug trade. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these disturbing developments clearly indicate what do the \"further steps\" and \"stronger measures\" peddled by South Korea and Japan under the manipulation of the bush administration really mean. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They also confirm once again that the DPRK's Songun policy and its increased self-defensive physical deterrent force provide a decisive guarantee for protecting the sovereignty and stability of the country, averting a war on the Korean Peninsula and ensuring peace there.    \r\n\r\n"

This is the real picture in the era of independence and reunification in which the nation is bound to emerge victorious thanks to the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article.\r\n Referring to the astonishing events and stirring realities on this land the nation has witnessed in the movement for national reunification over the last three years since the publication of the joint declaration, the article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The more reckless the U.S. imperialists become in their moves to chill the desire of Koreans for independence and reunification and bring a nuclear holocaust to the Korean Peninsula, the stronger faith and will the Koreans will have to creditably carve out the future of the country and the nation on their own, regarding national independence as their life and soul. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The desire to achieve reconciliation, unity and reunification by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation is running high all over the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter how desperately the U.S. may work to start a nuclear war it cannot break the fixed will of the Koreans to achieve independence and reunification by rejoining the severed blood ties of the nation by its concerted efforts, optimistic about the victory of the era of independence and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint declaration serves as a landmark of patriotism as it encourages the nation to sail to the final destination of reunification in the spirit of great national unity under the uplifted banner of independence, despite any adverse wind raised by outsiders and such snags as flunkeyism and treachery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nation has yet a thorny way to go as there are many trials and difficulties in its way of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But no force on earth can stop the 70 million Koreans from vigorously advancing under the banner of the joint declaration. \r\n\r\n"

Nobody can vouch that this blockade operation will not lead to such a serious development as an all-out war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In case a war breaks out between the DPRK and the U.S. the frontline will not be confined to the Korean Peninsula only but every place where aggressors are stationed will be the target of the DPRK's strike. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard the DPRK can not but serve a warning to Japan, too. In case a war breaks out on the Korean Peninsula it will immediately spill over into Japan as the territory of Japan is used as a U.S. base of aggression against the DPRK and Japan is fully involved in the U.S. policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
