It is foolish to suppose that they may lend an ear to such a smear campaign by the Kim Young Sam regime, \"ANSP\" and KBS.\r\n   The false report is another grave challenge to our people, who are angered over the production of the series.\r\n   It came when the ugly colors of \"ANSP\" and the criminal nature of the anti-north drama have drawn fire in South Korea and abroad.\r\n   KBS, which regards a venal broadcasting service under the \"government-general\" of the Japanese imperialists as its \"progenitor\", has engaged in treacheries, boasting of being a mouthpiece of fascist dictatorship.\r\n   It led the reactionary, conservative median branding the Kwangju pro-democracy resistance of South Korean people as \"rebellion of rioters\" and the pro-reunification, pro-democracy movement of the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils as \"leftist, pro-Communist activities\".\r\n   It is the blackest one of the KBPS's crimes that it, on the order of \"ANSP\", centre of plots, started the \"social and cultural program\" zealously fostering north-south confrontation.\r\n   The production of the anti-north drama by KBS only precipitates its doom.\r\n   Now all the Koreans including the fellow countrymen in the north are bitterly condemning KBS for the series and are willing to demolish the plot-breeding tool and sternly punish those involved in the production of the series. It is not merely a threat.\r\n   If KBS continues producing the anti-north drama, ignoring our warning, it will meet a miserable end. \r\n\r\n"

In the whole period of his term of office, however, he has all along pursued reactionary economic policies, making a mess of the economy and deteriorating the people's livelihood to the extreme.\r\n   The Kim Young Sam regime, which is directly responsible for the worst economic crisis, is now trying to flee from the responsibility for it and impose more disaster and sufferings upon the South Korean people, inviting their bitterer condemnation.\r\n   As already reported, the recent \"agreement\" is a subordinate and humiliating one, which makes it possible to leave the South Korean economic sovereignty to the tender mercy of the IMF by law.\r\n   In the final analysis, only the South Koreans will fall a victim to the IMF \"trusteeship\". \r\n   There is no room for the South Koreans to move back because they have been deprived of democracy and right to existence.\r\n   Only struggle is their way out.  \r\n\r\n"

Paektu in Korea for 17 years have discovered five good-looking rocks around Piru Peak.\r\n   The peak east of the Mt. Paektu crator is a peculiar-shape peak representing the natural beauty of the mountain.\r\n   One of the five rocks is the tiger-shape rock, 2,671 metres high, which is standing on the top of the peak, facing Janggun, Haebal and Hyangdo peaks. Associated with the rock is a legend that a tiger climbed Janggun Peak only to be fascinated by the spirit of the mountain, and settled on Piru Peak to defend Janggun, Haebal and Hyangdo peaks.\r\n   The whale-shape rock (2,650 metres) is the second highest peak after the tiger-shape rock and the most steep and deep-rooted among the rocks around Piru Peak. It boasts of a legend that a whale from the East Sea became hard there, deeply moved by the beauty of the mountain.\r\n   Standing high between the tiger-shape and whale-shape rocks is a camel-shape rock, 2,645 metres high. A legend says a camel, a tropical animal, came to the mountain, prompted by the rumour that if it drinks water of Lake Chon on Mt. Paektu, it can live 1,000 years more, and became hard, admiring the beauty of the mountain.\r\n   The fairy-shape rock (2,643 metres), which is the nearest to Janggun Peak among the rocks, also has a legend that a fairy descended aboard a twin rainbow and settled near Janggun Peak.\r\n   The last one is a dragon-shape rock, 2,300 metres high. \r\nIt is standing between the whale-shape rock and the camel- shape rock. According to a legend, a dragon who had lived on Lake Chon gave up ascending to heaven and became hard, enraptured by the mountain's beauty. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
