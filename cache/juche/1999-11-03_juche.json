The U.S. and the South Korean warmongers are now staging dangerous war drills one after another including \"Foal Eagle\" joint military exercise to provoke a war against the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is entirely just for the DPRK to increase the self-reliant defence capability and nobody has the right to decry it as the U.S. and the South Korean warmongers are browbeating it by reinforcing their armed forces and staging large-scale military drills of all forms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This notwithstanding, jo song thae was foolish enough to assert that \"instability\" in northeast Asia was attributable to somebody's \"defence buildup\". This is just like a thief crying \"stop the thief.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Jo has seized every opportunity to clamor about non-existent \"provocations\" from somebody but it self-exposed that they are the arch criminals escalating the north-south confrontation into extremes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As long as such warmongers as Jo remain in this land, our nation can never live in peace nor avoid scourge of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people will certainly punish such anti-national,  anti-reunification warmongers as Jo going against the trend of the times and aspiration of the nation. \r\n\r\n"

And it will be a historic landmark in effecting a new turn in the socialist economic construction under the banner of building a powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such praiseworthy meeting can be convened only in Korea where the history of the great revolutionary upswing continues under the guidance of the great party, the paper says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The President Kim Il Sung kindled the flames of the grand Chollima upsurge in the most difficult postwar period.   He aroused all people across the country to the performance of heroic feats and thus brought about great changes in this land and ushered in a new era of national development and prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the steadfast will of the Marshal Kim Jong Il to maintain the precious traditions and revolutionary spirit created in the course of the grand Chollima march and build a powerful nation with their invincible might. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The meeting reflects this noble intention of the Marshal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nA decisive effect should be made in the building of a powerful nation with the indomitable will and fighting spirit which were fully displayed in the period of the grand Chollima upsurge. Herein lies the great significance of the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The present second grand Chollima march for the building a powerful nation is a worthwhile onward movement that is being accelerated on the basis of the strong foundations laid by the Marshal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Any difficulties can be overcome and any target can be hit when we work heart and soul for national prosperity with unbounded loyalty to the party and the leader and ardent patriotic enthusiasm as frontrankers of the second grand Chollima march, the heroes and heroines of our era, have done. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Minju Joson says: Today's grand march successfully carrying forward the proud history of the grand Chollima upsurge will become a more praiseworthy struggle, and greater victory and glory are in store for the Korean people who are advancing firmly united around Kim Jong Il. \r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary carried in this regard says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Shortly ago, a U.S. non-governmental organization specializing in nuclear weapons disclosed that the United States deployed some 7,000 nuclear weapons in NATO member countries and more than 2,000 in the pacific early in the 1970s and keeps nukes in the countries where their deployment has not been known so far. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There are more than 10,500 strategic nuclear missiles in the United States, among them over 2,050 intercontinental ballistic missiles and 3,075 nuclear bombs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Noting that most of the nuclear weapons are concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region, the commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Deployed in South Korea are more than 2,000 tactical  nuclear weapons and a large number of depleted uranium bullets. South Korea is an area with the highest density of strategic weapon deployment in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S.  represents the most dangerous nuclear war fanatics in this world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What merits particular attention is that those nuclear weapons deployed by the U.S. are targeted at the DPRK. The Korean people are exposed to the threat of nuclear weapons of the U.S. wherever they are deployed. This threat is increasing because the U.S., a nuclear weapon state, is in the belligerent relations with the DPRK and does not implement the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What can not be overlooked is that the United States openly asserts the \"use of nuclear weapons\" on the pretext of threat from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nA clear example of this was outbursts made by such warmongers as Shalikashvili, former chairman of the U.S. joint chiefs of staff, at an interview  concerning the \"review of the nuclear war preparations\" that the nuclear weapons deployed by the U.S. were meant \"for implementing the mission of striking North Korea\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Nuclear threat is coming to the DPRK from the U.S. The United States is the arch criminal increasing the nuclear threat. \r\n\r\n"

It was a massive anti-Japanese patriotic resistance of the Korean youth and students against the Japanese colonial rule, slave education and national contempt, which demonstrated the Korean people's firm national will to drive out the invaders and achieve national independence and sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Though the Korean people's massive anti-Japanese struggle was put down, it dealt a telling blow to the colonial rule of the Japanese and fully demonstrated bravery, wisdom and fighting spirit of the Korean nation to the whole world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   National dignity and interests are seriously trampled down and the people are subjected to humiliation, insult and disgrace as  slaves in South Korea today under the colonial rule of the U.S. The reality there is more deplorable than under the colonial rule of the Japanese. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S.'s occupation of South Korea is the main cause of misfortunes and sufferings of the South Korean people. As shown by massacres in Yongdong and Kwangju, the U.S. regard the Korean people as no more than \"mouses\"  and do not hesitate to commit such brutalities as killing them,  looting their properties and raping Korean women as they please. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nMoreover, the U.S. force the South Korean people to slave under the mandate of the International Monetary Fund. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese militarist forces that have revived under the U.S.'s patronage are feverishly whetting their swords for reinvasion to repeat the history of crimes committed against the Korean people in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Not content with having offered everything to the U.S.,  the South Korean ruling quarters are selling off the country and nation even to the Japanese reactionaries, the sworn enemy of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean people can never get rid of foreign domination and subjugation as long as the nation allows such group of traitors to stay in the land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   National reunification is the supreme cherished wish and most urgent task of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All Koreans in the north, south and overseas should turn out in the just struggle for national reconciliation, unity and reunification. \r\n\r\n"
