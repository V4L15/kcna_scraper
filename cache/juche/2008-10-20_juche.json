            "content": "Japan's Moves to Grab Tok Islet Assailed by North and South\r\n Pyongyang, October 18 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of the Korean Buddhist Federation, the south Korea-Japan Buddhist Welfare Association and the Memorial Society for the Monument to the Victory in the Battle in the Northern Area of Korea issued a joint statement on Oct. 18 to accuse Japan of its moves to grab Tok Islet. \n\t\t\t\t\t The statement said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese authorities recently decided to describe Tok Islet as part of the territory of Japan in the \"new teaching guidelines\" for primary and middle school students and officially announced it. This is a wanton infringement upon the dignity and sovereignty of the Korean nation and an unpardonable crime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan, the worst war criminal state, is seeking to fan up the territorial ambition among the young Japanese and grab a land of other country still today when more than 60 years have passed since its defeat. Through this, the Korean people clearly realize once again the inveterate criminal nature of the land of islands. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe fellow countrymen of the north and the south of Korea regard the above-said moves of Japan as a dangerous act of aggression to realize its old dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\" and vehemently denounce them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tok Islet has always remained part of the inviolable territory of the Korean nation and will stand so in the future, too. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan should bear in mind that its brazen-faced claim to the land of other country will only precipitate its own destruction and had better behave itself, not forgetting the lesson drawn from its defeat in the 1940s. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan should stop at once such foolish moves to seize Tok Islet and make apology and reparation for its crimes committed against the Korean nation in the past. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll Koreans in the north and the south who value the dignity of the nation and territorial integrity will in the future, too, hold Japan accountable for its past crimes to the last and go united closer and steadily conduct actions to check and frustrate the above-mentioned moves of Japan, the statement stressed."

You must pick up the cause where he left off and win back the country, come what may. You may have no chance to take care of me or your mother, as is your filial duty, but you must give yourself heart and soul to the cause of Korea's independence.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was deeply impressed by her words and gained great strength therefrom.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was her temperament and spirit not to submit to any coercion and injustice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the Japanese imperialists forced Koreans to change their names to Japanese ones, she did not respond to the demand but resisted stubbornly their pernicious colonial rule, thus demonstrating her ardent patriotism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She held fast to the principles as the mother and grandmother of great revolutionaries when the Japanese imperialists made desperate efforts to attain their heinous aim while concentrating all \"punitive\" forces on the headquarters of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army and launching \"surrender campaign.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She said, \"You may take me along by force, but I won't help you. Instead, I will look around Mt. Paektu and Manchuria where my grandson is fighting against you, just to see who will be the winner.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhenever the enemy poked her in the back with a rifle butt to make her call out her grandson's name, she retorted, \"I don't know how to blabber wild nonsense like that. Anyway, do you think you can kill me and get off scot-free? Go ahead, kill me if you want to end up with my grandson's bullet in your skulls!\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Finally giving up on their attempts, the enemies who mobilized her to the \"surrender campaign\" were compelled to send her back to Mangyongdae.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tShe was not a professional revolutionary. And she neither attended school nor received any revolutionary education in an organization. But she strongly resisted the enemies and behaved sturdily. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t President Kim Il Sung writes about it in his reminiscences that the tradition of the Mangyongdae family and the revolution turned her into such a heroic woman.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even after the liberation of the country, she led a simple and upright life till the last moments of her life though she was the grandmother of the head of state."

Therefore, the crime can never be pardoned in any case. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The traitorous group's suppression of the democratic forces standing for reunification is, in essence, a premeditated fascist act to mercilessly repress and stamp out activities of the south Korean reunification movement organizations and progressives by linking them with the north under the pretext of \"wiping out pro-north leftist forces\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group is groundlessly terming the pro-reunification patriotic activities of the south Korean progressive organizations and figures \"enemy benefiting activities\" conducted at the instructions of the north.
