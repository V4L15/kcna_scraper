In her early days she lost her parents and could \r\nnot but lead a miserable life, subjected to all sorts of humiliation and insult \r\nas part of the stateless nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the liberation of \r\nthe country she could enjoy a genuine life. She devoted her wisdom and \r\nenthusiasm to the construction of the country. She performed labor feats in the \r\nconstruction of the capital as a highly skilled plasterer during the postwar \r\nperiod of rehabilitation, in particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a pensioner, \r\nshe has enjoyed a happy life for over 40 years, benefiting from the popular \r\nhealthcare policy of the Workers' Party of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Free \r\nfrom an unbalanced diet, she keeps herself optimistic, mixing with neighbors. \r\nShe is still good at seeing, hearing and speaking and even does kitchen chores. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoint Military Exercises to Be Staged in S. Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 7 (KCNA) -- The south Korea-U.S. \r\n\"Combined Forces Command\" announced on Feb. 1 that \"Key Resolve-Foal Eagle 08\" \r\njoint military exercises will be staged from March 2 to 7 throughout south \r\nKorea, according to a news report. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The \"Combined Forces \r\nCommand\" disclosed that the joint military drills are to involve equipment, \r\ncapability and manpower in all aspects as they consist of the combined command \r\ndrill and combined field mobile exercise to be staged under such diverse \r\nconditions as reception of U.S. reinforcements from outside of the Korean \r\nPeninsula, its staging and onward movement and integration. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trigger-happy elements claim that the joint military \r\nmaneuvers are aimed at examining the military preparedness focused on defence \r\nand they are not of provocative nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The codename \"Key \r\nResolve,\" a version of \"RSOI and Foal Eagle\" was contrived by the U.S. to calm \r\ndown the public censure and condemnation at home and abroad that they are \r\nintended to unleash a war to invade the DPRK. This codename itself assumes very \r\nbelligerent and provocative nature as it is designed to lead a war to victory \r\nthrough the effective deployment of the U.S. reinforcements in the event of \r\ncontingency. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The joint military exercises are, therefore, \r\nnothing but saber rattling to invade the north as is the case with \"RSOI\" and \r\nthe \"Foal Eagle\" in every respect. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecurity Authorities' Suppression of Movement for Reunification Denounced in \r\nS. Korea&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 7 (KCNA) -- The People's \r\nSolidarity for Abolition of the \"National Security Law\" (NSL) and the Teachers' \r\nTrade Union of south Korea (Jongyojo) reportedly called a joint press conference \r\nin Seoul on February 1 at which they denounced the security authorities for \r\ntheir crackdown upon the movement for reunification . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At \r\nthe conference speakers accused the security authorities of recently detaining \r\nKim Hyong Gun, chairman of the reunification committee of the North Jolla \r\nProvincial Branch of Jongyojo, on charge of violation of the NSL, declaring that \r\nlurking behind this is a sinister intention to obliterate the education in the \r\nissue of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The security authorities working \r\nhard to deny the June 15 joint declaration, in particular, are unpardonable, \r\nthey said, stressing the need to put an end to the tragic reality in which the \r\nmovement for reunification has become a target of suppression. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A press release read out at the conference warned that if \r\nthe security authorities continue cracking down upon the movement for \r\nreunification, failing to face up to the truth of history, they will certainly \r\nmeet strong resistance of all people. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBirthday of Kim Jong Il Celebrated in Different \r\nCountries&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 7 (KCNA) -- Seminars, \r\nround-table talks, friendship meeting, film shows and book and photo exhibitions \r\ntook place in Egypt, the Czech Republic, Laos and South Africa from January 27 \r\nto 30 on the occasion of the birthday of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
