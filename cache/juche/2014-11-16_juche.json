This arms deal between the aggressors and traitors is lashing all Koreans into fury.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts go to prove the validity of the DPRK's measures to bolster up its nuclear deterrence. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said arms deal only compels the DPRK to further bolster up its nuclear deterrence."
