During the Clinton administration, the annual joint military drill Team Spirit had been suspended. It is necessary to cut down the scale of the military drills, though belatedly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Saturday says in a commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This reflects the present situation in which the structure of muscle between the DPRK and the U.S. has dramatically changed and proves that the U.S. is the arch criminal escalating the tension and, therefore, it should move first.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's access to nuclear weapons is an inevitable outcome of the U.S. heinous hostile policy toward the DPRK pursued for a long time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the stand of the DPRK not to hesitate or make any concession in bolstering up its capability for self-defence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is sadly mistaken if it thinks the nuclear deterrence of the DPRK is a matter for political bargaining and economic deal after putting it on the negotiating table.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Explicitly speaking once again, the DPRK's bolstering of its nuclear force is the exercise of the right to self-defence to counter the U.S., the world's biggest nuclear weapons state bringing the danger of a nuclear war to hang over the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will continue to bolster up its capability for self-defence and preemptive attack with the nuclear force as its pivot as long as the U.S. and its vassal forces persist in its nuclear threat and blackmail."

El pasado dia 2, el nuevo secretario de Defensa de EE.UU. llego al Sur de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\tEntonces, los titeres surcoreanos describen esos hechos como \"demostracion de la cooperacion firme y alianza solida\" con EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl diario Rodong Sinmun, en un comentario individual de este sabado, lo califica de caricatura politica de los vendepatrias proyanquis y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos maniacos de enfrentamiento expusieron su necio intento de acatar a la parte connacional con la ayuda de las fuerzas extranjeras al usar ademas la expresion de \"cooperacion firme en la campana anti-Norte (de Corea)\" y \"fuerte advertencia\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEllos estan desesperados ahora para detener el avance vigoroso de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea que manifiesta su poderio inagotable frustrando en el principio de autofortalecimiento todos los desafios y pruebas de la historia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRecientemente, revelaron el intento de endurecer la sancion y presion anti-RPDC en confabulacion con EE.UU. y otras fuerzas extranjeras diciendo que ahora es el \"momento crucial\" para \"inducir la desnuclearizacion y el cambio del Norte\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPagaran muy caro sus actos traidores esos elementos serviles a EE.UU. y dependientes de las fuerzas extranjeras que no toman en consideracion el destino de la nacion."

            "content": "RPDC consolidara capacidad de autodefensa nacional, apunta Rodong Sinmun\r\nPyongyang, 4 de febrero (ACNC) -- Recientemente, la revista estadounidense Foreign Policy escribio que el programa de arma nuclear y misil de Corea avanzo ya demasiado y se ha fijado como importante cuestion del Estado y por eso, no hay la posibilidad de renunciarlo a cambio del mejoramiento de las relaciones con Estados Unidos.\n\t\t\t\t\t Prosiguio que aunque piensan que con ningun acuerdo diplomatico se puede hacer a Corea renunciar su arma nuclear y misil, en este caso tambien es necesaria la diplomacia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAgrego que existe la oportunidad de prevenir el empeoramiento de la situacion porque la RPDC todavia no realizo el lanzamiento de prueba de ICBM.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Opino que la administracion Trump debe proponer a la RPDC la moderacion de los ejercicios militares en 2017, recordando el antecedente de la suspension de los ejercicios militares conjuntos Team Spirit durante el mandato de Clinton.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEspecifico que hace falta reducir el tamano de los entrenamientos militares, aunque tardiamente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Esta version refleja la realidad de hoy en que se ha cambiado radicalmente la estructura de las ferzas entre la RPDC y EE.UU. y demuestra que este debe moverse primero porque es el culpable principal de la agravacion de tension.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Asi senala el diario Rodong Sinmun en un comentario individual difundido este sabado y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La posesion de arma nuclear por la RPDC es el resultado inevitable de la brutal y larga politica hostil de EE.UU. contra ella.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No vacilar ni ceder nunca en el camino de consolidacion de la capacidad de autodefensa nacional, esto es nuestra posicion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Estaria muy equivocado si EE.UU. piensa todavia que nuestro disuasivo nuclear es una materia de regateo politico o transaccion economica que puede debatirse en la mesa de negociaciones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Se reitera en claro que el aumento de nuestras fuerzas armadas nucleares es el justo ejercicio del derecho soberano frente a EE.UU., primera potencia nuclear del mundo, que trae el nubarron de guerra nuclear a la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Mientras continuen la amenaza y chantaje nucleares de EE.UU. y sus satelites, seguiremos elevando la capacidad de autodefensa nacional y de ataque preventivo con las fuerzas nucleares como eje."
