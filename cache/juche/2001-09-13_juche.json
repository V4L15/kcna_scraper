            "content": "Spokesman for CPRF on resumption of inter-Korean ministerial talks \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 13 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland today released a statement as regards the 5th inter-Korean ministerial talks slated to take place in Seoul from September 15 to 18.\r\n The statement says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The inter-Korean ministerial talks will be resumed 6 months after they stalled in March. This is entirely ascribable to the initiative taken by us to solve the issue of the north-south relations independently by the efforts of the Korean nation according to the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This reflects our will for the independent reunification and painstaking positive efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This also represents the unanimous aspiration and demand of the whole nation, which were confirmed at the recent August 15 Grand Festival for National Reunification held in Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The review of the past 6 months proves that if the outside interference in our national issue is allowed, the inter-Korean relations in the process of favorable development will be frozen and deteriorate overnight. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also a lesson taught by the long history of national division and its review. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That is why the first point of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration calls for settling the issue of country's reunification independently by the concerted efforts of our nation responsible for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National independence is the kernel and quintessence of the declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whether the overall inter-Korean relations including the north-south ministerial talks develop smoothly or not entirely depends on how the south side respects the spirit of the June 15 joint declaration and maintains an independent stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south side should draw a proper lesson from the review of the past 6 months. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The outside forces should no longer stand in the way of the development of the inter-Korean relations and our country's reunification in collusion with the anti-reunification forces in south korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-reunification elements swimming against the trend of the history can not go scot-free. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will as ever make every sincere effort to implement the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration.    \r\n\r\n"
