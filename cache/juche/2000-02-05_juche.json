It has greatly inspired fathers and mothers who are all out in the great Chollima advance in the New Year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Our party and people deeply love and value the school youth and children, who are the flowers of the country and the nation and the masters of the new century. They, who will take the future of the country and the revolution on their shoulders, should firmly prepare themselves to be true sons and daughters of our party,  the reliable successors to the Juche revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The ardent and clean loyalty to the party and the leader are the most important traits to be possessed by them. They should become young vanguard, juvenile lifeguards who always believe and follow only our party and defend it, study and grow for the party and the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They should study hard under the slogan \"Let's study for Korea \" and deem it greatest honor to defend the country and make positive contributions to socialist construction, the message said, setting forth the tasks to this end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The WPK and the people are visualizing the bright future of the country in the valiant and bright looks of the younger generations who are inheriting the lineage of the revolution, the message noted, firmly believing that they would more firmly prepare themselves to be successors to the revolution and vigorously continue making thousands of miles of journey for the building of a powerful nation in the wake of the \"250-mile journey for national liberation.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A ceremony for conveying the congratulatory message was held in Phophyong on Feb. 4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The message was conveyed by kim jung rin, secretary of the WPK Central Committee. \r\n\r\n"

Nor can it emerge from a stern judgement as a violator of human rights, the news analyst says, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   International treaty and wartime law and regulations ban targeting non-combatants. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S., however, massacred innocent people with bare hands, ignoring the principle and requirements of the international law. Any offender of the international law should be punished by the law. There is no prescription to crimes against humanity. If the U.S. has an iota of conscience to feel guilty of its criminal acts and responsibility for them, it should come out to a court of its own accord to meet a deserved punishment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If it refuses to admit its criminal acts and accept responsibility for them, it will lose its face and confidence in the international arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is not in a position to talk about human rights in the international arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the key source of human rights abuses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States' recent crying for \"giving priority to human rights\" is nothing but a camouflage to justify its interference in the internal affairs of other countries as well as to conceal the true colors as an aggressor and state sponsor of terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the U.S. tries to refuse to accept responsibility for its crimes in view of international law and in the light of morality and make an official apology and compensation to the Korean people for them, the Korean people will accuse it of its crimes for all ages and square accounts with it to the end. \r\n\r\n"

Nobody can make an issue of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   However, the United States persistently denies this clear-cut reason because the DPRK's self-defensive means are an unshakable obstruction to its anti-DPRK moves based on the strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Our principle is the only one and it can never be changed in any case though the U.S. resorts to \"appeasement\" strategy or \"tough\" strategy. Arms are immediately our lifeline. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We have thought of nothing but them and will go this way. \r\n\r\n"
