It stressed that the tripartite economic cooperation projects including the laying of railways, gas pipeline and a transmission line linking Russia with the north and the south of Korea have a special prospect in the aspect of actively helping improve the inter-Korean relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK side expressed support for the projects of the Russian side for tripartite economic cooperation and manifested its willingness to positively examine the proposal for tripartite working negotiations for their implementation if it is advanced.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Russian side expressed its stand that the six-party talks should be resumed at an early date to settle the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula in a political and diplomatic manner. It pointed out that it is important to take constructive measures such as DPRK's moratorium on nuclear test and ballistic missile launch, access of IAEA experts to uranium enrichment facilities in the Nyongbyon area and discussion of the issue of uranium enrichment at the six-party talks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK side expressed its stand that it can go out to the six-party talks without any precondition, it is not opposed to the discussion of the above-said issue at the six-party talks and if the talks are resumed, other issues raised by the Russian side can be also discussed and settled in the course of implementing the September 19 Joint Statement calling for the denuclearization of the whole Korean Peninsula on the principle of simultaneous action.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Beneficial were negotiations held in an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust."

It is a legitimate right of sovereign states.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality proves that the existing commitment to giving a guarantee for non-use and safety of nukes alone can never help solve the problem. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is our view that it is most urgent, therefore, to set up a mechanism under international law totally banning the threat with nukes and their use.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is our view that to this end it is necessary to institute an international convention banning the use of nukes which calls for  stipulating it as a legal duty of nuclear weapons states to neither threaten with nukes nor use them under any circumstances and making a strict verification of its observance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the nuclear weapons states should roll back nuclear policies based on preemptive use of nukes, unconditionally commit themselves not to use nukes first as demanded by the non-nuclear states and respond to the negotiations for working out the international convention on this issue as early as possible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will always sincerely fulfill our duty before the international community as a responsible nuclear weapons state."
