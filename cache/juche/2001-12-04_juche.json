            "content": "U.S. moves to pose military threat condemned \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 4 (KCNA) -- The United States has decided to deploy anti-missile radars in South Korea in the near future and strongly urged the latter to purchase its fighters of the next generation to be developed by it.\r\n The fact proves once again that the U.S. is the very one who constantly poses military threat to the Korean peninsula. Minju Joson today says this in a signed commentary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is due to the U.S. unchanged policy to stifle the DPRK by force of arms that such moves for arms buildup are getting more undisguised, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In particular, the bush administration, which appeared in the U.S. this year, has desperately pushed forward its moves to stifle the DPRK as part of its major foreign policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recently disclosed U.S. projected arms buildup, too, is mainly intended to escalate its military threat to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has massively deployed missiles and other war equipment in South Korea, threatening the DPRK militarily. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, it argues that the DPRK should \"reduce missiles and conventional armed forces\". This is no more than a gangster-like logic. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has no right to make such argument, the commentary says, and goes on: The prevailing situation compels the DPRK to be in full readiness to cope with the U.S. military threat which is getting more pronounced as days go by. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should stop such military threat at once and rectify its anachronistic Korea policy, if it does not want to suffer the same disgraceful defeat before the world as it did in the past.    \r\n\r\n"

And the same can be said of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We state on behalf of all the fellow countrymen that we will wage an uninterrupted struggle to check the U.S. war maneuvers and Japan's rearmament to become a military power.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Korea policy termed anachronistic \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 4 (KCNA) -- Abnormal relations between the DPRK and the United States have not yet improved though over half a century has passed since its occupation of South Korea. It is totally attributable to the U.S. anachronistic policy toward the DPRK. Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article.\r\n Calling for \"dialogue\" with the DPRK, the U.S. is conducting only deeds of rubbing the DPRK, its dialogue partner, the wrong way, the article notes, and says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some time ago, U.S. President Bush made reckless remarks against the DPRK while grossly distorting the truth about \"resumption of dialogue.\" \r\n Such imprudent and rude remarks unsuitable for his position as \"president of the superpower\" do not go with the U.S. call for unconditional \"dialogue\" with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is more grave is the U.S. dangerous military movements. The U.S. is massively reinforcing its armed forces in South Korea, inciting war atmosphere. Allegedly to \"cope with emergency\" on the Korean peninsula, it has put its troops in South Korea on \"high alert\" while forward-deploying there its task force and war equipment from its mainland. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is urgently needed for the Korean nation at present is an atmosphere for national reconciliation and unity, not lethal weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK remains unchanged in the new century, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the new century it has set it as a main link in its reactionary world strategy to implement the new military strategy with its stress put on Asia with the Korean peninsula as its focus. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is evidenced by the fact that the bush government is still pursuing the hardline policy to contain the DPRK though it calls for the \"resumption of dialogue without any precondition.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, this policy toward the DPRK is nothing but an anachronistic delusion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. strong-arm policy can never work on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The peaceloving people of the world are rejecting such anachronistic policy of the U.S. imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should courageously renounce that outdated policy. If it is truly willing to resume dialogue with the DPRK, it should take a proper attitude toward dialogue and build atmosphere and confidence for it. But it is failing to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. escalated policy intended to stifle the DPRK compels the DPRK to increase its military capabilities for self-defense to cope with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to clearly know who is its opponent, before making any action.    \r\n\r\n"

This was the first intentional political suppression of Chongryon since its inauguration. Minju Joson today says this in a signed commentary.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The financial crisis of the Korean bank is attributable to the depression of the overall Japanese economy. Though the Japanese authorities are well aware of this, they resorted to a political suppression of Chongryon on false charges. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' political suppression of Chongryon was a vivid manifestation of their wild ambition for overseas expansion to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries have escalated their political suppression of Chongryon and stretched the claws of the crackdown to its central standing committee, taking advantage of anti-terror war. This is a clear indication that they are keen to undermine Chongryon in case of \"emergency\" when they are conducting an operation against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK government and people will never tolerate the anti-Chongryon, anti-DPRK campaign the Japanese reactionaries have launched while brandishing their swords for reinvasion instead of redeeming their crime-woven past. \r\n\r\n"

Folk games and entertainment were also organized for this purpose.\r\n In the process of this activity, the sword dance was created. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This traditional dance takes on various forms according to the outfit--a long-sword dance, two-sword dance, masked sword dance and a dance using a dagger with a broken hilt. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The last form is a distinctive style unique to Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The sword dance had developed to the grassroot level by the reign of Koguryo (277 bc-ad 668) and was in vogue among soldiers by the period of Koryo (918-1392), during which the soldiers marching out to battle would perform their grand procession and sword-and-shield dance in front of the cheering people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The dance was practiced as part of army drills and gradually found its way into the rest of society and the royal court, assuming diverse forms and showing off nimble movement and a delicate rhythm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It began to settle as an art form in the 19th century, mainly performed by women using a dagger with a broken hilt. In the wielding and crossing the daggers produce a sweet rhythmic effect. This kind of dagger became a stage prop and the dance grew far more rhythmic and artistic than previously. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For its embodiment of Koreans' patriotism, resourcefulness and courage, the sword dance is an important part of the country's folk dance traditions.    \r\n\r\n"
