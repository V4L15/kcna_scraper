It clarified that if the south side insists on such defiant attitude, it will fundamentally reexamine its participation in the games and that the issue of its participation in the games would entirely depend on the attitude of the south side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Consequently, the hard-won north-south working talks failed to reach any agreement and broke down without setting the date for the next round of the talks due to the south side's unreasonable attitude and provocations."
