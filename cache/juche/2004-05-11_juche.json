Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 10 (KCNA) -- The People for Achieving Peace and Reunification and the Council for National Reconciliation and Independent Reunification reportedly issued a joint statement on May 6 against the offer of the plot for a new U.S. embassy building at the U.S. military base in Ryongsan.\r\n The statement drew attention to the fact that the south Korean authorities are now having a negotiation for an agreement with the U.S. to allot a part of the U.S. military base in Ryongsan instead of the site of Toksu Palace in Seoul for a new U.S. embassy building. It said the \"government\", which had been intending to offer the site of Toksu Palace for a new U.S. embassy building, are now going to allot to it a part of the U.S. military base in Ryongsan after hesitating in face of the strong opposition of the public. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the \"government\" failed to give up the negotiation on designating the U.S. military base in Ryongsan as the building lot, the U.S. would demand again the site of Toksu Palace, too, and then it would either repeat arbitrary and self-righteous practices against the people to meet the U.S. demand or make a bigger concession to the U.S., it warned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Opposing the offer of the U.S. military base in Ryongsan as the site for a new U.S. embassy building, it strongly demanded the \"government\" authorities open to the people the content of the negotiation with the U.S.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Promptly withdraw planned troop dispatch to Iraq volunteering to be man-killing mercenaries\".\r\n The statement recalled the continued exposure of facts about brutal maltreatment and tortures of Iraqi prisoners of war by U.S. troops. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the more serious is that the maltreatment and tortures of Iraqi POWs have been committed on organized and planned orders and at the connivance of the U.S. forces authorities, the statement said, and added: This is only a tiny part of the war crimes committed by the U.S. in Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The humankind of the world, the statement went on, have clearly seen once again the barbarity and aggressive nature of the U.S. through those facts reported by media despite the Bush administration's control on the press. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the \"government\" authorities, with much talk about \"alliance\" with the U.S., are still going to dispatch troops to Iraq for cooperation in the war of aggression, thereby driving people to the field of death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Troop dispatch to Iraq can never be justified from the historical, legal and conscientious point of view, the statement said, and demanded the \"government\" immediately retract the decision on troops dispatch to Iraq.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Proceeding from this stand, the DPRK has kept exercising patience and flexibility and participated in the process of the six-way talks in a positive manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The Korean people hate such a tragic fate as the Iraqis' and will never allow anyone to impose it upon them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The nuclear deterrent force of the DPRK does not aim at anyone who does not pose any threat toward it. The nuclear deterrent is a means for legitimate self-defence and a firm guarantee for beating back the U.S. preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK and reliably defending its sovereignty, socialism, peace and security. If the U.S. takes a practical measure to abandon its hostile policy toward the DPRK from a realistic stand and on the basis of cool-headed judgment, the latter will undoubtedly take a corresponding innovative and trustworthy step. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Success of the six-party talks and progress in the settlement of the nuclear issue will entirely depend on the U.S. attitude. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  If the U.S. truly stands for a negotiated and diplomatic solution to the issue, it should boldly make a switchover in its stance and take a trustworthy practical action. This is the only shortcut to the settlement of the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Nobody can predict what will happen in the future unless the U.S. changes its present stand and attitude. The U.S. had better bear this in mind and stop wasting time.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is the stand of the DPRK. This is a flexible proposal advanced by the DPRK as a first-phase measure, taking into full account the fact that there exists no confidence between the DPRK and the U.S. and Washington is not yet ready to accept Pyongyang's proposal of a package solution based on the principle of simultaneous actions all at once. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the assertion of the DPRK that it should commit itself to scrap its nuclear program in return for the U.S. commitment to renounce its hostile policy toward the DPRK on the principle of \"verbal commitments\" and \"action for action\" and the U.S. and those countries concerned should make due compensation to the DPRK for its freeze of its nuclear program. This is an indisputably just and fair stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will participate in the meeting to discuss this issue. It is ready to take a positive and fair stand and attitude so as to make the meeting successful. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the rumor has it that the U.S. still insists on its assertion that the DPRK should make the CVID and is set to unilaterally pressurize the latter to accept it at the upcoming meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such unreasonable stand of the U.S. would only throw a hurdle in the way of the meeting. In that case the discussion of the issue would not proceed smoothly but will only spark off argument and the meeting would make it impossible to expect any success from the third round of the six-party talks. The DPRK is of the view that it would feel no need to sit with the U.S. at the negotiating table if the U.S. persistently insists on its wrong assertion that the DPRK should dismantle its nuclear program \"in an irreversible manner\" and the like in a bid to force the DPRK to disarm itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK, however, will participate in the working group meeting with patience and magnanimity, proceeding from the stand to seek a negotiated peaceful solution to the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S..  It takes two hands to make handclap. It is self-evident that the efforts exerted by the DPRK side alone would not be enough to make the meeting successful. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The meeting can prove successful only when the U.S. responds to the DPRK's concession with concession and returns its magnanimity with magnanimity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chances are not always available. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had better seize this opportunity to make a switchover in its stand.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
