Hearing the unexpected news that his father, indomitable revolutionary fighter Kim Hyong Jik, was arrested again by the Japanese imperialist police in January, Juche 14 (1925), he set out on the \"250-mile journey for national liberation\" to wage a life and death struggle in order to take revenge upon the enemy for the nation's sufferings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In Juche 64 (1975) 25 years ago Kim Jong Il paved the way for the excursion along the course of the \"250-mile journey for learning\" and \"250-mile journey for national liberation\" made by the President and saw to it that a vigorous movement was waged among school youth and children to learn from the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Ri Il Hwan, first secretary of the central committee of the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League, in his report said the \"250-mile journey for national liberation\" made by the President reflected the faith he cherished in his boyhood following the course of revolutionary activities of Kim Hyong Jik and seeing the people in dire distress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The journey made it possible for the Korean revolution to greet a new era of history in which it could advance victoriously, inspired by a scientific guiding idea and a correct strategy of struggle, and enabled the Korean people to vigorously wage the anti-Japanese war, rallied close under the banner of national liberation, with the hope for the national resurrection, he said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Marshal Kim Jong Il paved the way for the excursion along the course of the 250-mile journey for revolution, thus helping the school youth and children deeply grasp the greatness of the President, following the course of the \"250-mile journey for national liberation\" and \"250-mile journey for learning\" and harden their faith and will to carry forward and complete the revolutionary cause of Juche generation after generation under the leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Jong Il saw to it that the party helped the youth league in organizing the excursion along the course of the \"250-mile journey for national liberation\" and \"250-mile journey for learning,\" and showed profound love and trust in the excursionists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The reporter called upon the school youth and children to continue to wage a vigorous movement to learn from glorious boyhood and youth of the President and the respected Marshal so as to deeply grasp the peerlessly great men's immortal revolutionary exploits and take an active part in the excursion to be a true young vanguard and children's lifeguards loyal to the Worker's Party of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Present at the meeting were Choe Thae Bok, Yang Hyong Sop, Kim Ki Nam, Kim Jung Rin and other senior party and state leaders. \r\n\r\n"

It is a reunification program common to the nation which is supported not only by the compatriots in the north, south and abroad but also by the world people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The three-point charter includes the three principles of national reunification, the 10-point program for the great unity of the entire nation for the country's reunification and the proposal for founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo (DCRK). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   President Kim Il Sung advanced the three principles of national reunification, the keynote of which is independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity, at conversations with South Korean delegates to the north-south high-level political talks in Juche 61 (1972). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The principles call for reunifying the country independently free from intervention of outside forces, by peaceful means without resorting to arms and by promoting great national unity transcending the differences in ideas, ideals and systems. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The three principles were declared at home and abroad as a reunification program common to the nation through the historic July 4 joint statement of the north and south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The 10-point program of the great unity of the entire nation for national reunification (1993) comprehensively elucidates all the issues arising in achieving great national unity including the general aim and ideological basis of the great national unity, principle to be adhered to for the unity and ways of achieving it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  \r\n   It is a political program to strengthen the internal force of national reunification by achieving national reconciliation and unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The proposal for founding the DCRK (1980) is a blueprint of national reunification which shows general aspects of the reunified state and ways of building it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  A proposal to reunify the country by confederacy formula means to build a pan-national reunified state which represents all political parties, all the groups and  all members of the nation from all walks of life with two systems and  two governments existing in the north and south left intact. It also calls for reunifying the country by means of founding a confederal state in which two regional governments  in the north and south are represented on an equal footing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The three-point charter of national reunification is a program that makes it possible to reunify the country, long-cherished desire of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Koreans in the north, south and abroad, therefore, sat together last year and decided to build a monument to the three-point charter of national reunification in Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Its construction is being pushed ahead in full gear. \r\n\r\n"

In that period the industrial production increased 36.6 percent on an annual average while the agricultural production shot up 32 percent in four years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people thus carried out the historic task of industrialization in a matter of 14 years, which took other countries a full century or even a few centuries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Since then, the greatly increased activity of Chollima has denoted the spirit of the Korean people vying with times and bringing earlier future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The economic situation of the country remains very difficult. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The moves of the imperialists and the enemies to isolate and stifle socialist Korea have become all the more pronounced. Several years of severe natural disasters have inflicted tremendous losses on all the economic fields. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThere is still a serious food shortage as agriculture was hardest hit by them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The situation prevailing in the country compels us to run faster in all sectors of socialist construction than at the time of the great Chollima advance after the war when we took a hundred steps, a thousand steps while others took only one step or ten steps. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the faith and will of the Korean people to significantly increase the activity of Chollima once again and demonstrate the spirit of Chollima Korea to the whole world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They will glorify this year, the 55th foundation anniversary of the Worker's Party of Korea, with brilliant exploits in the crucible of greatly increased activity of Chollima despite manifold ordeals and difficulties. \r\n\r\n"

Scores of dietmen visit it in groups every year, advocating the revival of militarism. It was against this backdrop that the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan resolved to promote the official visit to \"Yasukuni Shrine\".

The United States should pull its troops out of South Korea to swim with the trend of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people have suffered misfortunes and pain resulting from the national division, which was caused by the U.S. occupation of South Korea, for over half a century and the Korean peninsula has become a most serious  hotspot and biggest source of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. forces' presence in South Korea is only harmful to the reunification and peace of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is quite difficult to solve the Korean issue and improve the DPRK-U.S. relations as long as the U.S. troops stay in South Korea. The prospect of settling those two issues entirely depends on their pullout. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Therefore, the United States should take practical steps for their withdrawal. Only by doing so, it can fulfil its responsibility and keep faith. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   U.S. forces' continued presence in South Korea is not good for the United States from any angle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States should not seek their permanent presence there not only for its own government but for the sake of the Americans. \r\n\r\n"
