Kim Jong Il writes to Korean-American journalist\r\n\r\n   Pyongyang, July 21 (KCNA) - Secretary Kim Jong Il in Hamhung sent a letter on July 13 to Mun Myong Ja, a Korean-American woman journalist accredited to the White House and in charge of Asian News, who came to the socialist homeland to commemorate the third death anniversary of President Kim Il Sung, father of the nation, and hoped to be received in audience.\r\n   Secretary Kim Jong Il expressed thanks to her for participating in the events to mark the third death anniversary of the President.\r\n   He said he remembered that the President in a meeting with the woman said the Korean nation were proud of the prominent woman journalist who makes patriotic activities energetically in an alien land with the pen of justice.\r\n   He said he was well aware that the woman was making brisk activities for the country and the nation and for national reunification invariably as she had done when the President was alive.\r\n   He stressed that the Workers' Party and people of Korea were determined to carry forward and complete the President's cause. \r\n   This time, the Korean people renewed their firm determination to unite around the Party wholeheartedly and defend and exalt the man-centred Korean socialism, a precious legacy of the President, he noted.\r\n   He said that despite temporary difficulties caused by the imperialists' hostile activities against the DPRK and repeated natural disasters that swept the DPRK, he and his people were firmly resolved to make the country and motherland ever more prosperous as wished by the President. \r\nHe expressed belief that this resolution would be put into brilliant reality.\r\n   The reunification of the country is an urgent task facing the Korean people and the President devotedly worked for this national cause all his life, Secretary Kim Jong Il said, adding that the three principles of national reunification, the establishment of a Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo and the Ten-Point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the Reunification of the Country proposed by the President should be taken as guidelines in the efforts for national reunification.\r\n   We will do all we can to reunify the country independently and peacefully and on the principle of great national unity as the President wished, he said.\r\n   In our relations with the United States, we will faithfully implement the agreed points in conformity with the idea and principle of our foreign policy, he said. \r\nThis is our invariable stand.\r\n   Our position for establishing good neighbourhood and friendship with Japan is also consistent, he said. I think the settlement of the issues depends on the attitude of the United States and Japan toward us.  \r\n\r\n"
