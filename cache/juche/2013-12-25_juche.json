These undying exploits will shine for all ages.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underlined the need to always remember the brilliant annals in which all service personnel and people performed epoch-making miracles and brought about innovations in their struggle for protecting socialism and building a thriving nation, weathering storm and stress unprecedented in history under the leadership of Kim Jong Il, and significantly commemorate December 24, the day when he was held in high esteem as supreme commander of the KPA. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un looked round the room for the education in the revolutionary history and the room devoted to the history of the unit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recollecting with deep emotion the undying exploits of the great Generalissimos Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il recorded in the annals of the unit's history, he said it was thanks to their wise leadership and meticulous care that the unit has grown to be a powerful and matchless combat unit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Praising the unit for arranging well the above-said rooms and conducting effective education of its service personnel through them, he underscored the need for the unit to intensify the education of them in the undying leadership exploits of the peerlessly great persons of Mt. Paektu and thus help all its service personnel add glory to the proud tradition of the unit by performing feats in rounding off combat readiness and bolstering up combat capabilities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the operation command rooms, the room devoted to military research and the pistol shooting gallery, he heard a detailed report on training and the unit's performance of duty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was satisfied to learn that the large combined unit arranged well the operation command rooms as intended by the party and  scrupulously operated the room devoted to military research, thus helping its commanding officers and members of the staff steadily improve their ability to map out and command combat operations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He instructed the unit to put utmost spurs on rounding off its combat readiness with the firm viewpoint and stand that it should be wholly responsible for its combat readiness before the party, always bearing in mind that a war breaks out without any prior notice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the unit has a very important duty to perform, he indicated important tasks to be fulfilled by it to bolster up its combat capability in every way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round various places including the hall of service personnel and the mushroom greenhouse, he learned about the political and ideological education, supply service and command and management of the unit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Expressing expectation and belief that the service personnel of the unit would firmly defend with arms the socialist country dynamically advancing toward a final victory, while keeping themselves in perfect combat readiness, he had a photo session with them."

            "content": "CPRK Secretariat Issues Open Questionnaire\r\n Pyongyang, December 25 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) released a following questionnaire Wednesday one year since Park Geun Hye became \"president\" through fraud-marred election.\n\t\t\t\t\t Park has run the whole gamut of rhetoric such as \"road of peace and common development\" and \"new era on the Korean Peninsula,\" vociferating about \"reform\" and \"confidence\" whenever an opportunity presented itself during her election campaign and after her assumption of office, the questionnaire noted, and continued: All compatriots are, however, recollecting how deceptive and shameless jargons they were.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. How does the present regime's north policy differ from the Lee Myung Bak regime's confrontation policy?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The Park regime's policy toward the north has nothing different from the Lee Myung Bak regime's confrontation policy. Park's policy surpasses that of the Lee regime in its crafty and vicious nature. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This proves that the Park regime is just the continuation of the Lee regime and it only seeks fiercer confrontation with the DPRK than Lee's. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Who is the arch criminal harassing peace and escalating tension on the peninsula?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After taking office the Park regime has become all the more dangerous in its moves to provoke a war against the DPRK in collusion with the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All this goes to prove that the U.S. and its stooge Park regime are the arch criminals who have disturbed peace and escalated tensions on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Confidence or confrontation?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Hye pledged to \"take one step after another to build confidence between the south and the north\" while talking about \"confidence-building\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But behind the scene, she challenged head-on the social system in the DPRK, while calling for \"giving priority to the regime change in the north\" and urging the north to \"opt for making real change\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park went the lengths of slandering the policy of the DPRK. She let loose such vituperation as terming it \"way of inviting isolation\" and \"the north will never succeed\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t4. To whom does Park give priority, outsiders or the nation?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After taking office, Park tightened nexus with the U.S. more zealously than any others, while calling for \"tightened south Korea-U.S. alliance\" and \"all-inclusive alliance.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park and her group even subordinated the north-south ties to the U.S. policy for invading the DPRK, while blustering that \"south-north relations can be settled smoothly only when south Korea-U.S. alliance is tightened\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park made no scruple of committing such act of treachery as begging for \"international cooperation\" to stifle the DPRK, while malignantly slandering the fellow countrymen during her trip to the U.S. and other countries in Europe.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t5. Who is a provoker?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group never opens its mouth without talking about \"provocation\" and \"threat\" to justify its confrontation and war moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBut the reality proves that it is none other than the U.S. and the Park regime which are keen to provoke a war on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t6. Who is responsible for mud-slinging and who is obliged to stop it?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group of conservatives is malignantly slandering the DPRK. They range from the \"president\", \"prime minister\", representative of \"the Saenuri Party\", authorities concerned, paid journalists and experts to anchor persons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is hurling even aged ultra-right conservatives and human scum into smear campaigns against the DPRK. It is the Park regime which should stop the smear campaign.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t7. Who should make a right option?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea is now swept by waves of fierce actions of people of all social standings against the puppet regime's sycophancy and treachery, confrontation with fellow countrymen and unpopular rule.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality shows that it is none other than Park Geun Hye herself who should make a right option."
