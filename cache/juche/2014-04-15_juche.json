            "content": "Grupo de inspeccion del CDN revela verdad de la caida de drones\r\n Pyongyang, 15 de abril (ACNC) -- El grupo de inspeccion del Comite de Defensa Nacional de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea dio a la publicidad el dia 14 los verdaderos aspectos del \"incidente de drones\", revelados hasta la fecha.\n\t\t\t\t\t Segun el acta de revelacion, las autoridades surcoreanas lo describen como \"obra del Norte de Corea\" al igual que el incidente de la corbeta \"Cheonan\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recientemente, fueron descubiertos en varios puntos del suelo surcoreano los drones caidos, comienza el documento y prosigue: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Las autoridades militares surcoreanas publicaron el 2 de abril el primer \"resultado de investigacion\", segun el cual los aviones no tripulados fueron despegados del Norte de Corea. Y el dia 11, presentaron el \"resultado de investigacion intermedio\" insistiendo en que las fotos, encontradas en los drones, son pruebas mas contundentes que confirman la \"obra del Norte de Corea\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Segun la logica de la parte surcoreana, todas las aeronaves, que circulan entre el Norte y el Sur de Corea y llevan las fotografias de la parte Sur, son \"las del Norte de Corea\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Si fuera asi, se puede sacar la conclusion de que son las surcoreanas las aeronaves que vuelen desde el sur hacia el norte en la parte al norte de la linea de demarcacion militar y tengan las fotos de la parte Norte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El \"grupo central de investigacion conjunta\" presento como una de las pruebas mas evidentes las letras coreanas inscritas en la bateria del motor. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Dicen que en la parte frontal de la bateria se ve la marca con inscripciones \"Kiyong nalja (fecha de entrada en uso)-25 de junio de 2013\" y \"Sayongjungji nalja (fecha de salida de uso)-25 de junio de 2014\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Las autoridades surcoreanas insisten en que el Norte de Corea usa generalmente esa manera de marcar y en el Sur de Corea se escribe la fecha como \"naltza\" a diferencia de \"nalja\" en el Norte de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pero, en la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea no se usa nunca la expresion \"kiyong\" (entrada en uso). En el gran diccionario de lengua coreana no aparece ni el parafraseo de esa expresion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Segun el \"resultado de investigacion\", en el reverso de la bateria estan las letras chinas y japonesas y el aparato de mantenimiento de la posicion de vuelo de drone es el producto de Futaba de Japon. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Entonces, ?como las autoridades surcoreanas sabran explicar esas palabras extranjeras y el aparato de fabricacion japonesa?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Como un testimonio para certificar el rumor de \"obra del Norte\" del incidente de drones se presentaron las huellas digitales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t ?Quien creeria si insisten en que estas huellas digitales descubiertos en los drones son de los norcoreanos porque no son de los surcoreanos? \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Al principio, el vocero del Ministerio de Defensa Nacional del Sur de Corea  aviso que   \"no sera facil para certificar el punto de  despegue de drones del Norte aunque se gasten mas de 30 billones como presupuesto para defensa nacional\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pero, unos dias despues, el mismo dijo que el lugar de despegue de drones es el aeropuerto de Onchon de la provincia de Hwanghae del Sur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Este aeropuerto no esta situado en dicha provincia sino en la provincia de Phyong-an del Sur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Poco despues, el mismo vocero dijo que es incorrecto el nombre del lugar publicado antes y el verdadero lugar de despegue de drones es el aeropuerto alrededor de la zona de Ongjin de la provincia de Hwanghae del Sur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En la RPDC no hay el aeropuerto en la zona cerca de Ongjin.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Las autoridades surcoreanas dijeron que el otro testimonio es el color verde y blanco del cuerpo de drones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En el \"resultado de investigacion intermedia\" ellas publicaron que en vista de la distancia de  vuelo de drones el presente caso es de la obra del Norte porque su distancia es corta para salir de los paises vecinos y el Sur de Corea no lo hizo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Entonces, ?todos los aviones de corta y larga distancia de vuelo son del Norte de Corea?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El Ministerio de Defensa Nacional del Sur de Corea aviso que el radar del avion de mando de las fuerzas aereas \"E-8\" capturo el 31 de marzo el dron que volaba del Norte hacia la isla Paekryong, lo que confirmo que los drones se despegaron de la zona norte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Y justificaron que aunque dispararon de inmediato mas de 300 proyectiles Balkan en tres ocasiones despues de descubrirlos no podian derribarlos porque el maximo alcance de tiro de sus proyectiles es 2km y el dron volaba manteniendo la altura de 5-6km.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Como si fueran olvidado sus palabras, el \"grupo central de investigacion conjunta\" publico que el dron descubierto en la isla Paekryong cayo por falta de combustible volando en zigzag con la velocidad 100-120km/h en la altura de 1.4km. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Cuando se ampliaron las sospechas de la opinion publica, el grupo respondio vagamente que fue posible acaso que haya aparecido en la isla Paekryong el otro drone desconocido por las autoridades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Segun el \"resultado de investigacion intermedio\", la aeronave fue hecha por la \"fundicion en troquel\", el circuito electronico pegado a la madera no es el estilo surcoreano y no hay testigos ni declaradores que descubrieron la plataforma de lanzamiento y los equipos adicionales necesarios al despegue de drone. Estas y otras absurdidades son los argumentos de la \"obra del Norte de Corea\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En cuanto a esa conducta dudosa, la gente susurra que no es facil inventar y comprobar el rumor de que \"la caida de drones es obra del Norte de Corea\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A medida que pase el tiempo, se tornara mas evidente el caracter fraudulento de ese rumor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El acta de revelacion denuncia el intento criminal de las autoridades surcoreanas que reprodujeron esta vez el incidente de \"Cheonan\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Primero, al acusar a la RPDC como autora del incidente de drones, las autoridades surcoreanas intentan imputarle la responsabilidad del empeoramiento de las relaciones N-S y de la creacion de la coyuntura a punto de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Segundo, con la fabricacion de otro caso de \"Cheonan\", tratan de repetir las \"medidas sobre el Norte del 24 de Mayo\" a fin de convertir las relaciones intercoreanas en las siempre conflictivas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tercero, bajo el pretexto del \"afianzamiento del estado de seguridad\", pretenden involucrar a su amo norteamericano en el aumento armamentista del Sur de Corea, de manera que puedan cubrir el \"vacio de las fuerzas militares\" y aplastar a toda costa a la RPDC por via militar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Las autoridades surcoreanas tienen el vicio de inventar un caso sensacional cada vez que se encuentran en crisis y lanzar, vinculandolo con la RPDC, la febril campana de enfrentamiento con esta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Puesto que ellas no retiran todavia el rumor de que el \"incidente de ¬¥Cheonan¬¥ es obra del Norte de Corea\" y siguen inventando casos similares, el grupo de inspeccion del CDN de la RPDC esta dispuesto a verificar todos los hechos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Es invariable nuestra posicion de investigar en conjunto todos los incidentes relacionados con la RPDC, inclusive el caso de \"Cheonan\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En representacion de la parte surcoreana, el jefe de la Oficina de Seguridad de Chongwadae, Kim Jang Su, quien presuntamente, se responsabiliza por la seguridad nacional del Sur de Corea, podria tomar parte en la investigacion conjunta que tendra lugar centrando gran atencion de la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Si no tienen nada que temer, no habria ninguna razon que haga a las autoridades surcoreanas desoir la justa y racional exigencia de la RPDC que se mantiene desde el principio del estallido del caso de \"Cheonan\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Esperamos la respuesta de las autoridades surcoreanas."
