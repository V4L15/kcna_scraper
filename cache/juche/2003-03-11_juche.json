            "content": "KCNA refutes U.S. absurd call for \"multilateral talks\" \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 10 (KCNA) -- U.S. senator Kennedy in his NBC appearance said \"He thinks the administration should hold direct talks with the North Korean leadership,\" adding that this is what allies in the region including South Korea and Japan want, according to South Korean MBC.\r\n This is an objective assessment of the call of the international community and world public for the DPRK-U.S. direct talks to solve the nuclear issue. It is, at the same time, a principled advice given to the administration to seriously handle the matter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not the first time that U.S. senators asserted U.S.-DPRK direct talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A senator, referring to the issue of concluding a non-aggression treaty at the direct talks between the DPRK and the U.S. during the hearing of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 4, asked deputy Secretary of State Armitage why the U.S. is not ready to conclude a non-aggression treaty while it is saying it does not have a plan to attack North Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many countries are calling for the peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula through direct talks and even American politicians share the same view. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, officials of the bush administration are insisting on \"multilateral talks,\" asserting that the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula is not an issue concerned with the DPRK and the U.S. only but an issue which affects whole Northeast Asia and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue, a product of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK, is an issue to be solved between the DPRK and the U.S. in view of its origin and circumstances of its outbreak. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe only way of solving it is to conclude a non-aggression treaty with legal binding force through bilateral direct talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue surfaced because the U.S. posed a threat to the DPRK with nuclear weapons in a bid to invade it and a touch-and-go situation is prevailing on the peninsula because Washington has escalated the nuclear threat to the DPRK in recent years, talking about \"preemptive nuclear attack.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTherefore, the DPRK's proposal to conclude a non-aggression treaty which legally guarantees it non-aggression is the most fair and aboveboard solution to the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration calls for \"multilateral talks\" though it talks about \"dialogue\" with the DPRK and escalates the military tension on the Korean Peninsula, talking about \"military options\". These can not be construed otherwise than a revelation of its intention to evade its direct responsibility for the nuclear issue and unleash a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This hypocritical and belligerent stand of the U.S. only makes the solution of the issue more complicated and renders the situation on the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia tenser. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. is truly willing to settle the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula it should withdraw its call for \"multilateral talks\" going against the trend of the times and immediately opt for direct talks with the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"

What remains is when and how to ignite a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under this situation we can not sit idle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Strength is not a monopoly of the U.S. We have military strength enough to fight against the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States should stop such a reckless military racket. \r\n"

            "content": "Truth of much ado about \"remittance to north\" clarified \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 10 (KCNA) -- The Korean Asia-Pacific Peace Committee (KAPPC), a direct party cooperating with the Hyundai Group of South Korea, issued a detailed report on March 9 to denounce the anti-DPRK hostile forces in South Korea for defiling the cooperation that has been underway between non-governmental organizations in the north and the south over what they call \"case of remittance to the north\" and unreasonably trying to link even the historic June 15 North-South Summit Meeting to it.\r\n It says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ultra-right conservatives in South Korea, though not well informed of the economic cooperation between KAPPC and Hyundai, floated the wild rumor that \"the north requested 1 billion U.S. dollar-fund\" and \"there was a secret agreement or a memorandum related to the summit talks,\" etc. in a bid to make their absurd assertion sound plausible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dismissing this as a sheer fabrication, the report continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Firstly, the Hyundai's cooperation representing the peculiarities of the north-south relations deserves the nation's appreciation and the issue of \"remittance to the north\" can never be subject to legal action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already pointed out in the agreement between the KAPPC and Hyundai and recognized by the public at home and abroad, the north-south relations are an internal issue of the nation and, at the same time, an issue that assumes double nature as the north and the south live separated. The Koreans, though a homogeneous nation, are in the relationship of peculiar nature as there still exists the foreign forces-imposed atmosphere of confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north side allowed Hyundai to use Mt. Kumgang, the famous mountain of Korea, and the Kaesong Industrial Zone, a scenic spot with many historical relics, and granted to it business right in railways, power, telecommunications and other key industrial fields, something unimaginable, judged by common sense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Hyundai side provided a huge amount of food aid to the northerners who suffered natural disasters out of humanitarianism and compatriotism and donated over 1,000 head of cattle to be used for agriculture and stockbreeding. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite natural for the two parties to have a financial transaction as the cooperation between them assumes the form of economic deal based on ensuring profitability and financial guarantee. Both sides, therefore, can have any option of financial transaction including prepayment or security, etc. if necessary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a direct dealer with the Hyundai side we are of the view that the whole nation should highly appreciate the cooperation rendered by the Hyundai for national reconciliation and unity and its praiseworthy deed should in no way be incriminated to meet the partisan interests and strategy of anti-reunification forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Secondly, the grand national party and other ultra-right conservatives in South Korea should immediately stop its confrontation racket to use the inter-Korean issue for attaining its political and strategic goals and apologize to the nation for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the fiction of \"remittance to the north\" is concerned, the GNP is not in a position to say anything about it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Frankly Speaking, since long before the emergence of the \"civilian government\" the GNP suggested high-level contacts to the north through various channels. It even said that if the north side accepted its request, it would offer us not only tens of billions of dollars but everything we wanted without any limit to items and size of aid. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With the presidential election at hand last year, the GNP sent a secret envoy to the north. He said: The GNP will other the north more positive and bigger aid than what the present \"government\" does if Ri Hoe Chang takes office. He added the GNP's attack on the north policy of the present \"government\" and \"ruling party\" is aimed to take power. He informed the north of the GNP's on-going revision of its north policy from absolute reciprocity to flexible reciprocity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is difficult at the moment for the north to disclose the secret of the GNP's dispatch of the secret envoy taking the peculiar nature of the north-south relations into due consideration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The racket over the \"remittance to the north\" kicked up by the GNP and other ultra-right conservatives in South Korea is neither for the sake of the nation nor to meet the \"state interests.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As South Korean media commented, it is nothing but an expression of the GNP's anger at its defeat in the \"presidential election\" held toward the end of last year and a desperate effort to prevent the party from being totally divided and revamp it till the general election slated for 2004. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thirdly, as a back-stage wirepuller of the farce of \"remittance to the north\" the U.S. should admit its despicable crime and stop inciting north-south confrontation at once. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Displeased with the process of reconciliation and peace on the Korean Peninsula, the U.S. has worked hard overtly and covertly to prevent the KAPPC and Hyundai from starting the tour of Mt. Kumgang since its very beginning. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. moves to hamstring the tour of Mt. Kumgang reached a more serious phase after the emergence of the Bush administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In November 2000 the U.S. instructed the U.S. Forces commander and other brasshats in South Korea to force the Hyundai Group to stop the tour of Mt. Kumgang under the pretext that \"there is apprehension as to the diversion of Hyundai's fund into a military purpose by the north.\" This was reported by the Japanese Sankei Shimbun on February 2, 2001. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Hyundai had been recognized as the greatest conglomerate in South Korea till the end of 1999. But it broke up into several companies due to financial difficulties and is now compelled to take its hands off the business for the tour of Mt. Kumgang. All this is attributable to the U.S. which put financial pressure on Hyundai through the banking institutions under its control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"case of remittance to the north\", an issue of public focus in South Korea, is a product of this base operation of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The report called on the South Korean authorities, political parties and organizations and Koreans at home and abroad to clearly see through the nature and truth of the ruckus over \"remittance to the north\" kicked up by the U.S. imperialists and ultra-right conservatives in South Korea and resolutely frustrate it to boost the inter-Korean relations and non-governmental cooperation to meet the interests of the nation.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "S. Korean military hit for slandering north \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 10 (KCNA) -- The South Korean military issued a \"statement on the north\" in a bid to kick up a row instead of expressing support and sympathy with the DPRK which exercised its self-defensive right by letting fighters of its people's army force a reconnaissance plane of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces to fly away. Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary terms it an act against the nation and peace.\r\n According to a news report, the South Korean ministry of defence in a \"statement on the north\" issued on March 7 slandered the north and went the length of admonishing it over the incident of the U.S. reconnaissance plane which occurred on March 2, asserting that \"such incident may have a serious impact on the security situation\" on the Korean Peninsula and \"it is a reckless military action.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean military authorities put the fellow countrymen in the north on edge at a time when the very dangerous foal eagle joint military exercise aimed to inflict disasters of a nuclear war on the nation is now under way in South Korea, the Rsoi drill is to be staged there under the simulated conditions for a war against the north, a U.S. aircraft carrier Carl Vinson is deployed in the waters off South Korea and 24 B1 and B52 bombers and more than 2,000-strong U.S. Forces have been amassed on Guam Island all of a sudden for the purpose of mounting a preemptive attack on the DPRK. This is intolerable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reckless behaviour on the part of the South Korean authorities will only result in bringing the inter-Korean relations back to those in the period of confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they are truly concerned about the danger of war created on the Korean Peninsula, they should not slander the fellow countrymen in the north while siding with foreign forces but stop the joint war exercises with the U.S. aimed to invade the north, respect the spirit of the June 15 Joint Declaration and opt for protecting the interests of the nation. \r\n They should know that days of those who dare provoke the north are numbered.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
