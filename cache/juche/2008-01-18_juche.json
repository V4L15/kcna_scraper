            "content": "Kanggye Spirit Sparks off Flames of New Great Revolutionary Upsurge  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 17 (KCNA) -- The DPRK has made a victorious advance, breaking through difficulties lying in chronicles in the great spirit of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is eloquently illustrated by the Kanggye spirit that kindled the flames of a new great revolutionary upsurge in the DPRK when its people had to make an \"Arduous March\" and a forced march previously unknown due to natural disasters that hit it for several consecutive years and the U.S. imperialists' moves to isolate and stifle it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In those days when the country was standing at the crossroads of life and death, Kim Jong Il unfolded a far-reaching blueprint to cut the Gordian knot on the pattern of Jagang Province which had shared the destiny with the revolutionary headquarters in each period of ordeals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Immensely inspired by the trust shown by him in pushing them to the foreground of the era, the people of Jagang Province registered miraculous successes. They built or reinforced dozens of minor power stations in a little more than six months and operated hundreds of local industry factories and provided tens of thousands of families with lighting with the electric power generated by them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He visited Kanggye in January Juche 87 (1998) when a new wave of innovation was sweeping Jagang Province and made a tour of over 6 000 ri in a few days for on-the-spot guidance in defiance of the intense cold of midwinter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Going round minor power stations and a number of industrial establishments bearing the marks of the fighting spirit and sweat of provincial people, he said the people of Jagang Province had shown with practical examples how one should uphold the Party in such hard times as those days. He named their fighting spirit \"Kanggye spirit\" and made the whole country learn from it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Raging waves of a new great revolutionary upswing rolled over the whole country when the Kanggye spirit, an embodiment of the revolutionary soldier spirit, was spreading over the society with great influence and attraction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The devoted struggle of the working class across the country brought back to normal operation in 1999 thousands of industrial establishments which had been lying dead nationwide and many of them overfulfilled their annual plans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Large-scale salterns including the Kwangmyongsong Saltern were laid out in the east coast and power stations cropped up everywhere. The Kaechon-Lake Thaesong Waterway of natural flow, which had been said to take more than 10 years, was completed in a little over two years and crop fields extending hundreds of thousands of hectares were rezoned into standardized ones. These were miracles never known in the national history of fifty centuries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Kanggye spirit that made the flames of a new great revolutionary upsurge flare up in the Songun era is powerfully rousing the Korean people in the general offensive to glory this year as a year of historical turn.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They also successfully represented the faith and will to eternally glorify the land of Jagang frequented by Kim Jong Il in mixed trio \"For Better Morrow\", male chorus \"Let's Advance Faster for a Higher Goal\" and other pieces.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
