province.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Sun Zhengcai said that Kim Jong Il's another visit to the Northeast area of China associated with many stories about Kim Il Sung who shared weal and woe with revolutionaries of the elder generation of China while living, studying and fighting in his youth and provided the roots of Sino-DPRK friendship, would be brilliantly recorded in the history of friendly relations between the two countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the two countries are now greeting the opportunity of important development in political, economic, cultural cooperation and other fields, Sun stressed that Jilin Province, a bridgehead of exchange and cooperation between China and the DPRK, would positively contribute to boosting friendly and cooperative

a China por la invitacion cordial del estimado camarada Secretario General Hu Jintao y de sostener este encuentro significativo con el y otros camaradas chinos hermanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ante todo, quisiera expresar mi profundo agradecimiento al Secretario General Hu Jintao que ofrecio este banquete opiparo para nosotros a pesar de que esta muy ocupado y le esperan muchos importantes problemas politicos nacionales e internacionales a atender, y acaba de pronunciar ahora un discurso de desbordante sentimiento de amistad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Igualmente, agradezco a la direccion

las relaciones Corea-China, se esforzaran dinamicamente por el fortalecimiento y el desarrollo de ellas y enviaran siempre su apoyo y solidaridad a la lucha del pueblo coreano por construir el socialismo y realizar la reunificacion del pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Sobre todo, estamos complacidos de que se estrechara la comunicacion de opiniones estrategicas entre ambos partidos y paises y se materializaran bien los espiritus de acuerdos logrados entre nosotros y la direccion central del Partido Comunista de China en todos los sectores como la politica, la economia y la cultura.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La tradicional amistad Corea-China, que demuestra su enorme vitalidad aun bajo la complicada situacion internacional, se consolidara y se desarrollara mas en lo adelante y estimulara mas energeticamente la justa lucha de los pueblos de ambos paises por cumplir la causa comun: la construccion del socialismo y la reunificacion del pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Me alegro mucho de que nuestra visita a China haya sido una oportunidad magnifica para desarrollar mas vigorosamente las tradicionales relaciones de amistad Corea-China, arraigada en el corazon de los pueblos de ambos paises, superando todas las pruebas de la historia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El Partido del Trabajo de Corea y el gobierno de la RPDC se esforzaran en todo lo posible por seguir consolidando y desarrollando la amistad Corea-China, patrimonio comun y valiosa herencia que nos legaron los revolucionarios de generacion veterana de ambos paises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La amistad
