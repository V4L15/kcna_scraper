So it was very difficult to bomb them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nU.S. bombers, however, flew into deep valleys and rabidly bombed ancient buildings, leaving no traces of them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn May Juche 40 (1951) they pounded the Jangan Temple in one of the scenic wonders of Mt. Kumgang and in June they burned to ashes the wooden buildings of the Singye Temple including its main building. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThey laid in ruins more than 40 buildings, the nine-storied pagoda and others of the Yujom Temple which was the largest of the four major temples in Mt. Kumgang and the center of over 60 temples in the mountain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe Kwangbop Temple at the foot of Mt. Taesong in Pyongyang, the Sokwang Temple at the foot of Mt. Solbong in Kosan County, Kangwon Province, and other historic relics in different parts of the country were all badly destroyed or reduced to ashes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe U.S. imperialists tried to wipe out the brilliant culture created by the Korean people through a long history spanning 5,000 years, but the DPRK has restored the historical remains and relics to their original state so that they may throw brighter rays as national treasures. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Nothing can replace the declarations in realizing the vital requirement and interests of all Koreans who earnestly wish for independent reunification, peace and prosperity at present. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The validity of the above-said declarations, in a word, lies in that they put forward the Korean nation as the driving force responsible for the movement of national reunification and indicated in detail the principles and ways of solving the issue of reunification by pooling the strength and wisdom of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary for the Koreans to dynamically wage the nationwide struggle for implementing the declarations to consolidate the achievements already gained by the Korean nation and achieve national unity and reunification at an early date. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The stand on the declarations serves as a touchstone which distinguishes patriotism from treachery at present. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Neither national reconciliation and cooperation nor the development of inter-Korean relations, peace and prosperity would be thinkable apart from the declarations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation will never tolerate the treacherous moves of the Lee group who negate the reunification programmes common to the nation and stand in the way of their implementation, swimming against the trend of the times, concludes the article.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The situation is further deteriorating. The U.S. drop of the above-mentioned policy is, therefore, essential for defusing the tension and ensuring security on the peninsula. This is also in line with the interests of not only the north and the south of Korea but other countries around it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has consistently urged the United States to rectify its hostile policy toward the DPRK and replace the AA by a peace accord. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Had the U.S. rolled back the above-said policy as called for by the DPRK, no such complicated pending issues as what they are facing now would have surfaced between them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. warlike forces are straining the situation behind the scene of the six-party talks while systematically escalating their military moves to invade the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The military tension can never be defused on the peninsula nor can the danger of war be removed from there unless the U.S. drops the above-said policy and replaces the AA by a peace accord. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Everything depends on the stand and attitude of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should not evade its heavy responsibility as the party chiefly to blame for having deteriorated the situation on the peninsula and caused the nuclear crisis but respond as early as possible to the just call of the DPRK for replacing the AA by a peace accord. This would be beneficial not only to ensuring peace and security in Northeast Asia and other parts of the world but also to the U.S., concludes the commentary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
