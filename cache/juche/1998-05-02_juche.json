            "content": "Nature reserve for tristram's woodpecker\r\n Pyongyang, May 2 (KCNA) -- Tristram's woodpecker, belonging to the family to woodpecker, is a species of birds native to Korea. It was discovered in Kyonggi Province in 1879.\r\n   Right after liberation in 1945, Korea took necessary measures to promote forestation and protect useful wildlife.\r\n   In September 1969, for example, a cabinet order, \"On protecting and propagating tristram's woodpeckers and establishing their reserve\", was adopted, and a massive protection was given to these birds.\r\n   In Kaesong city tristram's woodpeckers in Mt. Songak were given special protection   as national treasure. Many areas, including Phyongsan and Rinsan counties in North Hwanghae Province and Pongchon county in South Hwanghae Province, were designated as reserves, creating a fine environment for the birds.\r\n   Nowadays all the areas inhabited by this bird are designated as the reserve, an indication of encouraging their further propagation.\r\n   Tristram's woodpecker is the biggest bird of the family of woodpecker in Korea.   It resembles black woodpecker, but its chest, waist, belly and tail are all white, which makes  it easy to tell white from black woodpeckers.\r\n   Its beak is long, pointed and firm. It has four toes, two of which stretching backward. The tail's feather is also firm. Woodpeckers live near the human communities, on the hills filled with chestnut, oak, poplar and zelkova trees. \r\nThey tap the bark of trees and dig holes on the bark to search for insects in the trunk.\r\n   The bird quickly moves from tree to tree and protects itself when faced with danger, by prostrating on the trunk. \r\n   It sings \"kullak, kullak,\" in a peculiar sound. Before sunset it comes to the nest and at sunrise it flies off. In  April and May it lays a litter of 3 to 4 eggs in a hole in the trunk.\r\n   \r\n\r\n"
