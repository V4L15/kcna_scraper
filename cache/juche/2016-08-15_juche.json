That is none other than the empire of evils the U.S. which emerged from the heap of corpses of the native population on the American continent who had lived in peace while creating their own culture for thousands of years.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the early period of \"the nation-building\" the presidents of the U.S. justified territorial expansion to the west as \"endowed mission\". They were criminals who abused human rights as they adopted it as the state policy to massacre Indians and took presidency for their military achievements in the massacre.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. describes the stark fact of massacre as \"war\" with Indians but it could hardly be called a war as primitive spear-armed Indians had to stand against the American ground forces armed with firepower weapons. It was a horrible massacre of American Indians in all aspects.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. nature as man-killers has become all the more undisguised with the passage of time. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It massacred more than 600,000 in the Philippines between 1898 and 1905, over 2.47 million in Korea between 1950 and 1953 and at least 3.8 million in Vietnam in 1965-1973.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As leopard never changes its spots, the brutal nature of the U.S. can never change. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even at this moment, tens of thousands of innocent people are meeting deaths owing to ethnic and factional disputes sparked by the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t While going through the \"maturity\" process based on the law of jungle, the U.S. swallowed the whole of the North American continent and turned Latin America into its \"tranquil backyard\" by dint of the carrot and stick policy. Late in the 19th century to early in the 20th century it stretched its tentacles of aggression to the land across the Pacific.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After raking up huge profits through the two world wars, the U.S. emerged as a world power. It cried out for \"peace by America,\" being buoyed by ecstasy that it can build a world order wished by it based on its overwhelming economic and military upper-hands.   \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The true nature of the above-said motto was revealed as pronoun of war and destruction from the beginning.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was by no means independence which the U.S. brought to weak colonial countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America which kowtowed to the U.S., being steeped in pro-Americanism. It was not prosperity, either. It was an evil cycle of internal disturbance and bloodshed and complete colonization through destruction of national economy and national culture.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Over 70 years ago the painful history of national division started on this land due to foolish pro-American guys and even at this moment the group of traitors still obsessed by the idea of \"peace\" offered by the U.S. are working desperately to introduce evil weapons for killing the fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the U.S. launched the Iraqi war with such far-fetched assertion as \"concealment of weapons of mass destruction\", not content with invading Afghanistan by force of arms and spreading story related to terrorism, people did not realize that the \"war on terrorism\" was a new war of aggression and a prelude to a new world war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Bush's Iraqi war sowed the seeds of factional conflict which had been dormant and Obama's assertion about the withdrawal of the U.S. forces sparked off a new world war throughout the Mideast.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  What is this \"peace\" for?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The answer is clear. It is aimed to prolong the remaining days of the U.S. which turned into a huge war machine that gets corpulent through wars and which can not exist without them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The U.S. military-industrial complexes are steadily manufacturing new destructive weapons in its hasty preparations for bringing a horrible disaster that can rake up huge profits.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The U.S. claimed \"cultural pluralism\" allegedly calling for \"establishing macro national culture on the basis of recognizing and respecting the national, racial and linguistic commonness and the value of their differences\". But as the mask of the U.S. as \"champion of free world\" during the Cold War was shaken off, the U.S. plunged again into the whirlwind of racial conflict and contradiction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  This reached the height with black President Obama, symbolic of \"cultural pluralism\" in the U.S., taking office, in particular.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Recently Obama called for racial harmony at a TV appearance but crack in the American society has already entered the phase beyond control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Now there do not exist racial and ethnic bonds that have kept the country called the U.S. afloat with difficulty, an indication that the U.S. will sooner or later break to pieces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  This is the absolute fate the U.S., the empire of evil, has to face.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The article said that the nuclear weapons were the foremost strength that helped the U.S. lord it over the world for a long time, stressing that now the nuclear weapons are no longer a monopoly of the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  It will clearly realize before long what is precipitating its doom."

France made contracts with Qatar, Egypt, Kuwait and other countries last year on sale of fighter jets, attack copters and frigates worth about 8 billion euros and began the delivery of the jets. Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia and other east European countries sold various type weapons worth 1.2 billion euros to dispute-torn Mideast countries including Syria and Yemen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to a report released by international survey organizations, a lot of weapons exported by east European countries for the past 4 years are being used by terrorist organizations like \"Islamic State\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The European public and media are terming the arms sales of European countries an \"act of exporting death.\" They comment that the situation in the war-torn Mideast including civil wars in Syria and Yemen are tragic consequences of the irresponsible arms export policy by the governments of European countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This goes to prove that the reckless arms sales of European countries have become another factor of increasing tensions and fostering human rights abuses in the dispute-torn Mideast.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said increasing arms sales are illegal and unethical acts quite contrary to the codes concerning arms export established by them and the ardent desire of humankind for peace and stability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t EU arms export regulations stipulate that export of military technology and supplies should be banned in case they may be used for sparking or prolonging armed clashes and escalating tensions in the country which purchased them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Laws of European countries concerning arms control ban arms sale if weapons create the danger of wrecking peace or being used for a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As European countries massively sold weapons to dispute-torn Mideast for raking up profits in disregard of those regulations, the situation is getting tenser and the refugee crisis is now beyond control. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their sale of offensive weapons to south Korea, in particular, is resulting in escalating reckless confrontation to disturb regional peace and security.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the past European countries talked about \"stability of situation\" and \"peace\" louder than any others.
