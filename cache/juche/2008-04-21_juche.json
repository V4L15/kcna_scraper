            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on Songun Leadership Exploits of WPK\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- The Songun leadership exploits performed by General Secretary Kim Jong Il serve as the unchangeable guidelines for the Korean revolution and construction. His Songun leadership provided a decisive guarantee for accomplishing with arms the Korean revolution, which was started and advanced with arms, and brought a great heyday to all fields of the revolution and construction in the era of the Workers' Party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Sunday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Comprehended in his Songun leadership exploits are ideological and theoretical guidelines to victoriously advance the revolution and construction and the boundlessly rich experience of struggle that helped lead the revolution and construction to a brilliant victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il covers all fields and sectors of the revolution and construction such as politics, military affairs, economy, culture and diplomacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the army and people of the DPRK are highly demonstrating their militant spirit as the revolutionary army and people who carry out any difficult and huge tasks, always full of confidence in victory and without knowing impossibility despite of any ordeals. It is because that they work and struggle with Kim Jong Il's great revolutionary leadership exploits and experience as guidelines. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Contained in his Songun leadership exploits are all the models of the times to be followed in all fields of the revolution and construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He has always created everything as a model of the times and generalized it to steadily advance the revolution and construction. This is part of his distinguished leadership traits. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At present we are faced with the task to renovate all realms of social life, including the economy and culture, as befitting the appearance of a great prosperous powerful nation. This means that we should add luster to the models of the times provided by Kim Jong Il on the road of Songun and create and build everything at the same level. If this demand is met, fresh leap forward and great change will be brought about in socialist construction and the DPRK dignified with Songun will prosper forever.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japanese Reactionaries' Extension of Sanctions against DPRK under Fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- The Japanese government recently decided to extend sanctions against the DPRK, asserting that no substantial progress is made in the latter's nuclear declaration and the settlement of the abduction issue and to pursue the same \"diplomacy based on the view on value\" as the Abe government did. This is nothing but the last-ditch effort of those trying to prolong the remaining days of their political careers now in increasing danger by winning popularity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun observes this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has lost her face to say anything about the nuclear issue and the abduction issue, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was none other than Japan which raised the abduction issue that had already found a solution each time the six-party talks were under way, obstructing their work. Japan is making desperate efforts to check the progress of the six-party talks and strain the situation on the Korean Peninsula in a bid to create a favorable environment for its emergence as a military power and overseas aggression. Its decision to extend sanctions against the DPRK was prompted by its sinister intention to deliberately bring the DPRK-Japan relations to an extreme pitch of tension and hasten the military preparations for overseas aggression under this pretext. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Diplomacy based on the view on value\" much touted by the present Japanese government is also a dangerous diplomatic strategy aiming at aggression and plunder. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present government's decision to pursue the same \"diplomacy based on the view on value\" as Abe did is nothing but a revelation of its intention to carry forward his aggressive and reactionary policy. If the Fukuda government follows the above-said diplomacy of Abe, failing to draw a lesson from his miserable end, it will meet the same tragic end as its predecessor's. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is very foolish and absurd for the Japanese reactionaries to try to gain something by extending the sanctions against the DPRK and increasing pressure upon it. Abe was forsaken by the Japanese people for going against the trend of the times and the wishes of the public. Should the present Japanese ruling quarters follow the same policy as Abe's, they will only face self-destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Just since its emergence, the Lee Myung Bak regime of south Korea has been hell-bent on the cooperation with outsiders and the confrontation with the fellow countrymen to follow the U.S. anti-DPRK policy, crying out for \"priority to improving the relations with the U.S.\" and anti-national \"pragmatism\" and \"no nukes, opening and 3,000 dollars\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans should smash the foreign forces' aggression policy and the anti-national moves of the south Korean conservative ruling forces supporting such policy and give impetus to the national reunification movement at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the sake of the nation's destiny they should foil every move of the U.S. imperialists to unleash a new war and repulse any attempt of the Lee Myung Bak group who is running amuck to deny the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration and block the way of independent reunification, peace and prosperity after shaping the anti-national and anti-reunification \"policy toward the north.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson stresses that the Korean nation will surely win in the showdown with the U.S. and usher in a new era of independent reunification, peace and prosperity, thus realizing the noble desire of the uprisers without fail.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

These were provided in the crucible of the dynamic drive to effect a signal turn in the movie industry. Herein lies another aspect of the greatness, scientific accuracy and truth of his ideas and theories. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He also brought about a radical turn in the fields of opera and drama, thereby effecting a signal turn in literature, music, fine art and all other fields of literature and art. Korea of Juche thus witnessed the renaissance of the 20th century that startled the world people, concludes the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
