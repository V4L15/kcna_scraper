The youth are playing a major role in the decisive battle against the U.S. today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The 5 million youth who have cultivated matchless power and wisdom under the guidance of Kim Jong Il, illustrious commander born of heaven, will become human bombs and sledge hammers and mercilessly wipe out the U.S. imperialist aggressors if they ignite a war on this land and do harm to beloved Pyongyang even a bit.    \r\n\r\n"

It has ensured visits of Koreans in Japan to the homeland and Japanese visits to the DPRK, contributing to promoting exchange and friendship between the Korean people and the progressives of Japan and between political parties and organizations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He dismissed the Japanese authorities' reckless behavior as a provocative act to impair the high international prestige of the DPRK and tarnish its image and encroach upon its sovereignty and self-respect and an anachronistic move to trample underfoot the right to humanitarian visit of Koreans in Japan to their homeland and bedevil the Korea-Japan friendship and thus chill the desire of the two peoples for improved bilateral relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities should ponder over the fact that in case the Korean people strong in self-respect are compelled to take any countermeasure, the relations between the two countries may turn into the worst hostile relations, the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration may be reduced to a dead document and then this may pose an unpredictable threat to the peace and security of Asia and the rest of the world. \r\n The Japanese authorities should immediately rectify their hostile policy toward the DPRK and Chongryon (General Association of Korean Residents in Japan), a policy going against the trend of the times, make a policy switchover for the implementation of the declaration and take positive measures to ensure at once the regular service of the ship and enable Korean residents and students in Japan to visit their homeland as scheduled. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Availing ourselves of this opportunity, we express belief that the progressive and peace-loving people, political parties and organizations in Japan will actively turn out in the solidarity movement to check the Japanese authorities' unreasonable anti-DPRK, anti-Chongryon campaign and boost the Korea-Japan friendship.    \r\n\r\n"

In that case Japan, too, will not be safe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's assertion about the \"importance of multilateral negotiations\" was prompted by its real intention to use the multilateral talks as a leverage for laying an international siege to the DPRK, not to truly settle the nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind Japan's ceaseless ruckus over someone's kidnapping issue is its black-hearted intention to flee from its responsibility to redress its past wrongdoings by internationalizing the kidnapping issue at any cost and misleading public opinion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should not dance to the tune of the U.S. but ponder over the grave consequences to be entailed by the worsening DPRK-Japan relations, he urges.    \r\n\r\n"

Korea slammed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 12 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists were recently reported to have deployed over 20 AH-64D helicopters of the latest type in South Korea as a link in their whole chain of their plan to bolster their forces in South Korea.\r\n This is a very dangerous military development as it happened right after the recent announcement of the \"arms buildup plan\" calling for spending a stupendous amount of fund in three years to come to massively beef up the U.S. forces in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson today in a signed commentary says this indicates that the U.S. imperialists are desperately stepping up their preparations for a war of aggression to contain the DPRK by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The deployment of the new type helicopters in South Korea clearly proves that the \"arms buildup plan\" announced by the U.S. as part of its preparations for a war of aggression against the DPRK is being put into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are grossly mistaken if they think they can bring the DPRK under their control by force. The DPRK has a deterrent force powerful enough to foil the U.S. imperialists' nuclear war moves at a single stroke. The U.S. imperialists are going frantic to stifle the DPRK militarily. This reality proves once again that it was quite just for the people of the DPRK to have built up self-defensive war deterrent force, tightening their belts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. ignites a war of aggression against the DPRK, the Korean people will vent their long pent-up wrath against the aggressors and wipe out them to the last one.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
