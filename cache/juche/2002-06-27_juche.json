Pointing toward Namsan Hill, he asked officials what should be built on the hill.\r\n They hesitated to answer him because Namsan Hill, a good site in the centre of the capital, was the place which the president spared. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The president saw to it that the hill was left intact when a plan for rehabilitation and construction of Pyongyang was mapped out and when a design for a government office building was presented. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In December that year, he climbed the hill and said a large library should be built there so that the people would like it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n So, the grand people's study house with a total floor space of 100,000 square meters and a collection of 30 million volumes has been built on the hill which he spared for scores of years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In June Juche 83 (1994) he went sightseeing of the River Taedong with former U.S. President Jimi Carter on a visit to Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the excursion boat was passing by a place out of the city, he suddenly called a suite member and told him to have the speed of the boat decreased. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Carter wondered at the decreasing speed and asked the president why the speed was going down. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The president, pointing his finger at the riverside where working people were angling fish, said the waves by the boat would disturb them and the boat was made to go slowly lest it might break their interesting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Carter was deeply moved to see what was unexpected.     \r\n\r\n"

The reason behind this tactics can be explained by the fact that the world is in the grip of turbulence and there is a series of chaos in the international relations in the wake of the \"September 11 incident\" and the U.S. is not strong enough to contain the independent forces of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the general thrust of the U.S. imperialists' reactionary world strategy to destroy the world's independent forces and make the world a uni-polar world under its thumb in a bid to establish its unchallenged hegemony by dint of its policy of strength, the strategy of aggression and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration is hell-bent on arms race and arms buildup. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are stepping up their preparations for a war of aggression under the signboard of \"peace\" and \"anti-terrorism.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their main target is developing countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One of their most crafty methods is to launch a war of aggression against small countries single-handed under the pretext of \"combating terrorism.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In a bid to justify their moves to escalate the \"anti-terrorism war\" the U.S. imperialists listed the DPRK, Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya and other countries as members of \"the axis of evil,\" \"terrorism sponsors\" and \"rogue states.\" Through this they seek a pretext for military aggression of those countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n their nuclear strategy is one of the strategies clearly proving the aggressive and bestial nature of the U.S. imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are keen to put big powers and developing countries under their control with an upperhand in strength and a nuclear edge and establish an international order based on the jungle law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' aggressive nature has been brought into bolder relief on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialist hawkish forces are working hard to provoke the second Korean War in a bid to stem the trend toward peace and detente, get rid of its political and economic crisis and establish a uni-polar world at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' aggressive nature will never change.     \r\n\r\n"
