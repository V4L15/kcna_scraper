This was an immortal contribution to saving the cause of socialism from a crisis and triumphantly advancing it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Typical of those works are \"Socialism Is a Science\", \"the Historical Lesson in Building Socialism and the General Line of Our Party\", \"Abuses of Socialism Are Intolerable\", \"Our Socialism Centred on the Masses Shall Not Perish\" and \"Socialism Is Lifeline of Our People.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the President Kim Il Sung demised, the nation's greatest loss, Kim Jong Il published \"the Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung Is Always With Our People\", \"Let Us Always Hold the Great Leader in High Esteem and Accomplish His Cause\" and other famous works, thus inspiring them to implement his last instructions in order to accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il also authored many other famous works clearly teaching the truth of the great Juche idea and ways to embody it and giving lucid answers to the issues arising in political, military, economic, cultural and all other fields. \r\n\r\n"

Paektu towering on the northernmost tip of the country is well known to the nation for several reasons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Once Taehongdan was known to be away from haunts of men. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In may Juche 28 (1939) the President Kim Il Sung, personally leading the main force of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army, advanced into the Musan area and wiped out Japanese aggressors in Taehongdan. So, this place is known as an anti-Japanese battle-site. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The monument to the victory in the Musan area battles and revolutionary battle-sites and historic relics which are well preserved draw an endless stream of visitors from across the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nation's first state-run farm made its appearance there as a result of the huge land reclamation project carried out during the hard fought Fatherland Liberation War (June 1950-july 1953). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The agricultural workers have turned their farm into a model despite unfavorable natural conditions in the alpine area. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The great leader Kim Jong Il visited the farm several times in the period of the \"arduous march\" when the country was hard pressed for everything. He instructed the farm to bring about a signal boost in potato cultivation and indicated a clear orientation and ways of turning the county into a socialist paradise. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The county built minor power stations on its own efforts to solve the acute shortage of electricity, thus setting an example for all other people to follow.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The head of the power station construction unit is among those six persons known to the country as heroes and heroines of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Taehongdan county is exemplary in potato farming, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The county has a bright prospect of comprehensive mechanization as it has  widely used trucks, tractors, potato planters, potato harvesters and other modern farm machines this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A modern pig farm and a potato starch factory were newly commissioned, one more example to other counties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The county is proud of couples of discharged soldiers who volunteered to work there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This March Kim Jong Il spared time to visit the family of a discharged soldier working on the Sodu branch farm. His wife asked the leader to name her baby expected a few months  later. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il proposed two names: Taehong for a son and Hongdan for a girl. He added that if they have a son and a daughter, their names will make Taehongdan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In July last she gave birth to a girl named Hongdan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Later, couples of discharged soldiers came to have hundreds of babies and vied with each other to name them Taehong and Hongdan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Successive births of Taehong  and Hongdan promise a brighter future of Taehongdan. \r\n\r\n"
