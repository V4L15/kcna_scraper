            "content": "Anniversary of Kim Jong Il's Assumption of Supreme Commandership of KPA Marked\r\n Pyongyang, December 23 (KCNA) -- A national meeting was held at the April 25 House of Culture here Tuesday to mark the 17th anniversary of General Secretary Kim Jong Il's assumption of supreme commandership of the Korean People's Army.\n\t\t\t\t\tPresent there were senior party, army and state officials, chairpersons of the friendly parties, officials of party, armed forces and power bodies, social organizations, ministries and national institutions, servicepersons of the KPA, officials in the fields of science, education, culture and arts, public health and media, persons of merit and working people in Pyongyang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tVice Marshal of the KPA Kim Il Chol, minister of the People's Armed Forces who is member of the National Defence Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in a report made at the meeting said that holding Kim Jong Il at the highest post of the revolutionary armed forces made it possible to steadily advance the Juche-oriented cause of army building started by President\n\t\t\t\t\t\tKim Il Sung generation after generation, steadfastly carry forward the history and tradition of the Korean revolution which has emerged victorious thanks to the Songun politics and thus successfully accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that the path of the revolution along which  Kim Jong Il has led the revolutionary armed forces in the DPRK, shouldering the heavy responsibility as supreme commander of the KPA, is a significant course in which he put the Juche-oriented cause of army-building on a new high stage, thus turning the KPA into an invincible revolutionary army of Mt. Paektu and a glorious history in which        he has brought an epoch-making miracles and changes in the do-or-die struggle to defend socialism and build a rich and powerful nation by pulling through the unprecedentedly grim difficulties under the uplifted banner of Songun.   \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il has wisely led the work to ensure that a radical turn was brought about in the efforts to increase the roles of the party organizations and political organs of the People's Army in every way, establish the Party leadership system throughout the army and implement the Party's military line of self-defence in the early period of his leadership over the army.  He unrolled a programme for modeling the whole army on the Juche idea as required by the mature demand for the development of the Korean revolution, which called for modeling the whole society on the Juche idea, thus opening up a new history of the cause of Juche-based army building aimed at turning the KPA into a genuine army of the leader and an army of the Party.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He has developed the KPA into core ranks and a main force for the Juche-oriented revolution and brought about epoch-making miracles and changes in the struggle for defending socialism and building a great prosperous powerful nation, thereby laying an eternal foundation for achieving boundless prosperity of the country and nation, guided by the great Songun idea and with energetic Songun revolutionary leadership. These revolutionary exploits performed by Kim Jong Il will shine forever along with the history of the country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reporter called for successfully attaining the Party's magnificent goal to fling open without fail the gate of a great prosperous powerful nation in 2012 which will commemorate the centenary of birth of the President. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A grave situation is prevailing on the Korean Peninsula due to the hostile policy of the U.S. imperialists and their followers toward the DPRK and their frantic moves to ignite a war of aggression against it, he said, and continued: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's revolutionary armed forces have already made a solemn declaration that they would counter the enemies' slightest moves for \"preemptive attack\" with more rapid and powerful advanced preemptive strike of our style.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The pro-American warmongers of south Korea hell-bent on igniting another war had better stop their rash acts, bearing in mind that Korean-style preemptive attack based on striking means unimaginably more powerful than nuclear weapons will prove to be the most decisive and merciless strike based on justice as it will not merely turn everything into a sea of fire but reduce everything treacherous and anti-reunification to debris and build an independent reunified country on it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Should the U.S. hard-line conservative forces and the bellicose forces of south Korea dare ignite another war of aggression against the DPRK, the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK will mobilize all the military potentials reinforced by dint of Songun and remove the main source of war from the peninsula and thus accomplish the historic cause of national reunification without fail."

This clearly indicates that the Lee group do not want the reconciliation and unity, peace and reunification between the north and the south but intend to keep to the road of confrontation with fellow countrymen and war of aggression against the north, clinging to the coattails of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their preoccupation is to offend and do harm to fellow countrymen at any cost. It is, therefore, the height of folly for them to call for \"dialogue.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The black-hearted intention of the Lee group and their wrong view on fellow countrymen go to prove that they have no will to truly have dialogue and cooperate with the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those going against the trend of the times are fated to meet self-destruction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group would be well advised to face up to the reality and behave themselves."
