The number of cases rapidly increased, reaching over 3,500 cases in April, 1951.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During the period the U.S. forces committed such bestial atrocities as spreading epidemic pathogens of hemorrhagic fever as well as smallpox.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At least 3 000 tests for germ weapons were made every day against POWs of the Korean People's Army at Boat 1091 led by the chief for hygiene and welfare of the \"UN Command\" anchoring in the waters off Wonsan on the East Sea of Korea and the waters off Koje Island in secrecy in March, 1951.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. committed the germ warfare on all areas of the northern half of Korea, entering 1952. Germ bombs were dropped over 169 areas of the northern half of Korea through a total of 804 raids, regardless of tablelands and coastal and mountainous areas, from early January to March, 1952.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The germ bombs which were dropped included lots of flies, fleas, spiders and other harmful insects with the most horrible malignant, acute and infectious disease-germs of more than 20 kinds. In May, 1952 the U.S. let hundreds of planes fly every day, one fourth of them  dropped  germ bombs and their number was nearly 480 one day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The number of planes involved in the germ warfare of the U.S. forces and areas over which they dropped germ bombs clearly indicate that this was the first largest germ warfare in the world war history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This was a wanton violation of the international convention on banning the use of toxic gas and germ weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A POW who took part in the germ warfare of the U.S. testified to his crime on April 13, 1952 that he was forced to serve war merchants and drop germ bombs, committing grave crimes against the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I had to obey orders as a soldier without fail and this order was issued by the imperialists in Wall Street.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A long period has passed since the ceasefire but evidence proving the U.S. germ and chemical warfare is found in different parts of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At least 40 explosives of various types including germ bomb with large infectious power were founded in a matter of a half year since the start of the project to reclaim Sepho tableland where a large-scale stockbreeding base is under construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. germ and chemical warfare can neither be distorted nor justified.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of traitors and colonial rabid dogs should be brought to a tribunal of history at an early date as they dare challenge the toughest offensive of the DPRK against the U.S. while shielding its germ warfare."
