This observation is made by Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This idea represents a revolutionary foreign policy tenet to defend Korean-style socialism centered on the popular masses and further glorify it. It is a noble idea common to humankind leading the world people to strengthen international solidarity and genuinely contribute to the accomplishment of  the cause of global independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Independence is what keeps a country and a nation alive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Just and equitable relations can be established between countries only when they are based on independence and these relations alone can truly contribute to the independent development of countries and the accomplishment of global independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK not only values its dignity and rights but respects other countries' independence and opposes any attempt and move to encroach upon their sovereignty and interests and interfere in others' internal affairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK is a peace-loving state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is entirely thanks to its efforts for peace that a war is averted and peace preserved on the Korean peninsula  despite increased tensions.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK has considered it as an important aim of its external activities to develop friendly relations with the peoples around the world and made every possible effort to this end.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All the anti-imperialist forces of the world for independence can certainly foil the imperialists' high-handed and arbitrary practice and moves for domination and successfully build a new independent and peaceful world only when they firmly unite and carry on their struggle in the idea of independence, peace and friendship. \r\n\r\n"

But, the country's reunification, the cherished desire of the nation, is bound to be achieved by the concerted efforts of the entire nation. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is aimed  to establish military domination over Asia and worldwide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   U.S. conservative hard-liners should face up to the reality and drop its improper attitude toward the DPRK. \r\n\r\n"

This means that it will not admit its legal responsibility for its past crimes and furthermore, ignore basic human morality and conscience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan's settlement of its past regarding the Korean A-bomb victims is not an issue which it may do or may not but it is an issue related to international law and moral obligation which the Japanese government should solve unconditionally in a responsible manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan should quickly respond to the DPRK's demand for the liquidation of its past crimes including the issue of Korean A-bomb victims free from its old way of thinking whereby it has sought its own interests and turned down the demands of the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese government should immediately make public all information about Korean A-bomb victims and officially express its will to make an apology and state compensation to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It should promptly render humanitarian assistance to the aged Korean A-bomb victims who are still undergoing serious physical and mental pain due to A-bomb disasters. \r\n\r\n"
