As a result, trade unions were organized in the railways, metal, machine-building  and all other industries and the factory committees formed at every factory and enterprise in a matter of three months. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The workers brought under their control all the industrial establishments which had been owned by the Japanese imperialists, comprador capitalists, pro-Japanese and traitors to the nation while smashing the maneuvers of the reactionaries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As a result, the provisional people's committee of North Korea promulgated the law on the nationalization of the major industries on August 10, 1946. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This marked a historical event which legally confirmed and consolidated the conversion of the ownership of all the major industries in Korea into all-people, state ownership.\r\n\r\n"
