He asked the manager and the secretary of the party committee of the plant to sing the song. He praised them for singing the song well, his face beaming with a broad smile. It was a good song as it reflected the spirit of the workers of the plant, he added. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe recalled that Kim Jong Il regarded the plant as important and showed particular loving care for it in his lifetime. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Jong Un praised the plant for conducting effective education of its employees in the leadership exploits of the great men of Mt. Paektu after building the revolutionary museum well. Noting that it is a good center for education, he said it stands out in a sharp contrast to the plant he criticized while visiting it a few days ago.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe dropped in at the products show hall to see machines manufactured by the plant and learn about the development of new type products. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe expressed satisfaction over the fact that the plant manufactured new modern machines of Korean style by its own efforts and with indigenous technology. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is good to have the spirit of buckling down to the work full of confidence, not disappointed in any difficulties, he said, asking what is necessary for the modernization of the plant. He took benevolent measures.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe went round the processing and assembling shops to learn in detail about production there. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt the processing shop, he praised the plant for keeping the production site neat and tidy. He was pleased to see varieties of machine parts being churned out from modern machines and presses standing in lines at the work sites. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter watching workers of the plant using a modern spinning machine presented to Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un as a gift, he appreciated the intense loyalty of its workers to the Party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt the assembling shop he encouraged the workers and technicians devoting their wisdom and enthusiasm to the production of machines. Walking a compound of the plant, he praised its workers for keeping their work sites neat and tidy. He called for intensifying the work to spruce up the inside of the plant like a palace and its outside like a park.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe made the round of the swimming pool and gymnasium newly built by the plant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe praised officials of the plant and a relevant field for having made devoted efforts to provide its workers with ample conditions for cultural rest.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"I am very pleased to see the modern swimming pool and gymnasium,\" he said, adding that the longer one watches the plant, the more it looks attractive.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGoing round the canteen in the compound and a bean processing factory, he learned about supply service.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt the dining room he was very pleased to hear that the plant has detailed plans for daily service, monthly special service, service to couples of innovators, service to mothers and service on birthdays and service is given according to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Stressing once again that supply service means a battle for defending socialism, he urged the officials to pay primary attention to the work for improving the standards of material and cultural life of the workers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"I am most pleased when I visit any plant which is successful in supply service,\" he added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe met with the labor innovators of the plant and had a photo session with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe watched a grand chorus \"Our Plant Shining with the Bloodline of Mt. Paektu\" presented by workers of the plant. He congratulated them on their successful performance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"I drew great strength while watching the performance. It helped me renew the resolution to more successfully make revolution with our reliable workers in the future,\" he noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe was accompanied by Choe Ryong Hae, Pak Thae Song, Kang Kwan Il, Hwang Pyong So, Hong Yong Chil, Yun Tong Hyon, Pak Jong Chon and Kim Thaek Gu and Ryu Yong Sop, chief secretary of the Jagang Provincial Committee of the WPK."

Korean Group for Kidnapping Citizens of DPRK\r\nPyongyang, June 21 (KCNA) -- The south Korean puppet forces have become all the more undisguised in their acts of alluring and abducting citizens of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\tRecently the puppet forces tried to let agents of the Intelligence Service and flesh traders allure and kidnap a dozen of youngsters of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was disclosed shortly ago that flesh traffickers tried to take away teenagers of the DPRK to south Korea. However, the \"Saenuri Party\" and other right-wing conservative forces of south Korea are taking issue with the DPRK over \"human rights abuse\". They have become busy protesting those countries which helped the return of the teenagers to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is a product of the sinister attempt to cover up the crime of kidnapping with the veil of \"human rights\" and fan up the frenzy for escalated confrontation with fellow countrymen in a worldwide scale.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe act of alluring and kidnapping citizens of the DPRK including teenagers is a hideous human rights abuse engineered by the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn fact, the U.S. administration and Congress solicited other regional countries for \"protection\", expressing their special concern over the abduction of young people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark Geun Hye, expressing regret over the failed abduction program, checked the whole process of the operation of alluring and kidnapping citizens of the DPRK in a \"crisis management room\" in the underground air-raid shelter of Chongwadae.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe puppet Intelligence Service has so far instigated criminal organizations specializing in the abduction to conduct vicious acts against the DPRK in China and other countries. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt painted criminal organizations as \"NGOs\" and veiled their anti-DPRK smear campaign with the words of \"human rights\" and \"humanitarianism\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAccording to the teenagers who came back to the embrace of the DPRK after being allured and kidnapped, flesh traders who were disguised as religionists held in a hide-out dozens of teenagers of the DPRK whom they kidnapped in the northern border of the DPRK and put them through religious education and brainwashing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll those youngsters were not normal in their mental and physical conditions as they had long been secluded from the outside world. However, the south Korean group trumpets about \"human rights abuses\" reminding one of a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe puppet group set afloat a bad rumor that the DPRK will execute or send to concentration camp those \"young defectors\" and talked such rubbish that \"the north should ensure the life and security of those taken to the north under escort\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is ludicrous for them to trumpet about \"human rights\" as they sought to sell off to the alien land children of tender age.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNot only those young returnees but even those who once deserted the homeland being taken in by the appeasement of the enemies are unanimous in their voices that only contempt and maltreatment await those who deserted hometown and homeland and that Korean-style socialism full of loving care and warm feelings is the best in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe more desperate the puppet group becomes in its moves for alluring and abducting citizens of the DPRK, the more clearly it will disclose its dirty nature as human rights criminal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe puppet group should immediately stop the unethical farce aimed to undermine the single-minded unity in the DPRK and tarnish the bright image of Korean-style socialism."

The transfer of the right to command wartime operation may lead to the dissolution of the south Korea-U.S. \"Combined Forces Command\" and the U.S. forces will lose the justification to remain in south Korea. Proceeding from this, the U.S. is mulling setting up a new war mechanism so-called \"combined field command\" to replace the \"Combined Forces Command\" in a bid to keep its forces in south Korea and put the puppet army under its control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe post of the command which the U.S. promised to bestow on the puppet forces is in name only. Such core elements as commanding right to information, operation and military supplies and tactical and commanding system are set to be controlled by the U.S. commander.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. is working to let the puppet forces hold the post of commander and instead impose lots of burdens to bear on them as it is suffering from unprecedented serious financial crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the meantime, the puppet forces have been intent on keeping the U.S. forces in south Korea while offering a large amount of fund in a bid to do harm to fellow countrymen with their help.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. and the puppet forces' efforts to establish the new war mechanism is exactly aimed to serve these interests."
