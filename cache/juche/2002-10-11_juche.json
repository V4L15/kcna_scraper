            "content": "KCNA accuses Chosun Ilbo of its sycophantic and treacherous nature \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 11 (KCNA) -- The despicable sycophantic and treacherous nature of the South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo has been brought to light again.\r\n As already reported, James Kelly visited the DPRK from Oct. 3 to 5 in the capacity of a special envoy of the U.S. President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The special envoy's explanation made it clear that the U.S. is working hard to bring the DPRK to its knees by force and highhanded practice, not wanting dialogue with the latter. The DPRK clarified to the envoy its principled stand towards such position before his departure from here. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, Chosun Ilbo made such servile flattery as zealously supporting U.S. arrogant unilateralism. It described the DPRK just stand to defend the dignity and sovereignty of the nation as a \"brinkmanship\" and \"a manifestation of its ignorance of the present international situation led by the Bush administration.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What Choson Ilbo said in its editorial is nothing but sophism which echoed the U.S.-style logic that the relations between the DPRK and the U.S, between the DPRK and Japan and between  the north and south of Korea may improve smoothly only when the DPRK first accepts the U.S. unilateral demand for solutions to the issues of nuclear, missile and conventional armed forces and \"human rights issue\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such remarks can be made only by the foolish and despicable sycophantic traitors who do not know even the elementary principle that inter-state dialogue should be held on the principle of impartiality and equality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is universally known that the \"issues of concern\" peddled by the U.S. are a product of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK. Such \"issues of concern\" will be settled of their own accord when friendly relations are established between the DPRK and the U.S. on the basis of mutual confidence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The hostile policy escalated by the U.S. toward the DPRK after listing the DPRK as part of the \"axis of evil\" and singling out it as a target of nuclear preemptive attack is the main issue of concern that may aggravate the military situation on the Korean Peninsula and the biggest obstacle lying in the way of improving the DPRK-U.S. relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The international community and the unbiased public opinion are unanimous in terming the Bush administration's hostile policy toward the DPRK anachronistic and progressive intellectuals in the U.S. contend that \"it is not North Korea but the U.S. which should undergo a change\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is only Chosun Ilbo that can echo a spate of outbursts to be let loose by stooges of foreign forces who, steeped in the flunkeyist and treacherous idea to the marrow of their bones, lend no ear to the unanimous contention and estimation of the public opinion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The main aim sought by Chosun Ilbo in extolling the U.S. high-handed policy is to list the compatriots in the north as members of the \"axis of evil\" in a bid to torpedo the processes of improving the relations between the DPRK and the U.S. and achieving the north-south reconciliation and perpetuate the national division and thus prolong its remaining days as a sycophantic country-selling newspaper. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are media speaking for the \"right wing\" by itself and representing particular political forces in the press circle of the world. But there is no newspaper which has so completely betrayed the nation and has been so totally reduced to a political maid of foreign forces as Chosun Ilbo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is by no means fortuitous that South Korean media and intellectuals termed Chosun Ilbo a \"newspaper for the Bush government bereft of reason\" and a \"'newspaper' informing its master of everything.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The group of hack journalists of Chosun Ilbo are bound to meet self-destruction for their unpardonable flunkeyist and traitorous acts.    \r\n\r\n"
