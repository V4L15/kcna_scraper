            "content": "S. Korea, Hotbed of Nuclear Proliferation and Source of Nuclear War: KANPC\r\n Pyongyang, March 14 (KCNA) -- The Korean Anti-Nuke Peace Committee Wednesday released a white paper to disclose the crimes the U.S. and south Korean authorities perpetrated by turning south Korea into the world's worst hotbed of nuclear proliferation, fraught with the biggest danger of a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t The white paper, released in connection with the \"Nuclear Security Summit\" to be held in south Korea on March 26 and 27, said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nukes have been shipped into south Korea since 1950.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From late in the 1950s the U.S. has shipped into south Korea Honest John tactical nuclear missiles, 280mm atomic artillery pieces, \"B-61\" nuclear bombs, etc. nonstop.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. shipment and deployment of nuclear weapons in south Korea steadily increased, bringing their number to over 1,000 in the 1970s and at least 1,720 in the 1990s. South Korea tops the world list in the density of their deployment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"map on the nuclear shipment and deployment by U.S. forces in south Korea\" submitted to the south Korean puppet \"National Assembly\" on October 9, 2005 says that nukes are stockpiled not only in Chunchon, south Korean Kangwon Province, Osan of Kyonggi Province but also in Seoul, Taejon, Pusan, Taegu, Kwangju and other main cities. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A confidential document of the U.S. forces declassified in December 2010 says that nukes had been deployed in the U.S. military base in Chunchon until April 2005. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is a nuclear arsenal extending 8km underground called \"farm\" in the U.S. military base in Kunsan of North Jolla Province and similar \"farms\" are still under construction one after another. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has stockpiled 2.74 millions depleted uranium bombs in its military bases in Suwon and Osan of Kyonggi Province, Chongju of North Chungchong Province and other parts of south Korea. This is 3.5 times the number of depleted uranium bombs used by the U.S. Air Force during the Gulfs War in 1991. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea also serves as a nuclear weapons arsenal for the U.S. forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has staged various war exercises for invading the north in south Korea since late in the 1950s, massively bringing a lot of nuclear attack means including super-large nuclear carriers, aegis cruisers and nuclear submarines. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. introduced into south Korea \"F-15E\" and \"F-16\" nuclear-capable fighter bombers every year in the form of rotation deployment. In last December and January this year it additionally introduced 24 fighter bombers \"F-16CM\" and \"F-16C\" into its base in Kunsan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The white paper notes that south Korea is the area where nuclear control is most fragile, adding that the U.S. is conniving at south Korean puppet forces' development of nuclear weapons, though it is aware of it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. also shuts its eyes to the south Korean puppet forces' extraction of fuel for nuclear weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There were traces of extracting plutonium from nuclear reactors in south Korea in 1998 and 2003, but the U.S. pretended ignorance of the fact and covered it up.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet forces have systematically stockpiled the spent fuel from the reactors underwater, keeping as many as 5 982 metric tons in December 2002.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This amount is enough to extract 36 metric tons of weapon-grade plutonium and is sufficient to produce at least 3,000 A-bombs similar to the one dropped over Nagasaki of Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is zealously backing south Korea not only in producing nuclear fuel but in acquiring the technology of manufacturing nukes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It let an American company to conclude a contract with south Korea on the introduction of the technology of fast breeder reactor and provide help to it in 1982 while the Combustion Engineering Corporation delivered to it 201 pieces of technical data on designing, mock test and development of A-bombs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is also helping south Korea have access to nuclear delivery means.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It delivered nuclear-capable \"Honest John\", \"Nike Hercules\" and \"Hawk\" missiles to the puppet army in the 1970s. It also signed an \"agreement on missiles\" with south Korea in 1979, paving the way for developing missiles. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nuclear experts of south Korea blustered that it is the tenth in the world in the capability to manufacture nuclear weapons: three months are enough to produce one nuclear weapon and the technology of extracting enriched uranium has reached \"the world's level\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea is the most dangerous source of a nuclear war, the white paper points out, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean Peninsula is the most dangerous region in the world as the U.S. had already designated it as the next target of nuclear strike since it dropped A-bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and its plan remains unchanged.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea serves as an advance base for carrying out the U.S. scenario for the next nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The then U.S. President Truman said at a news conference in November 1950 that the use of A-bombs in the Korean war was under earnest examination. The then Commander of the U.S Forces in the Far East MacArthur in December 1950 blackmailed the DPRK with nukes, saying the U.S. was planning to drop 30-50 A-bombs in the areas of the north bordering on China.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. examined its nuclear attack on the DPRK when its armed spy ship \"Pueblo\" was captured in January 1968 while illegally intruding into the DPRK's territorial waters and when its spy plane EC-121 was shot down in April 1969.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. moves to provoke a nuclear war against the DPRK got evermore undisguised through Team Spirit joint military exercises staged by the U.S. with the puppet army of south Korea every year since 1976.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework concluded in Geneva in October 1994 the U.S. committed itself to end its nuclear blackmail against the DPRK but it went ahead with drills for nuclear attack in the subsequent period, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The danger of the U.S. provocation of a nuclear war against the DPRK has become more potential since the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors came to power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If such nuclear war-maniacs host what it called \"Nuclear Security Summit\", it will turn out to be no more than a confab for justifying their moves to launch a nuclear war and hurling the U.S. allies into the another Korean war in contingency, concludes the white paper."

The U.S. seeks to use the rest of its Marines in Okinawa in a cyclic way after deploying them in other Asian regions including south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Wednesday in a bylined article observes in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The confirmation of the basic policy is a proof that the U.S. Asia-Pacific strategy has entered the phase of practical implementation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Citing the theory of \"Pacific State\", the U.S. is thinking of giving stronger impact on the Asia-Pacific region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It regards the establishment of its domination in Northeast Asia as the core in its Asia-Pacific strategy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. gives top priority to the Korean Peninsula because it thinks it can realize its ambition of dominating the continent of Eurasia and, furthermore, the whole world only when it occupies the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has thus directed its efforts to tightening the military alliance with Japan rich in the experience of war of aggression, and south Korea, its lackey.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. attempts to use Guam Island and Okinawa as strongholds for fighting a war against the DPRK in case of \"emergency\" on the Korean Peninsula. Its ulterior aim is to amass aggression forces in areas close to the Korean Peninsula and use them in the second Korean War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., giving priority to Japan's role in carrying out its strategy toward the Asia-Pacific region, is giving a shot in the arm of Japan, which is mired in serious political crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With south Korea as a military strategic stronghold the U.S. seeks to attack the DPRK and dominate by force the Asia-Pacific region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The coiled up tension on the Korean Peninsula will result in the escalation of tension in the Asia-Pacific region while the increasing danger of war on the Peninsula in the mounting danger of war in the region."
