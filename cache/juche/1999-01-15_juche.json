The U.S. military monopolies and their spokesman hard-line conservative forces  consider this to be developments contradictory to their interests.\r\n   Especially, the hard-line conservative forces in the U.S. congress steadily mounted pressure last year to turn foreign policy  into tough one in the wake of the sex scandal of the Clinton administration and set the time limit for a  political gamble this year. \r\n   Their objective is to worsen the situation of the world, northeast Asia in particular, proliferate a hotspot and collect bloody dollars, in a word, to give a boom to the U.S. military conglomerates in the crisis.\r\n   To get a thick bundle of banknotes here it is imperative to subordinate Japan's satellite development and the establishment of the Theatre Missile Defense system to the United States. \r\n   To this end the United States is seeking to make \"threat\" by someone  a fait accompli.\r\n   That is why Cohen gave a hint that one of the important contents of talks in Japan is \"to establish the defense system to provide against a possible missile attack from North Korea.\"\r\n   We will keep a good watch over the future trip and remarks of Cohen and will never pardon any encroachment upon our sovereignty. \r\n  \r\n"

In this \"declaration,\" the U.S.-Japan \"security\" cooperation is expanded to surrounding areas from \"defense of Japan\".\r\n   According to it, the new \"guidelines for U.S.-Japan defense cooperation\" were worked out with emphasis laid on \"deterring\"  and putting down  \"emergency\" which may occur around Japan.\r\n   It is ridiculous of the Japanese reactionaries to cry that the DPRK has a \"plan to develop nuclear weapons.\"\r\n   The DPRK is exposed to nuclear threats posed by the U.S. and Japan.\r\n   The new \"guidelines\"  were jointly worked out by the U.S. and Japan for aggression on and military interference in Asia.\r\n   The U.S. and Japan  are going to realise their ambition to dominate Asia, the former using the strength of the latter and the latter taking the former's aggressive chariot.\r\n   A signed commentary of Minju Joson notes: The Japanese reactionaries  plan to start their overseas aggression in Korea, unreasonably heaping  slanders at the DPRK.
