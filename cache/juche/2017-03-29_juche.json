Clear is its ulterior design.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has worked hard to justify the war rehearsals, talking about their transparency, but it is no more than a paradox.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its trumpeting about transparency is just outbursts of a gangster to commit robbery in broad daylight.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the strategic depth of the DPRK is not big, the only way to defend itself from the sudden preemptive attack from the U.S. modern strategic assets and special warfare units is just to mount a resolute preemptive attack.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In case a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula, the U.S. will be held wholly accountable for it, no matter who will launch a preemptive attack, as it is causing trouble by bringing lots of nuclear strategic assets and special warfare means, not content with persisting in its hostile policy toward the DPRK."

Then, they pressurized the Society for World Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) headquartered in Belgium into terminating its financial communication service to the banks of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. House of Representatives produced a \"bill on escalating sanctions with respect to transactions with North Korea\" after modifying and supplementing the \"North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016.\" It has gone the lengths of crying out for independent sanctions against banks and businesses of other countries dealing with the DPRK after inventing absurd pretexts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent racket kicked up by the U.S.-led hostile forces to tighten financial sanctions against the DPRK is no more than a stopgap measure of those being driven into a tight corner in the political and military standoff with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A step was taken by SWIFT to ban its communication with the banks of the DPRK but the banks of the DPRK have not dealt with the SWIFT since a long time ago in actuality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As for the farce staged by the International Financial Supervisory Body to re-list the DPRK as a \"target of countermeasure\", it is just an unfair one taken under pressure from the U.S., as repeatedly clarified by the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is doing its best after establishing the system of anti-money laundering and combating financing of terrorism in accordance with international standard.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The independent sanctions the U.S. claims slapping against other countries dealing with the DPRK are also being opposed worldwide as an impudent act of wantonly violating international law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts go to clearly prove that the frantic racket of the U.S. is aimed to tarnish the international image of the DPRK and stir up the international atmosphere of ratcheting up sanctions and pressure upon it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The whole gamut of base actions the U.S. and its vassal forces are running to deprive the DPRK of its nuclear weapons under the pretexts of UN sanctions and independent sanctions would only result in bringing into bolder relief the unreasonable and immoral nature of the sanctions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They can never check the advance of the DPRK accelerating the building of a socialist power under the unfurled banner of self-reliance and self-development, firmly holding the nuclear deterrent, a treasured sword of victory."

It serves as tremendous muscle for defending peace in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When World War II was over the U.S. exercised its authority to beat its rival in any matter with an unchallenged right to decide worldwide, but the world political structure and the balance of forces have changed at present.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A report published by the U.S. Centre for Strategic and International Studies on January 19, 2016 said that the balance of forces in Asia is steadily changing in the direction of running counter to the interests of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This reflects the policy stand of the U.S. displeased with the present timetable for executing its strategy for dominating Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The commander-in-chief of the U.S. Forces in the Pacific recently underlined the need for the U.S. to maintain the strongest military muscle to counter any country in the areas under its control covering 52 percent of surface of the earth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. recently hurled its F-35B and F-22 Raptor stealth fighters into its bases in Yamaguchi and Okinawa of Japan from its mainland. It staged a precision air raid drill under the simulated conditions of striking pivotal areas of the DPRK with F-35Bs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is confirming the possibility of an actual war involving a \"beheading operation\" aimed at \"bringing down the social system\" of the DPRK and a preemptive strike operation targeting the nuclear means of the DPRK through the largest-ever Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military drills.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an escalation of the U.S. moves for a nuclear war to stifle the DPRK at any cost and contain the regional big powers by force of arms and a vivid manifestation of its scenario to dominate the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Big powers are to blame for the escalating tensions in Northeast Asia as they are making no scruple of creating the danger of serious armed clashes for hegemony after expanding the sphere of their interests far beyond the purpose of defending their sovereignty. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t U.S. Secretary of State Tillerson admitted during his trips to East Asian countries that the policy pursued by the U.S. toward the DPRK for the past 20 years went belly-up.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is by no means fortuitous that world media are warning the U.S. not to make any more mistakes if it came to know that its DPRK policy was wrongly-guided.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The stability on the Korean peninsula is directly linked to the security not only in Northeast Asia but also in the Asia-Pacific.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The position of the DPRK as a nuclear power in the East has grown stronger and the strategic structure of the relations among its neighboring countries began to undergo a fundamental change.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nukes which the DPRK was compelled to possess for self-defence are preserving peace, stability and prosperity not only of a country or a nation but of the region and the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nukes of the DPRK are different from the ones of big powers for aggression and intervention.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All military steps taken by the DPRK are an entirely legitimate exercise of its right to self-defence to cope with the brigandish nuclear blackmail and threat from the U.S. and its vassal forces and their moves to isolate and strangulate the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Justice and truth, equality and respect are now gradually disappearing in the world political arena, but injustice, high-handed and arbitrary practices are prevailing. Some big powers are closeted to conspire against other countries to seek their interests in disregard of the most elementary principles specified by humankind with common agreement. Such situation should never be tolerated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There are the forces faulting the nuclear deterrent of the DPRK for self-defence and seeking to fish in the troubled waters by sacrificing the Korean nation while kowtowing to the U.S. keen to dominate the world after occupying the whole of the Korean peninsula, a strategic vantage point. They should behave themselves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The viewpoint on the geopolitical position of the Korean peninsula should undergo a due change as required by the strategic position of the DPRK that has ranked itself among the advanced nuclear powers and the developing trend of the times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The countries, failing to take a responsible option in dealing with the Korean issue and vacillating with a short-sighted view, will clearly see how the DPRK will set right the international justice and principle in the future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Sacred is the strength of the guardian preserving the  dignity of the country, security of the region and global peace with treasured sword of nuclear deterrent for justice and ever-lasting is the truth of the cause of Juche Korea that had access to nukes."

Then on June 25, it provoked the Korean War without declaration of it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On the eve of the Iraqi war in the new century, the U.S. conducted smear propaganda campaign against Iraq 17 hours a day at five different frequencies for the purpose of weakening the will of resistance among the army and people of Iraq and creating illusion about the U.S. military among them. After that it started a war through preemptive attack by cruise missiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The deception of the rhetoric about \"exclusion of preemptive attack\" made by the U.S. is proven with added clarity through the contents of the military operations pursued by the empire of evil against the DPRK, and performance and deployment of strike means.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now the U.S. is carrying out Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military exercises under the scenario of preemptive strike like OPLAN 5015 and OPLAN 4D targeting \"precision strike\" at key strategic strongholds including the supreme headquarters and nuclear and missile bases in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are openly describing the nuclear strategic assets involved in the exercises as \"ideal preemptive strike means\" and are unhesitatingly carrying out \"special operation\" drills targeting the headquarters of the Korean revolution by setting in motion heinous group of murderers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An assertion that preemptive attack has to be pushed forward in secrecy is heard from the U.S. policy-makers, a clear proof that the U.S. ambition to stifle the DPRK and its strategy for a preemptive attack remain unchanged and that the story now afloat is a prelude to an armed invasion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is seriously mistaken if it thinks it can shake the will of retaliation of the army and people of the DPRK through such a trite trick and deceive the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The powerful revolutionary Paektusan army is closely following the every move of the hostile forces after putting the strongholds of aggression and provocation within the optical sight of its nuclear weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the slightest sign of preemptive attack on the DPRK is detected, the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK will punish the enemies with powerful preemptive nuclear strikes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should clearly understand the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by the reckless attempt at preemptive strike and behave with discretion."

On the contrary, it suffered bitter shame in the eyes of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The same is true of the south Korean puppet forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They have gone wild as a shock force in the U.S. campaign for escalating sanctions and pressure on the DPRK like a blind pony. This, however, has got them nowhere.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean group of traitors blustered quite often that it is a matter of time for \"the north to collapse\". But it was the Park Geun Hye regime that collapsed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After all, their sanctions and pressure on the DPRK ended in tightening the noose around their necks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Obama administration's \"strategic patience\" policy for the \"north's dismantlement of its nukes\" and the Park Geun Hye regime's \"confidence-building process\" aimed to lead the DPRK to \"changes and collapse of social system\" met final setbacks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. and the south Korean puppet authorities ratchet up sanctions and pressure upon the DPRK, persistently clinging to the hostile policy, this will only entail tragic consequences of precipitating their miserable end."
