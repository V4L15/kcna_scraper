            "content": "KCNA Blasts Japan's Financial Sanctions against DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 23 (KCNA) -- The Japanese Cabinet in its meeting held on September 19 approved the application of \"financial sanctions\" against the DPRK.\r\n This action calling for suspending the remittance and freezing assets targets 15 enterprises and corporations related to the DPRK. It was taken in the wake of the prohibition of the entry of the DPRK liner Mangyongbong-92 into Japanese ports.\r\n Japan declared sanctions against more financial institutions and corporations of the DPRK, plus those against which the United States designated as targets of its sanctions. Such shrewd attitude of Japan cannot but arouse the concern of the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Why is Japan becoming so zealous in the sanctions against the DPRK?\r\n The financial sanctions taken by Japan against the DPRK can not be construed otherwise than a politically motivated charade intended to please its American master, pursuant to Washington's hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The undisguised actions taken by the Japanese reactionaries in a bid to tighten their sanctions against the DPRK are no more than reckless and provocative acts of leading the DPRK-Japan relations to a more serious phase of confrontation in wanton violation of the spirit and principles of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration.\r\n Japan is blindly copying whatever policy of the U.S. It is keen to fish in troubled waters both in political and military aspects, backed by the U.S. \r\n Such behavior of Japan would only result in straining the situation on the Korean Peninsula and the rest of the Asia-Pacific. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is well known that Japan considers itself as part of the U.S. So, its racket of sanctions is nothing surprising for the DPRK and it does not feel any need to deal with it as a separate issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is ridiculous for Japan to talk about playing a \"responsible role in the international community\" and \"its contribution\" as it is unashamed of being a waiting maid for the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will not remain a passive on-looker to the provocative and despicable behavior of Japan but continue taking necessary counter-measures.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun Sunday says this in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people's faith in socialism is, first of all, based on the absolute belief in the validity of the ideas and line of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The course in which the Korean people won great victories in the confrontation with the United States and brought about signal changes in building a great prosperous powerful nation under the great banner of Songun during the \"Arduous March\", the forced march, firmly convinced them that his ideas and policies serve as the most powerful weapon for accomplishing the cause of socialism of Korean style.\r\n It has become a deep-rooted trait of the army and people of the DPRK to devotedly implement his ideas and intention, regarding his revolutionary ideas as their maxim of struggle and life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people's faith in socialism is also based on the undisputed conviction of the advantages of the Korean-style socialist system holding him in high esteem as their father. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Benevolent social policies such as free education and free medical service were invariably enforced and a dynamic work was conducted to improve the standard of the people's living and enhance the level of cultural and emotional life of the working people at the state expense in so difficult time of the country as the period of the \"Arduous March\", the forced march. This was possible only under the socialist system in Korea. Our society is like a large family as all its members help and lead each other forward on the basis of collectivism. People's beautiful traits of devoting themselves to society and the collective and revolutionary comrades prevail in the society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people's faith in socialism is also based on the unshakable conviction that they are always sure to triumph under the leadership of Kim Jong Il.\r\n They experienced the great heyday in the era of the Workers' Party in the 1970s and 1980s and a shining victory in defending socialism in the 1990s under his leadership. They also witnessed the stirring reality in which the country made a leap forward toward the eminence of a great prosperous powerful nation despite the worst adversity which might force others to collapse. Kim Jong Il has brought about great victories and tremendous changes in all fields, political, military, economic and cultural with his matchless grit, pluck, extraordinary stratagem and revolutionary sweep, shattering every move of the U.S. imperialists and reactionaries against the DPRK. The dawn of a great prosperous powerful nation is breaking in the DPRK thanks to his wise guidance. This stirring reality is reinforcing the Korean people's conviction that the cause of socialism of Korean style is sure to triumph in the future.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Independence against imperialism is a guarantee for the triumphant advance of the NAM. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unity and solidarity of the NAM is an important matter for the NAM in accomplishing the global cause of independence, keeping and strengthening its existence in the international relations in the present century when the process of multi-polorization is making headway. Only when the NAM goes united, can one say that the NAM represents the South, can NAM expect its voice to be respected and can it demonstrate its might. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The non-aligned countries should firmly unite and solidarize with one another politically, cooperate and exchange with one another economically and technologically on the principle of independence. The only way of achieving independent development and social and economic progress, free from the economic domination and plunder by the imperialists is to expand the south-south cooperation based on the collective self-reliance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is important to resolutely reject the double standards applied by the imperialists in the international relations and strictly preserve the principle of equality and impartiality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the non-aligned countries fail to pay due attention to the injustice and consequences of the application of double standards in the international relations and collectively reject them, this will allow the imperialists to become more arrogant and upset the international justice and impartiality and gravely threaten peace and security of the world. The number of the NAM member states grew to 118 this time. This proves the attraction of the NAM and its strengthening and development. \r\n The ideal and aim of the NAM are just and its prospect is bright. No moves to keep the outdated order of domination and subjugation can block the advance of the NAM toward independence against imperialism.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It goes on:\r\n Any concession in the revolutionary principle means surrender and death. Had some countries which advocated socialism in the past remained true to the revolutionary principle, there would not have been such tragic events as the breakdown of ruling parties, collapse of socialism and the yielding to the imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What happened in Iraq clearly shows what disastrous consequences are entailed by any act of abandoning the revolutionary principle. The imperialists resort to more vicious and cunning methods in order to invade and plunder other countries and nations. Without a struggle against imperialism, is it impossible to achieve and defend and consolidate the national independence, establish an independent regime and adopt and implement any line and policy in keeping with the desire and will of the people and to ensure the independent development of country and national prosperity. Confrontation with the imperialists is unavoidable unless they abandon their aggressive and predatory nature. So, there will be no other way but to stand firm against them without any concession or retreat. The stronger pressure the imperialists put, the more resolutely each country and nation should meet them, without being frightened or stepping back. Only by doing so, it is possible to win in the standoff\r\n  with the imperialists. This is immutable truth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Imperialism is by no means strong. One should never get frightened by the desperate efforts made by the imperialists on the verge of ruin. Victory is always in store for those countries and nations resolutely fighting against imperialism.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
