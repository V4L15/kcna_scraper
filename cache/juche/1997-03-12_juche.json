Korea\r\n   Pyongyang, March 12 (KCNA) -- The national alliance for \r\ndemocracy  and reunification in a statement Sunday branded \r\nthe \"reamendment of labour laws\" agreed by the ruling and \r\nopposition parties of south Korea as the second \r\nretrogressive revision and declared it cannot accept it, \r\naccording to a radio report from Seoul.\r\n   The organisation said that the \"reamendment\" in which \r\n\"flexible working hours\", \"layoff\" and other poisonous \r\narticles are not struck out is the outcome of political \r\nnetogotiations ignoring the opinion of the people.
