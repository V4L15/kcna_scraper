Through a vigorous campaign the members of the shock brigade have achieved successes in the work to forecast yellow sand phenomenon and clearly indicate the areas where dust storms are expected to come from and the course of their movement and the scientific researches to minimize damage.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The public health organs at all levels are conducting diverse activities to explain the adverse influence of yellow sand upon the people's health. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, measures are being taken to treat on time bronchial, eye, skin and other diseases to be caused by yellow sand storms and medical examination and preventive treatment are also intensified. All the people are urged to wear masks and sun glasses and other things to protect themselves from dust storm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Different fields of the national economy are making preparations to protect themselves from dust storm and taking effective measures to recover from its aftermath. People are all out in this campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A special attention is being paid to the work to protect people's health, crops, domestic animals, and precision equipment, apparatuses, reagent, electronic and automatic devices of scientific research organs and various types of vehicles from dust storm.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 28 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Democratic Workers' Party of south Korea on Mar. 24 called for strongly reacting against Japan's moves to grab Tok Islet through international solidarity actions, according to south Korean MBC.\r\n He held that the dispute over Tok Islet should not be regarded as a mere issue of territorial claim but should be oriented to the issue of achieving peace in Northeast Asia and forcing Japan to make an apology and compensation for its war crimes in the past.\r\n He underscored the need to build up a strong world public opinion opposing Japan's pitch for the permanent membership of the UNSC and escalate the campaign against this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, a meeting of the people in Ulung County denouncing Japan's moves to grab Tok Islet was held at Todonghang Square on Ulung Island on the same day with an attendance of at least 1,000 people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A protest statement addressed to the Japanese government was read out at the meeting. It claimed that Tok Islet belongs to the territory of Korea in every respect from the historical point of view and in the light of international law. It demanded Japan retract at once \"Takeshima Day\" instituted by the Shimane Prefectural Assembly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Charging that due to the south Korean government's lukewarm attitude, Japan's ambition to grab Tok Islet has become evermore undisguised, the meeting urged the government to strongly react against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The participants wrote in blood words evincing their resolution to defend Tok Islet and had close haircutting. They burned the Japanese flag and the chairman of the Shimane Prefectural Assembly of Japan in effigies in token of their protest.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's Claim to Tok Islet Slammed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 28 (KCNA) -- The History Institute of the Academy of Social Sciences of the DPRK Saturday issued a lengthy memorandum as regards Japan's evermore undisguised moves to grab Tok Islet.\r\n It once again proved that the islet is part of the inalienable territory of Korea and laid bare the criminal acts committed by the Japanese imperialists to seize it in the past and the shameless and aggressive nature of Japan's present \"claim\" to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to it, it was Korea that discovered the islet and put it under its jurisdiction for the first time and Korea was the first to reconfirm dominion over the islet as required by the modern law and declare it at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There was Usan State on Ullung Islet in the East Sea of Korea in the early 6th century which was built by Koreans. It was peacefully attached to Silla by Isabu who was governor of Hasulla sub-county in 512, the 13th year of King Jijung of Silla. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The geography book of Sejong True Records said that two islets of Usan and Murung were called Usan State at the time of Silla. Mangi Handbook compiled in the early 19th century noted that according to the geography book, Ullung and Usan belong to  the land of Usan State and Usan  means Tok Islet but Japanese call it Song Islet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Government of the Ri Dynasty promoted Ullung Islet to Uldo County in 1900 and put Tok Islet (Stone Islet) under its jurisdiction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As Usan State comprising Usan Islet (Tok Islet) and Ullung Islet was attached to Silla,   Korea put the ownerless islet under its control in 512 according to one of the basic principles of territorial acquisition stipulated in international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Tok Islet has been controlled by the successive Korean governments as part of its inseparable territory. Korea has never given up its  dominion over it since it was attached to Silla in 512. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Government of the Ri Dynasty, on the basis of such tradition, promulgated royal ordinance No. 41 on October 25, 1900, in order to reconfirm its dominion over Tok Islet as required by modern international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Strong evidence proving Japan's recognition of Korea's dominion over Juk Islet and another one, that is, Ullung Islet and Tok Islet, is a decision made by Japan's shogunate in January 1696 and an instruction issued by its Cabinet in March 1877. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In 1877 the Japanese Ministry of Interior examined for five months the issue of \"Juk Islet and another one\" which was raised by Shimane Prefecture as regards the nationwide land survey and reported its results to the then Cabinet. Tomomi Iwakura, acting Cabinet minister, on its basis, prepared an instruction that Juk Islet (Ullung Islet) and another islet  (Song Islet, Tok Islet) are to be understood as not belonging  to the territory of Japan on March 20 in the same year and issued it to the Ministry of Interior and Shimane Prefecture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As seen above, Tok Islet is part of the inalienable territory of Korea as the successive governments of Japan officially admitted Korea's dominion over it several times and Japan was the first to officially recognize Korea's dominion over it internationally in those days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"annexation of Tok Islet to Shimane Prefecture\" in February 1905 was a product of fraud, swindle and intrigues perpetrated by the Japanese imperialists to implement their policy of occupying Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the brigandish decision of the Japanese Cabinet on January 28, 1905, the Shimane Prefectural Office faked up \"Shimane Prefectural Notice\" No. 40 dated February 22 in which it declared that the islet 85 miles northwest from Oki Islet that lies 37 degrees 9' 30\" north latitude and 131 degrees 55' east longitude will be called Juk Islet and it will come under the control of the governor of Oki Islet belonging to the prefecture from that day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Shimane Prefectural Notice\" No. 40 is a false document saturated with fraud and swindle in view of the procedures to work out a notice and the method of notifying it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan neither made any prior consultation with any countries, to say nothing of the Government of the Ri Dynasty, its neighbor, as regards \"the annexation of Tok Islet\" nor informed them of this later. It only let a prefectural newspaper carry the notice and the local paper Sanin Shimbun give small publicity to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan was so cunning as to let the governor of Oki Islet and his party inspect Tok Islet on March 28, 1906, one year since \"it was attached to Shimane prefecture,\" in the period when no country made any protest against the seizure of Tok Islet four months after it fabricated the \"Ulsa Five-Point Treaty\" and reduced Korea to its colony. Moreover, it instructed them to inform on their way of return trip Sim Hung Thaek, governor of Ullung, that they came to the islet as Tok Islet became part of the territory of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Government of the Ri Dynasty did not lodge any formal protest with the Japanese government against this because it was deprived of the diplomatic right by Japan, and big powers did not express different opinions because they did not know about the annexation of the islet to Japan at all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fact that \"Shimane Prefectural Notice\" is an illegal and invalid false document is well illustrated by the fact that international conventions including the Cairo Declaration (December 1, 1943) and the Potsdam Declaration (July 26, 1945), which called for settling the issue of Japan's territory after the war, defined Tok Islet as an object Japan should abandon and stipulated that the islet shall belong to Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is preposterous, indeed, for the Japanese reactionaries to assert that the world public admitted Japan's claim to Tok Islet over its omission in the part dealing with Japan's abandonment of territory  in \"San Francisco peace treaty with Japan\" (September 8, 1951). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of Tok Islet is not an issue of territorial dispute. Korea's dominion over it is nothing doubtful in view of history and international law and there is not any pending issue as regards this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What Japan seeks in its \"claim to Tok Islet\" is to put under its control rich marine resources and inexhaustible seabed resources in the waters of the islet to have an unchallenged monopoly on the economic interests and, furthermore, use it as an outpost and a military bridgeboard to realize its territorial ambition and attempt at staging a comeback to Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries, obsessed by the militarist ambition, singled out Korea as the first target of their overseas aggression and are dreaming of dominating Asia once again by advancing into the continent with Korea as a springboard. Such shameless \"claim to Tok Islet\" in the wake of their distortion of the criminal history of the colonial rule in the past and their persistent refusal to settle Japan's past is a provocative move to realize their ambition for reinvasion of Korea and a grave encroachment upon the dignity and sovereignty of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  That is why the Japanese reactionaries seek to make an effective use of the issue of Tok Islet as leverage for instilling into the youngsters and other Japanese contempt of the Korean nation, \"superiority\" of the Yamato nation and militarist idea and veering Japan to the Right and militarizing it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  They would be well advised to discard their anachronistic delusion and drop at once the shameless \"claim to Tok Islet\" and the ordinance on instituting the \"Takeshima (Tok Islet) Day\". They had better stop acting rashly, properly understanding the steadfast will of the Korean nation to force Japan to pay for its century-long crime-woven history at any cost this year, 60 years since the defeat of the Japanese imperialists.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Flayed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 28 (KCNA) -- Foal Eagle and RSOI joint military exercises staged by the U.S. bellicose elements in south Korea were in every respect a military adventure perpetrated to launch military intervention not only against the DPRK but against other countries in the Asia-Pacific region.\r\nRodong Sinmun Monday says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These exercises were staged at a time when the moves had been stepped up to reorganize the U.S. troops in south Korea into \"task forces operating in the wide region.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Having chosen the strategy of preemptive attack as the U.S. military doctrine, the U.S. bellicose elements seek to reorganize the U.S. troops in south Korea into the above-said forces aimed at mounting a preemptive attack on the DPRK and maintaining military supremacy in the Asia-Pacific region and thus using them as forces for aggressive preemptive attack to pressurize and contain the countries around Korea by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Precisely for this reason they are massively shipping latest war equipment capable of conducting long-range operations and making long-range strikes into south Korea and areas around it while further tightening the military alliance between the U.S. and south Korea and between the U.S. and Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe U.S. reckless and undisguised policy aimed at military domination and its military exercises are seriously threatening peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia and extremely straining the situation there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these facts clearly prove that the United States is chiefly to blame for the mounting tensions on the Korean peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But for the U.S. military occupation of south Korea, its arms build-up and threat of nuclear preemptive attack, the nuclear issue would have not surfaced on the Korean peninsula, the political structure in Northeast Asia would not have become complicated nor would the situation have become so tense as today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose elements should give up their ambition to stifle the DPRK by force and stop seeking criminal military domination over the Asia-Pacific region.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It doubles the crossing speed of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves and promotes rejuvenation and normalization of all the nerve cells. It, therefore, is efficacious for all nervous diseases including neuroparalysis and neurological disorder. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It simply removes affection by geomagnetism and computer and mental and physical stress and prevents various kinds of cancers. It also decreases the number of pulses by more than ten per minute to extend the life of the heart and extends the wobbling width by 5-10 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It kills the pain of neuralgia within three days, 10-20 minutes at maximum and takes 7-10 days to completely recover from the disease.
