The satellite launch for scientific researches into the peaceful development and use of space and economic development can by no means be a monopoly of specified countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs a matter of fact, many countries and regions of the world are deepening scientific researches in the use of outer space and putting them into practice at present, the age of latest science and technology. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGrowing strong with each passing day is the international trend of energetically pushing forward the manufacture and launch of satellites and joining in it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK's satellite launch is a matter pertaining to the sovereignty of the sovereign state.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs the DPRK has already clarified, Kwangmyogsong-3 is a precious result of scientific researches conducted by scientists and technicians of the DPRK in order to develop and utilize working satellites indispensable for the country's economic development, pursuant to the government's policy for the peaceful development and use of space.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen the DPRK launched two experimental satellites, it strictly abided by relevant international regulations and practice. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs regards the projected launch of the working satellite, the DPRK sent necessary information to the relevant international bodies according to international regulations and procedures and expressed the will to invite experts and journalists of other countries to view the launching station. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis being a hard reality, the hostile forces are vying with each other to find fault with the DPRK's projected legitimate satellite launch. This is a move to step up their hostile policy towards the DPRK as it is a sinister and deliberate anti-peace action aimed at provocations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMoreover, the U.S., Japan and south Korea have neither justification nor face to talk about someone's satellite launch. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is the U.S. that is hell-bent on espionage against sovereign states with the help of so many spy satellites in the space. Japan is rushing headlong into launching spy satellites and establishing its own system of space espionage, dreaming of a military giant. South Korea was shameful to have failed twice in its attempt to launch a satellite entirely with other's help. South Korea has neither justification nor face to chide someone's satellite launch. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe hostile forces are persistently insisting that the DPRK's satellite launches are \"missile threats\" and \"provocations\" because they consider its dignity, might and scientific progress as a thorn in their flesh.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tExplicitly speaking, no one can tolerate the double yardstick and double standards in the issue of satellite manufacture and launch. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe hostile forces are sadly mistaken if they think the DPRK will cancel the already projected satellite launch due to some forces' accusations over the above-said matter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIntolerable are the dastardly acts to use the DPRK's satellite launch for peaceful purposes as a lever for political, military and economic pressure upon it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo one has the right to take issue with the DPRK's projected satellite launch this or that way."
