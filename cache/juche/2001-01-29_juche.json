The play is practised on ice or ground in winter.\r\n It helps the children to harden their bodies and impart knowledge to the physical movement. The process of its making gives them an opportunity to cultivate their thinking faculty and improve their manual craft. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The top is mainly made of weighty and hard wood such as birch and jujube tree or pine knots. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The top made thus spins long, producing a sound just like bees humming around. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to its shape, it is divided into drum, horse and rope tops. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A whip for spinning a top is made of twisted cotton or silk thread, attached to a 50 cm long stick. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The top-spinning contest is decided by how long it spins, which top survives the collision and how far it goes.    \r\n\r\n"

It weighs 140 grammes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The hilt is made of dark brown stone, which was ground exquisitely. It is unique in form and comfortable to handle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The bronze axe is pocket-shaped with its handle being fixed at the head. Its edge is arch-shaped and both ends of the edge are tipped.  From the edge to the waist, it becomes narrow and then wide at the head, which is 1.4 centimetres narrower than the edge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The axe is five centimetres long and weighs 75 grammes. Its edge is 4.5 centimetres wide and the pocket is 3.5 centimetres deep. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since the remains are from Tangun's Korea, the first ancient state of Korea, they will serve as a source of archaeological knowledge about the history of King Tangun and the ancient Korea.    \r\n\r\n"
