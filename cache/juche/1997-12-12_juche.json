            "content": "Foreign Ministry spokesman on \"quad talks\"\r\n  Pyongyang, December 12 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea said today that success in \"four-way talks\" depends largely on how the equality of each side's position and the atmosphere of confidence are ensured.\r\n   In an interview with KCNA over \"four-way talks\" held in Geneva, the spokesman said:\r\n   We took part in \"four-way talks\" in the hope that the talks would contribute to achieving durable peace and security in the Korean Peninsula.\r\n   If confrontation is to be uprooted in the peninsula, it is imperative to put an end to the U.S. military intervention and, for this purpose, it is necessary to have a peace agreement concluded between the DPRK and the United States and U.S. troops withdrawn from South Korea.\r\n   As our delegation made clear at the talks, this is one of the main and essential matters we want to have solved through the talks.\r\n   It is our principled stand that its solution will make it possible to solve other matters smoothly.\r\n   At the talks the United States and South Korea asserted that the implementation of the inter-Korean agreement is the most important thing and the whole. If they attempt to turn aside from the point of the matters and disperse the discussion, the matters can never be solved.\r\n   As for the inter-Korean agreement, its implementation is apparently an internal issue of the Korean nation and it depends on the attitude of the South Korean authorities.\r\n   From this point of view, we consider that the DPRK and the United States have something to solve and the two parts of Korea have other things to solve.\r\n   But the U.S. and South Korean sides maintained the stand that the U.S. troops cannot be withdrawn because of the DPRK's \"military threat\". Their preposterous assertion is an uncourteous act towards their dialogue partner. Such an act will only result in increasing distrust, not in building confidence.\r\n   Success in the talks involving the longtime belligerents and parties concerned depends largely on how the equality of each side's position and the atmosphere of confidence are ensured.\r\n   We will do all we can to this end.    \r\n\r\n"
