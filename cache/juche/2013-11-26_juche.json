            "content": "Japan's Wild Ambition for Overseas Aggression Denounced\r\n Pyongyang, November 26 (KCNA) -- The Japanese Defense minister in a recent press conference expressed his willingness to finish the revision of Japan-U.S. defense cooperation guidelines by the end of 2014 as scheduled even though the reexamination of the constitutional interpretation which allows the exercise of the right to collective self-defense is delayed. Mentioning the reason for it, he referred to so-called threats from neighboring countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t A commentary of Minju Joson Tuesday says that threats do not come from countries surrounding Japan, emphasizing that other countries are being exposed to threats from Japan, which is looking to turn the country into a military giant and realize its wild ambition for reinvasion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the defeat in the Second World War, Japan has worked hard to realize its old dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\" with the support of the U.S. imperialists who have been hell-bent on realizing its world domination strategy, the commentary notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Considering that conditions are ripe for realizing their ambition for overseas aggression the Japanese reactionaries have become undisguised in their moves to launch overseas aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As it has become highly likely for the reexamination of the constitutional interpretation regarding the right to collective self-defense to be delayed in the face of strong protest by the public at home and abroad, the Japanese reactionaries are considering revising Japan-U.S. defense cooperation guidelines under the spurious signboards of \"tightened Japan-U.S. alliance\" and \"threat to security\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They have long craved for realizing their ambition for overseas aggression. This is clearly evidenced by their moves to change even the strategy of depending on locally available resources for the production of defense hardware which they have \"maintained\" for the past nearly four decades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan should clearly bear in mind that if it dreams of realizing its wild ambition for overseas aggression, oblivious of the lesson of history, it will only meet earlier ruin."
