Por eso, las autoridades surcoreanas no tienen ninguna razon para entrometerse en ese asunto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La ruta del turismo de los compatriotas surcoreanos deseosos de ver los lugares famosos de la nacion no debera ser bloqueada por culpa de la camarilla de los conservadores anti-reunificacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Puesto que en el interior y el exterior del pais crecen cada dia mas los pedidos del turismo al monte Kumgang y la zona de Kaesong, no podemos tener abandonados indefinidamente estos famosos lugares de talla mundial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por eso, declaramos solemnemente que como ya hemos anunciado, abriremos las puertas del turismo a la zona de Kaesong desde marzo y al monte Kumgang desde abril.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Seran garantizadas perfectamente las comodidades y la seguridad personal de los compatriotas surcoreanos que entren en nuestra parte para el turismo al monte Kumgang y la zona de Kaesong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Si las autoridades surcoreanas siguen bloqueando el camino del turismo recurriendo a las insistencias absurdas, nos veremos obligados a tomar las medidas resueltas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En estas seran incluidas la quiebra de todos los acuerdos y contratos sobre las labores turisticas, contraidos dando preferencias a la parte Sur, la congelacion de bienes inmuebles de esta en las areas turisticas, entre otros problemas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ahora, el problema de la apertura o no del camino turistico al monte Kumgang y la zona de Kaesong depende de las autoridades surcoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Las autoridades surcoreanas tendran que asumir todas las consecuencias y responsabilidades que emanen del no reinicio del turismo."
