It, therefore, indicates the most fair and aboveboard way of ensuring peace on the Korean Peninsula and achieving co-existence and co-prosperity and reunification of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reunification solidarity for the implementation of the June 15 South-North Joint Declaration and peace on the Korean Peninsula in a protest letter on May 24 said that Ri Hoe Chang should quit the political arena at once, aware that his remarks were absolutely unpardonable. It urged the GNP to withdraw the nomination of Ri Hoe Chang as a \"presidential candidate\" because he has betrayed his anti-national, anti-reunification nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Taegu and North Kyongsang provincial reunification solidarity in a statement on May 24 said Ri Hoe Chang's call for the abolition of the second point of the joint declaration laid bare his intention to scrap the core point of the joint declaration and to obstruct the implementation of the declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It declared that the organization is opposed to Ri Hoe Chang running for presidency on the ticket of the GNP, because he is defiling the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, the peasants council of Wanju county, the General Student Council of Konkuk University, Seoul Women's University and the committee for implementing the June 15 joint declaration released a similar joint statement on May 26.    \r\n"

This goes to clearly prove that the U.S. is persistently seeking confrontation with the DPRK, while talking about \"dialogue\" with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If dialogue is to be held, there should be no confrontation. The ceaseless confrontation will further strain the situation on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An atmosphere of national reconciliation and cooperation is prevailing on the Korean Peninsula according to the April 5 joint press release. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. behavior to put a brake on such positive developments can never be justified and it will only meet bitter criticism from the world progressives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is well advised to face up to the reality of the Korean Peninsula aspiring after dialogue and drop its anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"
