            "content": "Radical Improvement of Inter-Korean Relations Called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 4 (KCNA) -- There is a growing danger of a nuclear war against the north by foreign forces in Korea. This makes it incumbent upon the north and the south of Korea to boldly dispel the outdated idea of confrontation and earnestly promote the improvement of the relations through practical measures in order to defend the destiny of the nation and achieve common prosperity.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Thursday says this in its signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the realistic way for the radical improvement and development of the inter-Korean relations for the north and the south to recognize and respect each other's ideology and system in the spirit of the June 15 joint declaration and take practical measures to this end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There have been different ideologies and systems in the north and the south for decades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the ignorance of the essence of the matter to argue that mutual exchange will lead to confidence building. One of the factors standing in the way of the development of the inter-Korean relations is the pattern of thinking originating from different ideologies and systems and legal and institutional problems resulting from them. Under this condition it is the best cure for the development of the inter-Korean relations to recognize the reality and respect each other's ideology and system.\r\n For a dramatic turn in the inter-Korean relations through the recognition and respect of each other's ideology and system, the ideas and practices of the old era of confrontation must be abandoned and all the anti-reunification institutional barriers such as the \"National Security Law\" repressing the desire for national reconciliation, unity and reunification through alliance with the north be pulled down in south Korea. \r\n Recognition and respect of each other's ideology and system and reconciliation based on it are, indeed, the bed-rock point of principle of practical significance in the development of the inter-Korean relations. The earliest possible solution to this matter is an urgent task that brooks no further delay for the implementation of the June 15 joint declaration and the accomplishment of the cause of independent reunification. Depending on it is whether the inter-Korean relations enter the stage of fundamental development, braving the challenges and obstructions of the foreign forces, or fall into the crisis of severance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a bold decision for the country and the nation to take practical measures to recognize and respect each other's ideology and system. The south Korean authorities should respond to the call of the times and history by taking practical measures for the radical improvement of the inter-Korean relations as early as possible.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is now directing special efforts to preventing the occurrence of undesirable incidents in the current blue crab catching season in particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fiction of the north's \"retaliation\" floated by the south Korean military despite this hard fact only betrays its sinister intention to do harm to the north.\r\n The north side is greatly angered by the south Korean military's false propaganda  as it echoed just what the U.S. imperialist warhawks uttered, dancing to their tune. \r\n Through such smear campaign the south Korean military authorities disclosed the undeniable fact that they are following the road of treachery at the instigation of the U.S. imperialists, not the road indicated by the joint declaration.\r\n The north considers the south Korean military's spread of such misinformation as a prelude to a fresh West Sea skirmish. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Through this he scientifically proved that socialism is sure to triumph and instilled firm conviction of sure victory in socialism into the revolutionary people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The work serves as important guidelines to be always held fast to in accomplishing the socialist cause in our times as it clarifies the solidity and invincibility of socialism centred on the masses which puts the people forward as a genuine master of society and makes everything serve them, it says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The work, among other things, serves as precious guidelines indicating the way of consolidating the ideological foundation of socialism and victoriously advancing the people's cause of independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il in the work taught that Korean-style socialism was built and has grown stronger, guided by the Juche idea. He scientifically proved that the above-said socialism remains solid and invincible as it makes it possible to protect and fully meet the wishes and interests of the people as required by the Juche idea.\r\n The work serves as an ever-lasting banner for remarkably bolstering the driving force of socialism to advance the socialist cause. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il in the work teaches that the people are the driving force advancing the socialist society but they can creditably fulfill their role as an independent driving force of the revolution and successfully build socialism only when they are united around the Party and the leader as firm as a rock. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The singled-minded unity in the DPRK with the headquarters of the revolution at its core provides a sure guarantee for all victories of Songun Korea.    \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The Korean people fought against the Japanese imperialists with arms in their hands and thus achieved the liberation of the country.\r\n After the liberation, the President, basing himself on the rich experience in closely rallying the anti-Japanese patriotic forces around the ARF, put forward the three principles of national reunification, the proposal for founding the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo and the ten-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation for reunifying the divided country and nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Leader Kim Jong Il has formulated the three principles of national reunification, the proposal for founding the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo and the ten-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation as the three charters for national reunification and is successfully carrying forward the brilliant tradition of great national unity provided by the President, with the result that a new phase for the reunification of the country has been opened up and successes unprecedented in the north-south relations made in recent years.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
