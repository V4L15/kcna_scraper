The paper goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No spurious words can hide its sinister intention or its crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In recent months the U.S. conducted ceaseless joint military exercises and beefed up armed forces on the peninsula and its vicinity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From the end of September it staged a combined naval drill against the DPRK in secrecy in the East Sea of Korea. It brought to Pusan Port the nuclear carrier task force of the Navy of its imperialist aggression forces that took part in the drill and held a saber-rattling in the South Sea of Korea. In order to conceal its sinister purpose the U.S. said the drill was for deterring possible \"provocation\" from the DPRK including nuclear test and missile launch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Timed to coincide with this, the U.S. made public \"tailored deterrence strategy\" which envisaged increased threat of a nuclear war against the DPRK and the completion of a plan for a preemptive nuclear strike. From October 25 to the first ten days of November the U.S. waged combined aerial drill Max Thunder together with the south Korean puppet forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is now mulling offering 40 F-35s and 14 CH-47Ds to south Korea after setting up the anti-missile functional committee aimed at a preemptive attack on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reckless war drills that were staged for less than three months led to a touch-and-go situation on the peninsula where a war may break out any moment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the U.S. is talking nonsense about the DPRK, while shelving its criminal responsibility for pushing the situation on the peninsula to an uncontrollable phase. This is sophism which can convince no one.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should not try to deceive the international community with a threadbare sleight of hand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is a chief culprit harassing the peace and stability of the region with ceaseless war maneuvers and arms buildup, concludes the commentary."
