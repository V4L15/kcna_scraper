            "content": "Projected Transfer of U.S. 8th Army Command to Hawaii Termed Hypocritical \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 29 (KCNA) -- The U.S. and the south Korean warlike forces are reportedly contemplating transferring the U.S. 8th Army Command in Ryongsan, Seoul to Hawaii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A spokesman for the Korean National Peace Committee in a statement on June 28 dismissed this as a charade to mislead the public opinion at home and abroad strongly demanding the withdrawal of the U.S. forces from south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ulterior aim sought by the U.S. through this is to keep the main combat forces under the U.S. 8th Army Command in south Korea as they are while creating the impression that it would be transferred to Hawaii, and bolster them as a \"rapid task force\" equipped with the latest nuclear war means, the statement said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another aim sought by the U.S. is to adjust from a new angle the operational command system in such a way as to make its military intervention smoother in case it provokes another Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the U.S. scenario becomes a reality, the U.S. 8th Army will be completely converted into a task force performing military operational duties on the Korean Peninsula and in the rest of Northeast Asia, escalating the danger of war in the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality clearly proves that the projected transfer of the said command is nothing but a move to reorganize the aggression troops for the sinister purpose of tightening the U.S. military domination over south Korea and escalating the actions to provoke a war of aggression against the DPRK and, furthermore, holding military hegemony in Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a day-dream for the U.S. to try to invade and dominate other countries and nations today when struggling for independence and peace has become a trend of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised not to stage the charade of transferring the above-said command but immediately pull out of south Korea taking with it all the aggression troops and war hardware.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "S. Korean Puppet Military's Anti-DPRK \"Human Rights\" Racket Blasted \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 28 (KCNA) -- A military commentator's article titled \"'Human rights racket' kicked up by the south Korean puppet military bound to meet stern judgment by KPA\" was made public. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the south Korean puppet military's frantic moves to incite confrontation with the DPRK, the article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From early June the puppet military let media give publicity to the anti-DPRK rubbish let loose by human scum who have been thrown into the dumping ground of the south Korean society for having turned their backs on the country and the nation. It even went the lengths of orchestrating a series of \"concerts and plays\" based on the fictions about \"human rights issues\" in the DPRK and letting so-called artistes tour different places to perform them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Traitor Lee Myung Bak called for setting right the \"security\" awareness and the \"view on principal enemy\" of the servicepersons of the puppet army and ordinary people that were obscured over the past decade and saying what should be done about the north's \"human rights\" performance. The puppet defense ministry does not hide that the aim of the performance tour is to instill hostility toward the DPRK into them, as intended by Lee. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Involved in the fresh anti-DPRK \"human rights\" racket that kicked off with the performance tour are evil agents for a psychological warfare and \"TI and E\" officers of the puppet military, bribed \"artistes\" and other riff-raffs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a rare tragicomedy for the puppet military to go busy while taking the lead in kicking up the anti-DPRK \"human rights\" racket although it has left a shameful record in the nation's history for playing the role of an ill-famed shock brigade in abusing human rights. The above-said act cannot be construed otherwise than another grave political provocation against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The racket is a product of the stooge's blind submission and subservience to his U.S. master's policy and strategy for invading the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the U.S. imperialists' anti-DPRK \"human rights\" offensive is concerned, it is aimed at forcing us to accept their \"human rights standards\" in a bid to impose U.S.-style democracy and market economy system upon us and thus put the DPRK, independent and dignified, under their control like south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In other words, it is the strategic purpose of the U.S. imperialists' anti-DPRK \"human rights\" offensive to deprive the people of the DPRK of their sovereignty, their lifeline, and put everything in the DPRK under the U.S. control and lord it over as it pleases. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is none other than the south Korean puppet military which plays the role of a shock brigade in carrying out such \"human rights\" offensive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has closely followed all acts of traitor Lee Myung Bak as he cried out for \"handling someone's 'human rights' problem in cooperation with the international community from the universally accepted principle of value\" and \"saying what should be done out of affection\" to please his master soon after he took office as puppet president. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is preposterous for south Korea to talk about someone's \"human rights\" issue despite the fact that its sovereignty and military prerogative, the main symbol of \"human rights\", have been put at the mercy of the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Worse still, the puppet military is making a hue and cry over the \"human rights\" issue though it has committed heinous crimes by persistently violating rights of the people. This cannot but be a shameless behavior. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In league with the U.S. imperialist aggressors, the mastermind of the vicious \"human rights\" offensive, the puppet military dare do harm to the unique Korean-style socialist system centered on the popular masses. Its sinister \"human rights\" racket is no more than a deed as foolish as trying to cover the sun with palm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also an unpardonable, treacherous and anti-reunification act intended to negate the historic June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration, a program for its implementation, and do harm to the DPRK's sovereignty and its dignified system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-DPRK \"human rights\" racket the puppet military are kicking up through the performance of such poor \"concerts and plays\" based on sheer lies only betrays their wicked intention to undermine the DPRK's sovereignty, the main symbol of human rights and the life and soul of the people, and its socialist system centered on the popular masses providing sure guarantee for it, by employing any means and method. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such behavior, a clear denial to the historic declarations in which both sides agreed to respect each other's ideology and system and stop slandering each other and inciting hostility, cannot be construed otherwise than a deliberate treacherous act to incite division and confrontation among the fellow countrymen instead of seeking national reconciliation and unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also a vicious offensive staged in advance to ideologically and morally disintegrate the army and people of the DPRK and aggravate the confrontation and tension between the north and the south in a bid to ignite a new war, pursuant to the U.S. imperialists' policy and strategy for a war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and the people of the DPRK scathingly denounce the anti-DPRK \"human rights\" campaign frantically conducted by traitor Lee Myung Bak and the puppet military by using despicable human scum as an unpardonable act of treachery quite contrary to the trend of the nation's history towards the north-south development and peace and prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the national sovereignty and independence that should never be violated in any case but protected as one's life and soul. The revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK regarding this as an unshakable principle will never pardon such deed of the puppet military. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Traitor Lee and the puppet military should not be mistaken. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nothing is more foolish than finding fault with socialism in the DPRK based on maxim of believing in people as in Heaven, the society where the Juche idea has been embodied in all fields and genuine human rights are guaranteed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lee and the puppet military should properly understand the desire of the nation and the trend of the times and stop at once their anti-DPRK \"human rights\" racket. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The action taken by the Lee group to import beef from American cattle infected with mad cow disease so infuriated the people that they were thrown into the danger of being burned by their candlelight. But the anti-DPRK \"human rights\" racket kicked up by them, pursuant to the U.S. policy, will force them to face a more stern judgement by the army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Should the above-said ruckus spearheaded by the south Korean puppet military be allowed to go on despite our warnings, our revolutionary armed forces standing on the forefront of the struggle to defend the sovereignty will take merciless counter-actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our army knows no mercy.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is also a policy for defence of peace as it serves to protect the peace of the country and security of the nation and pave a broad vista for national reunification with the invincible military strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun policy serves as a banner of national unity which helps remarkably strengthen the driving forces of national reunification by encouraging all the fellow countrymen to turn out in the drive to accelerate the realization of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over the past years, it has strikingly demonstrated its invincible vitality as a great banner of national reunification and prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The adoption of the historic June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration, which enveloped all the Koreans with hope for national reunification and shook the world with admiration, and the proud picture in the June 15 era of reunification in which a vigorous drive is being waged to achieve the national reconciliation, unity and independent reunification--these achievements would have been unthinkable without the great Songun policy which made it possible to reliably defend peace of the Korean Peninsula and create favorable conditions for independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun policy, which brought the June 15 era of reunification to be recorded in the Korean nation's history and provides a sure guarantee for its victorious advance, is a symbol of the Korean nation's dignity and pride and a banner of triumph, concludes the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
