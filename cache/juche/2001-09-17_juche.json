            "content": "Kim Jong Il inspects South Hamgyong Province \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 17 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Il, General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and Chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission, gave field guidance to the work in various fields in South Hamgyong Province from Sept. 14 to 15.\r\n Accompanying him were secretaries of the WPK Central Committee Kim Kuk Thae, Kim Ki Nam and Jong Ha Chol, minister of railways Kim Yong Sam and others.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Leader Kim Jong Il visited different units in the province including the July 6 Railway Factory, the Rahung Concret Sleeper Plant, Songchongang Power Stations, the Yonggwang Youth Fish Farm and the Jungphyong Cooperative Farm in Sinhung county. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The first leg of his visit was the July 6 railway factory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After being briefed on the history of the factory in front of its panoramic map, he went round production processes to learn about details of its production. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He advanced tasks to be carried out by the factory, saying that its position and role are very important in putting railway transport, the pilot of the national economy, on a new higher stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A technical modernization drive for updating all production processes should be energetically pushed ahead and new advanced technology introduced in order to satisfactorily meet the increasing demand for transport and produce more quality goods suited to the new century, he stressed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He appreciated a performance given by the itinerant art squad of the factory on the worksite. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then he moved on to the Rahung Concrete Sleeper Plant. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Going round sleeper shop and other workshops to learn about the production of the plant, he gave a pet-talk to workers in the drive for increased production. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said the plant should be modernized and its capacity further raised to increase the output of sleepers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il also inspected newly built Songchongang Power Stations nos.23, 24, 25, 26 and 27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Looking round the interior and exterior of the modern power stations, he acquainted himself in detail with their construction and operation and expressed thanks to all those who participated in the construction of the stations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said it is important to elevate the efficiency of generators and do away with the waste of electricity while building many minor power stations, and indicated concrete ways to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The next leg of his guidance was the Yonggwang Youth Fish Farm newly built in Jadong-ri, Yonggwang county. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Going round the modern fish farm covering scores of hectares, he noted with great satisfaction that the members of the youth shock brigade, who built the Kwangmyongsong Saltern, finished the construction of the excellent farm in a short span of time, and extended thanks to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He put forth tasks to be carried out to operate the fish farm, saying that in order to increase the output of freshwater fish it is essential to put pisciculture on a scientific and intensive basis, develop good breed and solve the feed problem. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He visited the Jungphyong Cooperative Farm in Sinhung county. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After seeing the monument to President Kim Il Sung's on-site guidance on the farm, he went round different places of its sixth workteam to learn about the rural construction and farm work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said that farm work should be done on a scientific and technological basis as demanded by the Juche method of farming whose validity and advantage have been proven in practice and the principle of the right crop on the right soil and in the right time strictly adhered to according to the topographical features so as to raise the grain yield. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then he dropped in at servicemen's family whose father is farmer Kim Hyo Bong. There he had a cordial talk with Kim's family members and posed for a picture with them.\r\n Meanwhile, the South Hamgyong Provincial People's Committee and the South Hamgyong Provincial Committee of the WPK hosted a dinner at Sinhung restaurant in honor of Kim Jong Il upon the conclusion of his guidance to the province. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il met with leading officials of the restaurant to learn about how it serves the people. And he urged them to prepare a variety of delicious noodles in a larger quantity with local special products such as potato starch for the people.    \r\n    \r\n"

This, however, will only lead the U.S. to self-destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration should clearly know that its escalated hard-line policy to stifle the DPRK would drive the U.S. to a grave situation.     \r\n\r\n"
