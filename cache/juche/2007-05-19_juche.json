Except royal family names and awarded surnames, there were 24 surnames in Koguryo, about 20 in Paekje and more than 10 in Silla. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The number of surnames reached over 120 in the time of Palhae and late Silla and more than 160 in the years of Koryo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The word \"pon\" (family origin) came into being to classify the lineages along with the generalization of surnames. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to historical records, there were nearly 500 surnames in Korea but over 200 of them had vanished down through history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nearly 10,000 pons also decreased to 3,000 in the closing years of Ri dynasty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the occupation of Korea by Japanese imperialists, they forced Korean people, who have used surnames from the early period of the human history, to change their names into Japanese ones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In an attempt to exterminate the Korean nation, they installed consultation offices for changing Korean names into Japanese ones in different parts of the country.  They made no scruple to change names without permission of the persons in question. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people strong in national character, however, firmly preserved their full names in the teeth of the vicious pressure by the Japanese imperialists.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "American-Style \"Democracy\" Dismissed as Hypocritical  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 18 (KCNA) -- The bipartisan system in the United States is a hypocritical and deceptive political system aimed at covering up the reactionary nature of its unpopular bourgeois dictatorship and policies and justifying the capitalist class's domination over society. Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The hypocritical and deceptive nature of the American-style \"democracy\" under the bipartisan system finds its expression in the fact that the toiling popular masses are excluded from the election campaigns and political activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any citizen of a country should be granted the rights to vote and to be elected in the country without any condition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said rights related to democracy are not guaranteed in the American-style \"democracy\" under the bipartisan system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. federal and state constitutions do not guarantee the poor suffrage. These constitutions restrict the rights of the ordinary people to vote under the pretexts of their property status, level of their education, duration of their residence, etc. The presidential election in the U.S. is an indirect election through electoral college. The president is elected by this electoral college and its members are chosen by ordinary electors. Almost all the members of the electoral college represent the exploiting class. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is mainly due to this bipartisan system that democracy is suppressed and the political life is getting more reactionary as the days go by in the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said nature is also manifested in the fact that all U.S. policies and line are shaped and executed in contravention of the desire and demands of the toiling people. The two parties--the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, groups of monopoly capitalists and those who speak for them, faithfully serve the bourgeois only. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the American \"democracy\" under the above-said system denotes is very simple and mechanical. When the Republican Party insists \"it is right\" before acting, the Democratic Party says \"it is wrong\" before moving. This precisely means American -style \"democracy.\" The political scramble between the two parties is nothing but a clash between the wealthy classes over their interests, the fight to gain more economic profits with the help of power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any illusion about the above-said \"democracy\" leads to national ruin. The world progressive countries and people should, therefore, guard against American-style \"democracy\" and never allow themselves to accept it, concludes the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "\"Democracia\" norteamericana es absurda y enganosa\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, 18 de mayo (ATCC) -- El sistema bipartidista de Estados Unidos es un regimen politico hipocrita y fraudulento establecido para ocultar el caracter reaccionario de la dictadura burguesa y la politica antipopulares y racionalizar la posicion dominacionista de la clase capitalista en la sociedad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Asi senala el diario Rodong Sinmun en un articulo individual de este viernes y continua: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La absurdidad y la fraudulencia de la \"democracia\" al estilo yanqui por el sistema biopartidista se revelan en la campana electoral y las actividades politicas en las que se marginan las masas populares. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Los ciudadanos de cada pais deben tener el derecho a elegir y ser elegidos independientemente de las posiciones que ocupan en la sociedad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Tal \"democracia\" contraviene al primer contenido de la democracia que es el derecho a elegir y ser elegido. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Las constituciones federales y estatales de EE.UU. no dan el derecho a votar a los pobres. Restringen el derecho de los electores en la posesion de bienes, la escolaridad y el tiempo de residencia. La eleccion presidencial en EE.UU. es la indirecta por el \"colegio electoral\". El presidente es elegido por este \"colegio electoral\" cuyos miembros son elegidos por los votantes generales. Los miembros del colegio electoral casi en su mayoria representan la clase explotadora. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Se suprime la democracia y se torna cada dia mas reaccionaria la vida politica en EE.UU., lo que se debe principalmente al sistema bipartidista. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Tambien la absurdidad y la fraudulencia de la \"democracia\" norteamericana se revelan en el hecho de que todas las politicas y lineas contravienen a la aspiracion y demanda de las masas trabajadoras. Ambos partidos democratico y republicano representados por los magnates y sus portavoces sirven fielmente a los burgueses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El contenido de la \"democracia\" bipartidista es sencillo y mecanico. Es decir, el partido republicano dice \"si\" y el democratico responde \"no\". La pugna politica de ambos partidos es el choque de los intereses de las capas adineradas para ganar mayor provecho con el apoyo del poder. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Abrigar la ilusion a la \"democracia\" norteamericana por el sistema bipartidista es el camino de la ruina. Los paises y pueblos progresistas del mundo deben guardar estrictamente de tal \"democracia\".    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
