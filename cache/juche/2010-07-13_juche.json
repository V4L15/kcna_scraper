            "content": "KCNA on Tricksters' Selfish Sophism about \"Cheonan\" Case\r\n Pyongyang, July 13 (KCNA) -- The U.S. and the south Korean puppet authorities tried to save their lost faces even a bit, uttering that they feel disappointment with the presidential statement of the UN Security Council concerning the \"Cheonan\" case but there was what they called \"success\" at least.\n\t\t\t\t\t World media, however, consider the presidential statement as a total fiasco for them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No wonder, media put it that the south Korean authorities' original plan to wrest \"apology and compensation\" from the DPRK by prodding the UNSC into adopting a \"resolution\" of legal binding force went up in smoke, terming the presidential statement an absurd and toothless one.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A particular mention should be made of the fact that media are jeering at the U.S. and south Korea, saying: The fact that the presidential statement took note of the DPRK's stand that it has nothing to do with the case of \"Cheonan's\" sinking now that the \"chief culprit\" of the case has not yet been probed means, in the final analysis, that the UNSC does not view the case as \"something done by north Korea\", and the U.S. and south Korea raised a hue and cry over the case but it ended in the publication of a very ambiguous presidential statement that seems to defend north Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a natural outcome based on the objective reality in which the international community terms the U.S. and the south Korean authorities' \"Cheonan\" diplomacy a fiasco.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A scrutiny into the presidential statement proved that the DPRK was right when it asserted that the case is an issue to be settled between the north and the south, not an issue to be referred to the UNSC in view of its nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By nature the UNSC has to perform the function of handling any incident posing \"threat to international peace and stability\" and finding out its culprit and \"punishing\" him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHowever, the presidential statement not only took a deformed attitude of condemning the recent case itself without singling out the author of it but also called upon the parties concerned to settle the case peacefully through their direct dialogue after considering it as a regional affair.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This amounted to the UNSC's affirmation of the DPRKâ€™s stand that the \"Cheonan\" case is not a matter to be dealt with at the UN forum as asserted by the United States and the south Korean authorities, but a matter to be settled by the north and the south of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such being the case, the U.S. and the south Korean authorities are misinterpreting the presidential statement in favor of them, adding something to it as they please in a bid to save their face even a bit. But such behavior will only reveal how poor their position is.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Every sin brings its punishment with it and one bereft of any reason would talk much.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Though the U.S. and the south Korean authorities are talking a lot like a thief afraid of his own shadow, they can neither cover up the truth behind the \"Cheonan\" case nor hide up their despicable true colors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn keeping with the presidential statement saying that \"the Security Council encourages the settlement of outstanding issues on the Korean Peninsula by peaceful means to resume direct dialogue and negotiation through appropriate channels,\" the DPRK will do its utmost to probe the truth about the case to the last and achieve peace, stability and denuclearization of the peninsula."

This was a product of the persistent and mean plots of the U.S. to put an end to the June 15 era.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By recently faking up the case of warship \"Cheonan\" sinking the U.S. drove the situation on the Korean Peninsula to the brink of a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the pretext of the warship case the U.S. overturned an agreement on the \"transfer of wartime operation control (OPCON)\" in 2012 on which it made, pressurized by the south Koreans' fierce struggle for independence against the U.S. and thus revealed its wicked intention to permanently hold the right to command the \"ROK army.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation prevailing on the Korean Peninsula reminds one of that six decades ago when the U.S. provoked the war of aggression against the DPRK by instigating traitor Syngman Rhee and massively hurled troops of its allies into the war under the name of the UN. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean nation can neither live in peace even a moment nor escape nuclear disaster as long as the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces are present in south Korea, the indictment said, and continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. imperialists provoke a war of aggression against the DPRK again, the people in south Korea will turn out as one in a sacred just and patriotic struggle to build a reunified country alongside the brothers and sisters in the north out to defend the country in order to protect the honor of the nation."

Ademas, definio el caso como problema regional y llamo a las partes involucradas a resolverlo por via pacifica mediante las conversaciones directas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esto significa afirmar la posicion de la RPDC de que el caso del \"Cheonan\" no es un problema a tratarse en la ONU, como insisten EE.UU. y las autoridades surcoreanas, sino un asunto que deben manejar ambas partes coreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  A pesar de esta realidad, EE.UU. y las autoridades surcoreanas tergiversan a su conveniencia la declaracion del presidente con el fin de recuperar su honra perdida. Este hecho muestra que ellos se hallan en una situacion muy pobre y vulnerable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Los culpables terminan pagando sus crimenes y los irrazonables recurren siempre a la chismeria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Aunque EE.UU. y las autoridades surcoreanas hacen comentarios de todo tipo sobre el criminal incidente del \"Cheonan\", no podran encubrir la verdad ni ocultar su fachada deshonesta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ateniendose al parrafo de la declaracion del presidente del Consejo de Seguridad: \"se promueve resolver de manera pacifica los problemas pendientes de la Peninsula Coreana reiniciando el dialogo directo y las negociaciones por vias adecuadas\", la RPDC se esforzara en todo lo posible por esclarecer hasta el final la verdad del incidente y alcanzar la paz, la estabilidad y la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana."
