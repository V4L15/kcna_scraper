            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on Bush Administration's Aggressive Military Strategy \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 28 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today carries a signed article which castigates the Bush administration for establishing preemptive nuclear attack strategy as the keystone of its aggressive military strategy in the 21st century and committing the inhuman crimes of increasing the danger of a nuclear war.\r\n The U.S. has advocated that it will use nukes as a means of threat or a last resort to strike, but it has openly changed this stand into the reckless preemptive nuclear attack strategy, the article says, and goes on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush group designated the DPRK and other countries as the targets of nuclear attack, which is a revelation of very dangerous attempt to put its preemptive nuclear attack strategy into practice. The U.S. imperialists declared all over the world that their main military doctrine is a preemptive nuclear attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is clear that the U.S. is the very one who poses a nuclear threat in the world. The U.S. is stepping up the development and production of smaller nukes in a bid to use nukes as if they are conventional weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is the first target of the U.S. preemptive nuclear attack. The U.S. imperialists have deployed a large quantity of means and equipment for nuclear operation in and around south Korea to ignite a nuclear war in the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to realise the desire of the humankind to live in the world without nukes, the nuclear powers, first of all, should honestly implement their duties corresponding to the NPT. But the U.S. has become undisguised in its attempt to launch nuclear attacks upon non-nuclear and other countries, taking no account of its implementation of duty, and posed a nuclear threat to humankind while running amuck in modernizing and minimizing nukes. This proves that the U.S. imperialists are the vicious harasser of peace and nuclear war maniacs. The peace-loving people of the world should wage a positive struggle to frustrate the U.S. imperialists' moves for a nuclear war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The performers put on the stage colorful numbers with high pride and honor of greeting the significant day when the army and people of the DPRK won a shining victory in the Fatherland Liberation War by defeating the U.S. imperialists who boasted of being \"the strongest\" in the world under the wise guidance of Kim Il Sung, an invincible iron-willed commander and outstanding strategist. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, a performance of wartime songs \"For the Motherland\" was given by war veterans and honored disabled soldiers in Pyongyang at the Central Workers' Hall to celebrate July 27.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Defending Independence Is Basic Guarantee for National Development: Rodong Sinmun \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 28 (KCNA) -- The realities today when the alleged \"only super power\" of the world is getting all the more wanton in its aggressive and dominationist hysterics make it quite urgent for the Koreans to hold higher the banner of independence in the struggle to carve out the destiny of the country and the nation, says Rodong Sinmun in an article Friday.\r\n Holding higher the banner of independence is a highly important matter in foiling the U.S. imperialists' current moves to destroy national identity under the slogan of \"globalization,\" the author of the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Anyone who is concerned for the destiny of the country and the nation should approach the imperialists' moves to destroy national identity with high vigilance and resolutely smash them with national self-respect. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The stand of national independence should be firmly maintained in the reunification movement, if the cause of reunification is to be led to victory in the teeth of all manner of challenges of history blocking up the advance of the era of independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people's struggle to defend the independence of the country and the nation at the present juncture is a stand-off of strength and a stand-off of ideology and will with U.S. imperialism, stresses the article, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The best weapon for maintaining independence is invincible military capacity. The motive of the Workers' Party of Korea choosing the path of Songun and the mission of Songun politics are to consolidate the might of the driving force of the nation to be invincible and thereby frustrate the outsiders' moves of aggression and domination and reliably defend the dignity and sovereignty of the nation. The colossal war deterrent built under Songun politics is demonstrating its invincible might in the current stand-off with the U.S. Under this great politics, the U.S. imperialists' policy of aggression against the DPRK is bound to go bust and peace on the Korean Peninsula and security of the Korean nation are sure to be guaranteed.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Cancellation of Plan for U.S.- S. Korea Joint Military Exercises Demanded\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 28 (KCNA) -- The \"Ulji Focus Lens\" joint military exercises to be staged under the simulated conditions of preemptive attack upon and a nuclear war against the DPRK are very dangerous large-scale war maneuvers which the U.S. and south Korean warmongers have staged every year with huge aggressor forces involved since the mid-1970s. A spokesman for the Korean National Peace Committee declared this in a statement issued on July 28 lashing at the plan announced by the south Korea-U.S. \"Combined Forces Command\" to stage the saber rattling in south Korea from August 21 to September 1.\r\n The joint military exercises will involve more than 8,000 U.S. imperialist aggressor troops and hundreds of thousands of south Korean troops and lots of latest war equipment, the statement noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said joint military exercises are projected at a time when the U.S. and other bellicose forces have gone to extremes in their moves to stifle the DPRK and provoke a war against it. This is a dangerous development indicating their intention to further strain the situation on the Korean Peninsula. It is, therefore, another serious military provocation and a de facto declaration of war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and the south Korean military authorities advertise the projected war exercises as \"annual ones\" like habitual tactics, but needless to say, this is an extremely dangerous play with fire intended to ignite a war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such military maneuvers for aggression will get the U.S. bellicose forces nowhere because they will only harden the will of the army and people of the DPRK to bolster up its deterrent for self-defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The more recklessly the U.S. brandishes its \"stick of strength\" against the DPRK, the more resolutely it will react to it with force and respond to its dagger of aggression with a sword of justice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and south Korean authorities should immediately cancel their plan for the reckless \"Ulji Focus Lens\" joint military exercises as they will only push the situation on the Korean Peninsula to an extreme pitch of tension and have a catastrophic impact on the inter-Korean relations.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
