He profoundly elucidated the essential principle and scientific ways for developing the socialist national language and clarified the issues to be settled by the party of the working class to develop the national language. And he has wisely led the work to firmly preserve the Juche character and national character in the linguistic life as required by the demand of the developing revolution in the new century, in particular, in which the building of a great prosperous powerful nation is now making dynamic progress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary and national way of linguistic life which calls for firmly preserving the Korean language and the cultured language prevails among our people.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

On this basis they committed a germ warfare against peaceable residents and cities of Korea in a wily way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The germ warfare atrocities of the U.S. troops reached the extremes in 1952. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They dropped all sorts of germ bombs on 169 areas of the northern half of Korea 804 times in total from early January to March 1952. They dropped various articles containing poisonous insects and germs in at least 90 cities and counties 900 times in total from January to April 1952. Kinds of the germ weapons used by them during the war numbered more than 20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They not only massively used germ weapons during the war but also brutally conducted tests on living bodies of POWs of our side. In 1951 they sent warships to a place near Wonsan, where they tested germ weapons on POWs almost every day, totaling 3,000 cases. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  One of the most brutal crimes committed by the U.S. imperialists against Koreans during the war was that they massively used chemical weapons. They used many chemical weapons in 24 cities and counties in the northern half of Korea including Kangwon and Hwanghae Provinces and front areas from February 1951 to July 1953. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Napalm bombs were used in most cases. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They used depleted uranium shells and other weapons of mass destruction in the Vietnam war, Persian Gulfs war and in the subsequent wars, inflicting great casualties and sufferings upon a large number of people. They brutally killed peaceable people of Iraq with chemical weapons on charges of \"terrorists\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The biological and chemical warfare committed by the U.S. imperialists, the most diabolic and cruel barbarians of modern type, can never be covered up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is the biggest possessor of biological and chemical weapons in the world. Nevertheless, the U.S. imperialists try to brand others as criminals, an indication of their peculiar shamelessness and brigandism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should stop unreasonable action of finding fault with others who are not problematic, honestly admit and open to the public its atrocious crimes of biological and chemical warfare and stand trial by history.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
