            "content": "EE.UU. ubica B-1B en isla Guam\r\nPyongyang, 6 de agosto (ACNC) -- Los imperialistas yanquis, que en los ultimos dias intensifican de manera escalonada sus actos hostiles anti-RPDC, ubicaron hoy el bombardero estrategico nuclear B-1B en la base aerea Anderson de la isla Guam. \n\t\t\t\t\tY hablan abiertamente que esto es la medida para hacer frente al tiempo emergente de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo el pretexto del \"equilibrio estrategico\" de la region Asia-Pacifico y la \"asistencia militar al pais aliado\", ellos vinieron estacionando permanentemente el bombardero B-52H en esa isla, base avanzada para la agresion a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, el emplazamiento del B-1B en Guam se efectuo por primera vez en los ultimos 10 anos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora, los enemigos echan fanfarronadas cacareando que el \"B-1B\" tiene la velocidad de 1.5 veces y la capacidad de dos veces de carga de bombas nucleares en comparacion con el B-52H y puede llegar dentro de 2 y 3 horas a la Peninsula Coreana para darle el ataque nuclear sorpresivo a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTales maniobras de aumento de las fuerzas nucleares vuelven a mostrar que los yanquis hacen como hecho consumado el golpe nuclear sorpresivo contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el ano en curso, bajo el absurdo pretexto de  la \"provocacion\" y \"amenaza\" del Norte, EE.UU. se enfrasco en las maniobras sin precedentes para la provocacion de guerra nuclear movilizando los \"3 medios de ataque nuclear\" y \"6 fuerzas combativas medulares\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy en dia, las tropas agresoras norteamericanas introducen en repetidas veces las fuerzas armadas de las operaciones especiales, los submarinos y bombarderos estrategicos nucleares en el Sur de Corea y su contorno y realizan sin cesar los ejercicios extremadamente aventureros para provocar la segunda guerra coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl emplazamiento de B-1B en la isla Guam testimonia el hecho de que se tornan mas imprudentes las perversas maquinaciones de los imperialistas yanquis para ocupar por via militar a la RPDC movilizando todos los armamentos mortiferos de guerra nuclear. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTales maniobras provocativas que se hacen mas abiertas con el paso de los dias llevan la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana a la incontrolable fase catastrofica. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito coreano observa con vista penetrante los extranos movimientos militares de los bandidescos yanquis. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi se da la orden, el Ejercito Popular de Corea, armado con la espada omnipotente nuclear de justicia, convertira en un santiamen en chatarra todos los equipos belicos sofisticados del imperio yanqui inclusive B-1B y destruira completamente a las bases agresoras anti-RPDC de las tropas agresoras norteamericanas situadas en la region Asia-Pacifico. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos agresores yanquis deben actuar con prudencia."
