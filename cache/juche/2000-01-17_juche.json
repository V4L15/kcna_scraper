            "content": "Achievements of Korean youth \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, January 17 (KCNA) -- Today marks the 54th anniversary of the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   On this day, the Korean youth look back with deep emotion on their achievements recorded in the annals of the Korean revolution advancing victoriously under the banner of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Young Korean communists and patriots waged the arduous anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle commanded by the President Kim Il Sung in the darkest period of the Japanese imperialist colonial rule, thus performing immortal exploits which will always shine in the history of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Many revolutionary forerunners including Kim Hyok, Cha Kwang Su and Kim Jin took part in the anti-Japanese war with arms in their hands to set fine examples as a young vanguard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Democratic Youth League of Korea was founded on January 17, Juche 35 (1946), after the liberation of the country. It was a unified mass organization which could mobilize the Korean youth to devote themselves to the building of a new country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Brilliant exploits were performed by them during the grim Fatherland Liberation War (1950-1953) fought to repel the U.S.'s armed invasion. During this period the indomitable spirit of the Korean youth was highly displayed by a large number of youths including heroes Ri Su Bok, Kang Ho Yong, Jo Kun Sil and heroine An Yong Ae. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It was in the same spirit that was displayed by them that those heroes in the 1990s including Kim Kwang Chol and Han Yong Chol dedicated their lives to save their comrades and heroes Kim Chol Jin and Jong Kwang Son came back to their units after emerging victorious in the fight against the enemy in its rear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean youth have performed labour feats in socialist construction, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Young men and women wrought such a miracle as completing the laying of over 80 km-long broad gauge railways from Haeju to Hasong in a matter of 75 days at the end of the 1950s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Many monumental edifices, including the west sea barrage, the laying of railways in the northern part of the country, Kwangbok Street, Thongil Street are also associated with the exploits performed by the youth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Many athletes including Jong Song Ok have demonstrated the nation's honor at international matches. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All this was the result of the devoted efforts made by the Korean youth to eternally remain loyal to the two great leaders and repay their trust with brilliant successes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They are playing the role of a shock brigade in building a powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They are performing feats in different fields of the national economy such as the Pyongyang-Nampho Motorway project under the slogan \"Let all of us become heroes in a drive to glorify the 55th anniversary of the party foundation \" \r\n\r\n"

On arrival at the islet, its medical workers examined mother and her babies and took a first-aid measure. Meanwhile, the ministry of public health made full arrangements to receive them, keeping in frequent touch with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The mother and her triplets were thus safely helicoptered to Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Every step is taken for the treatment of them who are under profound care at the hospital. \r\n\r\n"

The days of the traitorous \"government\" are numbered as the people are fully determined to topple it. \r\n\r\n"

It is possible only when Japan makes a governmental apology and compensation for all the human and material losses brought by it to the Korean people in the past. It is preposterous for Japan to insist on paying money only to servicemen and civilian employees of the imperial army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan has done nothing to mend its past wrongdoings against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   During its more than 40 year-long occupation of Korea, it took away at least 6 million young and middle-aged people for slavery labour and killed some one million Korean people. It also drafted nearly 200,000 Korean women as \"comfort women for the army,\" who were killed or crippled as sexual slaves. And it plundered Korea of hundreds of thousands of pieces of national treasure and cultural relics, which the Korean people had inherited from their ancestors, and huge quantities of natural resources and products. The amount of material loss brought by the Japanese imperialists to the Korean people ran into astronomical figures. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We will surely make the Japanese government pay for the human and material losses inflicted by Japan upon the Korean people regardless of the passage of time and the replacement of generations. \r\n\r\n"
