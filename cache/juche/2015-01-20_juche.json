These disgusting behaviors remind one of a drowning man catching at even a straw.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. authorities, bereft of reason as they were hell-bent on their hostile policy toward the DPRK, staged a farce by getting such a swindler involved in their anti-DPRK human rights racket, although they were aware of his true colors. But it only brought to light the true colors of their conspiratorial \"human rights\" racket before the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. \"invited\" Sin to the UN and other arenas and staged \"hearing\" and distributed \"the report of the CI\" worked out on the basis of false testimonies as a UN document before cooking up a UN \"resolution.\" This cannot but be the most mean and shameless act of flouting the conscience of the world people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin's admission of his lies goes to prove that everything told by those who claim to be \"defectors from the north\" cannot be trusted and the above-said report is peppered with sheer lies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t So needless to say, all the \"resolutions on the human rights\" forcibly adopted against the DPRK on the basis of such false documents are invalid.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is bitter shame on the UN that it was involved in the racket against the DPRK, taken in by the U.S. plots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hostile forces should retract at once the false documents including the \"resolutions on the human rights\" based on the lies told by human scum, though belatedly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The international community should take a fair stand, keenly aware that the U.S. and other hostile forces' \"human rights\" racket against the DPRK is utterly irrelevant to the defence of genuine human rights and it is the most dangerous move to tarnish its image and find a pretext to invade it, to all intents and purposes."

He noted that it could be done by those inside the U.S., adding that he knew hackers but would not mention them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As data show, the U.S. attached importance to the cyber war worldwide and has invested a huge amount of funds in it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. set up a huge cyber command at the U.S. Defence Department and has augmented its position and authority.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Washington Post reported that in 2013 the Defence Department decided to enlarge the cyber command more than five times that in the past and beef it up as a cyber force capable of mounting hot attacks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At present the U.S. regards cyber space as a means for preemptive attack on other countries. The U.S. administration and Pentagon consider cyber space as the fifth sphere for dominating the world and are seeking hegemony over it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Having totally transferred the U.S. forces' actions in cyber sphere to offensive cyber strategy, the U.S. is working hard to realize its ambition to dominate the world at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. singled out not only those countries opposed to it including the DPRK and Iran but also regional powers, including Russia and China, and even its allies, its rivals, as targets of its cyber strategy which involves vast fields of politics, economy, military, education, culture, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The development of weapons for cyberattack has been stepped up and a huge amount of funds have been spent for its purpose with the approval of the U.S. Administration and its Congress.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. became the first in the world to mount state-sponsored cyberterror attack on other countries. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A typical example of the above-said attack was the attack on Iran's nuclear facilities by dint of vicious virus of Stuxnet in 2010.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 2011 alone witnessed over 230 cyberattack operations of the U.S. targeting different countries. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recent reports released by software companies making virus vaccine said that it is the United States where the development of software for computer hacking and vicious code for cyber attack is more rampant than any other countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is abusing its latest scientific and technological successes as war weapons for realizing its ambition for world domination.
