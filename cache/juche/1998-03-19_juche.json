But those who abandon the principle curry favour with others and repose expectations in others' way and finally fall into slavery. \r\n   Proof of this is the situation of those countries that abandoned socialism.\r\n   General Secretary Kim Jong Il clarified all the matters arising in adhering to the principle of national independence including the question of finding one's own way and means in advancing revolution and construction with one's own idea and faith, not reposing expectations in \"way\" of imperialists.\r\n   When all the countries and nations firmly defend this principle and take a road of independent development, as he taught, the cause of human independence will be accomplished without fail.    \r\n \r\n"

The current tense situation on this peninsula eloquently shows what a just self-defensive measure it was to avert war and preserve peace on the Korean peninsula.\r\n   The United States must act with discretion, mindful that the policy of strength is not almighty in solving issues.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
