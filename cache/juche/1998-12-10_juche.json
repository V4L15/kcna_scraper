            "content": "Japanese crimes since DPRK satellite launch\r\n   Pyongyang, December 10 (KCNA) -- One hundred days have passed since the DPRK launched the first artificial satellite \"Kwangmyongsong No. 1.\" \r\n   The world wonder at the successful launch of artificial satellite by the DPRK. Only Japan, however, describes the launch as \"the launch of a ballistic missile,\" betraying its true colors as the sworn enemy.\r\n   Japan's hysterics in the wake of the launch have revealed its U.S.-toeing policy with no principle, moral inferiority peculiar to Japan, which is jealous of and slandering other's success, and ignorance of international laws.\r\n   While creating a hostile atmosphere towards the DPRK to the extreme, Japan committed outrages and threats against the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) and the Koreans in Japan without hesitation. It also ran amuck to tarnish the dignified image of the DPRK in the international arena and bring into shape a \"cooperation system\" against the DPRK.  Particularly, it, taking sides with the U.S. crying for \"inspection of an underground nuclear facility,\" betrayed its intention to take the lead in carrying out the \"operation plan 5027\" for the second Korean war of aggression.\r\n   The past one hundred days also fully lay bare what Japan has sought in its frantic anti-DPRK, anti-Chongryon campaign in the wake of the artificial satellite launch in the DPRK.\r\n   The development and deployment of the \"theatre missile defense\"  system, introduction of intelligence satellites and the enactment of the \"emergency legislation\" attest the fact that Japan, considering the launch a perfect chance for the realisation of its wild ambition to stage a comeback, is trying to round off in the final stage  the preparations for criminal overseas expansion  the first target of which is the Korean peninsula.\r\n   Japan staged anti-DPRK military manoeuvres of various names together with the U.S. Forces based in Japan and South Korea and made public a plan to send the maritime \"Self-Defense Force\" to the East Sea of Korea for joint maneuvers with South Korea in next spring.\r\n   The Korean people will remember Japan's thrice-cursed crimes and make Japan pay one thousand-fold price for its ever-increasing crimes.    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n"

This is, in the final analysis, a revelation of its criminal intention to break the framework agreement and provoke a war against the DPRK.\r\n   The U.S. considers that the framework agreement is white elephant and that to break it is in complete concord with the U.S. interests. We have no idea to oppose it. It is the stand always maintained by us.\r\n   If the U.S. breaks the framework agreement and provokes a war, we will take a tough self-defensive countermeasure.\r\n   What is called \"suspicion\" and \"inspection\" may work on other countries. We cannot allow them at all. We will never do anything harmful to our security and interests in any circumstances, but answer enemy's \"retaliation\" with retaliation, an all-out war with an all-out war.\r\n   The U.S. hardline conservatives should have a good knowledge of their rival and act with discretion.    \r\n \r\n"

Moreover, an emergency alert order was issued to all the operational areas of the U.S. Pacific command to gather more information about the DPRK and intensify surveillance on it.\r\n   The United States is going to ignite the train of war to make a preemptive attack on the DPRK.\r\n   U.S. brasshats' clamourings about \"check of threats from someone\" and \"deterrent to war\" are nothing but an artifice to cover up their nature as warmongers.\r\n   The DPRK has already made a declaration.\r\n   Instantly the enemies pounce upon the DPRK, its striking means aiming at them will be fired.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n"
