            "content": "KPA Proposes Talks between DPRK and U.S. Militaries  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 13 (KCNA) -- The chief of the Panmunjom Mission of the Korean People's Army issued the following statement on July 13: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-DPRK fanatics of the U.S. are now raising more brigandish assertions as they have found themselves in a tight corner, left with no pretext to justify their moves to stifle the DPRK they have so far persistently pursued over the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are letting loose brazen-faced sophism that it is necessary to increase pressure upon the DPRK in order to force it completely dismantle its nuclear program, absurdly asserting that a series of undertakings related to the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula is now underway as a result of the U.S. policy to pressurize it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This discloses, after all, the intention of the U.S. to invariably pursue the policy to pressurize and stifle the DPRK till it has achieved its strategic goal to perpetuate its forces' presence in south Korea and the Korean division and bring down the socialist system in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this context, the KPA is compelled to clarify its stand on the vicious moves of the anti-DPRK fanatics of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aim sought by the U.S. in maintaining the armistice for more than half a century since the realization of truce was to bring down the DPRK by way of strangulating it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the U.S. found it hard to conquer DPRK by force of arms 54 years ago, it resorted to the act of deceiving the Korean and other peace-loving people of the world to achieve its aim though it put its signature to the Armistice Agreement (AA). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Just 12 days after the AA took effect the U.S. concluded the \"Mutual Defense Pact\" with south Korea, diametrically running counter to Paragraph 60 of the AA which calls for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from south Korea and a peaceful settlement of the Korean question. It thus justified the U.S. forces' presence in south Korea and made toothless the above-said paragraph of the AA which was the ultimate object of the conclusion of the AA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By doing so, the U.S. removed the obstacles lying in the way of achieving its strategic design on Korea and paved the way for turning south Korea into a nuclear base in the shortest possible time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue of the DPRK about which the U.S. has so far trumpeted like a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\" is, in essence, the nuclear issue of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has systematically introduced huge quantities of modern combat equipment as well as various types of nuclear weapons exceeding a thousand into south Korea after unilaterally declaring the abrogation of Paragraph 13 d of the AA on June 21, 1957, turning south Korea into the world's biggest nuclear base. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people have since been exposed to the incessant nuclear threat of the U.S. and have consistently demanded the pullback of U.S. nuclear weapons from south Korea and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n History goes to prove that the DPRK is the very advocator of the denuclearization of the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is ridiculous, indeed, for the U.S. to talk about the DPRK's nuclear threat and the denuclearization of the peninsula despite those hard facts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has recently worked out and pushed forward a new nuclear plan to annually produce 125 smaller nukes with tremendous explosive power which can be used in any area and any time, in Korea to be more specific. This fact offers a clear testimony showing where is the root cause of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and why is it so difficult to settle the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is a belligerent party hostile to the DPRK and the two countries are still technically at war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Under this situation nobody can deny that the confrontation between the DPRK and the U.S means a life and death one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the undeniable and legitimate right of the DPRK to have in place all the necessary self-defensive means to cope with the threat and blackmail of the U.S. in order to protect its right to existence. This is a fair and clear reason which even a mere child can easily understand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. keeps pressurizing the DPRK under the pretext of the nuclear issue and refuses to discontinue the large-scale war maneuvers it stages as an annual event in south Korea and the massive arms buildup as preparations for a preemptive strike at the DPRK, its army and people will have no option but to exert utmost efforts for further rounding off the means for retaliatory strike strong enough to cope with the U.S. nuclear attack and preemptive strike in order to protect its dignity, sovereignty and right to existence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the unshakable will and firm determination of the army and the people of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In that case, it is as clear as noonday that neither the implementation of the February 13 agreement nor success of the six-party talks will be possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such a complicated and grave situation is now prevailing on the Korean Peninsula and it is getting tenser not only because of the U.S persistent hostile policy towards the DPRK but because of the servile attitude of the UNSC which zealously patronizes and supports it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a hard fact well known to the world that the UNSC has historically conspired with the U.S. in pursuing the hostile policy of perpetuating the division of Korea against its reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As early as in the 1950s the UNSC allowed the U.S. to abuse the UN flag, so that it could cover up its armed invasion of the DPRK and its illegal occupation of south Korea. And the U.S. is still committing all sorts of crimes against the Korean people under the same flag. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For this reason, the Korean people have long pent-up grudge against the UNSC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The UNSC is obliged to observe the principle and strictly disallow the double standards in discharging its commitment to ensure global peace and security. It, however, actively joined the U.S. in dastardly racket of putting pressure upon the DPRK which had been compelled to take self-defensive measures to cope with the U.S. nuclear threat, while applying sanctions against it. This lashed the Korean people into extreme fury. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is shocking and deplorable, indeed, for the UNSC to protect the interests of big countries at the sacrifice of small countries on the basis of jungle law though it is obliged to adhere to the principle of impartiality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is by no means fortuitous that many people are skeptical about the reason for the continued existence of the UNSC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the sincere hope of the DPRK that the UNSC will take a principled and objective and impartial approach in its activities to firmly ensure the global peace and security at a time when the world is facing such complicated and difficult problems as now. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA side urges both the U.S. and the UN, a signatory to the AA, to remain true to their commitments under the AA till a new peace-keeping mechanism is built on the Korean Peninsula. Though many core paragraphs of the AA have been played down and have lost their validity, the KPA side proposes having talks between the DPRK and U.S. militaries to be attended by a UN representative, too, in any place and at any time to be agreed upon between both sides for the purpose of discussing the issues related to ensuring the peace and security on the Korean Peninsula, including Paragraph 60 of the AA as required by Paragraph 17 of the AA which calls on the DPRK and the U.S. to respect the letter and the spirit of all of the provisions of the AA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is easy to miss a chance, but difficult to get it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Siendo la contraparte beligerante de EE.UU., nuestro pais tiene su derecho legitimo a preparar todos los medios necesarios a la defensa para salvaguardar su derecho a la existencia frente a la amenaza y al chantaje del imperio. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Nadie podra objetar este principio tan imparcial y claro, de que facilmente se dara cuenta hasta un nino. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Si EE.UU. sigue presionando en lo adelante tambien a la RPDC pretextando el problema nuclear y no suspende los ejercicios belicos de gran dimension, que se desarrollan en el Sur de Corea como una ceremonia anual y un colofon de los preparativos para asestar a la segunda un golpe preventivo, y las desmesuradas maniobras de aumento armamentista, el ejercito y el pueblo de Corea se veran obligados a realizar todos los esfuerzos posibles por perfeccionar los medios de contragolpe de nivel correspondiente al ataque nuclear y al preventivo del imperio para salvaguardar su dignidad, soberania y derecho a la vida. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Esto deviene la ferrea voluntad y la inconmovible decision del ejercito y el pueblo de nuestro pais. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  De sucederse eso, resulta obvio que se echaran por tierra la ejecucion del acuerdo del 13 de febrero y las conversaciones a 6 bandas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La actual situacion tan compleja y critica de la Peninsula Coreana no se relaja no solo por la obstinada politica hostil de EE.UU. a la RPDC sino tambien por el procedimiento virulento del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU que la defiende y se adhiere a ella de modo activo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Todo el mundo sabe que el Consejo de Seguridad vino confabulandose y cooperandose historicamente con EE.UU., que se opone a la reunificacion de Corea y persigue la division de esta, en esa politica hostil. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ya en la decada de 1950 del siglo pasado habia facilitado a EE.UU. el uso de la insignia de la ONU para que este imperio pudiera encubrir la invasion armada a Corea y la ilegal ocupacion del territorio surcoreano. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Hasta la fecha, las tropas norteamericanas siguen perpetrando los crimenes de todo tipo en detrimento del pueblo coreano esgrimiendo esa bandera. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Por tal razon, el pueblo coreano abriga un rencor anejado y arraigado hacia ese aparato internacional. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En particular, esta sumamente indignado por el hecho de que esta entidad, que debe ser fiel a los principios en el cumplimiento de su mision de garantizar la paz y la seguridad del mundo y prohibir totalmente la pauta de doble rasero, se sumara activamente a la sucia campana de presion de EE.UU. a la RPDC al tomar medidas de sancion contra esta, que se vio obligada a adoptar medidas para la defensa frente a la amenaza nuclear de aquel pais. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Resulta muy sorprendente y lamentable ese gesto de la ley de selva del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU que en lugar de mantenerse imparcial, facilita los intereses de los grandes paises sacrificando a los pequenos. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  No por casualidad, hoy dia, muchas personas se muestran escepticas del motivo de la existencia de ese aparato mundial. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Esperamos sinceramente que el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU trabaje con principios, objetividad e imparcialidad en sus actividades para garantizar con firmeza la paz y la seguridad del orbe, justamente ahora cuando el mundo afronta unos problemas tan complicados y dificiles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El Ejercito Popular de Corea demanda a EE.UU. y a la ONU que como partes signatarias del Acuerdo de Armisticio de Corea, sean fieles a sus obligaciones estipuladas en este protocolo hasta que se implante un nuevo sistema de garantia de la paz en la Peninsula Coreana. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ademas, aunque fueron eliminados e invalidados muchos articulos medulares del acuerdo, ateniendose al articulo 17 que estipula que Corea y EE.UU. deben respetar las frases y el fundamento de este documento, propone las conversaciones militares entre ambas partes con la presencia de un delegado de la ONU para discutir en cualquier lugar acordado y en cualquier momento el articulo 60 y otros problemas relativos a la preservacion de la paz y la seguridad de la Peninsula Coreana. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Es facil perder una oportunidad, pero no lo es conseguirla.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
