            "content": "DPRK diplomats have little to do for DPRK-U.S.relations\r\n   Pyongyang, December 7 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK, today answering a question put by KCNA as regards the December 2 statement of the spokesman for the general staff of the Korean People's Army, said that the DPRK diplomats have little to do because the DPRK-U.S. relations are rapidly turning toward military confrontation.\r\n   Under this situation, the point at issue is that we have no other way, the spokesman said, and continued:\r\n   Over the past four years, the DPRK has faithfully implemented its obligations for nuclear freeze under the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework, whereas none of U.S. obligations has been smoothly carried out.\r\n   The project of the light-water reactors, including the groundbreaking, has been lagging far behind schedule. And under the pretext of shortage of funds the supply of heavy oil has not been made on a normal basis.  Consequently, a serious confusion has been created in the electric production in our country.\r\n   None of economic sanctions has been lifted substantially.\r\n   In a nutshell, only the DPRK has unilaterally implemented the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework. Accordingly, an issue of reexamining the agreement has been raised seriously more than once.\r\n   At this very juncture, the United States groundlessly raised a \"nuclear suspicion\" about an underground facility in the DPRK and called for inspections of the facility which are not speciflad in the agreed framework,  thus seriously insulting the dignity of the DPRK.\r\n   Worse still, it is insolently circulating an \"operation plan\" designed to \"annihilate\" someone.\r\n   The U.S. is now making a serious mistake.    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n"

Their rash act aims at currying favor with their master, the U.S. flunkeyism makes a person an idiot.\r\n   If the authorities, who are no match for us, continue raising a hue and cry over the \"suspected underground nuclear facility,\" irritating and slandering us, they will severely be punished.\r\n   Those who run amuck, ignoring our warnings, will have to pay dearly for their rash act.    \r\n \r\n"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on S. Korea's economy under IMF trusteeship\r\n   Pyongyang, December 7 (KCNA) -- Trusteeship of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has plunged the South Korean economy into an abyss of total ruin in the past one year, stresses Rodong Sinmun in a signed article today.\r\n   The article says:\r\n   Under the ruinous trusteeship, the South Korean people are wandering between life and death and the economy has been reduced to a total bankruptcy.\r\n   As a result of considering the United States a \"saviour\", the South Korean rulers have fallen into henchmen of the trusteeship and have experienced the life of \"economic slave\" in the past one year.\r\n   The South Korean economy has suffered the worst misery and has caught an \"incurable disease\".\r\n   Actually, the United States offered some amount of money to the South Korean authorities and made the South Korean economy open through the IMF to control it by dollars. It bought South Korea's domestic enterprises at a price no more than that of scrap iron, thus making excessive profits.\r\n   The IMF expects the growth rate of the South Korean economy this year to drop by seven percent. About 3,000 firms have been going bankrupt monthly in South Korea.\r\n   The trusteeship has reduced South Korean society to a wasteland of independence and democracy and a fascist rowdyism.\r\n   The one-year-long trusteeship in South Korea eloquently illustrates that the people cannot but be slaves and the politics, economy and the people's living are driven into the depth of misery under the politics of outsiders and traitors.\r\n   As to boundlessly intensify aggression and plunder.\r\n   Relief funds given by outsiders to South Korea are not a solution to the economic crisis but a poison to kill the South Korean economy in their interests.\r\n   Allegedly to get free from the IMF system the South Korean rulers are begging for foreign capital, even selling the interest of the country and the nation.\r\n   They are busy now with introducing foreign capital to tide over the \"government\" crisis, regardless of the situation of the economy and the people's living.\r\n   It is entirely due to the dependence on outside forces that South Korea is now floundering under the trusteeship.\r\n   If South Korea is to get rid of the disgrace of trusteeship and upright the economy it should discard the dependence on outside forces and take the road of independence and self-sustenance.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n"

            "content": "Independent national economy, best way out\r\n   Pyongyang, December 7 (KCNA) -- Vice-chairman O Ik Je of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, who made his permanent home in the northern half of Korea in September last year, published an article titled \"Let us go this way\" saying that the independent economy leads to the prosperity of the Korean nation and national economy.\r\n   The article came one year after the South Korean economy was placed under the trusteeship of the International Monetary Fund.\r\n   The article touched upon the catastrophic situation of the South Korean economy under the trusteeship of IMF.\r\n   It said that in the last year foreign monopoly capital wormed its way into the South Korean economy like Leucania Selarata.\r\n   It further said:\r\n   The innocent South Korean people are suffering from this economic bankruptcy. The wrong economic policy is to blame for the economic crisis. The South Korean authorities, therefore, should be punished because the blunder is of their own making.\r\n   The South Korean economy has been reduced to a proving ground of the most avaricious capitalist market economy of the U.S. style under the unctuous name of \"democratic market economy.\" the realities of South Korea attest the fact that market economy came to an end, sentenced to death. \r\n   In the article O Ik Je said that while living in the northern half of Korea for more than one year he came to know through his experiences that the line of building the independent national economy leads to the prosperity of the national economy.\r\n   The article went on:\r\n   The DPRK has built the independent economy on the strength of self-reliance. Self-reliance is vital to the nation. It pertains to the Workers' Party era. It is a great banner in building a powerful and prosperous country.\r\n   The DPRK has been able to defend the line of the independent economy and demonstrate its potentials thanks to leader Kim Jong Il. Such a wonderful event as the successful launch of an artificial satellite into orbit is the fruition of the independent national economy and a display of fireworks for its victory.\r\n   It has already been proved by history and realities that the building of the independent national economy is the road to independence which guarantees political sovereignty, the road to prosperity of activating the national economy and the road to an earthly paradise for the eternal prosperity of posterity.\r\n   The South Korean authorities should not try to win popular confidence, chanting the ridiculous slogans \"internationalisation\" and \"globalisation\", but stop depending on outsiders and courageously take the road of independence and self-reliance.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "White paper on crime-woven history of \"NSL\" \r\n   Pyongyang, December 7 (KCNA) -- The central committee of the National Democratic Front of South Korea (NDFSK) released a white paper on the crime-woven history of the \"National Security Law\" (NSL) on December 1, 50 years after the law was formulated, Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation said.\r\n   The \"NSL\" was formulated in December 1948 by the Syngman Rhee and other pro-American, pro-Japanese traitors to the nation. For the past 50 years since its formulation, it has recorded indelible thrice-cursed crimes against the fellow countrymen and nation.\r\n   The text of the law is composed of 62 points of 25 articles and its appendix has 10 points of four articles. It is an unethical law negating human ethics and morality and a repressive law of the worst type totally denying social progress, independence, democracy and reunification.\r\n   The fascist law allows the rulers to freely remove anyone who goes against their grit.\r\n   Over the past 50 years, the \"NSL\" has served as an instrument for the maintenance of pro-American dictatorial regimes and as a wrecker of independence, democracy and reunification.\r\n   The successive rulers of South Korea have used this law for the purpose of enforcing their flunkeyist and treacherous policies and of prolonging their power.\r\n   The present regime, styling itself a \"government for the people,\" is also zealously resorting to this law.\r\n   A large number of patriots and people from all walks of life have been ruthlessly killed on charges of violating the law.  All the progressive dissident organisations which were formed for the independence and democracy of society and national reunification were dissolved or have been suppressed.\r\n   In less than one year since the appearance of the present regime, more than 300 people have been detained and as many as 450 prisoners of conscience have been persecuted on the strength of the law.\r\n   Angry voices calling for the repeal of the law are loudly ringing out from South Korean people from all walks of life and overseas Koreans and in foreign countries including the United States.\r\n   The \"NSL\" is a cancer-like law which bars independence, democracy and reunification and blocks social progress.\r\n   The present regime must discard the anachronistic ambition to prolong its days with the \"NSL,\" a leftover of dictatorship, but abolish it without delay.    \r\n   \r\n"
