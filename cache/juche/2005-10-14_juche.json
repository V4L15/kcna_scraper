            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on U.S. Senate's Decision to Cut down Cost for Research of Smaller Nukes \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 13 (KCNA) -- The U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee decided to deduct a total amount of 4.5 million US dollars, expenses for the research of smaller nukes, from the appropriations for the fiscal year 2006, which has put a brake on the U.S. administration's moves for military expansion to complete the development of nuclear weapons of practical use for smashing anti-U.S. independent countries, says Rodong Sinmun Thursday in a signed commentary.\r\n The deduction of a total expense for the research of smaller nukes deals a heavy blow to the neo-conservative forces of the U.S. in their attempt to pressurize those countries incurring their displeasure with nuclear weapons, the commentary notes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bringing to light the reason why the U.S. Senate had no choice but to make such a decision, the commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The military expenditure of the U.S. dreaming of world domination has snowballed in recent years close to 500 billion US dollars. This is a record high in the U.S. history. It is, therefore, as clear as noonday that the U.S. is not in a position to squander a large amount of money for the research of smaller nukes given that anti-war spirit is mounting within the U.S. day by day and the public is growing suspicious about the U.S. occupation of Iraq.\r\n The decision is also related to the big chaos caused by increased damage by hurricane that swept the country in late August. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a result, the U.S. administration was compelled to stop developing the nukes because it found itself in a deplorable plight due to the tremendous expenses for Iraqi war and damage by hurricane Katrina. The U.S. bellicose forces were hit hard by it and have become limp.\r\n The recent U.S. Senate decision shows that the U.S. warlike forces' moves for a nuclear war cannot go ahead as they intend.\r\n But the U.S. ambition for nuclear weapons will remain unchanged.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
