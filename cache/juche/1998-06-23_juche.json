Kidnapping has been its  major state policy.\r\n  The Japanese imperialists' abduction and forcible drafting of young and middle-aged Koreans far surpassed the slave-hunting in medieval ages in terms of barbarity.\r\n   They openly kidnapped and forcibly drafted Koreans under the name of \"conscription\" and \"compulsory labour.\"\r\n   Those victims who were once kidnapped and conscripted for military service and forced labour and as \"comfort women\" were unanimous in saying that they were not \"conscripted\" but forcibly abducted and arrested.\r\n   The process of the forcible drafting of Korean women as \"comfort women\" eloquently exposed its true colors as kidnapping. \r\n   The criminal kidnapping of Koreans by Japan, which took discrimination and contempt, maltreatment and murder of other nations as its way of existence, was an unethical and inhumane war crime negating human rights to qualifications and status.\r\n   Exposing the heinous crime of Japan in killing abducted young and middle-aged Koreans in groups, the statement continued:\r\n   After they started the Pacific War in 1941, the Japanese imperialists occupied Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and other southeast Asian countries and many islands on the pacific and turned them into hell of backbreaking labour and graveyards for drafted Koreans.\r\n   The Japanese imperialist aggression army used young Korean men and women in battlefields and occupied areas, as workers and \"comfort women\" and murdered them in groups.\r\n   Arafune, former deputy speaker of the house of representatives from the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, told voters:\r\n   \"143,000 Korean comfort women died. They were murdered by the Japanese army.\"\r\n   Millions of people fell victims to kidnapping, drafting and massacre by the Japanese imperialists.  Such truculent atrocities have left indelible wounds and grudge on the Korean people.\r\n   This notwithstanding, Japan is still indifferent to its past crimes and, on the contrary, is kicking up an anti-DPRK racket over \"suspected kidnapping.\"\r\n   The Japanese authorities must fully admit their responsibility for all the criminal acts including the forcible drafting of Koreans and thoroughly investigate and publish the truth behind them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

His insistence is precisely the stand of the Japanese government authorites.\r\n   It is nobody's secret that Japan has wanted to become a nuclear power and made all preparations for nuclear armament and is watching for a chance.\r\n   Japan, the only victim of nuclear holocaust in the world, knows the danger and catastrophic consequences of nuclear weapons better than any other countries.\r\n   It, however, has set its face against the ban on the use of nuclear weapons at international meetings. Its opposition is motivated by its ulterior intention to use nuclear weapons.\r\n   No one can vouch that in case overseas military operation of the \"self-defence forces\" is approved by law and an institutional mechanism is set up for it Japan will not take the road of overseas aggression along with nuclear weapons. \r\nThe Japanese reactionaries are steeped in militarist idea of overseas aggression to the marrow of their bones.\r\n   Minju Joson in a signed commentary says the Japanese reactionaries are making desperate efforts to realise their design of overseas expansion, even relying on nuclear weapons, but they will get nothing but destruction from it. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
