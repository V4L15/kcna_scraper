            "content": "Lee Myung Bak's Sycophancy toward U.S. under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, April 16 (KCNA) -- Lee Myung Bak of south Korea is kicking up an anti-DPRK nuclear racket, asserting whenever a chance presents itself that \"priority\" should be given to \"strengthening\" of relations with the United States and the \"north's nuclear issue\" can be solved only through the south Korea-U.S. cooperation. Meanwhile, he zealously fawns on Japan, talking about \"mature relations\" or \"future-oriented relations\" with it, the relations that disregard the unprecedentedly heinous crimes the Japanese imperialists committed in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on his behaviors, Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He attaches such unreasonable conditions as \"no nukes and opening\" to the relationship with the fellow countrymen while devotedly making eye at the aggressive outsiders. This is the true nature of traitor Lee. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for Lee, he is a foul pro-American sycophant, as he became a faithful adherent to \"pragmatism\" advocated by the U.S. while engaging himself in money-making business long ago, and a diehard moneygrubber and a swindler. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He has been so imprudent to claim that south Korea would help the north to get the per capita income to 3,000 dollars if it abandons its nuclear program and \"opens\" its door. This is nothing but imitation of the anti-DPRK policy pursued by the U.S. hard-line conservatives seeking to stifle it while forcing it to dismantle its nuclear program first. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lee Myung Bak group should have drawn a lesson from the reality that the Bush administration came out to dialogue with the DPRK, being aware of the fact, though belatedly, that the U.S. hard-line confrontation policy could not work on the DPRK. But they are recklessly rushing about, not knowing what is the right or wrong, as they lack political career and are seized by improper desire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If he was going to do something as the chief executive, he should have done things helpful to the trend of times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, he has repeated the wrong policy of the U.S. hard-line conservatives because he has no proper political idea but depends on foreign forces. It is clear that such behavior would derail the inter-Korean relations and have bad effect on the situation in and around the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lee Myung Bak gentries would be well advised to act with discretion if they do not want to be condemned as pro-American sycophantic traitors going against the desire of the nation and the trend of the June 15 era of reunification forever by all the countrymen.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
