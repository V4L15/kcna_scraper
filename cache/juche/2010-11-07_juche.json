            "content": "Attempt to Evade Blame for Deteriorated Inter-Korean Relations Blasted\r\nPyongyang, November 7 (KCNA) -- Minister of Unification Hyon In Thaek and newly-appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Kim Song Hwan of south Korea have recently repeated such assertion that the north should be held responsible for what it has done in order to normalize the inter-Korean relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on this fact, a news analyst of Minju Joson today says:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than Hyon and other ultra-right conservatives who arrested the favorably developing inter-Korean relations with the watchword of \"no nukes, opening and 3000 dollars\". So it is those conservative forces that should settle such knotty problem.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently the reunion of the separated families and relatives from the north and the south was held, thanks to the active step and sincere efforts of the DPRK side, and working talks between the authorities for the resumption of Mt. Kumgang tourism are put on the agenda. The south Korean people and overseas compatriots have demanded that the conservative authorities of south Korea take measures to warm up the north-south relations, not chilling the atmosphere of dialogue provided with much efforts. Meanwhile, such argument is heard even from the ruling quarters of south Korea that the authorities should turn to the improvement of the north-south relations since the continuation of the deteriorated relations is unfavorable for them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This trend of the times is driving into a tight corner Hyon who invented the watchword of \"no nukes, opening and 3000 dollars\" and has taken the lead in the racket for confrontation between the fellow countrymen, Kim who has enticed the chief executive to bedevil the inter-Korean relations and other ultra-right conservatives of south Korea. That is why Hyon and Kim are making desperate efforts to shift the responsibility for the bedeviled north-south relations on to other. So, they pretend to be interested in the improved inter-Korean relations, frequently making the said assertion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hyon and Kim would be well advised to apologize to the nation for the crimes committed by them to hurt the fellow countrymen so far and immediately halt the moves for confrontation with fellow countrymen, far from impudently repeating the said assertion. This is a solution to the problem brought up by themselves."

Only when all the countries and nations strengthen international unity and cooperation on the basis of the principles of independence, equality and mutual respect, is it possible to create favorable conditions for realizing independence of each country and nation and accelerate the cause of global independence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The peoples of developing countries should maintain the principle of collective self-reliance to discard dependence on developed countries and expand and develop the South-South cooperation in the spirit of independence and solidarity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Many countries in the world attach importance to the military affairs and direct big efforts to the defense upbuilding, following the Songun idea and the Songun politics of the Workers' Party of Korea. And they are boosting military exchange and cooperation while establishing the collective defense security system. The Songun idea and the Songun politics, almighty treasured sword and invincible banner, give strength and courage to the world progressive people but deal a telling blow to the imperialist aggression forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Comprehensive development of the South-South cooperation means the anti-imperialist struggle and the key to victory in the struggle lies in Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Without possession of great military strength is it impossible to expand and develop the South-South cooperation and achieve the safe socio-economic development.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Powerful military strength makes it possible to repel any aggression and war moves of the imperialists and further expand and develop the South-South cooperation."
