            "content": "U.S. pressure upon S. Korea to purchase its arms flailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 21 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary assails the Bush administration for putting pressure upon South Korea to purchase more U.S.-made weapons to stifle the DPRK by force of arms.\r\n The commentary says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. pressure is aimed to bring huge profits to the U.S. munitions monopolies and increase its military threat to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is more serious is the fact that by pressurizing South Korea into purchasing their weapons the U.S. imperialists seek to escalate their aggressive hostile policy toward the DPRK in a bid to harass peace on the Korean peninsula and bring the dark clouds of a new war to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as day that the U.S. imperialists are keen to derail the process of reconciliation, cooperation and reunification on the Korean peninsula with strength, hamstring the Korean people's efforts to implement the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and, furthermore, bring the scourge of a nuclear war to the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation can never remain a passive on-looker to these challenges and provocation of the warmongers at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. dares to launch a war of aggression against the DPRK defying its repeated warning, the DPRK will wipe out the aggressors and blow up their arsenal meant for invasion of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to behave with discretion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean military quarters are keen on purchasing weapons for mass killings of compatriots, yielding to the U.S. pressure in utter disregard of the destiny of the country and the nation. They are also well advised to behave with reason.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Amyda sinensis, living monument\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 21 (KCNA) -- The part of the Ryesong River that flows through Kurak-ri, Jisok-ri and Chimgyo-ri in Singye county, North Hwanghae Province, hosts Amyda Sinensis, a kind of terrapin.\r\n It is an ideal habitat for these terrapins because its bed is thickly layered with sand and gravel and it follows a rapid, winding course with alternating fords and deep waters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The species is called a \"gold terrapin\" for its yellowish shell unlike other kinds of terrapin. Normally it is 30 cm long and weighs 0.7 kg, just over 0.8 kg at the most. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It lives on the sand-and-gravel river bed, and towards the end of October, when the water temperature falls below 10 degree c, it digs a hole in the bottom for hibernation that lasts until late the following April or early may, when the temperature gets above 10 degree c. it feeds on limnetic lobster, earthworm, mud snail and small fish. although its appetite is not big, it consumes all the food it secures. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After six or seven years, it starts to mate in late may or early June, when the water temperature is around 18 degree c. Seven or ten days later it lays eggs in a hollow dug on a sand beach usually 30 to 40 metres away from the river and covers them with sand. Its litters contain 13 to 30 eggs and they are hatched in 55 days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This habitat is important for study of the distribution and ecology of this endangered species and its preservation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The 20km-long stretch of the river (600 hectares in area) has been officially designated as an Amyda Sinensis habitat, and protection measures are in force.    \r\n\r\n"

That is why not only Russia and china but also U.S. allies are strongly opposed to this development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. reckless MD development will upset the global strategic balance and, at the same time, trigger off another arms race on this planet. This is in contravention of the world people's desire for peace and disarmament. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States should stop such arrogant moves, mindful that the MD will only precipitate its own isolation and destruction.    \r\n\r\n"
