            "content": "Kim Jong Un Looks Round Construction Site of Rest Home for Scientists \r\n Pyongyang, May 29 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, first chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, went round the construction site of the rest home for scientists. \n\t\t\t\t\t In January this year Kim Jong Un visited Lake Yonphung right after giving field guidance to the State Academy of Sciences. He finally confirmed the site for the rest home which was chosen by him last year. He not only took detailed measures for designing it and ensuring the supply of construction materials but instructed KPA Unit 267 to undertake the construction. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Inspecting the construction site, he was very pleased with the atmosphere in the work site of the unit, adding that it was worthy of the guard unit and hero unit. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round different places of the construction site, he set forth the tasks to be fulfilled for building the rest home to be impeccable. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed the need to build all the buildings and facilities of the rest home in the best quality as befitting the highly civilized socialist country and to be proud of in the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"It is necessary to build the gatepost of the rest home in a peculiar style and successfully construct a railway station close to it to the convenience of the holidaymakers,\" he noted, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"The open-air playground for volleyball, tennis and badminton now under construction should have multi-purpose sporting facilities so that holidaymakers may enjoy skating in winter days.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He called for building well an indoor swimming pool, a video room and an angling site and constructing modern welfare and service facilities including a public bath at the rest home.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said: \"The upper part of the boundary between land and water in the compound of the rest home should be covered with sand and its lower part with shingle. The parking lot and the promenade should be covered with blue stone.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underscored the need to simultaneously push forward the construction and the work for installing a geothermal cooling and heating system and the production of furniture and fittings and make good arrangements for the operation of the rest home.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting the soldier-builders of Unit 267 of the KPA are creating a new speed by bringing about a leap forward in construction while building the rest home for scientists, he expressed conviction that by this speed they would certainly complete the project by the date the party promised scientists to wind up.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He urged all the officials in the field of construction to learn from the work style of Unit 267 of the KPA.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Hwang Pyong So, Pyon In Son and Ma Won Chun."

Korean Regime's Desperate Racket for Cooking up \"North Wind\"\r\n Pyongyang, May 29 (KCNA) -- The south Korean puppet regime is desperately working to cook up the \"north wind\" with the elections to the local self-governing bodies at hand.\n\t\t\t\t\t It dares accuse the DPRK, claiming the latter abuses the ferry Sewol disaster for \"politically-motivated purposes\" and attempts to \"interfere in the elections\" and the like.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t While floating the fiction that the north would pose a threat by conducting a nuclear test, it is egging die-hard bellicose elements of the diplomatic and military circles onto letting loose such invectives that \"the unification should be achieved with south Korea as a main player\" and \"the north is a country which should disappear\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not content with kicking up the racket of \"drones from the north\", it is now hell-bent on confrontation with compatriots in the north and war moves against them after opening to public the \"five-phase military strategy toward the north for unification.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a clear revelation of its sinister design to tide over its ruling crisis caused by the ferry Sewol disaster and to turn the situation before the elections in its favor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park Geun Hye regime of south Korea is panic-stricken, pressurized by the public resentment and the anti-\"government\" actions of people of various circles mounting high in the wake of the ferry Sewol tragedy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This cannot but be a telling blow to the regime keen to consolidate its base for unpopular rule through the elections to the local self-governing bodies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hence, the puppet group is again resorting to the racket for fabricating the \"north wind\", a trite-method employed by it whenever the situation turns unfavorable to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Clumsy, indeed, is this racket intended to divert the public mindset to confrontation with compatriots in the north and crackdown upon progressive forces and thus justify its fascist rule.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how desperately the Park group may work, the ruckus of \"north wind\" can never work as its conspiratorial nature has already been brought to light.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean people has branded the farce of \"drones from the north\" kicked up by the regime as part of the \"north wind\" campaign, as a poor charade and a reckless act of describing the door of a toilet as a drone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the group floated a story about the \"north's shelling\" after firing at warships of the Korean People's Army, it was pressurized by the people to produce evidence. However, it let loose such sheer sophism that it was impossible to confirm the firing as the radar for detecting the \"base of firing\" failed to operate at that time only to become a laughing stock of the public.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently, even lawmakers from the \"Saenuri Party\" admitted that the racket of opening to public the minutes of the north-south summit kicked up by the Park group with the approach of the December, 2012 \"presidential\" election was a farce staged in collusion with the puppet Intelligence Service to grab power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As proved by history and reality, the \"north wind\" ruckus is a hideous crime perpetrated by the Park group to mock at and stamp out the public mindset and thus maintain its unpopular rule.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That is why south Korean people from all walks of life are now escalating their actions against the regime, holding \"the authorities are seeking a way out of its crisis caused by the ferry Sewol disaster through the fabrication of north wind\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group is bound to meet ruin, hit hard by the public angered by its criminal moves."
