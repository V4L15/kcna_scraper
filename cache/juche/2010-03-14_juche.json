            "content": "Minju Joson: DPRK Will Bolster Up Its War Deterrent\r\n Pyongyang, March 14 (KCNA) -- The DPRK will bolster up its war deterrent under the uplifted banner of Songun as long as the U.S. military threat and provocations against it persist.\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson Sunday observes this in a signed commentary.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All parts of south Korea reek of gunpowder due to the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military exercises being staged by the U.S. imperialist trigger-happy forces together with the south Korean puppet troops. Consequently, the situation on the Korean Peninsula is inching close to a touch-and-go situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This clearly indicates that though the U.S. is loud-mouthed about \"dialogue,\" it remains unchanged in its wild ambition to stifle the DPRK by force of arms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the scenario of the U.S. imperialist war-like forces to strain the situation on the peninsula and mount a surprise preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK in a bid to bring it under its control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The on-going joint war maneuvers are of very dangerous, aggressive and provocative nature in their program, feature and scale. They are exercises for a nuclear war against the DPRK with a preemptive nuclear strike being their main operation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has become clearer that the U.S. is only seeking to unleash a nuclear war to stifle the DPRK by force of arms, far from defusing its nuclear threat despite Pyongyang's sincere efforts to denuclearize the peninsula. The DPRK is, therefore, left with no option but to bolster up its war deterrent. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The service personnel and people of the DPRK regard its sovereignty and dignity as dearer than their own lives. They will mobilize all the military potentials built so far and mercilessly wipe out the aggressors, should they intrude into its inviolable air, land and seas even 0.001 mm.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. would be well advised to stop running amuck, properly understanding the DPRK's will for strong counteraction and tremendous power."
