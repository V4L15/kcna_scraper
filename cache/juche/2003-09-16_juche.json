Korean Authorities Urged to Reject U.S. Demand for Troop Dispatch \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 15 (KCNA) -- The south Korean authorities are reportedly talking about dispatching 1,200 additional troops to Iraq including 800 combat troops of a special warfare division, yielding to the U.S. pressure.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary says that this can not but be a mean pro-U.S. subservient act and an anti-people and anti-national criminal act lashing the whole nation into a fury.\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Grand National Party zealously hailed the additional troop dispatch to Iraq, praising it as a \"positive step.\" This has brought into bolder relief once again the pro-U.S. flunkeyist and traitorous nature of this party which stoops to any infamy in serving the U.S., its master. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Submission to foreign forces in disregard of the dignity and the interests of the nation would lead the nation to disgraceful ruin and death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should ponder over the grave consequences to be entailed by their traitorous troop dispatch to Iraq and resolutely reject the U.S. demand for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the nation is closely following the south Korean authorities' attitude.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's Move to Institute War Constitution Denounced \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 15 (KCNA) -- It was recently disclosed that the chief executive of the Japanese government instructed the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan to work out a \"plan for the revision of the constitution\" until 2005. He was reported to have singled out Article 9 of the \"Peace Constitution\" as one of the specific targets of the revision.\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun today carries a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"constitutional revision\" is, in essence, aimed at replacing the \"peace constitution\", which Japan has so far advocated as a symbol of \"peace state,\" by a war constitution in a bid to legalize Japan's moves to emerge a war state and its overseas military actions, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fact that the chief executive of Japan gave an official instruction to work out the \"plan for the constitutional revision\" indicates that Japan's arrangements for its militarization and overseas aggression are now being accelerated at a final phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the intention of the Japanese reactionary ruling quarters to legalize Japan's militarization and overseas expansion completely free of the binding force of the \"Peace Constitution\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's militarization and preparations for overseas aggression are basically close to completion in the ideological, military and legal aspects. And it has accumulated enough experience for overseas operations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists' old dream of \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\" which resulted in their defeat is reviving, supported and encouraged by the present Japanese ruling quarters and guaranteed by law. In the 21st century, Asia is again exposed to the Japanese militarist threat of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Asian people should be vigilant against the Japanese militarists' militarization and overseas aggression as harmful as \"cancer\" to peace and intensify the struggle to foil such moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's efforts to increase its self-defensive capability are aimed to cope not only with the U.S. moves to stifle the DPRK but with Japan's threat of reinvasion which is increasing as the days go by. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionary ruling quarters would be well advised to face up to the reality and give up their criminal move to fabricate the war constitution.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

In this regard Rodong Sinmun today says in a signed commentary:\r\n Such moves of the United States are blatant military provocations to the DPRK and they may push the DPRK-U.S. relations to an explosive phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The multi-national joint military exercises aimed to intercept and apprehend DPRK ships sailing in the open seas are preemptive military operations against the DPRK. This indicates that the United States has no will to drop its hostile policy towards the DPRK and has invariably pursued its plan to stifle the DPRK by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is keen on rounding off the mode of its military strategic action to stifle the DPRK while paying lip-service to \"dialogue.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's missile development and build-up of nuclear deterrent force are aimed to protect the sovereignty of the country and the nation from the U.S. aggression. No one can fault this as it does not pose any threat to anyone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Increasing national defence capability for self-defence is the most important affair of the state under the present situation where the U.S. military moves to stifle the DPRK have reached their height. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a gangster-like logic for the United States to ask the DPRK to drop its gun while levelling its gun at the latter. The U.S. should understand why the DPRK prizes arms so much and is doing the best to strengthen the army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The solution to the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. and improved relations between them entirely depend on the U.S. stand and attitude, the commentary concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

General Assembly and the reality of the Korean peninsula in which dialogue and cooperation are brisk according to the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, the statement said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States, however, is keeping huge troops in south Korea and continuing to bring latest combat technical equipment there and pushing forward at a grave phase all kinds of military plans including the \"operation plan 5030\" and \"arms buildup plan\" while attempting to disarm the DPRK and mount a preemptive strike at it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration should think twice, well aware of the Songun policy, the might of the singlehearted unity and strong military power of the DPRK, withdraw its troops from south Korea and refrain from obstructing any longer the efforts of the Korean people to reunify the country by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, K. P. Sharma Oli, chairman of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Committee of Nepal, and Surya Lal, chairman of the Peace Action Committee of Nepal, made public a joint statement on September 5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement expressed full support to the Korean people in their just struggle for national reunification and strongly demanded that the U.S. government pull its troops and weapons out of south Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "All Koreans Called Upon to Turn Out to Defend Peace from War\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 13 (KCNA) -- When all Koreans in the north and the south and abroad unite close in the struggle to protect the dignity and sovereignty of the nation and achieve the country's reunification, no ferocious aggressors can ever provoke our nation and anti-reunification forces can never raise their heads to run wild.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the Korean nation's struggle for the country's reunification is facing all kinds of challenges of enemies at home and abroad, the article says: The United States is posing a serious nuclear threat to the right to existence of our nation and a tiny handful of anti-reunification forces are working hard to block the advance of the compatriots by raising the adverse wind of confrontation and antagonism in the Cold War era. \r\n The struggle for peace against war is an urgent task before the Korean nation at present. The U.S. is the main target of this struggle. The U.S. is working hard to create impression that it is ready to solve the nuclear problem between the DPRK and the U.S. peacefully, talking about \"negotiating method\" and \"diplomatic solution\". This, is, however a lie. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the high-handed action and reckless military provocations of the U.S. imperialists are tolerated, the Korean nation would not be able to escape from such horrible disasters as a nuclear war, much less achieving the reunification of the country. The Korean nation has nothing to fear. The DPRK's war deterrent force represents a treasured sword for self-defence to firmly protect the nation's sovereignty and right to existence from foreign forces' armed invasion. All the Koreans in the north and the south and abroad should intensify the struggle for peace against war, confident of victory and frustrate all reckless moves of the U.S. imperialists for a war of aggression.\r\n It is as important as the anti-U.S. struggle to punish flunkeyist traitors and anti-reunification elements at home. Such ultra-right conservatives of south Korea as the Grand National Party are the wicked foes of national reconciliation, unity and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The dark fascist society is reappearing in south Korea as evidenced by the fact that the people who turned out in the just pro-reunification patriotic road are thrown into prison and taken to court and innocent people are meeting tragic deaths owing to the ultra-right fascist forces, trash of history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people should not remain a passive onlooker to the desperate moves of the ultra right fascist forces including the Grand National Party to stem the trend of the history against the era of national independence and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nobody can replace the nation in defending the peace on the Korean peninsula and saving it from a crisis. The peace on this land and the security of the nation should be defended through the struggle of the Korean nation under any circumstances.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
