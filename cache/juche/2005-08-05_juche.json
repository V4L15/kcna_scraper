It is of great theoretical and practical significance that in his work he formulated the three charters for national reunification and clarified important and principled matters arising in accomplishing the cause of reunification and improving the north-south relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the work is an encyclopedic and important document which would serve as unshakable guidelines in firmly defending and successfully carrying forward the President's idea of national reunification and leadership exploits and achieving the country's reunification, the article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historic events and great successes achieved in the movement for national reconciliation, unity and reunification over the last 8 years eloquently prove the attraction and vitality of the work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historic Pyongyang summit and the publication of the June 15 joint declaration ushered in an era of independence and reunification and brought about a new phase and signal successes unprecedented in the efforts to warm up inter-Korean relations and the movement for national reunification. These are precious successes made in the course of the struggle to carry out the President's last instructions for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the great exploit to be specially recorded in the history of national reunification that Kim Jong Il clearly indicated ways of carrying out the President's last instructions for national reunification and injected dynamism into the movement for the country's reunification with his energetic leadership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As taught by Kim Jong Il, the Koreans should regard the President's idea of national reunification and leadership exploits as the most priceless legacy and a solid foundation for accomplishing the cause of national reunification and firmly uphold and glorify them in order to carry out his last instructions for national reunification without fail.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
