Korean workers urged to unite and fight \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 2 (KCNA) -- The director of the worker-peasant department of the central committee of the National Democratic Front of South Korea issued a statement on April 30 to mark May Day, Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation reported.   He denounced the present regime for trying to block the massive action of the 10 million workers, stifle the mounting labor movement and ensure government security with May Day as an occasion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He said:   The workers have courageously risen in massive struggle to restore their right to existence and lead a  minimum of worthy life. This is an absolutely just exercise of their right.   The \"people\"-veiled authorities must renounce the labor policy that kills the workers, unconditionally accept their just demands and immediately stop the suppression of workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The workers must fight to the last till their vital demands for a stop to the present regime's unilateral \"restructuring\" and lay-off, for wage hike and for freedom of democratic labor union activities are met.   The 10 million workers must unite firm, fight out for vital rights and democracy and develop this struggle into a struggle to oppose the \"people\"-veiled authorities and frustrate the colonial economic trusteeship of the United States, on which the authorities depend. \r\n\r\n"

This is a product of the U.S. vicious moves to interfere in the internal affairs of Cuba and destroy its revolutionary socialist system, says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It goes on:   The U.S. \"human rights\" offensive is one of the moves to isolate and stifle the Republic of Cuba. Cuba has taken steps to intensify the anti-crime struggle, defend the sovereignty of the country  and develop its economy. The United States sponsored this resolution, vociferating about \"suppression of dissidents\" and \"violation of human rights.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is more ridiculous for the South Korean authorities known as the most hideous violators of human rights in the world to have come out to support the resolution. They once again laid bare their true colors as despicable stooges who  do not feel ashamed of clinging to the coattails of Americans.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The true colors of the United States as the  arch violator of human rights are brought to light before the world. The United States is well advised to stop behaving ludicrously, clearly mindful of its position of being  on top of the  list of criminals to be brought to the international tribunal of human rights. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
