This calls on the U.S. to sell such cluster bombs to other countries and develop new type cluster bombs in the fixed period. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun Wednesday runs a signed commentary which notes that not a few cluster bombs are now being used in various dispute-and war-torn areas of the world where peaceable inhabitants ceaselessly lose their lives or become disabled due to the explosion of the dud bombs in roads and bushes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If there is no country producing or spreading the cluster bombs, those bombs will not be used in battles or in wars at random and casualties will drop accordingly, the commentary observes, branding the U.S. as the arch criminal using, producing and spreading those cluster bombs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"Human Rights Watch,\" an international human rights organization, recently disclosed that the U.S. is the world's leading producer and exporter of cluster bombs and it is the world's biggest possessor of those bombs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is talking about the reduction of the cluster bombs with high rate of failure to explode not because it feels guilty conscience of the crimes committed by it in the past or it stands for world peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its assertion is nothing but sophism intended to increase the delivery of cluster bombs to its allied countries. Through this the U.S. seeks to gain more profits and arm its allied forces with weapons of mass destruction (WMD). That is to say, it wishes to kill two birds with one stone by use of cluster bombs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. can never cover up its true colors as a spreader of WMD.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
