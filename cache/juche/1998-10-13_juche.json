So the result is zero.\"\r\n   By describing the \"signing of humiliating fishing agreement\" as \"successful\" the South Korean chief executive proved to be a man imbued with pro-Japanese flunkeyism and stand to the marrow. During his stay in Japan, he made no word about Japan's criminal \"comfort women issue\" which creates quite a stir among the world people for the present, and \"claim to dominion over Tok Islet\".\r\n   In actuality, the press of South Korea are lamenting that the \"Fishing Agreement\" will cost South Korea more than 500 billion won a year.  His describing this as \"successful\" brings his disgraceful treachery into  bolder relief.\r\n   Japan's granting of the dlrs three billion loan on his lips is little different from what the loans Japan has so far granted in a bid to increase economic dependence on Japan.\r\n   That is well known to the world and eloquently proved by a deficit of astronomical amount in trade with Japan.\r\n   In this situation the South Korean chief executive promised to open the door to the decadent Japanese culture and invited the Japanese \"Emperor\" to visit South Korea. And he has gone the length of saying that he would get \"understanding\" from the people full of rancour against the Japanese imperialists.\r\n   The recent trip to Japan is, in the final analysis, a sycophantic trip to Japan without parallel in history and one more blot on history of the nation. \r\n\r\n"

Paektu  made a brilliant figure as the mountain of the sun and the sunrise on Mt. Paektu became famous.\r\n   Mt.

            "content": "Tok Islet is inseparable from Korean territory\r\n     Pyongyang, October 13 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today runs an article titled \"Tok Islet is inseparable from Korean territory\" by Dr. Jong Nam Yong.\r\n    Calling attention to the fact that on September 25 the South Korean authorities and their Japanese masters defined the water area around Tok Islet as \"jointly controlled  waters\" and reached a \"Fishing Agreement,\" under which Japanese and South Korean fishermen may engage themselves in \"free fishing operation,\" the author of the article says:\r\n   According to the UN conventions on marine laws and marine usage, if there are an islet and a traditional fishing ground in water area between the countries opposite to each other, the  water area around them constitutes the terrioral waters and economic zone of the country that have the islet and fishing ground.\r\n   The definition of the water area around Tok Islet as a \"jointly controlled waters\" in the \"agreement\" denies the existence of Tok Islet inseparable from the territory of Korea, before anything else.\r\n   The islet is in the heart of the East Sea of Korea (131 degrees 52 minutes 30 seconds of the east longitude and 37 degrees 14 minutes 30 seconds of the north latitude). It has some 30 islets around bigger tong and so islets.\r\n   The definition also denies the legal possession of the islet.\r\n   The islet is part of the Korean territory in view of the principles of discovery, possession and use, which are internationally recognised irrefutable evidence of legal possession of no-man's island and in view of a legislative step of a state to possess it.\r\n   Historical materials and documents of Korea and Japan ascertain that the ancestors of Korea discovered the islet before 500 A.D. and since then they have systematically used it as a major fishing ground. It was not until the end of the 16th century that Japan came to know that there was Tok Islet in the East Sea of Korea. From the legislative point of view Korea took a step to put the islet under the control of Uljin, Kangwon Province, in 512 A.D., or nearly 1,400 years before Japan did.\r\n   Judging from the map mark which is an visual indication of the legal possession of the territory, the islet belongs to Korea.\r\n   The wood-block map published by Korea at the end of the 16th century, which is preserved in the Samseong Publishing Co., Ltd. Museum of South Korea, and all other Korean maps published by other countries clearly show that Tok Islet belongs to Korea.\r\n   The Japanese maps published before the Japanese imperialists' occupation of Korea did not define the islet as theirs.\r\n   In the 1690s the then governor-general of  Japan,  and the Tokugawa Shogunate admitted that the islet belonged to Korea111d sent Korea an official diplomatic document in this regard. Even after the Second World War Japan made it clear that the islet belonged to Korea.\r\n   Japan also signed the San Francisco Peace Treaty in 1951. \r\nThe treaty deprived Japan of all rights, titles and claims to the mainland of Korea, Jeju, Komun and Ulrung (with Tok Islet included) islands.\r\n   It is stipulated in the \"fishing accord\" that Japanese and South Korean fishermen may engage themselves in free fishing operation in the \"jointly controlled waters,\" \r\nMeaning that Japan swallowed up  the traditional fishing ground around Tok Islet of Korea, lock, stock and barrel.\r\n   The term \"free fishing operation\" means that Japan and South Korea may engage themselves in fishing to their heart's content according to their ability. It is obvious that as Japan is superior to South Korea in view of the number of fishing boats and equipment, Japan has the fishing ground to itself.\r\n   With nothing the South Korean authorities can conceal the flunkeyist, anti-national nature of the recently-signed \"fishing accord\" with Japan.\r\n   Tok Islet still remains part of Korea and the water area around the islet is the traditional fishing ground of Korea. \r\nThis historic fact and legal ground are invariable. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

We, therefore, cannot but take a serious note of it.\r\n   If their crying represents the U.S. political stand, the matter is more serious.\r\n   The construction of light water reactors pursuant to the framework agreement  has proceeded no further than the ground-breaking ceremony. The delivery of heavy oil is not progressing as scheduled.\r\n   Only a few of the sanctions against the DPRK, basic to the framework agreement, have been lifted as a mere symbol. \r\nThe sanctions which may bring a practical stop to the hostile policy have not been lifted at all.\r\n   The DPRK has a lot of civil underground structures  now under construction. The U.S. demands to verify them, claiming that they are \"underground nuclear facilities.\" \r\n  The U.S. attempt cannot be construed otherwise than a sinister intention to disarm the DPRK and violate its sovereignty.\r\n   The U.S. ridiculous allegations that the DPRK's launch of artificial satellite is \"that of ballistic missile\"   stem from its heinous political purposes.\r\n   The U.S. is  crying for a tough policy toward the DPRK and re-examination of the framework agreement  instead of  taking a step of good neighbourhood and appeasement. The DPRK cannot remain a passive onlooker to the misbehaviour.\r\n   If the U.S. policy is to break the framework agreement, the DPRK has no intention to keep the U.S. from doing so. If the U.S. side considers the framework agreement white elephant,  it is free to break it.\r\n   The DPRK does not care about it.\r\n   Now the Korean people are strongly calling for not lending an ear to the U.S. empty talk  about supply of lwrs whose prospects are gloomy and supply heavy oil. They are calling for  doing things their own way according to their original plan, irrespective of the framework agreement.\r\n   We cannot but take the feelings and demands of our people into account.\r\n   In case the U.S. seeks to put pressure on the DPRK, as demanded by some elements of the U.S., it will certainly lead the DPRK to take its own choice in the implementation of the framework agreement. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
