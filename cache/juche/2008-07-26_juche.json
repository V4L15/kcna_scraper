In an attempt to defend Taejon, \"temporary capital\", at any cost, the enemy massed a huge amount of forces there and desperately built defense line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nOne day in mid-July of Juche 39 (1950) the President went to the front through the gunfire of the war. He instructed officers that the KPA combined units which had crossed the River Kum should instantly break through the enemy's defense line in the area south of the river and attack the enemy not only from the front but also from the back by bypassing Taejon and thus completely envelop and annihilate the enemy's units in the city. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn accordance with his operation tactics, the KPA units mounted a strong attack against the enemy, with the result that they completely liberated the city within seven hours, annihilated the U.S. 24th Infantry Division and captured its commander Dean. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDuring the temporary strategic retreat, the President took a bold and wise step to form the second front in the rear of the enemy with combined units of the regular army so as to disperse and sap the enemy forces and to heavily strike them from the front and in the rear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHis strategies and tactics were all unique, that could not be conceived with existing military knowledge and formula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDuring the three-year long war, the U.S. imperialists lost nearly 1.57 million troops including more than 405,000 GIs and enormous amount of military and technical equipment and war supplies including over 12,200 aircraft and knelt down before the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe exploit of the President who arranged the victorious July 27, the miracle in the 20th century, with his invincible strategies and tactics will shine long along with the Songun era. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The war, however, showed clearly that the outcome of a war depended not on the size of a territory and its population and economic and military potentials but on the mental power of the army and the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean War was the biggest war in history after the two world wars. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists committed atrocities which would make even the beasts blush wherever they went. They did not think twice about starting a germ warfare. They dropped an average of 18 bombs per square kilometer on the DPRK, leveling its cities and villages with the ground. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But they could not destroy the great revolutionary spirit of its army and people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The spirit of Korea which sent shivers down the spine of the aggressor was the spirit to defend the motherland with death, the spirit to defend its ideology and cause, system and happy life to the bitter end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With ideological resolution to devotedly defend President Kim Il Sung who liberated the country and brought its people a true life and happiness and safeguard the motherland, his bosom, to the last, the soldiers of the Korean People's Army fully displayed mass heroism and unrivalled heroism in the righteous battles for routing the aggressor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They opened the route of charge of their units by silencing the enemy's pillboxes with their bodies for the sole motherland, threw themselves under enemy tanks as human bombs and fought to the last drop of their blood to defend each inch of the land of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They worked military miracles unknown in the world history of wars: They liberated Seoul on the third day of the outbreak of the war and more than 90 percent of the area of the southern half of the country after one month. They delayed the landing of the enemy in Inchon for three days by fighting the enemy troops more than 50,000 strong, hundreds of warships and about 1,000 airplanes with only four artillery pieces, and captured Hill 351 in 15 minutes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Workers in the rear made hand grenades with bare hands and ensured wartime production by turning wheels with hands. Women of the rural area who launched into a plough-taking movement encouraged the People's Army soldiers by sending rice to the height in flame. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unshakable spirit to devotedly defend the country, the spirit to emerge the victor by defending the country, not slave by losing it sent firecrackers soaring into the sky on the day of victory in the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Just as they won the Fatherland Liberation War under the leadership of President Kim Il Sung so the army and people of the DPRK will establish a great, prosperous and powerful socialist nation without fail on the land of the country dyed with the blood of the forerunners with the mental power of the tens of millions of army men and people rallied with a single mind around General Secretary Kim Jong Il. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The Koreans are directly responsible for national reunification and, therefore, nobody can replace them in the struggle for achieving it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea of \"By our nation itself\" clarified in the historic June 15 joint declaration represents a transparent spirit of national independence. The idea helped significantly raise the Koreans' consciousness of independence and definitely put the movement for national reunification on the orbit of national independence as it is a patriotic idea reflecting their desire and will for independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history and reality eloquently prove that the stand of national independence serves as the fundamental stand to be held fast to by the Korean nation in solving the issue of reunification and it is necessary to resolutely frustrate the anti-reunification moves of foreign aggressor forces and sycophantic and traitorous forces, their lackeys, in the spirit of national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Terming those swimming against the trend of the times towards national independence foes of reunification, the article calls on all the Koreans not to pardon the Lee Myung Bak group in south Korea hell-bent on sycophancy towards the U.S. and dependence upon outside forces quite contrary to the trend of the times towards independent reunification. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But the prosecution distorted this fact, asserting that he invited such life by himself to conduct \"enemy-benefiting activities\", the statement pointed out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It said that the punishment for Yun, a patriotic youth who has devoted his all to the reunification movement, reveals the anti-reunification nature of the present \"government\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is due to traitor Lee Myung Bak's policy of confrontation with the fellow countrymen that the reunification movement is subjected to suppression and the south-north relations are getting deteriorated, the statement charged, adding: Any desperate efforts of his group can never stop the trend of the times towards peace and reunification.\r\n It urged the Lee Myung Bak \"government\" to clarify the will for implementing the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration and stop the crackdown upon the reunification movement at once.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
