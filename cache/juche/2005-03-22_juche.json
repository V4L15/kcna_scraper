They should, therefore, frustrate the U.S. policy to stifle and isolate the DPRK and its moves to start a nuclear war by concerted efforts. Rodong Sinmun Monday observes this in a signed article.\r\n The article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-Japanese struggle represented patriotism in the last century as it was the struggle to liberate the usurped country but now the anti-U.S. struggle represents patriotism because it is the struggle to reunify the divided country and nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a very just and patriotic struggle for protecting the dignity, interests and welfare of the nation to put an end to the U.S. criminal policy of occupation of south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Due to the U.S. high-handed interference and arbitrary practices and reckless moves for a new war, the process to develop the inter-Korean relations and the movement for independent reunification have hit a snag and a tense situation has been created on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans in the north and the south and overseas are the driving force in the fierce struggle against the U.S. and its might lies in their unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEven U.S. nuclear weapons will not prove effective when all Koreans pool their efforts and wage a dynamic joint struggle to frustrate the U.S. moves of confrontation and war against reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the fellow countrymen in the north and the south and overseas should intensify their sacred anti-U.S. struggle to protect the national dignity and honor so that they may not suffer any longer such disgrace as seeing the national sovereignty and dignity being infringed upon and pave a wide avenue for their independent development, concludes  the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "\"Anti-Secession Law\" of China Supported \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 21 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Monday runs a signed commentary titled \"Just Measure for Country's Reunification and Territorial Integrity,\" which reads in full:\r\n China recently took a momentous measure for the reunification of the country and its territorial integrity. As already reported, the \"anti-secession law\" aimed to prevent the \"independence of Taiwan\" was adopted at the third session of the 10th National People's Congress of China on March 14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is fully supported and welcomed by Chinese at home and abroad as it reflected the principled stand consistently pursued by China to achieve the peaceful reunification of the country by utmost sincerity and efforts and the unanimous demand and will of all the Chinese people to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity against \"Taiwan independence\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the keynote of the law to promote the peaceful reunification of the country and defend peace and stability in the Taiwan-Strait region, the national sovereignty and territorial integrity and fundamental interests of the Chinese nation by opposing and restraining the secessionist activities of \"Taiwan independence\" forces. The adoption of the law is another great achievement and progress in the struggle of the Chinese people to check the \"independence of Taiwan\" and attain the reunification of the whole country\r\nas it legally guarantees and codifies the country's reunification and sovereignty and territorial integrity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people fully support this momentous measure. Russia, Syria and other countries and international community expressed understanding, sympathy and support to the adoption of the law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its adoption is an entirely just step. Therefore, no one is entitled to take exception to it.\r\n The \"Taiwan independence\" forces and some forces including the United States, however, are taking issue with it and manifesting opposition to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nA tiny number of separatists calling for the \"independence of Taiwan\" leave no stone unturned to oppose and distort the law with malice and mislead and deceive the Taiwanese. They are crying themselves hoarse for further damaging the cross-Taiwan Strait relations, while stirring up hostile feelings toward the continent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a very wrong deed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard, the Taiwan Affairs Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council of China issued statements denouncing the \"Taiwan independence\" forces for decrying the law and clarified once again the principled stand of the Chinese government toward the Taiwan issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Taiwan issue is a domestic issue of China up to the hilt. Yet, the United States is recriminating China, expressing \"concern\" and \"regret\" over its adoption. This is an unjustifiable act of openly interfering in the internal affairs of China. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The master of China's question is the Chinese people and only they have the right to settle it. The open interference of the U.S. in the domestic issue of China is an expression of its hegemonism and arrogance. It is contrary to the international law and norms governing international relations including the U.N. Charter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n China is showing a tough rebuff to the untenable interference of the U.S. in its internal affairs. \r\n Recently, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China decisively refuted the U.S. charge over the measure, stressing that the law would promote the peaceful reunification of the country and help toward maintaining the stability of the relations across the Taiwan Straits and the Asia-Pacific region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unshakable are the stand and will of China to fulfill the law and achieve the complete reunification and territorial integrity of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The efforts of the Chinese people to prevent the \"independence of Taiwan\" and achieve the reunification of the whole country and territorial integrity will be further intensified.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

A spokesman for the DPRK Measure Committee for Demanding Compensation to Comfort Women for the Japanese Army and the Victims of Forcible Drafting said this in a statement on Mar. 20.\r\n Recalling that the Shimane Prefectural Assembly of Japan on Mar. 16 passed the motion calling for instituting Feb. 22 as \"Takeshima Day\" through its plenary session and the Japanese reactionaries are escalating their moves to grab the islet, talking about the \"issue of Takeshima stamp\", \"inspection of Takeshima\" and \"drill for a surprise attack on the islet\", it went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The islet is part of the inviolable territory of Korea from the historical and geographical point of view and in the light of international law and the issue of dominion over the islet, therefore, can never be a matter to be discussed between the DPRK and Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan came to know about the existence of the islet in the East Sea of Korea more than 1,000 years later than the Koreans. It is, therefore, a wanton encroachment upon the sovereignty of the territory of the Korean nation and a grave provocation to it for Japan to claim dominion over the islet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is more serious is that Japan is working hard to tamper with its past history of aggression, far from apologizing and compensating for the monstrous crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists against humanity after illegally occupying Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries would be well advised to halt at once their move to seize the islet, bearing in mind that they would get into hot water if they seek to reinvade Korea, oblivious of the bitter lesson taught by their defeat.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Therefore, the second Korean war to be launched by the U.S. imperialists will offer the Korean people a final chance to give vent to their pent-up grudge against the U.S.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
