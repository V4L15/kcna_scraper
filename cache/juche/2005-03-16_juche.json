            "content": "DPRK FM Spokesman Denounces U.S.-S. Korea Joint War Exercises \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 15 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA Tuesday denouncing the U.S. and the south Korean warlike forces for planning to stageï¿½@large-scale war exercises, the combination of Foal Eagle and RSOI, across south Korea.\r\n As already known, the U.S.-led large scale war exercises are scheduled to be staged in south Korea from Mar. 19 to 25.\r\n U.S. elite forces in south Korea, its mainland and abroad and Kitty Hawk and other huge nuclear strike forces are expected to participate in these maneuvers to be staged under the simulated conditions of an \"emergency\" on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The exercises will be nuclear war exercises aimed to invade the north to all intents and purposes in view of their nature, scope and contents. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is not secret that the U.S. is spending a huge amount of fund for researches into smaller nukes aimed to destroy underground bunkers of the DPRK and staging mock nuclear bomb dropping drills by introducing into south Korea even aircraft of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Japan, Guam and other places, to say nothing of the U.S. forces in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation in the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia is growing tenser as the U.S. is contemplating staging three dimensional nuclear war exercises involving even nuclear strike groups this time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We have already clarified our principled stand that we would seek a negotiated peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. and go out for the six-party talks to be resumed after their deadlock if conditions are mature and demanded the U.S. retract its remarks denying the dialogue partner, show its trustworthy sincerity and move. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nNevertheless, the U.S. responded to this just demand of the DPRK with the large-scale nuclear war drills. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The projected saber rattling, in the final analysis, clearly proves once again the hypocrisy of the U.S. assertion that it has neither hostility towards the DPRK nor intention to attack or invade it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. double-dealing behavior is an open challenge to the sincere efforts of the parties concerned and the international community as well as the DPRK  that sincerely desire the peace and security in the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is obvious that there is no change in the real intention and the aggressive nature of the Bush administration keen to bring down the system in the DPRK chosen by its people, strongly opposed to its ideology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through the war exercises the U.S. also seeks to develop the U.S. forces in south Korea into \"task forces operating in the wide region\" and thus extend anytime their operational scope to the areas around the Korean Peninsula, not confining it to the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAll facts go to clearly prove that the U.S. is chiefly to blame for straining the situation in the peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The U.S. can never evade the responsibility for the deteriorating situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The U.S. nuclear war exercises are touching off bitterer anti-U.S. sentiment among the servicepersons and people of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The DPRK will take necessary counter-measures including the bolstering of its nuclear arsenal to cope with the extremely hostile attempt of the U.S. to bring down the system in the DPRK though it is the Korean people's own choice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality testifies to the fact that the DPRK's nuclear weapons serve as powerful deterrent to keep the equilibrium of forces in the region, avert a new war and ensure peace.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

And Washington should pull its forces out of south Korea at once. Otherwise, it would face a stern judgment of our nation.       \r\n\r\n\r\n"

What they seek in this is to secure a legal and institutional mechanism for legitimate and open overseas aggression by rigging up a war-oriented constitution. Herein lie the reactionary nature and danger of their moves for a retrogressive revision of the constitution that they are accelerating with glib talk about \"a constitution suitable to the new era\" and \"building of a dignified state\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They intend to knock together a legal and institutional mechanism for a general mobilization of the human, material and military potentials of Japan in \"case of contingency\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Having made all military and technical preparations and built up capabilities for overseas expansion, they are now going to race headlong legally toward overseas expansion by cooking up a war-oriented constitution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the immediate target and ambition of the Japanese reactionaries to make a war-oriented constitution within this year, the 50th year after the formation of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, and remove the last obstacle in the way of the realization of their wild ambition for overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They persist in their \"territorial claim\" to Tok Islet, an inviolable part of the Korean territory historically, geographically and legally, while rendering relations with China strained by insisting that Diaoyu-dao \"belongs to Japan\". And there come from Japan voices that four islets of the Kurils of Russia should be retaken. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their moves for the conversion of Japan into a military giant and overseas expansion will only result in precipitating the destruction of Japan. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Despicable Misuse of Int'l Law Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 15 (KCNA) -- The U.S. has recently misused the international humanitarian law and human rights convention in a bid to perpetrate armed intervention against anti-U.S. independent and sovereign nations and bring down their systems.\r\n Moreover, it is working hard to fabricate new international laws and regulations to put anti-U.S. independent nations under its control, while peddling the \"theory that human rights are more important than state sovereignty\" and calling for \"non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD)\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Worse still, it is resorting to extraterritorial practices in disregard of such international law as the UN Charter that stipulates the respect for state sovereignty as its fundamental principle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun today says in a signed commentary: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThese practices of the U.S. are an outright challenge to sovereignty and international justice and a blatant breach of international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The U.S. military occupation of Iraq and killings of civilians there are a downright infringement upon the humanitarian principles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Typical of the moves stepped up by the U.S. to overturn the political systems of other countries under the pretext of \"human rights issue\" is the \"North Korean Human Rights Act\" adopted at U.S. Congress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It is foolish and naive of the U.S. to think that it can change the political and economic systems in the DPRK according to its standards. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  What merits a more serious attention is that the U.S. is contemplating cooking up new wrong international laws and regulations. This is evidenced by the facts that it is working hard to bring the issue of instituting a law designed to pull up other countries over \"human rights issues\" and use them as leverage for interfering in their internal affairs for discussion at the UN General Assembly and develop the PSI and \"regional maritime security initiative\" aimed at naval blockade against the DPRK and other anti-U.S. nations under the cloak of \"non-proliferation of WMD\" into international judicial systems. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Any interference in other nations' internal affairs under the pretext of human rights issue may bring about such serious consequences as the destruction of their political systems and the change of their regimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  What should not go unnoticed here is that the U.S. is unilaterally engaged in extraterritorial acts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It is its way of thinking that its extraterritorial behaviour in breach of international law does not pose any problem. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  If the U.S. misuse of international law is allowed and connived at, the world will turn into a U.S.-dominated lawless one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  All the nations should never allow and tolerate such arrogant and reckless misuse of international law by the U.S. but decidedly frustrate it.       \r\n\r\n\r\n"
