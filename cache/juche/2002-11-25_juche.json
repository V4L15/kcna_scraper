But the U.S. is forcing the DPRK to receive an earlier inspection on the charge that it violated the AF. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK clarified its stand that it prefers dialogue for the solution of the issue to a clash and proposed to conclude a non-aggression treaty between the two countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. is arrogantly asserting that it will have a dialogue with the DPRK only after it scraps its \"nuclear program.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is foolhardy of the U.S. to calculate that a country exposed to a threat may drop its arms.\r\n\r\n"

Minju Joson today carries a signed commentary in this regard.\r\n Recalling that the newspaper distorted even the appendix to the armistice agreement, not content with slandering the DPRK, the commentary continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the core point of the appendix that issues arising in the projects of inter-Korean rail and road relinks should be solved between the north and the south through discussion. But the editorial omitted such key phrases as the \"north and the south\" while citing the appendix. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is serious is that it asserted there is no need to hurry up as the projects are helpful to somebody. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By saying so Dong-a Ilbo disclosed its base mentality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The mission of the press is to champion justice, expose injustice and lead the times by building up a sound opinion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dong-a Ilbo professes the inheritance of the tradition of the national paper. If it is true it should refrain from speaking ill the Koreans are turning out in a nation-wide struggle to implement the June 15 joint declaration to achieve the independent reunification of the nation.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA blames U.S. for violating AF\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 23 (KCNA) -- As already reported, a spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Nov. 21 clarifying its principled stand on the U.S. unilateral decision to stop the supply of heavy oil to the DPRK under the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework (AF).\r\n As regards the reasonable and logical statement based on irrefutable facts, the White House and the State Department of the U.S. let loose sheer sophism that it was brazen-faced and North Korea was the first to violate the AF. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is not unaware of the Bush administration's vicious plot to isolate and stifle the DPRK under whatever pretext. And it cannot but make clear who is to blame for this serious development as Washington seeks to profoundly confuse the right and wrong even now when the AF is in the danger of being reduced to a dead document due to its moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history of the DPRK-U.S. relations since the AF was adopted in 1994 eloquently proves who has implemented it and who violated it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the days of the previous U.S. administration the DPRK and the U.S. adopted the historic DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework, prompted by the desire to remove the root cause of mistrust, confrontation and misunderstanding and normalize the relations, and pledged themselves to fulfil their political, moral and legal commitments under it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There were a series of ups and downs and difficulties due to the U.S. non-compliance with the AF but in the last period of Clinton administration the DPRK-U.S. dialogue provided an important occasion of solving outstanding issues and the bilateral ties reached such a level that President Clinton's visit to the DPRK was expected. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This meant that the DPRK-U.S. dialogue that had been pursued in real earnest since the adoption of the AF laid in principle a basic foundation for a comprehensive normalization of the bilateral relations despite a lot of difficulties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no need to recall who has demolished this foundation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Bush administration had not declared the \"re-examination of the U.S. policy towards the DPRK\" and \"suspension of dialogue\" and bedevilled the bilateral relations, there would have been no such situation as today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a wanton violation of the main spirit of the AF that the U.S. much delayed the construction of light water reactors, adopted it as a policy to mount a preemptive nuclear attack upon the DPRK and singled it out as part of an \"axis of evil.\" This was, in fact, aimed at ditching the AF. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This situation compelled the DPRK to have an extraordinary option to defend the sovereignty and right to existence and issue a stern warning to the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even at a time when the bush administration misrepresented the DPRK's warning in such a cunning way that it kicked up a nuclear racket, the latter exercised maximum self-restraint, proposing the U.S. for concluding a non-aggression treaty as a solution to the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the U.S. responded to the DPRK's constructive proposal with a decision to stop the supply of heavy oil. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the truth behind the total collapse of the AF. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the AF is to be alive and the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula to find a fundamental solution, the U.S. should drop its hostile policy toward the DPRK and conclude a non-aggression treaty with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Urging the DPRK to scrap its \"nuclear program\" first and repeating the ridiculous assertion without doing the above-mentioned things are nothing but sheer sophism to deceive the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should not insist on its far-fetched assertion that the DPRK was the first to violate the AF but drop the unacceptable brigandish logic it dreamed up as a superpower.    \r\n"

This situation compelled the DPRK to issue a warning that it is entitled to possess not only nuclear weapons but more powerful ones to cope with the threat. It, at the same time, clarified its principled stand to solve all the issues at the negotiating table with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. had stood for denuclearization and peace on the Korean Peninsula it should have taken such a historical opportunity to renounce its hostile policy toward the DPRK and opt to normalize relations with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But it misused the DPRK's constructive and fair proposal for hatching a sinister plot to prevent the DPRK-Japan and inter-Korean relations from warming and reverse the positive developments in Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That is why they are now busy spreading the false story that North Korea's development of nuclear weapons is entirely targeted against Japan and both China and Russia are within their range in a desperate bid to put the DPRK under a \"nuclear  siege\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Powell's outbursts are an extension of such a mean operation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The best solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula is for the U.S. to come out to a negotiating table and conclude a non-aggression treaty with the DPRK, not wooing its neighboring countries to meddle in the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. intention to involve the neighboring countries in the issue, while persistently shunning the DPRK's proposal, can not be construed otherwise than a carefully orchestrated operation to secure a political and military justification to invade the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to drop such a mean operation and come out to conclude a non -aggression treaty with the DPRK.  \r\n\r\n"
