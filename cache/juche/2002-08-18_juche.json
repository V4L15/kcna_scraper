The performance is based on the Korean folk song Arirang reflecting the history of the Korean nation's sufferings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt impressively tells how Arirang of prosperity came to resound through the country where only Arirang of sorrow could be heard in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Artists finished in a matter of one month pictures presenting background scenes which represent the essential advantages of Korean-style socialism and confidence and will to build a powerful nation, floor and stage decorations and handicrafts and various other genres of art works required for meeting the ideological and thematic requirements. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Creators of gymnastic scenes succeeded in producing dynamic rhythms and large-scale formations to suit the new style of the extravaganza. Choreographers created many new graceful dances full of national emotion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Acrobatic creators produced over 10 pieces including new aerial flight and aerial motorcycle stunt which make a free use of the vast space in the may day stadium. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those in charge of stage setting introduced the extra-large slide and projection systems and huge screen, the first of their kinds in the world, and a new optical system. As a result, the brightness of the scenes was 1.5 times that in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The performers ensured the first combined rehearsal of the work 40 odd days after the start of separate rehearsals. And they succeeded in completing the mass gymnastic and artistic performance as early as in over 90 days on the occasion of the day of the sun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The performance was given more than 90 times before capacity audiences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was watched by over 4 million servicemen of the people's army, working people from all walks of life, school youth and children and delegations and tourist groups of more than 2,600 organizations from at least 70 countries and international organizations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The performance is listed as a national treasure of Korea and the greatest masterpiece representing the 21st century as it makes a unique comprehensive representation of the bitter past of the Korean nation and its bright future.    \r\n\r\n"

This seriously threatens its right to existence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should clearly know that the key point in the implementation of the AF is not nuclear inspection but the issue of preserving the framework. This is the matter for which the DPRK and the U.S. should show greatest concern at present. \r\n As for the issue of nuclear inspection, it would be settled automatically if the lwr construction progresses under the AF. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is now at the final stage of implementing its commitments under the AF, but the U.S. still stands on the starting line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The AF stipulates that the commitments of the two sides under it shall be implemented on the principle of simultaneous action and, accordingly, the U.S. has much to do at present. Hence, the DPRK will move if the U.S. does. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. truly wants to preserve the AF and improve the relations with the DPRK, it should drop its hostile policy toward the latter, as required by the AF, and show its will in practice to compensate for the loss of electricity caused by the delayed provision of LWRs.    \r\n\r\n"
