Korean Ministry of Unification Accused of Failed Negotiations\r\n Pyongyang, June 30 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Guidance Bureau of Special Zone for International Tour of Mt. Kumgang gave the following answer to a question raised by KCNA Thursday as negotiations for settling the readjustment of properties including real estate inside the special zone proved abortive due to the obstructive moves of the south Korean puppet authorities.\n\t\t\t\t\t Those concerned of the south side, as notified by the DPRK Guidance Bureau of Special Zone for International Tour of Mt. Kumgang, entered the Mt. Kumgang Resort on June 29 for the readjustment of properties including real estate inside the special zone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But those concerned of non-governmental enterprises which have their properties in the mountain resort were just four and other 30 odd medium and small enterprises were barred from coming there by the south Korean puppet Ministry of Unification. Moreover, several \"government\" officials came to disturb the work with those concerned of enterprises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Entering the resort, a section chief of the ministry and other officials took those concerned of non-governmental enterprises to other room, not the venue of negotiations. They kept the DPRK side from meeting with those concerned of non-governmental enterprises, insisting on having negotiations between the authorities of both sides. They threatened to go back unless the DPRK side has negotiations with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the DPRK side stated it would clarify its stand in the presence of all those concerned of the south side, they categorically refused it. Finally, they hastily went back without notice, taking with them even those concerned of non-governmental enterprises on the instructions from Seoul.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean businessmen lost an opportunity to meet with those concerned of the DPRK side in the resort and were compelled to go back to south Korea under the pressure of the ministry officials.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was brought to light that the ministry sent its officials to the resort along with some businessmen under the pressure of public opinion but the real purpose of their trip was not to \"protect the right to properties\" of south Korean enterprises but to disturb the readjustment of real estate and scuttle the international tour of the DPRK side at any cost. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Due to the rude behavior of the ministry, the DPRK side had no alternative but to convey as a notice its proposal for readjustment of properties to those concerned of enterprises of the south side including Hyundai Asan who are staying in the mountain resort.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the notice the DPRK side said that all those who have properties in the resort are requested to come there by July 13 after studying the proposal and in case of those who fail to appear there by that time, the DPRK side will consider they quit their properties and take relevant legal steps.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The negotiations failed to take place entirely due to the deliberate obstructions on the part of puppet Ministry of Unification bossed by Hyon In Thaek, die-hard confrontation maniac.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, upon their return the ministry officials were so shameless as to spread misinformation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has shown all sincerity for the fair handling of the properties of the south Korean businessmen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should stop at once the base moves to scuttle the international tour of Mt. Kumgang and allow enterprises of the south side to take active part in readjusting their properties in a reasonable way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Otherwise, the south Korean businesses will suffer losses and the south Korean authorities will be held wholly responsible for them."

This alone will help hasten the victory of the cause of global independence.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Thursday says this in a bylined article.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The anti-imperialist struggle is the essential requirement for accomplishing the cause of global independence and the advance and victory of popular masses' cause of independence hinge on the successes of the anti-imperialist struggle, the article says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The popular masses' cause of independence is the noble revolutionary cause of terminating aggression and war, domination and subjugation and realizing independence of the popular masses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The people aspiring after independence and peace should clearly see through the reactionary nature and wickedness of imperialism and hold high the banner of the anti-imperialist struggle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a prerequisite to the anti-imperialist struggle and a primary requirement for global independence to discard illusion and horror about imperialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the people are well aware of the position and weakness of imperialism finding itself in a more bottomless predicament, they will not harbor any illusion and fear of it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The victory in the cause of global independence depends on the unity of the anti-imperialist independent countries. Now that the imperialists perpetrate aggression and war as allied forces, it is an essential task of the times for ensuring the victory in the cause of global independence for all the anti-imperialist independent forces to get united in their struggle.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Boosting the capability for self-defence provides a sure guarantee for encouraging the people to turn out in the anti-imperialist struggle with confidence and successfully accelerate the cause of global independence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The military strength constitutes the most important of the national power. If they emerge victorious on the military front, they can win on all fronts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is doing everything as it is determined and pushing forward every affair, guided by its grit, not bound to anything, proceeding from its steadfast independent stand in politics. This is because it has powerful military muscle and ever-victorious strategy and tactics."

Tal alboroto nunca será tolerable. Debemos aplastarla sin falta con las armas justas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Kwang Gun (de 49 años de edad), viceministro de Industria Mecánica apuntó:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl traidor Lee Myung Bak y cabecillas de la capa militar títere del Sur de Corea son los autores de los presentes alborotos anti-República que realizan abiertamente la unidad \"Paekgol\" y las otras en el frente del ejército títere surcoreano colgando hasta las malvadas consignas y pancartas. Esto deviene un desafío frontal contra la República Popular Democrática de Corea y una declaración de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos repetidos actos provocativos en junio son complot de enfrentamiento fratricida impulsado sistemáticamente desde hace mucho tiempo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLee Myung Pak practicaba política hostil a la connacional República Popular Democrática de Corea y de dependencia de las fuerzas extranjeras, con lo cual no hubo ni un paso de avance en  los esfuerzos por realizar la reunificación de la patria, anhelo de todos los coreanos del Norte, el Sur y en ultramar, y por lograr la paz y la estabilidad en la Península Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa conferenciante del Pabellón Central de Educación Clasista, Ryang Jong Gum (44 años de edad) subrayó:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa máxima dignidad de la República es la dignidad y el honor común de la nación. El pueblo coreano se movilizará como un solo hombre para defenderlos. La banda del traidor Lee Myung Bak, que se entrega a la confrontación anti-RPDC difamando hasta la máxima dignidad de la República, es el enemigo común de la nación a ser eliminado cuanto antes."
