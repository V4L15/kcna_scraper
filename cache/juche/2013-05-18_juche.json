Rodong Sinmun Saturday says this in a bylined article. \n\t\t\t\t\t Green mountains and fields are an icon of a prospering country, it notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Green mountains and fields are the inherent picture of just society, socialist society which enables all people to lead a happy life. The great Generalissimos Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il devoted their all to the work to turn all the mountains into mountains of treasure and the fields into ones where all crops are abundant and all fruits ripen. This history has been given steady continuity since it began on the socialist principle of giving top priority to the people's interests and living. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The mountains and fields were devastated by the Japanese imperialists' plunder and they were reduced to ashes during the Korean War. In the subsequent period they became greener and the foundation of the self-supporting economy grew stronger as the days go by, turning the country into a paradise of people good to live in. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The drive to defend the socialist country was like a sacred battle to defend not only its independent dignity but also the green mountains and fields. In that hard period a patriotic work of lasting value to turn the land of the country into the land befitting socialist Korea was carried out and bold and ambitious projects for building gravity-fed waterways were carried out to supply life-giving water to fields of the country. As a result, the farmers have become able to lead a happy life at modern houses as people in urban areas do. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Green mountains and fields mean lasting assets for the prosperity of the country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All people are called upon to turn all areas of the country into fields where all crops and fruits ripen in order not to put in vain the precious blood and sweat shed by those who reclaimed tideland by damming off sea waters and cultivated it with good care, tightening their belts."

It was none other than the U.S. which wirepulled the pro-U.S. conservative forces' seizure of power after ouster of pro-democracy and reform forces in a bid to put an end to the June 15 era of reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to translate the desire of the participants in the uprising into a reality, it is necessary to terminate the U.S. imperialists' colonial domination over south Korea and achieve the democratic development of society, concludes the article."

But the U.S. prodded the UN Security Council into cooking up an unreasonable \"resolution on sanctions\" against the DPRK, terming its satellite launch a \"long-range missile launch\". The DPRK countered it with its third underground nuclear test for self-defence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Though it was a just step, the U.S. again prodded the UNSC into faking up \"a resolution on sanctions\" against the DPRK and staged the U.S.-south Korea joint military exercises on the Korean Peninsula with huge forces involved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t U.S. nuclear strike means were involved in the joint military drills. Recently the U.S. and south Korea advanced a \"proposal for dialogue\" to the DPRK but with preconditions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. urged the DPRK to show its will for denuclearization as a precondition for dialogue.
