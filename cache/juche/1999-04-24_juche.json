            "content": "National meeting marks KPA birthday\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 24 (KCNA) -- A national meeting was held at the 6,000-seat theatre of the April 25 House of Culture here today with a large attendance to celebrate the 67th anniversary of the Korean People's Army (KPA).  Present at the meeting were Kim Yong Nam, Jo Myong Rok, Ri Jong Ok Pak Song Chol, Hong Song Nam and other senior party, state and army officials.     Foreign diplomatic envoys and military attaches in Korea were invited.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK celebrates as KPA birthday the 25th of April, Juche 21 (1932), when the President  Kim Il Sung founded the Korean People's Revolutionary Army, a new type of the working-class revolutionary armed forces.  Kim Yong Chun, chief of the KPA general staff, made a report titled \"Let us reliably guarantee the revolutionary cause of Juche with arms under the guidance of the great brilliant commander.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The reporter said that the Korean Revolutionary Armed Forces liberated the country from the Japanese  colonial rule and have heroically fought to defend the gains of revolution for nearly 70 years under the outstanding guidance of President  Kim Il Sung and Marshal Kim Jong Il, the great leaders and brilliant commanders, thus making achievements which will shine long in the history of the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He further said:   Our revolutionary armed forces have covered a shining militant path of victory and glory  under the outstanding guidance of  Kim Il Sung, the invincible and iron-willed commander.   They are now demonstrating their might as a matchless army which stalwartly stands guard over the fortress of socialism, going through the ordeal of history, as they have the respected Kim Jong Il, the illustrious commander of Mt. Paektu, as their Supreme Commander.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His policy of imbuing the whole army with the Juche idea has been creditably implemented with the result that our People's Army has turned to be the most dependable eternal army of the leader and the party.   The U.S. and their followers are getting frantic in their moves for aggression, revealing their undisguised attempt to ignite a second Korean war.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The KPA has grown and got trained as the strongest crack armed forces in terms of political and ideological preparedness, strategy and technique as well as in  terms of powerful means of attack and defence. It will  decisively shatter any fortress of the enemy and mercilessly strike and wipe out them to the last man once they attack us no matter where they may come from.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Our army and people do not want war but will never avoid it if anyone dares impose it upon us, and will annihilate all the aggressors by mobilizing strong politico-ideological power and all military potentials which we have long built.   This is the invariable, firm stand and unshakable will of our army and people.    The U.S. and their stooges should not act rashly but behave with discretion, clearly mindful of our Juche-based view and stand toward war and the KPA's unlimited merciless striking power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Sure to  win are our people and People's Army that are dynamically struggling for a bright future, holding high the sacred red flag of Mt. Paektu under the experienced and tested leadership of the great party.  There is no force on earth that can hold in check the dynamic advance of our revolutionary ranks in which the leader, the party and the masses are united as a harmonious whole. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
