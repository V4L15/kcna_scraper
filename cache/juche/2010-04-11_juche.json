Korea Urged to Stop War Aggression against North\r\n Pyongyang, April 11 (KCNA) -- The chief executive of south Korea was recently reported to have kicked up war atmosphere, instructing the warmongers of the military to \"get fully ready for any event.\" His minions let loose a whole string of dangerous war outbursts, trumpeting about the non-existent \"threat\" and \"provocation\" from someone. \n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Sunday observes in a signed article in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said outpourings of the south Korean ruling quarters are unpardonable acts of treachery as they threaten the destiny of the nation and disturb peace of the country and rash acts of going against the trend of the times towards independent reunification, peace and prosperity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The danger of a nuclear war is increasing on the Korean Peninsula day by day and the inter-Korean relations are inching close to an unpredictable collapse due to the reckless moves of the group of traitors to provoke a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean ruling quarters are persistently rushing headlong into the moves for a war of aggression against the north, challenging the ardent desire of the Koreans for peaceful reunification. This is absolutely intolerable as it is the greatest treason of letting the country and the nation fall victim to a nuclear war to be started by foreign forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their reckless remarks are nothing but a replica of the call for achieving \"unification by prevailing over communism\" made by the successive anti-reunification elements of south Korea. The present ruling quarters of south Korea are getting frantic in the moves to escalate the confrontation and ignite a war, retrieving the dregs of history which had been thrown into its dumping ground after being cursed and denounced by the whole nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a blatant challenge of the outdated forces intended to block the advance of the June 15 era of reunification and bring back the last era of confrontation in a bid to prolong their remaining days.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The anti-reunification conservative forces are now going mad with the moves to start a war of aggression against the north in collusion with outsiders, but this is nothing but the last-ditch effort of those who have lived out their days."

It is the height of arrogance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the ulterior intention of the south Korean puppet group to justify the criminal action taken by it to derail the tour and lay the blame for it at the north side's door by misleading public opinion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean authorities persist in the above-said rash acts, they will have to pay a dear price for them."
