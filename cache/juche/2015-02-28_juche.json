Now the U.S. has neither capability nor intention to intercept huge modern missiles of China and Russia, he added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t High-ranking officials of the U.S. are vying with each other in blustering as regards the deployment of THAAD in south Korea that it would not affect the strategic stability of China and Russia because it is a defensive one targeting medium- and short-range ballistic missiles of north Korea and, therefore, there is no need for China and Russia to react to the deployment in a oversensitive manner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Vincent Stewart, director of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, and the director of the operation department and the acting director of the intelligence department of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff in a joint written answer noted that north Korea's sustained development of nuclear weapons and missiles are posing a serious threat to the U.S. and its allies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This fully revealed the baseness and shamelessness of the Obama administration as what they asserted is nothing but a smokescreen to sacrifice small countries while refraining from accusing big countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is foolish, indeed, for the U.S. to calculate that it can divert elsewhere the international community's attention with such poor rhetoric though it is diverting the focus of its strategy in the new century to the Asia-Pacific and pushing forward the scenario for carrying out its new hegemonic strategy in real earnest.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The strategic position of the Asia-Pacific whose importance is increasing day by day is giving further momentum to the Obama administration's hegemonic ambition.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is massively beefing up its forces in Northeast Asia and the Asia-Pacific to contain big powers in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It decided to forward-deploy THAAD in its military base in south Korea while talking about \"nuclear and missile threat\" from the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the U.S. ultimate goal to build missile shields at various levels in the regions around Russia and China and make missile attacks on them from all sides in contingency.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Secretary of State John Kerry, at a hearing on the State Department's budget for fiscal year 2016 of the International Relations Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives on Feb. 25, said it earmarked 1.4 billion U.S. dollars for executing the pivot to Asia policy of the present administration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is building the largest-ever military bases in the region since the Second World War as part of the scenario for implementing the Asia-Pacific policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For example, the project for expanding the U.S. military base is now under way in Phyongthaek of south Korea and the projects for expanding the bases for reinforcing and deploying U.S. Marines will be undertaken not only on Guam but in Iwakuni and Okinawa of Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. announced that it would keep maximum readiness in the region, regardless of budget. It will keep 60 percent of the U.S. naval force in the region on a permanent basis, continue deploying more than 300 warships or 60 percent of the naval warships in the Pacific and additionally deploy four submarines on Guam. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is giving spurs to improving the performance of the existing bombers and nuclear missiles, bolstering up intelligence-gathering, monitoring and reconnaissance capabilities and developing and deploying high-performance laser guns, unmanned tactical vehicles and ultra-speed striking weapons. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is laughing stock of the world to claim that all those moves are to cope with \"threat\" from the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those countries in the Asia-Pacific region including big powers are strongly reacting to the U.S. moves to beef up its military muscle in the region, regarding them as a red light for strategic security."
