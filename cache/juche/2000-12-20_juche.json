            "content": "Japan urged to redress its past crimes \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 20 (KCNA) -- Japan can by no means shirk its responsibility for the organized crime related to sexual slavery its aggression army committed before and during World War II, said Rodong Sinmun in a signed article on Tuesday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the women's international war crimes tribunal on Japan's military sexual slavery recently held in Tokyo, the author of the article said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As was disclosed again at the tribunal, Japan's past crime related to sexual slavery was organized by its military which can never be justified. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has so far refused to admit its government and military's involvement in the crime related to the issue of \"comfort women for the army\". However, it has been disclosed in Japan and other countries that they were responsible for forcing women into sexual slavery and sponsoring and enforcing \"comfort women\" system, the article noted, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Documents Declassified at the U.S. government archives last year prove that the command of the Japanese imperialist army stationed in Korea took away Korean women as \"comfort women\" in an organized way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the postwar tribunal on Japanese war criminals Suzuki, commander of the 117th division of the imperial Japanese army, admitted that he instructed the forcible drafting of \"comfort women\" by the order of his superiors at that time when he was active as a regimental commander. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was also brought to light by document that the Japanese military provided necessary facilities for the drafting of \"comfort women\" and exempted those escorting them from paying transport fees.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The human history of war knows no such an example as meeting soldiers' sexual desire as a means of war and reducing many women into sex slaves. Japan committed too many hideous crimes in the past to deny them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should make honest apology and compensation for the past crimes including the crime related to the sexual slavery. If it refuses to do so, it will stand further isolated and condemned by the international community, the article warned. \r\n\r\n"
