However, it has been disclosed in Japan and other countries that they were responsible for forcing women into sexual slavery and sponsoring and enforcing \"comfort women\" system, the article noted, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Documents Declassified at the U.S. government archives last year prove that the command of the Japanese imperialist army stationed in Korea took away Korean women as \"comfort women\" in an organized way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the postwar tribunal on Japanese war criminals Suzuki, commander of the 117th division of the imperial Japanese army, admitted that he instructed the forcible drafting of \"comfort women\" by the order of his superiors at that time when he was active as a regimental commander. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was also brought to light by document that the Japanese military provided necessary facilities for the drafting of \"comfort women\" and exempted those escorting them from paying transport fees.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The human history of war knows no such an example as meeting soldiers' sexual desire as a means of war and reducing many women into sex slaves. Japan committed too many hideous crimes in the past to deny them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should make honest apology and compensation for the past crimes including the crime related to the sexual slavery. If it refuses to do so, it will stand further isolated and condemned by the international community, the article warned. \r\n\r\n"

Also created this year were a collection of poems \"Shining Victory Is In Store On the Way To the Front\" and epics \"Fatherland and Future\" and \"Love Soldiers\" which depict the unremitting revolutionary activities of Kim Jong Il and reflect the faith and will of the Korean people who are advancing towards a powerful and prosperous nation under his guidance. Among the newly created works are such poems and songs as \"The Day which I Longed To See Has Come,\" \"Taehongdan\" and \"Oh This Is My Fatherland,\" etc, instrumental in the education in socialist patriotism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many poems and songs on the unconverted long-term prisoners, who are patriotic fighters for reunification, such as \"Phoenixes Back Home,\" \"Meeting,\" etc, have also been created. \r\n\r\n"
