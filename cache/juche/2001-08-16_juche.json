            "content": "Withdrawal of U.S. forces from South Korea urged \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 16 (KCNA) -- Korea is the only country in the world which still remains divided among those countries which were partitioned as the outcome of the second world war. This is because of the U.S. military presence in South Korea. Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the June 15 joint declaration in which the north and the south committed themselves to solve the issue of reunification of the country by the efforts of the Korean nation was adopted and the desire for reconciliation and cooperation between the north and the south and reunification is daily growing stronger, the U.S. forces are left without any justification to stay in South Korea any longer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. right-wing conservatives, displeased with the developments on the Korean peninsula, are putting the brake on this process in a bid to derail it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. moves to escalate the tensions on the peninsula are aimed to stifle the DPRK by force and use the peninsula as a strategic base from which to establish unchallenged domination over Asia and the Pacific. To allow the U.S. troops to stay in South Korea is as dangerous as sleeping on the powder keg where a time bomb was planted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The withdrawal of the U.S. troops from South Korea means removing a stumbling block lying in the process of detente, reunification and national reconciliation on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. troops' pullback from South Korea would bring durable peace to the peninsula and create conditions favorable for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The foremost task of the policy of the DPRK towards the United States is to force the U.S. troops to withdraw from South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States should face up to the trend of the times and quit South Korea before suffering the disgrace of being driven out of it. This is good for the U.S. either.    \r\n\r\n"
