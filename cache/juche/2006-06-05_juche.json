The letter contained the fact that the U.S. directly ordered GIs to kill civilians during the war.\r\n The statement said:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is obliged to stand trial for its organized massacres of Koreans. But it is trying to evade its responsibility even today when its crimes were brought to light. It is working hard to provoke another war of aggression against the DPRK to reduce the Korean Peninsula to a battle-field of a nuclear war and exterminate the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is an open insult and intolerable challenge to the Korean nation who has not yet vented their pent-up spite on the U.S. imperialist man-slaughters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans should turn out in a just struggle to make the U.S. pay for the misfortune, disaster and sacrifice inflicted upon their fellow countrymen with the dignity and honor of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Koreans from all walks of life should wage a vigorous anti-U.S. struggle to get the U.S. to apologize and compensate thousand-fold for its crimes and to withdraw the U.S. imperialist aggression troops, root cause of misfortune and pain and war, from south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should also wage a staunch struggle to ostracize the pro-American \"Grand National Party\" which is following the U.S. to bring war and destruction to the Korean nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Paektu \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- Five decades have passed since leader Kim Jong Il started the study tour of revolutionary battle sites in the area of Mt. Paektu.\r\n The first study tour of the area organized by him in June Juche 45 (1956) was a great action which solemnly declared before the era his firm faith and will to defend and glorify forever the revolutionary traditions established by President Kim Il Sung and a historic event of weighty significance in keeping the continuity of the Korean revolution started in Paektu forests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il has since worked heart and soul to turn Ryanggang Province into a grand seat of education in the revolutionary traditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He visited the province on nearly 40 occasions in last five decades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He visited the Monument to the Victorious Battle of Pochonbo 10 times from July Juche 57 (1968) to Juche 61 (1972). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He opened the course for \"250-mile journey for learning\" while giving on-the-spot guidance to the province in July Juche 57 (1968), and published his famous work \"Let Us Build Up This Revolutionary Battle Site\" to give guidelines that should be maintained in building up the revolutionary battle sites in the area of Mt. Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When visiting Lake Samji on July 4, Juche 65 (1976) he located the site of the statue of Kim Il Sung and clarified the orientation and way of building a grand monument. And he gave teachings over 200 times in all to guide in detail its building from its formation and design to structure, representation and construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His on-the-spot guidance to the work of the revolutionary battle sites in the area in March Juche 89 (2000) marked an epochal turning point in sprucing up the area as a holy land of revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Great changes have been made in building up the area for five decades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many revolutionary battle sites and historic sites were discovered in the 1960s and 1970s, starting in Juche 47 (1958). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the latter of the 1980s the secret camp of Mt. Paektu was found in Sobaeksu Valley and restored to its original state. This was an auspicious event of special significance in carrying forward the revolutionary traditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the days of researching and discovering the revolutionary historic materials at least 1,100 pieces of revolutionary relics including Kim Il Sung's celebrated work \"The Ten-Point Programme of the Association for the Restoration of the Fatherland\", an original material in the period of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle, were collected, 230 revolutionary historic buildings ascertained and more than 360 trees bearing revolutionary slogans found. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A brisk drive was conducted to build up revolutionary battle sites and historic sites in the area of Mt. Paektu in step with the rapid progress in the work of discovering and ascertaining the revolutionary relics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A statue of Kim Il Sung was erected in the Pochonbo revolutionary battle site in November Juche 73 (1984). And his statues and statues of Kim Jong Suk, woman general of Mt. Paektu, were built in Phophyong, Sinpha and other areas to suit the revolutionary historic content there and monuments to autographic ode and propositions of Kim Il Sung in the secret camp of Mt. Paektu, more than 360 monuments in revolutionary battle sites and historic sites. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The work of preserving the revolutionary relics has been improved to meet realistic conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Paektu House has been built in the area of Mt. Paektu so as to contribute to the education in revolutionary traditions. Fine granite stairs down to Lake Chon of Mt. Paektu for expeditionary groups were built and a pavement road to the top of the mountain made with 437,500 stones. Other roads to revolutionary battle sites and historic sites have been built. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n More than 63.5 million people of all strata visited the revolutionary battle sites and historic sites of the area in last five decades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At least 210,000 Koreans overseas and more than 120,000 foreigners visited them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Large-scale state machinery and suppression networks of capitalist society serve the interests of monopoly capitalists, the ruling class, and ruling bureaucrats and encroach on the interests of the overwhelming majority of working people. Under this bourgeois state system the capitalist class exploits, plunders and suppresses people mercilessly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Everything is defined by money and power in capitalist society. Accordingly, the capitalist class behaves arbitrarily with their large money and unlimited state power while the popular masses are reduced to slaveries of capital and forced to lead a miserable life. The U.S. reactionary ruling quarters do not miss every opportunity to talk about \"welfare of all people\", \"equality of all people\" and \"respect for human rights\" in a bid to distort and fabricate the truth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the supreme principle of the party and state activities to work for the promotion of the people's welfare in our socialist society where the principle of collectivism \"One for all and all for one\" prevails. The state is entirely responsible for the destiny of the people and looks after them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the ideal of humankind to lead an independent and happy life in a peaceful world free from exploitation and oppression, domination and subordination, aggression and war. It is the socialist idea to embody this common demand and desire of humankind. The human ideal and desire cannot be changed and, accordingly, the idea of socialism embodying them cannot be changed.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The Korean people and the rising generations have come to cherish the unshakable faith and indomitable will to accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche to the end, while making a study tour of the revolutionary battle sites of Mt.

It threatened that it would move its 7th air force to other region unless such conditions are provided. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Yielding to the U.S. threat, the south Korean \"government\" is busy taking a measure for the U.S. air force to make a flexible use of the firing range in Jik Islet and seeking to install automatic marking equipment costing 2.8 billion won by the end of August.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The GNP is the most unpopular and traitorous party in south Korea. This party proved successful only by fishing in the troubled waters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The election results, in the final analysis, mean the victory of the south Koreans, not one won by such charlatans as GNP group.
