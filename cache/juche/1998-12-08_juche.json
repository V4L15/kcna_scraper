The aggressors will never escape the fate of forlorn wandering spirits.\r\n   This is the DPRK's warning to the U.S. and his followers who worked out the \"operation plan 5027\" for the second Korean war of aggression long ago and are putting spurs on its implementation.\r\n   The Korean people do what they mean.\r\n   That is proved by the past 50 years.\r\n   The U.S. imperialists made a surprise invasion of the DPRK in June Juche 39 (1950), saying that the destiny of the war was already decided.\r\n   The world focused attention on Korea, the DPRK solemnly declared that it would answer war with war, attack with counterattack.\r\n   The attempt of the U.S. imperialists to have breakfast in Haeju, lunch in Pyongyang and supper in Sinuiju, ended in failure in the face of DPRK's declaration.\r\n   During the 3-year-long Korean war, the U.S. imperialists lost troops and military equipment nearly 2.3 times those in the 4-year-long pacific war and kneeled down to the Korean people.\r\n   To answer \"retaliation with retaliation and all-out war with all-out war\" was a statement made by Pyongyang when the U.S. imperialists kicked up a frantic war racket in the wake of the armed spyship \"Pueblo\" incident in '60s.\r\n   The Yankees gave in to the grit and courage of the DPRK.\r\n   The \"Patrol Craft Escort No. 56\" sent to the bottom and \"EC-121\" shot down while engaging themselves in espionage act after intruding into the territorial waters and airspace of the DPRK and the GIs who met a miserable end in the \"Panmunjom incident\" showed that the DPRK did what it meant.\r\n   Five years ago the U.S. imperialists who had high morale in the Persian Gulf War, gathered the dark clouds of war together with imperialist allied forces.\r\n   In this touch-and-go situation the world was concerned about Korea's fate with suppressed excitement.\r\n   The DPRK, however, declared without turning a hair that if enemy dare invade the inalienabl territory, territorial waters and airspace even 0.001 mm, the DPRK will punish the aggressors mercilessly.\r\n   The U.S. imperialists' pride was humbled and U.S. President Clinton sent a message of guarantee to the respected leader Kim Jong Il.\r\n   Those who run amuck, forgetful of all the lessons, will realize keenly through their experiences what Korea's answer is.\r\n   The answer will be the most decisive and merciless punishement. \r\n   The Korean people and Peole's army will fight to the last.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n"

            "content": "U.S. is not \"only superpower\"\r\n   Pyongyang, December 8 (KCNA) -- An increasing number of American people are lifting up their voices criticising the U.S. position as the \"only superpower.\"\r\n   Commenting on this fact, a news analyst of Rodong Sinmun today says:\r\n   This eloquently reflects the weakened position of the United States which cannot be concealed with anything.\r\n   Having declared the end of the Cold War in December 1989, the United States has tried to establish a \"new world order,\" styling itself \"the only superpower.\" however, its position as \"only superpower\" has begun to collapse. As a result, its position has largely weakened on the international political arena.\r\n   After the end of the Cold War, the U.S. could not make the United Nations play into its hands. It is also losing its economic position in the capitalist world.\r\n   The economic development of some capitalist countries has seriously hamstrung the U.S. position of economic domination.\r\n   In order to keep its dominationist position in the capitalist world and ensure benefits of its expanded military monopolies, the U.S. has further militarized its economy. Consequently, its national budgetary deficit and foreign debts have increased.\r\n   The U.S. military position has also gone down.\r\n   An example of this is the U.S. failure to form an anti-Iraq military alliance.\r\n   Whenever Iraq challenged, the U.S. could not form  multi-national forces as in the Persian Gulf War.\r\n   Moreover, U.S. directives and policies do not work within the NATO.  European countries decided to conduct their own military operation without the United States, an operation which goes beyond the sphere of the NATO.\r\n   The U.S. is undergoing setbacks in its attempts to bring developing countries under its domination with \"supremacy of strength\" and \"nuclear predominance\" and establish an international order governed by the jungle law.\r\n   It is now making desperate efforts to prevent its position as \"only superpower\" from being weakened and extricate itself from predicament. However, its efforts are useless.\r\n   Its position will further weaken as the days go by.\r\n   The Korean army and people will never allow the United States to become the \"only superpower.\"    \r\n \r\n"
