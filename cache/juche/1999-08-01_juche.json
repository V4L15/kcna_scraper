They are scheming to make the union a weak organization without grassroots-level organizations and to alienate teachers from Jongyojo by framing up South Korean teachers union, the statement said,  and continued:   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This indicates that the South Korean rulers are seeking to make the union defunct and completely disorganize and undermine it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They are trying to bind Jongyojo hand and foot in a shrewd way, getting nervous at its activities, in a bid to block the struggle of the democratic mass movement organizations and make South Korean society more fascist  and reactionary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The chairman in the name of all the educational and cultural workers in the DPRK condemned the moves of the South Korean authorities against Jongyojo as an unpardonable challenge to the democratic rights and freedom of the South Korean teachers and a deliberate scheme to continue to pursue the anti-national, anti-democratic educational policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities should immediately stop their despicable moves to make Jongyojo defunct behind the scene of deceptive \"legitimization\" and ensure complete freedom of all the union activities. \r\n\r\n"

Korean authorities' obstruction assailed\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, August 1 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun in a signed commentary today assailed the South Korean authorities for laying hurdles in the preparations for the grand August 15 pan-national reunification festival through the \"People's Council for National Reconciliation and Cooperation\", a government-sponsored organization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Some days ago, the council organized what it called the \"headquarters for the promotion of '99 fellow countrymen's rally to join hands\" and proposed \"preliminary talks\" to the north. It said unless the north responds to it, it would hold unilaterally a \"joint meeting\" and \"fellow countrymen's rally to join hands\" in Panmunjom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   On the very day of the appearance of the council  the north branded it as an anti-reunification separatist one and made clear that the north would neither deal with it nor recognize it. This stand still remains unchanged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The commentary dismisses the proposed \"preliminary talks\" to the north as an imprudent offer that can be made only by the villains who do not know how to behave. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The council's loudmouthed \"joint meeting\" and \"fellow countrymen's rally to join hands\" are nothing but a crafty move to flout and insult the South Korean people and contain the activities of the genuine pro-reunification patriotic organizations, the commentary observes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities should refrain from their  criminal moves to foil the grand August 15 pan-national reunification festival through that council, but clear the south headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification (Pomminryon) and the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils (Hanchongryon), the main driving forces of reunification movement, in South Korea, of the charges of being \"enemy-benefiting organizations\" and ensure the freedom of their activities. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
