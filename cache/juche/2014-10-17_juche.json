She has, therefore, no face to talk about \"human rights\" of someone and \"pain of inhabitants.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She is talking about dialogue while slandering the other side behind the scene. This is a height of double-dealing attitude.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If she is to have dialogue with the north and improve relations with it, she should know how to observe elementary etiquette toward the other side, first of all.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If Park sincerely wants north-south dialogue and improve relations, she should refrain from making remarks obstructive to them, to begin with.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She had better clearly know that she may bring inter-Korean relations to total collapse due to her bad habit of wrongly waging her tongue."

It once again proves the truth that human rights precisely mean sovereignty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the popular masses are to enjoy genuine human rights, they must firmly defend the sovereignty of the country before anything else, and it is necessary to strongly react to the hostile forces attempting to meddle in the internal affairs of other countries under the signboard of \"human rights.\" This is the conclusion drawn by the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The politicization, selectivity, and double standards to abuse human rights, the universal value of mankind, for a sinister political purpose should never be tolerated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The vicious and base human rights racket of the hostile forces against the DPRK is lashing the Korean people into great fury.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will decisively frustrate the persistent anti-DPRK \"human rights\" campaign of the hostile forces and continue to make utmost efforts to firmly defend the best Korean-style socialist system and provide better conditions for the people's enjoyment of human rights."
