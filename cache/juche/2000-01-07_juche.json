This will provide most powerful strength to smash the enemy's anti-socialist campaign and the most correct way to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There should be an army true to the cause of socialism, that is armed forces  powerful enough to foil the anti-socialist moves of all the class enemies at home and abroad and the imperialists, as well as the self-reliant national defence industry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It will not be possible to defend socialism if people lack faith in it, even if they have a powerful army and national defence industry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Ideologically weak armed forces are worse than a stick and the army which is not true to the cause of socialism can not defend it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Begging the enemy for something and making concession to him are a taboo in defending socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It can be defended only by strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But for the invincible people's army, the unconquerable fortress of Korean-style socialism, and the most powerful national defence industry, more than ten wars of aggression would have been provoked by the imperialists on the Korean peninsula and our socialism could not have been defended. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In that case it would not have been possible for us to have such a high pride, self-esteem and national dignity in winning victory after victory in the confrontation with imperialism, unaided. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The most correct way of protecting socialism is to attach great importance to the national defence. \r\n\r\n"

Korean chief executive \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 7 (KCNA) -- The South Korean chief executive was recently reported to have let loose a spate of remarks intended to turn aside from the issue of reunification, while being skeptical about it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He said at an interview with Asahi Shimbun of Japan that \"he would leave the issue of reunification to his successors as one to be solved in future\" in the wake of his meeting with the head of the social democratic party of Japan at which he asserted \"making haste for reunification is not good for both the north and the south.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He repeated only \"peaceful coexistence\" and \"exchange,\" arguing \"now minus aspect of reunification is bigger than its plus one\" and \"a sudden reunification would create great mental difficulties.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Those remarks of the South Korean chief executive are nothing but anti-national, anti-reunification outbursts pouring cold water on the nation's ardent desire for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The reunification is a historic task pending a most urgent fulfillment. This alone provides the only way out and will bring prosperity to the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   That was why we appealed to all the people to make this year, the 55th anniversary of the country's liberation, a year of a new historic turn in the struggle for the national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It was against this backdrop that the South Korean chief executive talked about the principle governing the relations between countries called \"peaceful coexistence,\" describing the national reunification as an issue to be handled in distant future. This cannot be construed otherwise than an attempt to perpetuate the national division and have it universally recognized. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean chief executive once professed to be a \"president for reunification\" after winning political clout through his oft-repeated talk about the urgency of the national reunification. However, his recent behaviour clearly proves how craftily he has deceived the people and mocked at the national desire for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If he has true national conscience and political faith, he should frankly clarify why he has turned aside from the issue of national reunification, the most urgent historic task for the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean nation will never pardon the flunkeyist and traitorous forces for their anti-national, anti-reunification moves to prolong their remaining days in reliance upon the foreign forces who wish the permanent division of Korea, clean indifferent to its reunification, the call of history. \r\n\r\n"
