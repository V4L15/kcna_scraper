Korean People Released \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 2 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of the National Democratic Front of south Korea (NDFSK) released a New Year message to the south Korean people Saturday, according to Internet site Kuguk Jonson.\r\n Last year was a year in which the democratic forces in the south registered noteworthy successes in the struggle to terminate the U.S. colonial domination and military occupation and reunify the country by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation, the message noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The struggle for national reunification last year clearly proved that the attitude and stand on the June 15 joint declaration is a touchstone distinguishing between patriotism and treachery and that implementing the joint declaration by the concerted efforts of all the fellow countrymen provides a short-cut to smashing the moves of the anti-reunification forces inside and outside Korea and bringing earlier the day of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year is a significant year marking the fifth anniversary of the historic June 15 joint declaration and the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to wage a struggle for democracy this year with main emphasis on finally eliminating the pro-U.S. ultra-right conservatives such as the Grand National Party of south Korea that makes desperate efforts to topple the present \"government\" and hamstring the process of progressive reform under the backstage manipulation of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All movement organizations and people from all walks of life should strengthen the solidarity and unity in the struggle, conduct a dynamic and coordinated joint struggle, actively choose and steadily improve forms and methods of struggle which may attract broad popular masses' sympathy and participation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

We should fully repose the absolute trust in the headquarters of the revolution and manifest stronger sense of revolutionary obligation towards it and protect the unity and cohesion of the revolutionary ranks based on the Juche-oriented Songun idea and line as our own eyeballs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should glorify for all ages the revolutionary exploits, the tradition and treasures achieved by Kim Jong Il under the great banner of Songun as the eternal cornerstone of our revolution and the most precious treasure of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The servicepersons of the Korean People's Army should always preserve the admirable fighting trait with which they devotedly defended the headquarters of the revolution during the \"Arduous March\" and bore the brunt of the struggle to glorify Korean-style socialism. We should increase in every way the might of self-reliant defence industry we have built up from scratch in the spirit of fortitude. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the party members and other working people should make the spirit of attaching importance to the army and military affairs prevail throughout the society and bring the traditional trait of army-people unity into fuller bloom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The editorial calls on the entire party and army and all the people to turn out as one to thoroughly implement the militant tasks set forth in the joint New Year editorial under the uplifted banner of Songun and glorify the 60th anniversary of the Workers' Party of Korea and the 60th anniversary of national liberation as grand festivals of proud victors.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
