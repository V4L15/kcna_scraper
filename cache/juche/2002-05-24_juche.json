Korean political arena \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 24 (KCNA) -- Ri Hoe Chang, a presidential candidate on the ticket of the \"Grand National Party\" of South Korea, reportedly claimed at a \"forum of candidates\" on May 22 that article 2, a key point of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, should be abrogated.\r\n This is an expression of his anti-reunification, anti-national intention to write off the main idea and spirit of the joint declaration, a landmark for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As known, article 2 of the declaration indicates the target for the fastest and fairest solution to the problem of Korea's reunification, the cherished desire of the nation, and ways of hitting it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that there is commonness between the north side-proposed low-level federation formula and the south side-proposed commonwealth formula, the declaration calls for working together for the country's reunification in this direction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is of weighty historic significance in solving the problem of national reunification as it has defined the common way of reunification for the first time since the country was divided into the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The federacy formula is the only way for the Korean nation to solve the problem of reunification most smoothly and peacefully. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, Ri Hoe Chang has unhesitatingly denied it, going against the desire of the fellow countrymen and the trend of the times. Such act fully reveals his true colors as an enemy of the nation and an anti-reunification element. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, he has been opposed to the joint declaration since the very day of its publication. he argued that \"the north's assertion was unilaterally accepted, there is nothing to get from the declaration, and it will bear no fruit.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His recent remarks denying the declaration evidently prove that he is an anti-national separatist who has no willingness for the improved inter-Korean relations and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that there will be nothing but a war between the fellow countrymen if such guys as Ri seeking only division and confrontation instead of reconciliation and unity between the north and the south come to power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri, whose political life is coming to an end as he is a cancer-like element harmful to the country, the nation and reunification, should be eliminated from the political arena in time.    \r\n"

To this end it is necessary to eliminate all the nuclear weapons from South Korea and foil the moves of the U.S. imperialists for a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will unite with the world peace-loving people and strive hard to frustrate the moves of the U.S. imperialists for a nuclear war and defend peace on the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Asia and the world under the banner of peace against nukes.    \r\n\r\n"
