This is a cynical ploy to align the East European countries against the DPRK and Iran with a psychological impact on them by spreading absolutely false information. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' preemptive nuclear attack is primarily targeted against the DPRK. They are escalating their moves to provoke a nuclear war against the DPRK behind the curtain of \"peace\" and \"dialogue.\" Their drive to modernize nuclear weapons, militarize the space and establish the MD is aimed to beef up nuclear arms and start a nuclear war and intensify nuclear threat and blackmailing.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This marked a historic event that recorded a brilliant chapter in developing the Juche-oriented children's movement and giving steady continuity to the tradition of the Korean revolution generation after generation. Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says this in an editorial dedicated to the 60th birthday of the KCU.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n President Kim Il Sung formed the Saenal Children's Union, the first children's revolutionary organization in Korea, in the arduous period of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle, thus establishing the glorious tradition of the children's movement. On this basis he founded the Korean Children's Union, busy as he was with his work after the liberation of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean children's movement has been placed on the present high level and the members of the KCU are firmly prepared as reliable successors to the revolution. This is entirely thanks to the deep loving care and the wise leadership of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Leader Kim Jong Il has brought up the Korean children as a big contingent of dependable little revolutionaries who invariably trust and follow the Party and the leader in any storm and stress and reliably carry forward the cause of Juche. Herein lies an undying feat he has performed in the development of the Korean youth and children's movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the unshakable resolution of Kim Jong Il and the general task before the Korean children's movement to develop the KCU into an eternal children's organization of Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KCU members should always hold Kim Il Sung in high esteem, not forgetting even a moment what enabled them to enjoy happiness at present when their beautiful hopes and aims are coming true. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should become little fighters who work hard to defend and glorify the socialist system in Korea with warm love of the country and the people and bitter hatred for the U.S imperialists and the class enemy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The school children should strive to become excellent students as desired by Kim Jong Il, holding aloft the slogan \"Let's Study for Korea!\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the members of the KCU should fully prepare themselves as Kim Jong Il's true sons and daughters who will always carry forward the Songun revolutionary cause of Juche under the uplifted red flag of the KCU in the future, too.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
