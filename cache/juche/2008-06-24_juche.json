Kumgang areas and instead, is egging the conservative puppet military on to intentionally throw a stumbling block to its implementation, the statement pointed out, and said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said agreement is a commitment common to the nation, which was ardently requested by the south side and then accepted by the Korean People's Army side with bold stand and magnanimity out of compatriotism during the historic north-south summit meeting last October. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the cooperation and exchange in Kaesong and Mt. Kumgang areas are concerned, they are unprecedentedly nationwide projects as they could be realized thanks to the bold measures of opening the tightly closed Military Demarcation Line and offering militarily important vantage points taken by the KPA side to promote the common interests and co-prosperity of the nation in the idea of \"By our nation itself\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA is compelled to ponder over the need to continue providing military guarantees for the cooperation and exchange projects in the above-said areas, given that the implementation of the agreement on passage, customs clearance and communications essential for the reenergizing the projects are in the danger of suspension. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To negate the historic June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration, a programme for its implementation, and hinder the implementation of all the north-south agreements is a clear proof of the attitude standing against the development of north-south relations and peace and prosperity and a treacherous and anti-reunification act intended to go toward division and confrontation while ignoring the fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK will closely follow the future attitude and moves of the south Korean puppet military toward all the north-south agreements including the agreement on passage, customs clearance and communications.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

A series of agreements were reached there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard, the international community hailed this as an event which opened up a prospect of settling the issue of the relations between the two countries in conformity with the common interests of their peoples and as required by the new century and made a breakthrough towards improving the bilateral relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But a spate of reckless remarks quite contrary to its expectation is now heard from among ultra rightist conservative forces of Japan. They are blustering that they \"are opposed to easing the economic sanctions against north Korea\" and a \"unilateral policy of pressure should remain the core of policy towards north Korea\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ultra rightist organizations such as the Dietmen's League from the Liberal Democratic Party and the \"Headquarters of Measures for Settling the Abduction Issue\" of the Democratic Party and former Prime Minister Abe and the secretary-general of the Democratic Party and other right-wing forces vied with each other in talking such rubbish as \"lifting of the sanctions is premature\" and \"they sound a warning.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is nothing but a sinister attempt to bar the relations between the DPRK and Japan from improving and a despicable bid of the political charlatans to achieve their partisan purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The abnormal relations between the DPRK and Japan have lasted for more than half a century since the end of the Second World War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is harmful in every aspect. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To normalize the relations between the DPRK and Japan and develop the good-neighborly relations between the two countries are in line with the desire and interests of their peoples. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The improvement of the DPRK-Japan relations is not for one party but for the sake of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The normalization of the relations between the two countries, in particular, is stipulated in the joint document of the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan persists in the confrontation with the DPRK as asserted by the right-wing forces of Japan at a time when certain progress is made in the process of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, it will never be able to get rid of the situation where it is regarded as a cumbersome party at the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ulterior aim sought by the Japanese right-wing conservative forces in making such desperate efforts to hamstring the process for improving the relations between the DPRK and Japan, ignoring the prevailing political environment, is to seize power, their highest partisan goal, and realize the militarization of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their rhetoric that what they do is for the sake of national interests is throwing Japan into a dilemma as it is little short of sacrificing important points related to the establishment of the relations between the two countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to awaken itself so that it may stop swimming against the trend of the times.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

With a surging indignation, he authored the five-point policy for national reunification phrase by phrase on the running train in order to bridge over the prevailing difficulties facing the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He delivered the historic speech \"Let Us Prevent a National Partition and Reunify the Country\" four hours after the publication of the \"separatist statement\" on June 23. In the speech, he set forth the Five-point Policy for National Reunification, thus dealing an instant counterblow to the separatist theory of the anti-reunification elements and giving courage to the fellow-countrymen who aspired after reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The contents of the policy is to eliminate military confrontation and ease the tension between the north and south, to achieve multilateral collaboration and interchange between the north and south, to convene a Great National Congress comprising representatives of people of all levels, political parties and social organizations from the north and south, to institute a north-south Federation named the Federal Republic of Koryo (FRK), and to enter the UN as a single state under the name of the FRK. All the provisions of the policy fully reflect the noble intention and firm resolution of the President to prevent the permanent division of the nation and achieve the national reunification without fail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the publication of the reunification declaration, the whole nation vigorously waged a struggle for the independent and peaceful reunification of the country, under the uplifted slogan \"Korea is one!\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this process, the north-south agreement was concluded to be a foundation in ensuring peace such as \"Agreement on reconciliation, nonaggression, cooperation and interchange between the north and south\" and pan-national pro-reunification events including the pan-national rally and grand reunification festival of youth and students were held, with the result that a great advance was made in a national reunification movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Manifold difficulties still lie on the road of reunification movement owing to the obstructions of the U.S. imperialists and the anti-reunification forces of south Korea. But the patriotic cause of reunification of the Korean nation is sure to emerge victorious as long as there are the immortal and great reunification programme advanced by the President and the banner of the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration which are the embodiment of the programme.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The spirit of \"By our nation itself\" provided by the historic June 15 joint declaration to the Koreans constitutes a solid ideological basis for rallying close the Koreans as one under the patriotic banner, the banner of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans should display ardent patriotism and transparent spirit of independence to augment the might of great national unity in every way. Herein lies a sure guarantee for advancing the cause of independent reunification to victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With no desperate efforts can foreign forces and the south Korean conservative ruling forces, their lackeys, bar the Korean nation from achieving great unity under the uplifted banner of national independence.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 23 (KCNA) -- Candlelight struggle called \"48 hour-long emergency people's action\" was simultaneously kicked off throughout south Korea on June 21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n People from all walks of life throughout south Korea, infuriated by the announcement of the results of the additional negotiations with the U.S., turned out in streets in protest against the group of traitors' deceptive farce that day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In Seoul, a large-scale candlelight struggle was staged as part of the \"48 hour-long emergency people's action\" against the import of American beef with at least 100,000 members of civic and social organizations, youth, students and citizens involved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Speakers at the candlelight rally held in the plaza of the City Office pointed to the fact that the Lee Myung Bak group announced the results of the additional negotiations on the import of American beef that day, adding that there is no other way for the \"government\" than to have renegotiations in order to truly protect the lives and safety of the people and Lee Myung Bak is the specified dangerous man who should be eliminated by the people before any others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the end of the rally, its participants staged a demonstration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Prior to the candlelight action, the People's Measure Council against the Total Opening of south Korean Markets to American Beef held a press conference. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The organization declared at the conference that the Lee Myung Bak group's  additional negotiations are nothing but a charade to hoodwink the people and to let private traders ban the export of beef from cattle older than 30 months according to the regulation set by themselves is absolutely ineffective. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The security authorities rushed more than 10,000 riot policemen of 108 companies to the scene of the demonstration to crack down upon the protesters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Similar candlelight actions took place in Pusan, Kwangju, Taejon, Taegu, and Masan of South Kyongsang Province, Chongju and Umsong of North Chungchong Province, and Chunchon, Kangrung, Wonju and Nyongwol of Kangwon Province of south Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
