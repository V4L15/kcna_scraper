            "content": "KCNA urges IAEA to be impartial \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 29 (KCNA) -- Director general Mohamed Elbaradei at the annual conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) opened on September 17 said that \"the IAEA is continuing to monitor the freeze on facilities in North Korea under the 1994 agreement between the United States and North Korea, but the agency is unable to verify the accuracy of North Korea's nuclear program\" and a senior Japanese official was impudent enough to \"urge North Korea to cooperate with inspections and to comply with its obligation under the safeguard agreement promptly and completely,\" Kyodo News said.\r\n This can not be construed otherwise than reckless acts of the riffraff to shift the responsibility for the non-compliance with the agreed framework on to the DPRK, defying international justice and impartiality, pursuant to the U.S. policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the DPRK clarified more than once, the issue of implementing the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework (AF) allows no interference by others, as it is a matter to be solved between the two countries. If the IAEA conference wants to know who is to blame, it should, first of all, call the U.S. into question for being insincere in the implementation of the agreed framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n 2003, the target year for the U.S. provision of LWR to the DPRK is near at hand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. had remained sincere in implementing the AF, it would have been implemented to such a level as to enable the DPRK and the IAEA to start negotiations on verifying the accuracy and perfectness of the initial report on nuclear substance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Turning away from all these facts, the IAEA raised the unreasonable issue of inspection which had originally been expected to be discussed only after a considerable part of the LWR project was carried out and before the delivery of major nuclear-related parts. Evidently, this is an act of putting a brake on implementation of the af. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan, in particular, should drop its bad habit of reading big powers' faces and pulling up others to meet its own interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has secretly stockpiled plutonium enough to make thousands of nuclear weapons and is accelerating the development of missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons despite the international community's strong protest and condemnation. It is, therefore, shameless and foolish for Japan to raise a hue and cry over someone's \"fulfilment of obligation.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In a word, some forces of Japan and the IAEA, hell-bent on the anti-DPRK hostile policy, have become so reckless as to be unable to distinguish truth from lies and preserve neutrality and impartiality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The IAEA should bear in mind that it should be impartial if it is to honestly remain true to international justice.    \r\n\r\n"

Established in Juche 57 (1968) as the central institute of musical instruments, it is staffed by dozens of researchers and skilled craftsmen.\r\n Korea's traditional instruments produce simple yet graceful, soft sounds representative of national tastes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The company's improvements include the minor Haegum (four-string fiddle) and the Kayagum (plucking instrument). It has diversified the Oungum (plucking instrument), invented in the early 1960s, into small, medium and large ones, and recently produced the bass Oungum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The plucking Okryugum is particularly popular with musicians and amateurs alike for its beautiful sounds similar to the jingle of gems. After its invention in the 1970s, it underwent a series of improvements up to 1998. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The researchers have compiled \"pictorial book of Korean national musical instruments\" and other books on the same theme.    \r\n\r\n"
