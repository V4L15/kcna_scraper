They tell that the Japanese imperialists are the sworn enemy of the Korean people and the aggressive nature of the Japanese reactionaries will never change. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The book \"We Indict the Japanese Imperialists for Their Century-Long Crime-Woven History\" published by the Science and Encyclopedia Press cites with perfect logic and undeniable facts various types of crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists in different periods to prove that all sorts of atrocities perpetrated by them against the Korean people in the last century were unprecedentedly hideous criminal acts to exterminate the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The book refers to the facts that the Japanese imperialists committed unpardonable man-killings and plunder and violated human rights for over 40 years after occupying Korea by force of arms and have openly pushed forward their moves for overseas expansion, whitewashing their history of aggression even today. It also assails the Japanese authorities for desperately pursuing a hostile policy towards the DPRK and frantically suppressing the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The book \"Story of Tok Islet\" was brought out by the Social Science Publishing House. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The book having four chapters tells that the Korean people discovered Ulrung Island and Tok Islet before any others to use them as their cradles in the course of exploring the East Sea of Korea from ancient times and have exercised dominion over them for thousands of years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The book cites historical facts such as the well known case of An Ryong Bok to prove that the \"dominion over Tok Islet\" much touted by the Japanese reactionaries still today is nothing but sheer sophism and part of their moves for reinvasion because they worked hard to realize their wild ambition for territorial expansion through Korean aggression from 800 years ago.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Its claim is nothing but an artifice to disarm the DPRK. The U.S. is keen to whip the latter, while holding out an olive branch. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK can never remain a passive onlooker to this. It will reinforce its war deterrent in every way under the situation where the U.S. is planning to launch a war against it at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As water and fire are mutually destructive, dialogue and war maneuvers cannot go together. The U.S. should face up to the reality with a cool head and stop its reckless military moves against the DPRK which put dialogue and peace at peril. This is the key to the settlement of the issue.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But no aggression forces dare spark off a war on the Korean Peninsula. This is entirely attributable to the Songun politics. Therefore, the Songun politics is the genuine banner of defending peace that the Korean nation should hold high. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to achieve the unity of the whole nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unity of all Koreans in the north and the south and abroad should be strengthened in every way under the banner of \"By our nation itself\". And it should be thoroughly oriented to achieving the national reunification, the supreme task of the Koreans. It is urgent to whip up the atmosphere of reconciliation and unity among the Koreans and develop onto a new high stage the solidarity and unity of reunification movement organizations of different strata with the All-Korean Committee for Implementation of June 15 Joint Declaration as a matrix. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And all Koreans should heighten their vigilance and decisively smash the despicable moves of the pro-American reactionary forces in south Korea who stand against the unity of the nation and the cause of independent reunification, negating the idea of \"By our nation itself\" and giving importance to outsiders and cooperating with them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japanese Authorities' Suppression of Chongryon under Fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tokyo, November 12 (KNS-KCNA) -- A seminar took place in Tokyo on Nov. 8 under the sponsorship of the Seminar on Rights of Japan-resident Koreans to protest against the Japanese authorities' crackdown on the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) and human rights abuses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Shigeru Tokoi, representative of the Seminar, said that in recent years the Japanese authorities have got unprecedentedly outrageous in the political suppression of Chongryon and Korean residents in Japan and the violation of their rights. Nobody is allowed to encroach upon the freedom and equality of Koreans in Japan, the representative stressed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the seminar, Hong Sang Jin, secretary general of the Central Headquarters of the Korean Side to the Fact-finding Group on Forcible Drafting of Koreans, Kenjo Kogawa, a Japanese lawyer, and Akira Maeta, professor of Tokyo Zokei College, respectively made reports titled \"The 1905 Treaty and the issue on remains of the victims of forcible drafting\", \"On the present conditions related to such matters as the decision to cancel the permission for use of the Great Music Hall in Hibiya Park, litigation over remedy and litigation over the case of fixed property tax imposed on Chongryon facilities and their prospect\", and \"We ponder over the suppression of Chongryon and racial discrimination\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They held that the violation of Japan-resident Koreans' rights was started as Japan fabricated the \"Ulsa Five-point Treaty\" in 1905 and put Korea under its colonial control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They denounced the anti-DPRK policy of the Japanese authorities who have been hell-bent on suppression of Chongryon and encroachment upon rights of Koreans in Japan, distorting history, passing an unjust judgment on the lawsuit demanding reduction and exemption of fixed property tax and canceling the permission for rallies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that Japan has not shown earnest attitude toward the normalization of relations between the DPRK and Japan under the pretext of the \"abduction issue\" which already found its solution, they demanded that it immediately discard the national chauvinistic idea it has inspired, taking advantage of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
