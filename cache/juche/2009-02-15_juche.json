            "content": "National Meeting Held to Celebrate Kim Jong Il's Birthday\r\nPyongyang, February 15 (KCNA) -- A national meeting took place here on Sunday to celebrate the birthday of General Secretary Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t Present there were senior party, army and state officials, the chairpersons of friendly parties, officials of party, armed forces and power organs, social organizations, ministries and national institutions, servicepersons, officials of scientific, educational, cultural and art, public health and press organs, bereaved families of revolutionary martyrs, labor innovators, working people in the city, congratulatory groups and delegations of overseas compatriots and compatriots and the chief of the Pyongyang mission of the Anti-Imperialist National Democratic Front.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Yong Nam, Politburo member of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and president of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly, made a report at the meeting.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reporter said that the birth of Kim Jong Il as the son of legendary guerillas in Mt. Paektu was a great fortune of the Korean nation that promised the brilliant future for the revolutionary cause of Juche and an event of world historic significance that brought about a bright prospect for the human cause of independence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed that the history of humankind has never known such peerlessly great man as Kim Jong Il who has steadily led the country and the nation and the revolution and construction to victory with his extraordinary ideological and theoretical wisdom, veteran and experienced leadership art and noble virtues.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reporter went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What holds a distinguished position in Kim Jong Il's ideological and theoretical activities is the fact that he enriched President Kim Il Sung's idea giving importance to the military affairs in keeping with the requirements of the developing reality to formulate the philosophy on arms that the revolution is started, advanced and accomplished with arms and the principle of Songun that the army represents the party, state and people and, on this basis, expounded the theories of the Songun revolution in an overall way. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He established the Korean-style state leadership system with the National Defence Commission as its backbone, thus providing a legal and institutional guarantee for developing the DPRK government into a powerful political weapon to apply the Songun idea and leadership of the party and comprehensively ensure the Songun politics in all realms of the revolution and construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also formulated the lines of national reunification advanced by the President as the three charters for national reunification and set forth them as a banner of national reunification and an action program for achieving the independent and peaceful reunification. And he wisely led the struggle of the Korean people for their materialization to open up an epochal phase for national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to his independent and mature external political activities, the DPRK has positively contributed to global peace and the human cause of independence in the idea of independence, peace and friendship even under the complicated international situation and the dignity and influence of Songun Korea have been enhanced unprecedentedly in international arena while rapidly expanding its foreign relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reporter stressed the need to bring the great heyday of Songun Korea, holding high the torch of a new great revolutionary surge Kim Jong Il kindled when he visited Kangson, the birthplace of the Chollima movement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the south Korean conservative authorities dared defame the supreme dignity of the Korean people, totally denied the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and the October 4 declaration and unhesitatingly violated the north-south agreements adopted in the past, thus pushing the inter-Korean relations to the brink of war, the worst crisis, the reporter warned that if they challenge the DPRK to the last despite its repeated warnings, it would punish the group of traitors with decisive actions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will as ever develop the relations with the countries which are friendly towards it in the idea of independence, peace and friendship and positively contribute to the realization of the cause of global independence, the reporter stated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed that only victory and glory are always in store for Songun Korea led by Kim Jong Il, the peerlessly great man of Mt. Paektu who performed the undying feats to be recorded forever in the history of the country by guiding the party and the revolution during several decades of his great revolutionary career and is bringing the greatest heyday of prosperity for the country and the nation, which will shine more brilliantly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Similar celebration meetings and rallies were held in different provinces, cities and counties of the country on the same day."
