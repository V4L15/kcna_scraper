There is very acute shortage of electricity in the DPRK after it took the step of nuclear program  freezing. The economic loss caused by this is far greater than the price for the heavy oil provided by the U.S. There is no prospect of finishing the LWR project even in 2010. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe United States should own its due responsibility for this and make a compensation for the delay. It is preposterous for U.S. officials to claim \"payment for the supply of heavy oil.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the United States thinks that it alone has the right to take an option, it is seriously mistaken. The DPRK is also free to take an option. We will not waste time, bound by the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework which no one knows when it will be implemented. It is not difficult for the U.S. to guess what consequences it will entail in that case. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States will be wholly responsible for this. \r\n\r\n"

These monumental edifices that demonstrated the powerful might of Juche Korea were possible thanks to the spirit of self-reliance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The economic situation in the country is worse than that in the post-war period owing to the persistent moves of the imperialists to stifle and isolate the DPRK in recent years, the collapse of the world socialist market and several years of natural disasters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people, however, have laid a firm foundation for the construction of a prosperous country in recent years, holding fast to the principle of self-reliance as a precious sword to win a sure victory in building a powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the firm conviction and will of the Korean people to overcome today's difficulties and make new progress in all fields of socialist construction in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance. \r\n\r\n"
