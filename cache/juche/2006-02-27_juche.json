The 70 million fellow countrymen are now vigorously conducting the movement for independent reunification across the country under the banner of \"By our nation itself\" in an effort to establish national sovereignty and national independence and cooperation are prevailing in the history of the nation. This proud reality is a brilliant fruition brought about by the embodiment of his great idea of national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His idea and leadership serve as a banner for encouraging the fellow countrymen in their struggle to frustrate the aggression and war moves of the bellicose forces at home and abroad and defend peace and security of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The structure of confrontation between the Korean nation and the United States has been formed in the Korean Peninsula amid the daily growing struggle of the 70 million fellow countrymen for peace against war. This is proceeding from the confidence and pluck of the Korean nation encouraged by the great patriotic Songun politics which helps firmly defend national dignity and sovereignty and peace and security of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His idea and leadership are the great motive force to achieve national reconciliation and unity and strengthen the driving force of national reunification in every way. \r\n The reconciliation and unity of the Korean nation has opened the new era of \"By our nation itself\" startling the world people thanks to his wide patriotic all-embracing politics. He leads whoever strives for national reunification with national conscience, irrespective of capitalist, army general or ruling stratum, to stand in the ranks of great national unity and embraces anyone who repents of wrong doings and intends to devote himself to the cause of national reunification even though he betrayed the nation and took a wrong road in the past.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

He even went the length of uttering that the nuclear issue and the human rights issue of the north ought to be settled. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His remarks speak for the pro-U.S. conservatives keen to suppress those forces standing for progress and reform and the June 15 reunification forces with the approaching of local autonomous election due in May in south Korea, win election and take the next-term office of power, the commentary says, and goes on:\r\n What is more serious is that he made virulent outcries about someone's non-existent \"human rights issue\" while shelving the crimes they have committed by driving the south Koreans into an abyss and ruthlessly abusing their human rights with sycophantic treachery, fascism, corruption and irregularities and political chaos. It admits of no argument that his remarks are aimed to fan up the war hysteria of the U.S. imperialist master keen on a smear campaign for finding the pretext of isolating and stifling the DPRK and incite fratricidal confrontation and war. The traitorous nature of the GNP will never change just as a crow is never the whiter for often washing.\r\n The GNP clan is making desperate efforts to get rid of their deplorable plight of being thrown away into the garbage of history for turning their back to the times and people's mind-set and attain their dirty greed for power at any cost, but in vain.\r\n The GNP should not resort to such a silly thing as trying to prolong its remaining days by inciting confrontation and war with fellow countrymen in conspiracy with the outsiders but stand a trial of history by itself as unanimously demanded by the times and the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They threatened and blackmailed the feudal government of the Ri Dynasty, firing guns. Finally on Feb. 27 they fabricated the \"Kanghwa Island Treaty\" in a coercive way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The treaty contains 12 clauses including those which force Korea to open its ports and grant Japan the right to make a survey of its coastal waters and work out a marine chart. It was, therefore, an illegal one as it was cooked up amid the threat of the Japanese imperialists' armed intervention and under their pressure in disregard of the will and interests of the Korean nation. It was, at the same time, an unequal document of aggression as it paved the way for the Japanese imperialists' aggression of Korea aimed at subjugating Korea politically, economically and militarily.\r\n Japan is now inciting militarism seized by the same ambition for overseas expansion as in those days when they cooked up the shackling treaty. It is whetting the sword to stage a comeback to Korea, hell bent on the confrontation with the DPRK in support of the U.S. hostile policy toward it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The crimes the Japanese imperialists committed against the Koreans are still fresh in the memory of the Koreans. They will certainly force them to pay for those crimes. The Koreans will never pardon the GNP, a gang of wicked sycophants and traitors  keen on serving the U.S. and Japan in utter disregard of the dignity and interests of the nation, but deal deadly blows at them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
