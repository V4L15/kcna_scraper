The U.S. enacted the anti-DPRK evil law such as \"north Korean Human Rights Act\" in spite of opposition and denunciation at home and abroad. It is scheming to divide and disorganize the DPRK and spread American-style \"democracy\", while planning to nominate a \"special envoy in charge of north Korean human rights\" under the pretext of \"improved human rights\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is now getting all the more vicious in its moves to massively smuggle small radios, ultra-small TV sets, etc. into the DPRK in an attempt to destroy the single-minded unity of the DPRK and disorganize and degenerate it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to shatter the imperialists' moves for ideological and cultural poisoning, it is imperative to enhance the consciousness of national independence and thoroughly reject American-style \"democracy\" and way of life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those countries aspiring after independence should not depend on the \"aid\" of the West but train their strength in their own spirit and strive to settle the impending issues with their independent and creative stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And they should pay deep attention to ideological education among young people and firmly arm people with anti-American working class consciousness.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Downfall of Capitalism and Victory of Socialism, Law of Historical Development\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 2 (KCNA) -- It is an inexorable truth that socialism that is new overpowers and defeats capitalism that is  old and without future, declares Rodong Sinmun Saturday, adding: No force can change this law of historical development.\r\n The author of the article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In capitalist society, neither the inequality in material life can be removed nor the imbalance between material life and mental and cultural life getting further impoverished and that between the growing demand of the popular masses for independence and their worsening political life can be overcome because the material life of the people becomes deformed, their mental and cultural life impoverished and political life is made extremely reactionary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Herein lie the insoluble contradictions in capitalist society and, for this reason, the collapse of capitalism is inevitable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Capitalism is in a serious economic crisis and the contradictions and confrontation among the capitalist countries are escalated. Capitalism is the rubbish of history which has lived its days, being the most reactionary old force in human history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Stating that socialism is sure to emerge victorious for its scientific accuracy and truth, the article continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Socialism is the ideal of humankind and a society representing its future. The ideal of humankind is to lead an independent and happy life together in a free and peaceful world without any form of exploitation and oppression, domination and subjugation,   aggression and war. This common demand and aspiration of humankind are embodied in socialist idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The orientation of historical development is development to socialism. Transition from capitalism to socialism is the lawful course of the development of human society. If the independence of the popular masses is to be realized, the capitalist society based on individualism has to give place to the socialist society based on collectivism. This is an immovable truth and the historical sum total of the development of human society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world revolutionary people should wage a vigorous struggle to advance the socialist cause, deeply conscious of the scientific truth that it is the law of historical development that capitalism goes to ruin and socialism triumphs.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Centenarians Increase\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 2 (KCNA) -- A centenarian birthday table sent by leader Kim Jong Il was conveyed to grandma Song Yong Suk living in Sinyang-dong, Sariwon City, North Hwanghae Province, on Friday.\r\n Centenarians are growing in number in Korea. This year, too, macrobians have been reported from different parts of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some time ago macrobians including Ko Ok Dok residing in Saegori-dong, Haeju City, South Hwanghae Province, Kim Won Suk in Tohwa-ri, Kaechon City, South Phyongan Province, and Ri Won Ho in Ryonghung-ri, Mundok County, South Phyongan Province, greeted their centenarian birthday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Old folks who have lived more than 100 years and old men past 90 who have newly registered as macrobians are many across the country. They are under the special care of doctors assigned to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From old times, it was said many people lived long in ideal land with clean air and water. But, before the liberation of the country, the Korean people could not realize their desire to live long in happiness in this good land. In the same land 90-100 years old macrobians are growing in number day by day. This secret cannot be explained only by natural elements. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The macrobians say in unison that they live long in good health as they enjoy a happy life under the rays of the sun that has provided them with a kind socialist health care system and takes care of their destiny in a responsible manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il sends benevolent birthday tables to centenarians, so glad at the reports about them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The increase of macrobians is a pride and joy of the country and they are blessed by the leader. This rare reality can be witnessed only under the socialist system of Korea centred on the popular masses.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Society for Rallying Comrades, First Party Organization in Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 2 (KCNA) -- Seventy-five years have elapsed since the first party organization in Korea -- the Society for Rallying Comrades -- was formed.\r\n After advancing a proper and realistic policy for founding a party at the historic Kalun Meeting (June 30-July 2, 1930) President Kim Il Sung formed the first party organization at Jinmyong School in Kalun on July 3, Juche 19 (1930). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The first party organization was the embryo and seed of the Workers' Party of Korea. \r\n From then on, the Korean revolution could advance with a true vanguard of revolutionaries of a new generation under the leadership of the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a solid foundation for building a party was laid during the hard-fought anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle, the WPK could be founded in a matter of two months after the country's liberation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK was further strengthened through the fierce Fatherland Liberation War, the difficult postwar rehabilitation and construction, and the tremendous creation and construction for laying the foundation of socialism through the Chollima upsurge. And it has grown up to be a strong party with millions of members. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the trial years of the \"Arduous March\" and forced march the Party's cohesion and the unity of the revolutionary ranks were cemented. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK, the unity of which has been consolidated thanks to the ideas of the President and the leadership of Kim Jong Il, will always lead the revolution and construction to victory.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
