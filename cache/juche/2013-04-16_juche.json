Korean Puppet Forces\r\nPyongyang, April 16 (KCNA) -- The supreme command of the Korean People's Army issued the following ultimatum to the south Korean puppet forces on Tuesday:\n\t\t\t\t\tThe world is in a festive mood on the auspicious Day of the Sun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEven though an acute situation is prevailing in the DPRK, all the people are celebrating the Day of the Sun as the greatest national holiday.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is only the south Korean puppet forces who hurled a group of anti-communist gangsters into a rally against the DPRK in the heart of Seoul in broad daylight at which they set fire to the portraits, the symbols of its supreme dignity, the thrice-cursed crime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll the service personnel and people of the DPRK are simmering with towering resentment at this monstrous criminal act.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn view of this situation the Supreme Command of the KPA sends the following ultimatum to the south Korean puppet forces:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1.  Our retaliatory action will start without any notice from now as such thrice-cursed criminal act of hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK is being openly committed in the heart of Seoul under the patronage of the puppet authorities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTo be included in the targets of retaliation are those directly or indirectly involved in the operation to hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and those who instigated the perpetrators and connived their crime and the relevant organs and departments of the authorities involved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. The DPRK's revolutionary armed forces will start immediately their just military actions to show how the service personnel and people of the DPRK value and protect the dignity of the supreme leadership.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe military demonstration of the DPRK's revolutionary armed forces will be powerful sledge-hammer blows at all hostile forces hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. If the puppet authorities truly want dialogue and negotiations, they should apologize for all anti-DPRK hostile acts, big and small, and show the compatriots their will to stop all these acts in practice."

            "content": "DPRK FM Spokesman Dismisses U.S. Talk about Dialogue as Rhetoric Misleading World Opinion\r\nPyongyang, April 16 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued the following statement on Tuesday:\n\t\t\t\t\tRecently U.S. high-ranking officials are vying with each other to talk about dialogue. This is nothing but a crafty ploy to evade the blame for the tension on the eve of a war by pretending to refrain from military actions and stand for dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is none other than the U.S which sparked off a vicious cycle of tension, pursuant to its hostile policy to stifle the DPRK by force of arms, and pushed the situation on the Korean Peninsula to the worst phase. The tension began escalating there due to the U.S. wanton violation of the DPRK's right to satellite launch for peaceful purposes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere is no country in the world which does not react to the encroachment upon the legitimate right of a sovereign state to develop space and its sovereignty. The nuclear war maneuvers staged by the U.S. against the DPRK in the wake of its prodding of the UN Security Council into the cooking up of brigandish \"resolutions on sanctions\" one after another compelled the latter to clarify its stand to take military countermeasures for self-defence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOne may know well who is to blame for the tension when looking into who benefits from this.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. benefited from drastically increasing its military deployment pursuant to its Asia-Pacific-pivot strategy by massively introducing all latest weaponry while inciting military confrontation with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S., which regards the DPRK as the primary target of its attack in the Asia-Pacific region, not only deployed all its operational nuclear strike means but also posed the threat of the largest-ever physical nuclear strike to the DPRK in recent months.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt openly introduced strategic nuclear subs out of its three major strategic nuclear strike means into the waters off the Korean Peninsula, and let its strategic bombers openly make sorties into the sky of the peninsula for drills of dropping nukes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe third strategic nuclear strike means, the inter-continental ballistic missile launch, was reportedly postponed for the time being, but it is scheduled for May.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEven now the U.S. is letting its nuclear-powered carrier strike groups operate in waters off the peninsula, staging ceaseless DPRK-targeted nuclear war drills.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is the height of rhetoric intended to mislead the world opinion to talk about dialogue for dismantling the DPRK's nuclear deterrent under this situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. is sadly mistaken if it calculates the DPRK will pay slightest heed to such talk about dialogue as a robber's calling for a negotiated solution while brandishing his gun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWorse still, the U.S. claim that it will opt for dialogue when the DPRK shows its will for denuclearization first is a very impudent hostile act of disregarding the line of the Workers' Party of Korea and the law of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK is not opposed to dialogue but has no idea of sitting at the humiliating negotiating table with the party brandishing a nuclear stick. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDialogue should be based on the principle of respecting sovereignty and equality--this is the DPRK's consistent stand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGenuine dialogue is possible only at the phase where the DPRK has acquired nuclear deterrent enough to defuse the U.S. threat of nuclear war unless the U.S. rolls back its hostile policy and nuclear threat and blackmail against the former. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis time when the DPRK has been exposed to the U.S. direct and substantial threat of nuclear attack, it keenly felt the need to bolster up its nuclear deterrence both in quality and quantity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is quite natural for the DPRK to take counteractions for self-defence by beefing up nuclear force now that the U.S., world's biggest nuclear weapons state, threatens and blackmails the former with a nuclear stick.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe nuclear strike drills staged by the U.S. against the DPRK leave the latter with no option but to conduct drills to cope with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere is no guarantee that these drills will not go over to a real war and the U.S. will be held wholly accountable for all the ensuing consequences. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK will escalate its military countermeasures for self-defence unless the U.S. ceases its nuclear war drills and withdraws all its war hardware for aggression."

Korean Puppet Forces for Hurting Dignity of DPRK's Supreme Leadership\r\nPyongyang, April 16 (KCNA) -- A monstrous crime that shocked the Korean nation and the progressive mankind was committed in south Korea on the Day of the Sun, the greatest holiday of the Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean puppet forces mobilized gangsters to hold an anti-DPRK rally in downtown Seoul and torch portraits of great men symbolic of the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is an intolerable and shuddering act.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNow a touch-and-go situation has been created on the Korean Peninsula due to the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces' anti-DPRK moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDespite this acute situation, the Day of the Sun is being celebrated as an auspicious event of the nation and the world, reflective of the unanimous desire of the Korean nation and the world progressives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe puppet forces, however, are finding fault with the events for celebrating the Day of the Sun while stepping up the campaign for a war against the DPRK in collusion with the U.S. master in response to the just and toughest measures taken by the army and people of the DPRK to defend its sovereignty and the dignity. They made no hesitation of hurting the dignity of the DPRK, a thrice-cursed hideous provocation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe puppet group instigated the reptile media to create an extreme warlike situation and speak ill of the DPRK's festive mood for the celebration of the Day of the Sun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Day of the Sun has historically been celebrated as the greatest holiday of the nation. But the south Korean forces reviled at it, calling it a \"demonstration of the validity of the social system\" and an \"intention to rally local peoole.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey even talked about the \"trouble\" faced by the supreme headquarters of the DPRK in the wake of the \"south side's proposal for dialogue\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOn April 15, the south Korean chief executive at a grand mass made such a nonsensical remark that \"if the north makes a correct option, the south will take the road of common progress.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe puppet forces committed the bullying acts of hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK in downtown Seoul in broad daylight. Still they speak loudly of dialogue in public, the height of folly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe present south Korean ruling forces are going on the rampage, trying to make a political provocation and staging war exercises against the DPRK in alignment with the U.S. This proves that they are a group of traitors little different from the Lee Myung Bak group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe fuse of a war is now burning on due to the reckless moves of the puppet forces that are making ceaseless provocations, steadily escalating the situation on the Korean Peninsula to realize their design for the aggression of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army stated in the ultimatum, the military demonstration of the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK will become a sledge-hammer blow at the hostile forces of all stripes that hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe criminals have already jumped into fire with faggots on their back. They will have hardest time till the DPRK's retaliatory action starts without notice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe gangsters who took part in the criminal act will be made to blame themselves for harsh punishment that will be meted out to them."
