            "content": "U.S. and S. Korean Puppets Warned Not to Act Rashly\r\n Pyongyang, March 5 (KCNA) -- A spokesman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea today issued a statement denouncing the United States and the south Korean puppets for planning to stage large-scale joint military maneuvers Key Resolve and Foal Eagle across south Korea from March 9 at any cost defying the repeated warnings of the DPRK and unanimous protest at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t The projected joint military maneuvers are a grave provocation to the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK and a criminal act against peace as they will seriously endanger the security of the Korean nation and the situation in the region, the statement said, and continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The committee in the name of all Koreans bitterly denounces the U.S. and the Lee Myung Bak group for the projected DPRK-targeted war maneuvers aimed at bringing the dark clouds of a nuclear war to hang over the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This saber-rattling is large-scale war exercises, the first of their kind since the emergence of the new administration in the United States. The moves stepped up by the U.S. and the south Korean puppets to provoke a nuclear war after massively introducing various types of nuclear weapons into south Korea clearly prove that they are the arch criminals standing in the way of denuclearizing the Peninsula and that the \"denuclearization\" much touted by them is nothing but a smokescreen to cover up their scenario to invade the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said war maneuvers will be staged under the situation where the north-south agreement on putting an end to the politico-military standoff and preventing military conflicts has been declared totally null and void due to the frantic moves of the Lee group to escalate the confrontation with the DPRK. They are, therefore, so dangerous actions for war that they may develop into an actual war any moment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the touch-and-go situation where the north and the south are in full combat readiness and level their rifles and artillery pieces at each other, no one can guess what will trigger off a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's military force for self-defence will never allow any slightest provocation or its sign in the sky, land and sea but deal decisive and devastating blows at the aggressors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the situation prevailing in the Peninsula no one knows what military conflicts will be touched off by the reckless war exercises of the U.S. and the puppet clique for a war of aggression against the DPRK. It is, therefore, compelled to declare that security cannot be guaranteed for south Korean civil airplanes flying through the territorial air of our side and its vicinity, its territorial air and its vicinity above the East Sea of Korea, in particular, while the military exercises are under way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the south Korean puppets are sadly mistaken if they calculate they can browbeat someone by demonstrating what they call \"alliance\" and \"force\" through the projected saber rattling and get rid of their domestic and international crisis. On the contrary, it will bring into bolder relief the true colors as confrontational maniacs and aggressors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the Lee group would be well advised to stop their rash acts, properly understanding the fixed will and spirit of the revolutionary armed forces and people of the DPRK."
