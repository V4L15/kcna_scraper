And he added it is needed to further update the training equipment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He instructed that the pilots should be well trained how to aviate in bad weather conditions and practiced in such skills through steady drills with seat and training equipment so that they can creditably discharge their combat duty in any time and even under any unfavorable situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The pilots also need to intensify their physical training, he said, adding he would see to it that all-round sports facilities with indoor swimming pool and stadium and outdoor facilities are built on a modern basis at every Air and Anti-Air Force division.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then the supreme commander guided an air ambush combat drill of the unit's fighter pilots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching the drill with a smile on his face, he praised the airmen for their high aviation and successful drill.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is the key to ensuring the combat preparedness of the air force is for the pilots to acquire the high navigation, he said, stressing: All the pilots should steadily study and perfect the Juche-based air tactics, the guerilla-style war method, and make the flight drill part of their life and inveterate habit and thus prepare themselves as stalwart fighters capable of creditably discharging their combat tasks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He met the airmen involved in the drill and congratulated them on their successful drill.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Seeing the pursuit plane No. 302, watched by leader Kim Jong Il, he expressed great satisfaction over the fact that airmen and technical servicemen have managed it well. Those planes associated with the history of the great Generalissimos should be managed in a more responsible manner so that they may lead the red hawks in air combats for defence of the country when a war breaks out, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round bedroom, mess hall, kitchen and other parts of the unit, the supreme commander took warm care of the airmen's living with paternal love.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had a photo session with the airmen and technical servicemen, expressing belief that the pilots of the unit would make a collective innovation in their combat and political drills for the new year by intensifying the training on a regular alert, ready to make sortie immediately when the WPK Central Committee issues an order.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Vice Marshal Hwang Pyong So, director of the KPA General Political Bureau, and O Il Jong, Han Kwang Sang and Ri Pyong Chol, leading officials of the WPK Central Committee."
