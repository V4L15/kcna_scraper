He was pleased with the environment of the farm where formative art was applied at a high level. He noted with pleasure that the farm has radically changed the appearance of the area.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After being briefed on the farm before a map showing its panoramic view, he went round the raw material, fermenting, seeding, cultivating and raising rooms, technical preparation room, the combined control room and the sci-tech knowledge dissemination room and various other places of the farm.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He noted that the farm established well the management information, production control and automatic control systems on the basis of real-time check of useful information to organize production and management, adding that an integrated production system ranging from raw material feeding to forwarding was perfectly set up to put the production processes on a highly automated and streamlined basis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Learning that the equipment of the farm was made with indigenous efforts, technology and materials, he said that the longer he watched them they looked nice.

The only peaceful way to unify different ideologies and systems is to realize the reunification by means of federation formula. In fact, one third of the world population live in various types of federal states. It is today's reality that different systems co-exist in a country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ten-point programme of great unity of the whole nation, which clarified the ultimate goal, ideological basis, principles and concrete ways for the great national unity also reflects the Korean nation's demand, interests and experience as well as aspirations and desire of the progressive mankind. The programme is run through with fair and persuasive articles that everybody can accept regardless of ideology, political view and system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Comrade Kim Il Sung had conducted energetic external activities to strengthen international support and solidarity with the reunification line.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His energetic external activities and wise leadership aroused full support and sympathy with the DPRK's reunification proposals from heads of party, state and government and political and social personages of many countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The three principles of national reunification enjoyed unanimous support at the 28th UN General Assembly in 1973. The 4th and 5th summit meetings of non-aligned states in 1973 and 1976 adopted resolutions that fully supported the reunification policy of the DPRK government. In June 1977, the International Liaison Committee for Korea's Reunification and Peace was founded and international conferences were held successively in support of the Korean people's cause of reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t More than 1.6 billion people from 105 countries participated in the international signature campaign that took place from March 1981 to March 1982 in support of the DFRK founding proposal. Over 1.7 billion people from 150-odd countries took part in the signature campaign from April to October 1994 in support of the Ten-Point Programme of Great Unity of the Whole Nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that President Kim Il Sung had striven to reject outsiders' interference and create peaceful environment for Korea's reunification, the report said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since the early days of the country's division, the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung set forth the policy of independent reunification free from foreign interference and wisely guided the external activities for putting an end to the U.S. military occupation of south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK government staged vigorous struggle to create international environment favorable for national reunification under his wise guidance. As a result, the 28th UN General Assembly in 1973 passed a resolution on dismantlement of the UN Commission on the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea which had been misused as a tool for legalizing the sustained division of the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In March 1974 the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung saw to it that the 3rd Session of the 5th Supreme People's Assembly of the DPRK sent a letter proposing the U.S. Congress to hold the DPRK-U.S. talks to discuss peace treaty and withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea. He also led vigorously external activities to adopt a resolution in support of the proposal at the UN General Assembly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the 30th UN General Assembly in 1975, the DPRK's proposal for replacing the armistice with a durable peace and creating condition favorable for promotion of independent and peaceful reunification of Korea was adopted by an overwhelming majority, thus totally frustrating the U.S. attempts to legalize its military occupation of south Korea by separating the issue of dismantlement of the \"UN Command\" and the issue of withdrawal of U.S. troops from south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The report cited data to show that President Kim Il Sung had wisely led the work to reduce tension and ensure peace in the Korean Peninsula and create environment favorable for national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It also elaborated on the efforts made by leader Kim Jong Il and respected Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un to further glorify the exploits of President Kim Il Sung for national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the fixed will of Kim Jong Un to build a dignified, prosperous and powerful, reunified country on this land without fail, true to the noble, patriotic intension and wishes of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, the report said, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under his guidance, the great leaders' behests for national reunification will be implemented without fail."

The U.S. is, indeed, the kingpin of nuclear proliferation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., which trumpeted about building a \"world without nuclear weapons\" more loudly than others, is now openly calling for \"bolstering nuclear force to maintain an unchallenged edge in military capability\" while complaining that \"the U.S. nuclear force is left behind other country's\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even at the moment it is invariably carrying on nuclear weapons modernization requiring 1 trillion USD that had been pushed forward since the preceding administration under the motto of \"peace by strength\".  It openly calls for abolishing the nuclear disarmament treaties with other nuclear powers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such a ferocious nuclear monster is faulting the nuclear force of the DPRK, the direct product of its nuclear blackmail. This is the height of absurdity and impudence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has to clearly understand the invariable stand of the DPRK that as long as there exists a nuclear weapons state hostile toward the DPRK, the security of the nation and the peace of the Korean peninsula can be protected only by dint of dependable nuclear deterrence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The more viciously the U.S. and its vassal forces pose nuclear threat and blackmail, the more strongly the DPRK will bolster the military capabilities for self-defence and preemptive attack with the nuclear force as a pivot."

            "content": "KCNA Commentary Snipes at German FM's Reckless Tongue-lashing\r\nPyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- The German foreign minister at a home press interview on Wednesday hurled mud at the DPRK, according to media reports.\n\t\t\t\t\t Crying out for tightening sanctions against the DPRK as it refuses to comply with the \"resolutions\" of the UN Security Council, the foreign minister let out a string of rubbish that the misanthropic Pyongyang regime is suppressing north Korean citizens in the cruelest manner and the irresponsible politics of Pyongyang goes against international law to threaten peace and security of the world beyond region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such outbursts are not suitable for the foreign minister of a country. It seems that the German foreign minister is so ignorant of the DPRK that he was utterly reckless with his words.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the foreign minister of a country wants to speak about other country, he should have at least elementary knowledge about that country in order not to be seized with prejudice in his comment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The socialist system in the DPRK is the most advantageous system in the world which regards human beings as the most valuable existence and makes everything serve the popular masses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK regards the improvement of the standard of people's living as the supreme principle of its state activities. It is the consistent political mode of its party and state to devotedly serve the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The people in the DPRK are free from taxes, doctor's fee and tuition and there are no jobless people in the DPRK. Such fact is something unbelievable in the West plagued by false propaganda against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Everyone remembers that the \"misanthropic regime\" touted by the German foreign minister once existed in Germany.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His call for slapping harsher sanctions by following the U.S. moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK cannot be construed otherwise than a paradox calling for threatening the existence and life of the Korean people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He seemed to echo outbursts of the U.S. conservative politicians without his own objective and fair-minded understanding and view. Such behavior is not suitable for his position as the foreign minister of a European power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had better see for himself what is going on in the world through a foreign tour, not revealing his ignorance through his reckless tongue-lashing."

Korean Regime's Sycophancy toward U.S.\r\nPyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- The south Korean puppet conservative group, whose fate is at stake after being cursed and rejected by the public, works hard to stay in power, calling for \"priority to the relations\" with the U.S. and \"strengthened alliance\".\n\t\t\t\t\t The authorities of south Korea, typically acting President Hwang Kyo An, have zealously asked the U.S. to strengthen \"alliance\", terming the entirely just steps taken by the DPRK to bolster its capabilities for self-defence \"provocation\" and \"threat.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Saturday in an article says it is a stupid deed of the traitors seized with ill-minded inveterate repugnancy and hostility toward the compatriots in the north and sycophancy toward the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The article goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet regime's call for \"priority to the relations\" with the U.S. and \"strengthened alliance\" is, in essence, a call for escalating confrontation with the DPRK and igniting a war against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korea-U.S. \"alliance\" is just a war alliance to carry out the U.S. policy for isolating and stifling the DPRK and realize its foreign strategy of aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The relations between the U.S. and the south Korean regime are no more than master-servant relations. The \"alliance\", in actuality, serves as a lever for the U.S. to tighten its control over colony-like south Korea and use its lackeys as a shock brigade for invading the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the conservative regime of south Korea continues desperately resorting to the policy of \"priority to the relations\" with the U.S. and \"strengthened alliance\", it will only further their master-servant relations, bring the north-south ties to a catastrophe and escalate the danger of nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"alliance\", a root cause of all sorts of misfortune and an obstacle to peace and reunification, should be dissolved without further delay.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The lesson taught by history is that the only way out for the south Korean regime is not to call for \"strengthened alliance\" with the U.S. but to join hands with the fellow countrymen in the north and mend the north-south relations."
