She added that she thus fell victim to an anti-DPRK plot-breeding organization of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Saying about what she felt while staying in Japan, she noted that the Japanese authorities enforced a very harsh policy of national discrimination and that the Japanese society was corrupt and ailing one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She went on to say: I keenly realized that the place one was born and grew up is neither one's native place nor one's motherland, but the place which takes care of one's destiny and future is the genuine cradle and homeland. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She noted: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-DPRK organizations made up of riff-raffs in Japan are now busy with all forms of false propaganda against the DPRK and the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon), raising a hue and cry over \"abduction issue\" and \"human rights issue\" etc. They demanded me to attend what they called \"press conference\" and \"meeting\" in a bid to use even me for their purpose. They attempted to use even the kindred ties between parents and their children for their political purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Speaking of what she felt after coming back into the care of General Kim Jong Il, she said she felt ashamed when she was warmly greeted and kindly treated by everyone she met.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The theory of ideology is embodied in its Songun politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The army transparent in thinking alone can guarantee the victory of the revolution and display its invincible might. This is the stand and will of the WPK. Precisely for this reason, the WPK has adhered to the principle of putting main emphasis on ideology as well as arms and combining the latter with the former and pushing ahead with the revolution and construction by dint of their might. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK's Songun politics is an embodiment of the theory of ideology. This can be explained well by the fact that it considers the revolutionary soldier spirit as a powerful weapon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said spirit which was created and is now being fully displayed by the soldiers of the Korean People's Army under the Songun leadership of the WPK is the noble revolutionary spirit of the Korean People's Army the keynote of which is the spirit of devotedly defending the leader, the spirit of carrying out his instructions in a do-or-die spirit and the heroic self-sacrificing spirit. It is also a spirit of dedicating one's youth and life to the party and the revolution, the country and people. This great revolutionary spirit representing the Songun era is a source of the inexhaustible might of the WPK's Songun politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The fact that the WPK's Songun politics is an embodiment of the theory of ideology finds a vivid expression in that it attaches decisive importance to the ideological education and gives top priority to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK is now paying deep attention to properly combining political and ideological education, moral education and education in cultural and emotional life in the ideological work as required by the Songun politics. The WPK raised the issues of educating people to have loyalty to the party and the leader as their faith, conscience, morality and part of their life and cherish patriotism not only as ideological faith but as conscience and a moral obligation. The policies for ideological education put forward by the WPK are displaying their tremendous vitality in practice, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The hysteric racket of suppressing Chongryon and Koreans in Japan kicked off in the island country reminds one of the Japanese imperialists' barbarian repression of Koreans before liberation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such hysteric suppression of Chongryon once again discloses before the world the true colors of Japan as a barren land of democracy and humanitarianism and a state ill-famed for the worst human rights abuses and terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Abe group's moves to do harm to Chongryon and Koreans in Japan are an unpardonable provocation to the DPRK and are nothing but self-destruction as they drive the DPRK-Japan relations to the worst ebb. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said sinister behavior of the Abe group bent on suppressing Chongryon without having even an iota of guilty conscience of the past is hardening the resolution of the Korean nation to certainly settle accounts with Japan, the sworn enemy, and mercilessly wipe out the bandits of Japanese militarism.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
