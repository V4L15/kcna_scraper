Since then, she had devoted her all for defending the leadership of revolution with her very life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She, with the thoroughgoing principle that any trifle mistake must not be allowed in defending the President, exposed and frustrated the sinister plots of the enemies to destroy the headquarters of the revolution at every step in bivouac and in the course of march during the anti-Japanese war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She became a shield herself to protect his safety in fierce battles in the entrance to Dashahe, Fusong county town, Hongqihe and other areas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHaving regarded it the noblest and most honorable task to defend the revolutionary idea of the President, she resolutely struggled against the renegades to revolution who were ideologically degenerated in the grim ordeals, scared by the bluff of the enemies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She set an example in implementing orders of the President, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She, together with several sewing-team members, carried out within 20 days the task of making 600 suits of uniforms for a month. The spirit displayed by her in thoroughly implementing the President's orders is kept in minds of the Korean people as a brilliant paragon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the period of building a new country, too, she became of her own accord an eternal \"bodyguard\" of the President to pay a special attention to safeguarding him and devoted herself to the efforts for carrying out his line of national building.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Suk guarded with her very life President Kim Il Sung whom the Korean people held in high esteem for the first time in the 5,000-year-long history of the nation and thus gave the people the fortune of being blessed with illustrious leaders. Indeed, her precious exploit will shine long."

They serve as eternal treasures of Songun Korea at present.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Saturday says this in a signed article.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Her life was a noble one of a bodyguard as she set a shining example in protecting the leader at the risk of her life, thus contributing to the development of the Korean revolutionary armed forces into the army of the leader and that of the supreme commander. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Devotedly defending the leader was a starting point of all her thoughts and activities and a maxim in her life and struggle. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Her spirit of defending the leader reflected her unshakable faith and will that even not a single slip should be allowed in protecting the personal safety of President Kim Il Sung and her uncompromising spirit of dealing merciless blows without any slightest concession at the practices of defiling the leader's idea and prestige and line and policies. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Her whole life was the one of a peerlessly great person during which she helped develop the Korean People's Army into an invincible army, glorifying the tradition of the revolutionary unity based on comradeship.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The comradeship displayed by her was the revolutionary philosophy centering on the leader based on her intense loyalty to the leader and the most ardent and purest mental power free from affectation and changing attitudes as is the case with arms. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Her revolutionary life was a brilliant life of a woman commander of Mt. Paektu during which she performed immortal feats for the sovereignty and independence of the country and the strengthening of the revolutionary armed forces by tightly holding arms in her hand. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Her great exploits performed in the history of army building served as a solid cornerstone whereby the Korean People's Army won one victory after another, firmly defending the party and the leader and the country and people in the rigorous years of the revolution. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Her whole life was, at the same time, the life of a prominent revolutionary as she consolidated the deep roots of Songun Korea by creating the precious tradition of unity between the army and people, a source of the invincible might of the KPA. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She gave birth to General Secretary Kim Jong Il, the lodestar over Mt. Paektu, in the period when the final victory of the great anti-Japanese war was drawing near. This marked a great auspicious event that promised a bright future of the Korean nation and a historic event which ushered in a new era of the great succession which made it possible for the Korean revolution to always win victory after victory under the banner of Songun. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By holding Kim Jong Il in high esteem as supreme commander of the revolutionary armed forces as desired by her, the KPA has grown to be a main force of the Songun revolution and a powerful revolutionary army of Mt. Paektu capable of defeating any formidable enemy in the world, concludes the article."
