The progressives who aspire after independence and love peace should unite closer in order to decisively foil the U.S. imperialists' \"anti-terrorist war\" and moves for world supremacy at present. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the truth of history that separation goes to ruin and unity triumphs in the struggle against imperialism. The world progressives should closely unite and dynamically turn out in the struggle to frustrate the imperialists' moves for aggression and war. All the progressive forces and peace-loving people of the world should closely unite in the idea of peace and jointly fight against the imperialists' intensified moves for aggression and war and make a collective counterattack everywhere tentacles of their aggression have stretched so as to bind them hand and foot to prevent them from running amuck.\r\n It is important to direct the spearhead of attack to U.S. imperialism in the present anti-imperialist struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world people who love peace and value justice should clearly see through the true colors of the U.S. imperialists, enemy of peace and culprit of war, and wage a vigorous struggle to baffle their moves for aggression and war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This unity leads to independent reunification. Independent reunification and peace against war should be achieved through a struggle for great national unity. \r\n The slogan of the movement for national reunification for this year singles out independent reunification, peace against war and great national unity as a three-point patriotic movement, thus remarkably stirring up the patriotic enthusiasm of all the fellow countrymen and encouraging them to display it to the full. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  All members of the nation should fully display their patriotic zeal in the struggle to achieve independent reunification, peace against war and great national unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when all Koreans display patriotic enthusiasm in the above-said patriotic movement under the uplifted banner of \"By our nation itself\" as called for by the slogan contained in the joint editorial, the movement for independent reunification will make a dynamic advance and a new turning point will be brought about in the cause of reunification this year, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
