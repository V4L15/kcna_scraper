            "content": "All-out Actions for Withdrawal of U.S. Forces Called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 7 (KCNA) -- The Solidarity for Implementing the South-North Joint Declaration was reported to have released on May 23 an article titled \"Let us all turn out in the actions to drive the U.S. forces out of south Korea by the concerted efforts of the Koreans with firm faith in sure victory.\"\r\n The article said: More than 100 days have passed since the north declared its access to nukes. However, the White House is doing nothing, just running about like a headless chicken. What Bush has done is nothing but making absurd call for north Korea's return to the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"myth about the U.S. being a superpower\" has been smashed to smithereens in the era of Bush II. He will be recorded as the president from the Republican Party second to Eisenhower in signing a document of surrender with the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The victory of the Koreans is certain and any illusion about imperialism leads to national ruin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n February 10 when the north's access to nukes was declared and June 15 when the north-south joint declaration was adopted can be likened to the chariots of victors. The U.S. is completely upset by the north's tremendous political and military might and great national unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The prevailing situation proves it is not the Korean Peninsula but the U.S. that is in the grip of a crisis and the peninsula does not find itself in a war crisis but the U.S. is driven into an abyss of ruin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Victory of the Korean nation is certain but it does not come of itself. Any illusion about imperialism would lead to national ruin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to firmly maintain the anti-imperialist stand both at the phase of dialogue or the phase of confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Calling upon all the Koreans to direct all efforts to the movement to drive the U.S. troops out of south Korea and open up a landmark phase in this struggle this year, the article stressed that when the south Korean people's pressure for the U.S. troops pullout goes beyond control, the U.S. will be left with no option but to pull its troops back from south Korea without any excuse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article underlined the need to direct all efforts to the struggle for the pullback of the U.S. troops from south Korea and conduct an anti-war peace campaign in close combination with the movement for the withdrawal of the U.S. forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also called for developing all forms of anti-U.S. struggle tasks into a drive for their withdrawal.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Nuclear Threat to DPRK Must Be Removed First: Rodong Sinmun \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 7 (KCNA) -- The United States is now making a mockery of the international community, letting loose a string of balderdash that the DPRK's abandonment of its nuclear program is immediately the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and it would get rid of international isolation and gain economic benefits, if it returns to the six-party talks and drops its nuclear program.\r\n A Rodong Sinmun analyst Tuesday says that this cannot be construed otherwise than a sinister attempt to worsen the situation by confusing the nature of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and the way of its solution. If the whole of the peninsula is to be nuclear-free, the nuclear threat of the U.S. must be removed before anything else and confidence be built between the DPRK and the countries concerned, the analyst notes, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To this end, the United States should, first of all, give up its hostile policy to bring down the system in the DPRK through a nuclear war and withdraw all its nuclear weapons from south Korea. The withdrawal of the U.S. nuclear weapons must be confirmed, under all circumstances, through verification. Any nuclear pullout without it is meaningless. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear weapons possessed by the DPRK are deterrent to defend the sovereignty and security of the country from the U.S. preemptive nuclear attack. They will automatically become unnecessary, if the nuclear threat of the U.S. fundamentally disappears from the peninsula. The six-party talks should be a place seeking a package mode for fairly realizing the denuclearization of the peninsula on this principle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. claim that if the DPRK came to the six-party talks and showed its will to drop its nuclear program and fulfilled this, it would get a lot of benefits is a wrong logic denying the nature of the six-party talks and the basic way of solving the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The days are gone when the give-and-take way of solution was discussed at the six-party talks. Now that the DPRK has access to the nuclear weapons, the talks should become a place of disarmament talks for the participating countries to settle the issue on equal stand and status. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should have a correct understanding of the six-party talks and not try to use the venue of the talks as a leverage to attain its sinister aim by putting the DPRK in the dock as a \"nuclear criminal.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should correct the wrong view of the nature of the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and its peace and security and do what it should do, such as renunciation of its design to topple the system of the DPRK and withdrawal of its nuclear threat to the latter.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

These belligerent remarks hint at a military attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on this, foreign press reports said that the remarks can be interpreted as a call for \"regime changes\" in the DPRK and some other countries which the U.S. hawkish forces designated as \"outposts of tyranny\" in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This clearly indicates that the U.S. attempt to realize a \"regime change\" in the DPRK still remains unchanged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the fixed way of thinking and stand of the U.S. to topple the system in the DPRK by force. It attaches more importance to war than to dialogue and considers dialogue as leverage for getting time to execute a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. loudmouthed negotiated settlement of the nuclear issue is nothing but a smokescreen for concealing its strategy to stifle the DPRK by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a serious attention is that such outbursts are timed to coincide with the U.S. moves to escalate tension on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. reckless new war scenarios such as \"CONPLAN 8022-02\" have already been drafted for mounting a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK any moment and its  \"arms buildup plan\" calling for spending 13 billion U.S. dollars is being pushed ahead at its final stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many Stealth fighter bombers for nuclear attacks have been introduced into south Korea, missiles capable of penetrating underground have already been deployed and preparations for the creation of a \"rapid task force\", detached corps for a \"regime change,\" is making brisk headway. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality goes to prove that the U.S. military plan to realize a \"regime change\" in the DPRK is being put into practice and that it is opting for confrontation and war, not dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a wild dream for the U.S. to try to bring down the inviolable system in the DPRK.\r\n The system in the DPRK is a man-centered socialist system which the Koreans value as their life and soul as it was chosen by themselves and built by their own efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. reckless moves aimed at a \"regime change\" in the DPRK only harden the determination of its servicepersons and people to steadfastly keep to the road of socialism.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And it is a militarist folly of fostering the atmosphere of confrontation in Asia and whipping up reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The Japanese reactionaries are trying to describe the crime of aggression committed by the Japanese imperialists in the past as \"a peace-oriented act\" by paying visits to the shrine. Lurking behind this is their sinister intention to evade the settlement of their past. But things will never go as they wish. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' improper approach to Japan's history of aggression and continued visits to the Yasukuni Shrine have touched off wrath at Japan among the Asian people who hold bitter grudges against the Japanese imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their demand for apology and compensation from Japan for its past crimes is not merely to make Japan kneel down and beg for forgiveness but to see that it sincerely feels responsibility for its past crimes through the redemption of its past and does not follow the past footsteps. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries should ponder over this, stop visiting the shrine and distorting history and make a bold political decision to settle the past.

What is most important in economic affairs is to do farming well and solve the food problem. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are now all out in the farming, putting aside every other affair, in hearty response to the call of the WPK. In this course they are strikingly demonstrating the might of the single-minded unity of the Party, the army and people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Concentrating all efforts on the farming helps reinforce the political and ideological, material and technological foundations in the rural areas. The revolutionary step taken by the Party to focus all efforts on the farming this year provides an important occasion of accelerating the socialist rural construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The increased assistance of the whole Party and the whole state to the farming helps raise the farmers' political and ideological level and their enthusiasm to boost the agricultural production and encourages the officials and other working people in the agricultural field to do better the farm work. This, at the same time, helps them fully meet the requirements of  the farming method of Juche in all the processes of farming. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The successful implementation of the above-said policy has opened up a bright prospect of winding up the farm work at a lightning speed in the right season. The reality has firmly convinced all the agricultural working people and other people of the fact that the step taken by the Party is the most revolutionary one.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
