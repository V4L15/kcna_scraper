            "content": "KCNA Urges U.S. to Accept DPRK's Proposal \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 21 (KCNA) -- As already reported, there was a meeting of the working group of the six-party talks for the settlement of the DPRK-U.S.nuclear issue in Beijing from May 12 to 14.\r\n At the meeting, the DPRK side put forward the reward for freeze proposal as the first phase action to attain the general goal to denuclearize the Korean peninsula and maintained a sincere stance to solve the issue at all costs.  It proposed to have an in-depth discussion on the specific and practical issues related to the nuclear freeze including the objects to be frozen, the duration of freeze and the method to verify it andthe time to freeze facilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This proposal includes the core issues that should be implemented at the first phase for the solution of the DPRK-U.S. nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. side, however, again insisted that the DPRK abandon its \"nuclear program\" first, i.e. CVID and argued it would not discuss the \"reward for freeze\" proposal or other offer unless the latter accepts the former's demand. This attitude brought the discussion to a failure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the U.S. assertion was rebuffed at the meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Powell talked rubbish that the U.S. would put increased international pressure upon north Korea to disarm itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This only glaringly revealed the fact that the U.S.-loudmouthed peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue was nothing but a sheer lie and a trick and it is only keen on disarming the DPRK behind the curtain of dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The increasing U.S. nuclear threat to the DPRK, not a defeated nation, compelled it to build a nuclear deterrent for self-defence. For the U.S. to force the DPRK to dismantle its \"nuclear program\" first is, therefore, little short of a brigandish demand for laying down arms and unconditionally submitting to it and scrapping all its nuclear plans for a peaceful purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe DPRK-U.S. nuclear issue was caused by the United States and has become complicated in the historic process. Its solution is, therefore, possible only when the U.S. will drop its hostile policy toward the DPRK and accepts the latter's offer for reward for freeze the first-phase action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. unchanged arrogant assertion once again convinced the DPRK that the Bush administration has no will to peacefully coexist with the DPRK but only pursues a sinister aim to completely disarm it and swallow it up as was the case with Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The same can be said of \"north Korea's enriched uranium program\" the U.S. raised again at the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already clarified by the DPRK, the \"enriched uranium program\" is the product of the despicable plot hatched by the hawkish group of the Bush administration to isolate the former in the international arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What happened in Iraq clearly proved that it was the bellicose and bestial nature of the Bush administration to cook up misinformation to start and justify a war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is grossly mistaken if it calculates its spread of such lie about this program among the international community would help lay an international siege\" to the DPRK and force it to change its system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The moves taken by the Bush administration and the international situation including what is going on in Iraq go to prove that the Songun politics pursued by the DPRK serves as a treasured sword for achieving sure success in the political and military relations with other countries and the increase of the capability for self-defence including nuclear deterrent provides the best shield for protecting the sovereignty of the country and the destiny of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe DPRK will take all possible measures for self-defence, wielding high this treasured sword of Songun, unless the U.S. administration makes a substantial switchover in its hostile policy toward the DRPK with the good will to co-exist with it.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This only glaringly reveals the shameless nature of the Bush group. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No smear campaign on the part of the U.S. can ever shake Korean-style socialism centered on the popular masses under which the leader, the Party and the people are single-heartedly united. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation in Iraq where confusion, disorder, bloodshed and violence are rampant due to the U.S. aggression and wanton interference and tragic happenings in various other countries prove with added clarity that human rights precisely mean sovereignty and the loss of sovereignty leads to contempt, disgrace and humiliation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will as ever protect as the apple of the eye the inviolable Korean-style socialism, the Korean people's choice and life and soul, and never allow anyone to vilify it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
