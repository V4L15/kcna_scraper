He set forth the tasks to be fulfilled by the unit to boost its combat capability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the primary revolutionary task for the servicepersons under arms to train well, he said, stressing the need to focus all efforts on intensifying the training. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He made the rounds of the servicepersons' hall, a library and other entertainment and educational facilities to acquaint himself in detail with how the political work is conducted among its servicepersons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He praised the unit for having successfully built the centers for cultural education and conducted the political and ideological work in a unique manner in diverse forms and ways to train the servicepersons into heroes of the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Watching the information about the noble comradeship displayed by the officers and soldiers of the unit, he said that the ranks united close on the basis of the comradeship are sure to triumph. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Walking round the compound of the barracks clad in thick verdure, he learned about how the unit has created a thick woodland and greenery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He highly appreciated the feats performed by the servicepersons of the unit, greatly pleased to learn that they have successfully turned the compound of the barracks and its surroundings into a thick woodland and greenery in firm unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the people in the society have turned out as one in the afforestation with ardent enthusiasm, following the example set by the army, he stressed the need for the army and people to pool their efforts to make the mountains of the country thicker with green foliage and build a beautiful land of bliss good to live in. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then he took deep care of the service and living of its servicepersons, going round an education room, bedroom, mess hall, wash-cum-bath house, non-staple food store and other places. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He appreciated the assiduous and tenacious way the unit has managed its economic life, pleased to know that the unit has built supply service facilities convenient to its servicepersons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He gave the servicepersons of the unit a pair of binoculars, a machinegun and an automatic rifle as gifts before having a photo session with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by KPA Generals Hyon Chol Hae and Kim Myong Guk.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Timed to coincide with these moves, it is committing ceaseless provocations. The Korean People's Army is following the U.S. forces side's military movements with heightened vigilance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. forces side, while acknowledging the gravity of the cases raised by the DPRK side, informed it that it would conduct Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military exercises from August 18 to 22, contrary to the nature of the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The DPRK side strongly urged the U.S. forces side to cancel the exercises at once, denouncing such action as a criminal act as it will escalate the tension on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He urged the U.S. forces side to face up to the present reality and behave with discretion, declaring that the KPA would never pardon anyone infringing upon the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK even a bit.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a typical example of those moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK resolutely dismisses this as a despicable act to scuttle the denuclearization process on the Korean Peninsula in the end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is that the U.S. conservative hard-liners have seriously misinterpreted the DPRK's willingness and efforts for denuclearization in order to serve their interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's disablement of its nuclear facilities has been done more than 80 % as of now and it fulfilled the agreed point calling for submitting an accurate and complete nuclear declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK blew up the cooling tower at the pilot atomic power plant as a measure taken out of good faith, demonstrating once again its will for denuclearization at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This notwithstanding, the conservative hard-liners painted the DPRK as \"a country good at deceptive artifice,\" claiming that \"north Korea is capable of possessing highly-enriched uranium technology without a cooling tower\". This proves to what extent their hostile policy toward the DPRK has reached. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle of \"action for action\" is the key to realizing the denuclearization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is obliged to join the DPRK in its efforts for the process by honoring its commitments with good faith. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will make a relevant decision depending on the U.S. future actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. conservative hard-liners had better clearly understand that they will be held fully accountable for all the ensuing consequences should they persistently bar the progress of the talks.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They perpetrated such outrage as walking off the vice-chairman of the Health and Medical Workers' Union of south Korea for the mere reason that he protested against their outrage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said unjust action taken by the Japanese authorities was obviously politically motivated suppression, the statement held, adding that this incident compels the KCTU to cast serious skepticism about human rights and democracy in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KCTU will boost solidarity and cooperation with the trade unions and civic and public organizations in Japan and the international labor movement organizations in order to intensify the struggle against the neo-liberalist \"globalization\", declared the statement.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Kim Jong Il dirige sector agricola de provincia de Phyong-an del Norte\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, 10 de julio (ATCC) -- El Dirigente Kim Jong Il, Secretario General del Partido del Trabajo de Corea y Presidente del Comite de Defensa Nacional de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea, dirigio sobre el terreno las labores del dominio agricola de la provincia de Phyong-an del Norte. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El Dirigente recorrio la Granja Cooperativa de Unhung del distrito de Thaechon donde esta extendida la llanura Handure, uno de los nueve paisajes famosos del Songun (priorizacion militar). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Divisando las comodas casas nuevamente construidas en hileras al pie del monte, el frondoso bosque de arboles frutales acondicionado detras de la aldea y el campo fertil con iguales parcelas estandarizadas, se mostro muy satisfecho de la transformacion de modo irreconocible de la aldea en menos de 10 anos destacando que no puede encontrar ni un solo rastro de los arrozales diminutos de distintos tamanos y de las casas campesinas ubicadas desordenadamente en medio del campo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Evaluo altamente a los funcionarios y trabajadores de la granja y les envio un cordial saludo calificando de exito verdaderamente admirable el que ellos realizaron con sus propias fuerzas esa inmensa obra, que convirtio la aldea en un paraiso de la epoca del Partido del Trabajo y lugar pintoresco del socialismo, sobrecumpliendo cada ano el plan de produccion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Tras enterarse de los detalles de las labores de cultivo agricola de este ano, senalo que la Granja Cooperativa de Unhung debe ser modelo nacional en la produccion de cereales ateniendose estrictamente al metodo de cultivo agricola del Juche y presento las tareas y remedios para este fin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Sostuvo cordiales conversaciones en una parcela con la granjera Om Jong Sil. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Luego de cerciorarse detalladamente del trabajo y la vida de Om, dijo que es un acto muy adorable el que ella dedica todas sus fuerzas espirituales y fisicas a la produccion agricola desde que se asento en el campo voluntariamente y evaluo altamente la conducta patriotica de ella y sus padres quienes apoyaron activamente la decision de su hija. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Cuando los jovenes de otros paises andan obsesionados por conseguir la ciudadania capitalina, la juventud coreana se traslada voluntariamente al campo, las minas carboniferas y los lugares de explotacion abandonando sin vacilacion la entranable capital, comparo y continuo que esto es precisamente el verdadero aspecto de nuestros jovenes infinitamente fieles al partido y la revolucion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Acto seguido, el Dirigente estuvo en la Granja Porcina de Phyongbuk nuevamente construida en la provincia de Phyong-an del Norte. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Tras escuchar explicaciones ante el plano de la granja, recorrio el exterior y el interior de ella enterandose detalladamente del estado de construccion y administracion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Muy satisfecho de que esa provincia construyo excelentemente por cuenta propia esta moderna base ganadera de gran capacidad, evaluo altamente los meritos de los constructores y presento las tareas que se presentan ante la granja. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  A continuacion, el Dirigente se dirigio al Centro de Reproduccion de Conejos Juventud de Thaechon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Al recorrer los conejales reconstruidos y otros lugares del centro, averiguo detalladamente el estado de produccion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Dijo que este centro es la granja significativa que fue construida en los dias de la enconada guerra coreana por la iniciativa del Presidente Kim Il Sung para mejorar la vida alimentaria de los habitantes de la provincia y apunto que es preciso elevar incesantemente la produccion de las crias de conejo para glorificar mas las hazanas directivas del Presidente guardando siempre en lo profundo del corazon la infinita benevolencia de el. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Lo mas importante en la cria de conejos es establecer el sistema de cria y suministro de las razas superiores, tomar las medidas para asegurar el pienso y el sistema de prevencion veterinaria y solucionar satisfactoriamente los problemas cientifico-tecnicos, apunto e indico las tareas y los remedios para el particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El mismo dia, el Dirigente hizo conocimiento de la creacion de areas boscosas que se desarrolla animadamente en la provincia de Phyong-an del Norte. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Subrayo que en todas partes de esta provincia como las fabricas y aldeas rurales se pueden ver los proyectos de areas boscosas planeadas y todas las unidades y todas las personas trabajan con gran entusiasmo para llevarlos a efecto. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Enfatizo que este hecho basta para conocer bien la actitud y la posicion de los funcionarios y trabajadores de esta provincia de materializar consecuentemente la politica del partido. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Si todos aceptan con sensibilidad la linea y la politica del partido y se empenan por su materializacion al igual que los habitantes de la provincia Phyong-an del Norte, nuestro territorio patrio se convertira en un futuro no lejano en un paraiso del pueblo mas hermoso y acomodado con montes y llanuras verdes, senalo y subrayo la necesidad de aprender el espiritu y el estilo de lucha de ellos. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Es muy bueno el impetu de los habitantes de esta provincia para abrir primero la puerta que de acceso a la gran potencia prospera, senalo y expreso la conviccion de que la provincia de Phyong-an del  Norte cumplira el papel de vanguardia tambien en la produccion agricola. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El Dirigente fue acompanado por Kim Phyong Hae, secretario responsable del Comite del PTC en la Provincia de Phyong-an del Norte.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
