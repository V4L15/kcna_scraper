            "content": "Memorandum of the DPRK Government exposing arms buildup of U.S. and s. Korea \r\n  Pyongyang, September 13 (KCNA) -- The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on September 12 published a memorandum denouncing the large-scale arms buildup stepped up by the south Korean authorities under the U.S. patronage.\r\n   While clamouring about a \"new cold war around the Korean Peninsula\", the south Korean authorities have sharply increased military budget every year, the document says, and goes on:\r\n   The military spending of south Korea went up to 17,940 million U.S. dollars this year from 11,380 million U.S. dollars in 1992. This is an increase of 58 percent in a matter of five years.\r\n   The rate of increase of south Korea's military budget reached the mark of 49.2 percent in the period from 1992 to 1996. The figure is more than twice the amount of military expenditure increased by the countries in strife-torn areas in the corresponding period.\r\n   According to the \"report on world military expenditure and arms sales for 1993 and 1994\" published by the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in the beginning of 1995, the military spending of south Korea was the tenth in the world in 1993.   \r\n   The amount of money alloted for the purchase of military equipment holds a big share in the military budget of south Korea.\r\n   The amount of money south Korea squandered on purchase of military equipment rose to 4,974 million U.S. dollars in 1997 from 3,521 million U.S. dollars in 1992, or 41 percent increase.\r\n   The Kim Young Sam regime allocated a total of 21,384 million U.S. dollars for the introduction of military equipment from 1993 to 1997. The figure amounts to the money appropriated by his preceding rulers for the same purpose for ten years.\r\n   With a view to introducing more military equipment, the south Korean authorities announced a \"mid-term defence programme\" for 1998-2002 in December last year, and are now trying to appropriate 35,288 million U.S. dollars for military spending, up 65 percent as compared with the amount of money spent in the period from 1993 to 1997.    \r\n   The south Korean authorities are now  hell-bent on large-scale introduction of combat equipment to invade the northern half of Korea.\r\n   In particular, they are running amok to introduce the latest-type equipment for the navy and air force for preemptive surprise attack on the depth and strategic vantages in the northern half of Korea.\r\n   From 1991 to the end of last year they deployed for a real war six 1,200-ton class submarines and introduced eight P-3C sea-patrol planes and 78 Harpoon surface-to-surface missiles.    \r\n   They plan to introduce Barak missiles for the navy, the weapon that can be based on large and small warships, and two aegis destroyers  and submarines and amphibious ships of the latest type. \r\n   From 1994 to this year the south Korean authorities introduced 48 F-16 fighter planes and 200 Amraam air-to-air missiles and 136 agm-88b air-to-ground missiles into south Korea, and decided to introduce 72 F-16 fighter planes and some 100 Harpy unmanned attack planes and import 4 mid-air refuelling planes,  till 1999. \r\n   And they made public a plan to introduce in the near future more than 60 F-15 fighter planes and 10 Hawk-800 XP reconnaissance planes equipped with the latest-type electronic facilities. \r\n   The south Korean authorities put spurs on the introduction of military equipment in order to increase the attack capacity of the ground force.\r\n   In the last two years they introduced 275 M 48A-5 tanks, 30 T-80U tanks, 70 bmp-3 armoured combat vehicles, 100 Igla anti-aircraft missiles and 150 metis-m anti-tank missile units, and they announced that in the near future they would ship into south Korea multiple launch rocket systems (29 launchers and 279 rocket shells) and 110 sophisticated atacms ground-to-ground missiles.    \r\n  The U.S. is still pursuing the policy to stifle the DPRK by force of arms, while talking about \"peace-keeping\" and \"four-way talks.\" \r\n   The U.S. worked out an adventurous plan for aggression, and is reinforcing its troops present in south Korea and encouraging the south Korean authorities to round off war preparations.\r\n   Above all, the U.S. completed a war plan against the DPRK by adjusting and supplementing the original plan.\r\n   It put forward a \"south Korea-U.S. new operation plan 5027\" in 1993 through adjustment and supplement of the plan worked out in the 1980s. In 1995, under the operation plan, the U.S. provided the \"quick deployment forces\" to be sent to the Korean Peninsula from the U.S. mainland with two aircraft carriers, some 1,000 warplanes, expedition forces of marines in the pacific region, Patriot missiles and AWACS planes, instead of 1 aircraft carrier, 1 flying corps and 2 brigades of marines, and set up a new double-track transport system for direct transportation of forces and war materiel.\r\n   The U.S. amended the \"U.S.-Japan Defence Cooperation Guidelines\" so as to inveigle Japan into a Korean war. \r\n   It also is taking steps to identify the military map coordinates system of the \"ROK\" Army  (bessel system) with Wgs-84 of the U.S. and the European union and further strengthen the \"south Korea-U.S. joint operation system\".    \r\n   The United States is actively encouraging south Korea to introduce a lot of U.S.-made weapons.\r\n   Among the military equipment the U.S. has already delivered to south Korea and is going to do so are atacms ground-to-ground missiles, patriot and stinger ground-to-air missiles and other missiles of various kinds, tanks, armoured vehicles, various kinds of heavy guns, F-15 fighter planes, AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, AWACS planes, the latest-type spy planes, mid-air refuelling planes, Amraam, Side Winder, Sparrow air-to-air missiles,  Harm and Maverick air-to-ground missiles, aegis destroyers, Harpoon surface-to-surface missiles and sea sparrow ship-to-air missiles.\r\n   While crying for the introduction of diversified military equipment, the south Korean authorities are now shipping Modern tanks, armoured vehicles, anti-aircraft missiles, anti-tank missiles and helicopters from Russia as well as the U.S., and Harpy unmanned attack planes from Israel and huge military equipment from many countries around the world.\r\n   The U.S. is reinforcing its troops present in south Korea with the latest-type combat equipment.\r\n   From 1990 to 1995 the U.S. replaced the military equipment of its troops present in south Korea with the latest-type equipment used in the Gulf War, and last year set up a helicopter attack brigade with 30 more AH-64 Apache helicopters and introduced the equipment for one brigade including M1 A1 tanks and armoured vehicles, more than 10,000 items in all, and stockpiled some 700,000 tons of bullets for war materials in reserve. \r\n   And it shipped into south Korea from Japan in February this year the depleted uranium bullets. The nuclear weapon that was used in the gulf war has a harmful effect on the health of the people.    \r\n   While arguing that \"four-way talks\" are needed for peace on the Korean Peninsula, the United States is continuously reinforcing combat equipment in south Korea and staging large-scale military maneuvers with south Korea all the year round, aggravating the situation on this peninsula. This is patent proof of the double-dealing tactics of the U.S. policy toward the DPRK.\r\n   If war is to be averted and peace preserved on the Korean Peninsula, the United States must refrain from encouraging the arms buildup of south Korea and aggravating the tensions and withdraw its troops from south Korea.  \r\n\r\n"

This is to carry out the operation for new war of aggression on Korea.\r\n   Their call for \"coping with military movements\" of the DPRK is aimed at unleashing war in Korea on the pretext of \"threat of attack\" from the DPRK.\r\n   If they unleash war against the DPRK, we will mete out a merciless punishment to them. \r\n   With utmost patience and magnanimity, we are seeking to terminate the military confrontation and hostile relations with the U.S., But we will not show pardon and mercy to the provokers of war.\r\n   The U.S. warmongers had better give up the suicidal gamble of war and choose to conclude a peace agreement between the the DPRK and the U.S.    \r\n\r\n"
