In this connection Rodong Sinmun today carries a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At the time the DPRK delegation was about to board the already booked American airliner in Frankfurt airport, those who style themselves U.S. air security agents showed up there and made such a rude act as saying that they should inspect as a special case the members of the delegation including the president of the presidium of the DPRK Supreme People's Assembly and their hand luggages and claiming this was instructed by their government as the DPRK is a \"rogue state\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This arrogant and brigandish act of the United States is a grave encroachment upon the sovereignty of an independent state, an unbearable insult to human rights and an open challenge to the united nations and the UN millennium summit organized by it, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The recent incident sparked under the scenario of the U.S. administration clearly proves that the United States is, indeed, the world's largest rogue state, a country of international gangsters who think nothing of the international law and international norm and a state of hooligans ignorant of elementary etiquette and morality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It also goes to prove that the United States is proposing a series of talks with the DPRK for the present, vociferating about \"improved relations\" with it, but it has an axe to grind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The base act on the part of the United States is intended to prevent the situation at home and abroad from turning in favour of the DPRK, observes the commmentary.  Laying bare the dark intention of the U.S., the commentary notes: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. was very afraid that the criminal moves it has pushed ahead to establish the \"missile defense\" system under the absurd pretext of coping with \"missile threat from North Korea\" might be laid bare by the DPRK delegation on the UN forum.\r\n   The U.S. obstruction to the DPRK delegation's participation in the UN millennium summit was a product of the sinister trick to bar the message from Korea of Juche opposing the high-handed practices of the \"only superpower\"  and calling for an independent new world from being heard in the conference hall. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   One's evil doing will rebound on oneself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States will have to pay a dear price for debasing the sovereignty and dignity of Korea of Juche that values independence more than life.    \r\n\r\n"

Paektu called by the Korean people a holy mountain of the revolution, a five-pointed star and its rays.  These are symbolic of the brilliant revolutionary traditions of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle inherited by the government of the DPRK and a rosy future of the Korean people vigorously advancing towards the reunification and independence of the country and the victory of socialism and communism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A hydro power station with ears of rice on the emblem reflects the might of the country's industry and agriculture, prospects of their development and the will of the Korean people to build socialism and communism and self-supporting national economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The oval frame of the emblem bounded by a red ribbon bearing the inscription \"the Democratic People's Republic of Korea\" shows the unbreakable unity and cohesion of the Korean people firmly rallied around the party and the leader, prosperity and bright future of the fatherland. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The national emblem of the DPRK signifies that it is a popular state providing the working masses with genuine political freedom and rights and happy material and cultural life. It, therefore, imbues the Korean people with honour and pride of being citizens of the DPRK and ardent patriotism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Greeting the National Day (September 9), the Korean people look back with deep emotion upon the proud history of over 50 years they have covered with the national emblem and renew their determination to contribute to the building of a powerful nation.    \r\n\r\n"

It marked the beginning of the history of working people's power of a new Juche type, the building of people-centered state in the political history of humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK is enjoying its golden days and demonstrating the dignity and might of socialist Korea to the world under the experienced and tested leadership of Kim Jong Il, a creditable successor to Kim Il Sung's cause of Juche-oriented state building. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Jong Il successfully carried out the cause of perpetuating the memory of President Kim Il Sung with his outstanding leadership art. as a result, he is held in high esteem as the eternal leader of the DPRK and his revolutionary idea serves as an enduring guiding idea of Juche Korea and steady continuity is thus provided to the history of the DPRK to shine as the history of the president. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The reporter called for strengthening and developing the DPRK into a powerful nation whose power has reached its highest level in all the political, military and economic fields by holding fast to Kim Jong Il's army-first revolutionary line as an eternal strategic line of the Korean revolution and thoroughly implementing it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Referring to the facts that the historic Pyongyang meeting and the north-south summit were held in June, the north-south joint declaration was adopted and over 60 unconverted long-term prisoners in South Korea came back to the fatherland, he said that all this stirred up the whole country and the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The path of the Korean nation's struggle for the reunification of the country is not smooth. But Korea's reunification is certain to be achieved thanks to the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il, the great programme for national reunification provided to the Korean nation and the single-hearted unity of the Korean nation fully determined to remain loyal to him forever, he added.    \r\n\r\n"
