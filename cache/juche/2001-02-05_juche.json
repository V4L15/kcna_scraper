One of them is Choesung Pavilion which stands on the highest peak of moran hill. It came to be called Choesung Pavilion in the sense that it is an excellent place commanding a panoramic view.\r\n It was first built in Koguryo dynasty (277 bc-ad 668) and rebuilt in 1716 during Ri dynasty (1392-1910). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is of cosy attic style, the front 7.36 m long and the flank 4.67 m wide, on the embankment erected by well-trimmed granite. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The perimeter of the embankment is piled up with granite. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Down below the pavilion it looks higher and more magnificent and up in the building it feels far stable and comfortable although at height. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The floor is covered with square granite plates to make it clean and elaborate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pillars painted with red colour and wooden framework coloured with traditional patterns add a special touch of beauty to the building. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The hip-saddle roof like a crane taking flight also adds the cheerful effect on the building. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though it has suffered the action of time, it still testifies to the resoucerfulness and talents of the Korean people.    \r\n\r\n"

Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il reviewed the 20th century which saw the Korean revolutionaries register great victories and changes united close around Kim Il Sung with one faith and will as a history of comradeship and formulated the comradeship as a scientific programme for the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that our comradeship means comradeship of Kim Jong Il, the essay notes that his dedication to comrades is his greatest joy and happiness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that \"song of comradeship\" is his most favourite song, the essay says.    That he always sings the song as his all-time favourite during his inspection of the front and on-site guidance and in good or bad times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The essay cites the historic victory in the \"arduous march,\" a provision of a springboard from which to build a powerful nation and a vigorous advance of the army-first revolution as a great fruition of comradeship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n it further says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The banner of comradeship reflects Kim Jong Il's unique view on the revolution to build a new world by virtue of love and trust. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Comradeship alone leads to the protection of our own dignity, justice and prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nothing is fearful and impossible for us if we are under the steermanship of Kim Jong Il though the road ahead of us is thorny. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the requirement of the Korean revolution for glorifying the 21st century and a banner of life and struggle of the revolutionaries in our times.    \r\n\r\n"
