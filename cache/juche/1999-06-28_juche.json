He was accompanied by Ri Yong Mu, vice-chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission, and general officers of the Korean People's Army.   Ri Yong Chol and Jang Song Thaek, first vice department directors of the WPK Central Committee, were also among the visiting group.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Jong Il first went to the Phunghwa Cooperative Farm.   Acquainting himself with the farming process of the farm, he said the President Kim Il Sung would have been very happy to see this remarkable reality of today.   He expressed great satisfaction at the good crops in the paddy fields newly rezoned by concerted efforts of the army and the people.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said that weeding, management of water in paddy fields, application of fertilizers and all other farming processes should be done in good quality.   He said that all the farmers should take strict measures to prevent wind and flood damage and crop damage by blight and insects.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He went to the Chonsam Cooperative Farm.\r\n   Going round the monument to the on-the-spot guidance of President Kim Il Sung erected at the entrance to the village, he said that the president's immortal feats will shine long in the annals of the country.  He, acquainting himself with the farming process of the farm, said that diversified farming should continue to develop.\r\n   The already-built cultural and welfare facilities should be kept well and improved so as to suit the socialist character, he stated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He said that farming should be done on a scientific and technological basis and organic fertilizers of different kinds of good quality needed for crops be applied sufficiently.   He stated that the scientists and technicians of the agricultural domain should make active research into technologies and farming methods suited to climatic and topographical characters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The persimmon output, he noted, should be increased and fish be supplied to the farmers through extensive fish culture.   He said that as agriculture is the most important front in solving the food, clothing and housing problems of the people, the whole country and all the people should concentrate all efforts on the farming to bring about a bumper harvest this year without fail. \r\n\r\n"

Korean authorities hit for abusing songs\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 28 (KCNA) -- The propaganda department of the central committee of the National Democratic Front of South Korea (NDFSK) issued a statement on June 21 in connection with the fact that songs created by Korean poets and composers and sung among people in the past are being publicized as done by others in South Korea owing to the moves of the successive rulers to obliterate the national culture, Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation reported.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Recalling that more than 1,000 popular songs created by writers, composers and singers in the north have been distorted and abused by others in South Korea, the statement said:   This is attributable to the successive South Korean authorities' anti-national policy hostile toward the north and their moves to obliterate the national culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such misuse of the popular songs created in the past years that should be handed down to posterity is indeed a treacherous act unprecedented in history.\r\n   The South Korean authorities should properly use the names of authors of the songs that are being abused by others, deeply repent of the crimes they have committed so far and make an apology for them and compensate those concerned and their families. \r\n\r\n"

The recent clash did not lead to an all-out war entirely thanks to the patience and self-restraint exercised by us who love peace.\r\n   The U.S. is well advised to immediately stop instigating the South Korean authorities to provoke a war, keenly aware that there is a limit to our patience.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The commentary demands Japan stop dancing to the U.S. tune blindly and the South Korean authorities  discontinue their rash acts intended to sacrifice the country and the nation to meet their masters' dirty ambitions. \r\n\r\n"
