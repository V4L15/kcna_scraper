The Japanese chief executive is working overtly and covertly to make public a new statement distorting and embellishing the crimes related to the sexual slavery and its past history of aggression. During his junket to the U.S. he described the victims of the sexual slavery as \"victims of flesh traffic\" and claimed that the sexual slavery was the result of flesh traffic.

Esto es la expresion de su malsano intento de debilitar en la nueva declaracion la gravedad de los crimenes del pasado de su pais. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, Japon debe tener presente que la posicion de esclarecer la verdad de la historia es mas fuerte que su intento de tergiversar y embellecer la historia criminal. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA citar un ejemplo, en el periodo de su gira por EE.UU., se desarrollo en el territorio estadounidense una manifestacion de las masas demandando a Japon pedir perdon por su historia criminal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHasta en el interior del pais isla estan muchas personas conscientes como Takashi Uemura que exigen esclarecer y mantener la verdad de la historia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapon debe darse clara cuenta de que su intento de ocultar los crimenes del pasado le llevara al aislamiento y al arruinamiento."

            "content": "ACNC denuncia intento de Japon de registrar escenas de crimen como patrimonios culturales mundiales\r\nPyongyang, 22 de mayo (ACNC) -- Japon actua con astucia para registrar como patrimonios culturales mundiales de la Organizacion de las Naciones Unidas para la Educacion, la Ciencia y la Cultura (UNESCO) las escenas de crimenes cometidos en el siglo pasado por los imperialistas japoneses contra el pueblo coreano y los demas del mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\tTrazo un documento necesario disfrazandolas de \"objetos industriales que contribuyeron a la modernizacion de Japon\" e intenta someterlo a la consideracion final en la 39a reunion del Comite de Patrimonios Mundiales de la UNESCO.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto es el intolerable y grosero crimen antietico tendente a justificar la ocupacion militar de Corea de mas de 40 anos por el imperialismo japones. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos lugares que Japon trata de registrar como patrimonios culturales mundiales son testigos historicos sobre las desgracias y sufrimientos del pueblo coreano causados por la dominacion colonial del imperialismo japones. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSolo en el astillero de Mitsubishi, casi 7 mil adolescentes coreanos sufrieron los inimaginables trabajos de esclavitud, mientras en la mina carbonifera de Hashima sobrevivio solo un hombre coreano en el momento de abandono de la mina.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl astillero de Mitsubishi, la mina carbonifera de Hashima y otros lugares se engordaron y lograron la rehabilitacion economica por la sangre y sudor de los coreanos y los demas asiaticos secuestrados forzosamente. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRegistrar como patrimonios culturales mundiales tales lugares, testigos de las atrocidades del imperialismo japones es un acto cinico, gangsteril y antietico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapon es el unico pais que no liquida todavia sus tremendos crimenes cometidos al pueblo coreano. Sin embargo, intenta embellecer los campos de trabajos forzosos y escenas de homicidio donde esta impregnada la sangre de incontables  personas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInsatisfecho con la negacion y tergiversacion de la historia criminal, Japon presenta sin escrupulos ante el mundo y la civilizacion moderna las escenas de homicidio como \"patrimonios culturales que contribuyeron al resurgimiento industrial de Japon\". Esto es el verdadero aspecto de Japon, enano politico e idiota moral. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa historia de agresion no se cambia ni se justifica con nada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl vil proceder de Japon provoca gran rechazo de todo el mundo y contraviene a la meta y el espiritu del registro de patrimonios culturales mundiales.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo puede tolerarse jamas tales actos de las autoridades japonesas tendentes a introducir a los turistas en los lugares donde todavia vagabundea el espiritu de los antepasados coreanos muertos con rencor registrandolos como \"patrimonios\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl acto descarado de Japon sera denunciado y rechazado por parte del el pueblo coreano y los demas asiaticos."
