Nearly 600,000 tons of bombs and napham bombs and more than 600,000 rocket and biological and chemical bombs dropped by the U.S. troops reduced mountains, cities and thousands of villages of Korea to ruins, which put Hitler's atrocities into shade. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Monstrous crimes committed by the U.S. forces in south Korea after the war, lording it over, makes even animals blush with shame. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Judgment on the U.S. crimes passed at international tribunals in New York, Pyongyang, and Lima was just one reflecting world voice, the statement said, urging the U.S. to lend an ear to the judgment of the international tribunals and accept it unconditionally. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement noted that no statute of limitations can be applied to the U.S. crimes committed in Korea as they were war crimes against humanity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Tribunals and various mass movements for finding out and condemning principal culprits will continue on a worldwide scale, the statement stressed.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
