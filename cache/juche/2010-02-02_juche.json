And he earnestly called upon all the fishery enterprises to effect great changes and successfully carry into practice the WPK's intention to bring about a radical turn in the people's standard of living this year marking its 65th birthday, thus making positive contributions to opening the gate to a thriving nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accompanying him were Department Director Kim Kyong Hui and First Vice Department Directors Ri Je Gang, Ri Jae Il, Jon Il Chun and Han Kwang Sang of the WPK Central Committee."
