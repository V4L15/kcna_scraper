Tambien, el asistente del secretario de Estado norteamericano expuso el dia 16 que desea que la promocion del acuerdo nuclear de Iran nos hiciera corregir nuestro criterio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl acuerdo nuclear de Iran es el exito de este pais persico logrado por sus esfuerzos de largo tiempo para recibir el reconocimiento sobre su derecho a las actividades nucleares independientes y desmantelar la sancion.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, la realidad de la RPDC es completamente distinta del caso de Iran.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC es el pais poseedor de armas nucleares, que tiene el interes como pais nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo tiene interes nunca en el dialogo para discutir sobre la  congelacion o renuncia unilaterales de armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl disuasivo nuclear de la RPDC constituye el medio indispensable para defender la soberania del pais y el derecho a vivir desde la amenaza nuclear y la politica hostil de EE.UU. que continua mas de medio siglo, razon por la cual no puede ser el asunto para poner en la mesa de negociaciones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs absurdo que EE.UU. intente comparar el acuerdo nuclear de Iran con la realidad de la RPDC, victima permanente de los actos hostiles militares provocativos y la maxima amenaza nuclear de EE.UU. incluyendo los continuos ejercicios militares conjuntos de gran envergadura.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras exista la politica hostil de EE.UU., no se cambiara jamas la mision de las fuerzas armadas nucleares de la RPDC."
