            "content": "Dismantlement of \"UN Forces Command\" Demanded \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 9 (KCNA) -- A DPRK delegate, addressing the meeting of the Special Committee on UN Peace-keeping Operations on February 28, said that if  the UN peace-keeping operations are to contribute to ensuring world peace and security in conformity with its mission and purpose it is necessary to strictly observe the principle of respecting sovereignty in all activities.\r\n He referred to the human rights abuses including sexual abuses of civilians by members of the peace-keeping forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He attributed the continuation of such human rights abuses in the new century to Japan's refusal to eradicate the consequences of the crimes related to the sexual slavery committed by the Japanese army in the last century. He underscored the need to take strong measures to punish those members of the peace-keeping forces who perpetrated crimes recently and call into question the crimes committed by Japan in the past and their consequences and force it to fully settle them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He noted that it is another pressing task to put an end to the acts of individual countries to misuse the UN military operations and activities for achieving their sinister political and military purposes with the UN reform as a momentum. The dismantlement of the \"UN Forces Command\" which has illegally existed in south Korea for scores of years should be the primary target of the UN reform, he noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"UN Forces Command\" in south Korea is a typical example of the abuse of the name of the UN as it not only threw an obstacle to the settlement of the Korean issue but damaged the trust in the UN. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The 30th UN General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for the dismantlement of the \"UN Forces Command,\" recognizing that it is unnecessary for it to exist in south Korea any longer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the U.S. has insisted on its continued existence. This is aimed to continue abusing the name of the UN for maintaining its military initiative in the Korean Peninsula and other parts of Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We hold that the UN take the UN reform as an occasion of totally eradicating the aftermath of the abuse of its name for sinister political and military purposes in the last century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK delegation re-clarifies its stance that the UN should observe the principle of respecting sovereignty for the successful UN peace-keeping operations and disallow individual countries to abuse the name of the UN for their ulterior purposes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They have further intensified sanctions and blockade against it than ever before in a bid to make it vacillate before difficulties and yield to them.\r\n As history and reality prove, neither concession nor compromise should be allowed in the confrontation with the U.S. imperialists as they precisely mean death. The Korean people have keenly realized this in their more than half a century-long confrontation with the U.S. imperialists. The army and people of the DPRK, closely rallied around the party and the leader, have consolidated the single-minded unity as firm as a rock and devotedly protected their socialist life from the vicious moves of the enemies to destabilize the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have advancedsocialist construction, responding to the U.S. imperialists' anti-revolutionary offensive with a revolutionary one and their anti-socialist campaign with a movement for a great surge in the socialist construction. The fiercer the confrontation with the U.S. gets, the fuller play will be given to their fighting tradition and revolutionary spirit.     \r\n\r\n\r\n"

But the U.S. imperialists are opposing this with reckless military provocations. Rodong Sinmun says this in a signed article Thursday.\r\n�@Declaring that the Korea policy of the U.S. imperialists against the Korean nation and its reunification, however, is bound to go bankrupt, the author of the article continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A grave hurdle has been thrown into the way of the movement of the Korean nation for independent reunification by the U.S. imperialists' harebrained acts. \r\n They are, indeed, the main obstacle obstructing the reconciliation and unity of the Korean nation and blocking the reunification of the country. Their criminal maneuvers against the reunification of Korea are a brigandish act of trampling upon the right of the Korean nation to independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No one has ever given the U.S. the right to interfere in and encroach upon the movement for national reunification, an exercise of the right to independence by the Korean nation. The U.S. imperialists, however, are persistently resorting to anti-reunification moves for a permanent division of the Korean nation, pursuing their dominationist Korea policy all along. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their design to keep Korea divided permanently and establish their domination over the whole of Korea stands no chance of realization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the Korean nation is living in the June 15 era of reunification. The idea of \"By our nation itself\" has become a nationwide idea and the inter-Korean relations marred by distrust and confrontation have turned into relations of reconciliation and cooperation based on national independence and cooperation, bringing eventual achievements in the reunification movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No aggressive forces can ever block the path of the movement of the Korean nation for independent reunification dynamically advancing under the banner of the June 15 joint declaration which represents the idea of \"By our nation itself\".\r\n All the Koreans in the north and the south and abroad will give full play to ardent patriotic enthusiasm to resolutely shatter the evermore heinous U.S. moves for a new war and against Korean reunification and push forward with redoubled vigor the cause of national reunification which has entered into a new phase.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
