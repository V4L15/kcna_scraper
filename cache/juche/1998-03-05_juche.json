Therefore, the peasants who had languished in backwardness and poverty for a long time have become the master of land, the master of the country.\r\n   On this significant holiday the agricultural working people are looking back with deep emotion upon the benefits of the party and the state that provided them with an independent and creative life.\r\n   The state has constantly pursued popular policies for the improvement of the peasants' standard of living. It rendered a lot of financial and material assistance to improve the wretched life of the peasants in the postwar period. It completely abolished the agricultural tax-in-kind in 1966 to liberate the peasants from tax burdens for good and all.\r\n   Housing and productive construction costs in the countryside are borne by the state and the farmers are using them free of charge.\r\n   The farmers are also enjoying the same benefits of free education, free medical care, accommodation at health resorts and holiday homes at state expense  and social security system as the workers and office employees do.\r\n   Their standard of living is as good as the urbans'.\r\n   Their fruitful farming work is followed by a joyful cultural and emotional life in the evening. Many of them are obtaining qualifications for engineers and experts under the higher educational system of studying while at work. \r\n   The agricultural working people across the country are now greeting their holiday with achievements in the preparations for farming.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "A new type of Opera dance\r\n  Pyongyang, March 5 (KCNA) -- Dance is an indispensable medium for operatic expression in the Korean opera. It helps to bring the theme of the opera into bold relief.\r\n   Of course, dances had been incorporated in operas. But their role had been simply complementary, that is, solely for the creation of mood.\r\n   General Kim Jong Il,  leader of the Korean people, went carefully into the nature of the world opera and the interrelations between opera and dance. On this basis, he gave a clear solution to all theoretical and practical problems arising in the creation of opera dance.\r\n   Under his direct guidance the choreographers created a new form of opera dance, called \"the sea of blood\"-type opera dance, in the 1970s.\r\n   This type of opera dance is based on the traditional Korean dance and brings the dramatic development of opera and the spirituality of the main characters into focus with its own language that suits the feeling of the Korean people. Here the dance is incorporated in opera, not as a complementary part. It is closely combined with orchestra and Pangchang (sung by the actors and actresses off-stage) to bring out the rich and deep message of the opera. \r\n    Proof of this is provided by the moonlit scene from scene 2 of act 3 of the Korean revolutionary opera \"the Flower Girl\".\r\n    The scene began with the flower fairies slowly standing up and surrounding the leading character got bun.\r\n   Ill-treated and humiliated to save her sick mother, she is now sold to settle the debts she owed a landlord.\r\n   The flower fairies dance as if expressing the pain in got bun's heart. On the other hand, rich women are enjoying themselves on a swing in the full moon.\r\n  Then follows Pangchang:\r\n   One moon shines up in the sky.  But different people gaze upon it.  Some are happy to see the moon.\r\n   While others grow most melancholy.\r\n   The dance in this moonlit scene reveals a society which is full of contradictions, while bringing to life the noble spirituality of the leading character. At the same time, it shows a turning-point in her ideological development.\r\n   Like this, the Korean opera dance, in close combination with the music and stage arts, plays an independent role in the opera, thus enriching the mental quality and raising the artistic development of the opera.    \r\n \r\n"

He refused to wear it, telling them that if they wanted to do something for him, they had better work hard to solve the clothing problem of the people.\r\n   Later, he called at a light industry goods exhibition. \r\n   Officials let him know that cloth of good quality was being massproduced and wanted him to wear a new suit. He said that he liked to wear the clothes he had usually worn and that it was his wish to sufficiently supply good cloth to the people.\r\n   Some ten years have passed since then. He,  however, is taking the lead in the forced march of socialism for the final victory, still in the jacket.\r\n   He has had such simple traits from his childhood. \r\n   He put on an undergarment his mother Kim Jong Suk knitted with military woolen underclothes after the liberation of the country. He went to school right after the ceasefire, in the same clothes with other pupils and with books wrapped in a cloth.\r\n   His simple life was shown in the military camping days of his university period.\r\n   He took part in a tactical training, weapon cleaning and cooking together with other students, as required by the military regulations.\r\n   A revolutionary anecdote about a nail-clipper he made a habitual use of for more than 20 years, which is known well among the Korean people, shows part of his great popular traits.    \r\n \r\n\r\n"
