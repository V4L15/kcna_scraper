It is not fitting for him, a colonial servant, to clamour for \"state security and independent defence\". He also made provocative utterances that recent \"consciousness of security\" has been slackened and \"the view of fighting against the enemy\" weakened.\r\n   His remarks indicate that he would not permit the aspirations for independence, democracy and reunification and sympathy with the northern half of Korea because they are  an expression of slackened \"consciousness of security\" and weakened \"view of fighting against the enemy\".\r\n   This betrays the treacherous, repressive moves of the Kim Young Sam group to crack down under the pretext of \"security\" upon the slightest national feelings as well as the democractic movement for reunification which is obstructive to the war manoeuvres against the fellow countrymen.\r\n   The recent clamour of the Kim Young Sam group for \"security\" is part of their criminal moves to intensify the fascist suppression of the democratic forces aspiring after reunification, incite the spirit of confrontation against the north among the people and aggravate the situation of the Korean Peninsula to ignite another war.\r\n   The Kim Young Sam group should immediately give up their manoeuvring to unleash a new war under the cloak of \"security\". \r\n\r\n"

But, none of them learned the condition of the puppet army and showed up at the Military Demarcation Line to instigate the puppets to inter-Korean confrontation as Watanabe did.\r\n   Japan has pushed ahead with rearming itself on a large scale since its defeat in the war. As a result, the Japan  \"Self-Defence Forces\" have been strengthened into an aggression force which can undergo any war. Not content with this,  the Japanese reactionaries are trying to build a military power and thus reinvade other nations.\r\n   They unhesitatingly say that, if a war breaks out in Korea, they will not remain with folded arms. This means that they will involve themselves in Korean war.\r\n   Japan has already decided to dispatch vessels and planes of the \"Self-Defence Forces\" to south Korea on the plea of \"rescuing Japanese.\"\r\n   Japan's intention to take military cooperation with south Korea as an occasion in paving the road to reinvasion is a serious miscalculation.\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries would be well advised to realise that their military conspiracy with south Korea will bring about their own ruin. \r\n\r\n"

But the south Korean authorities kept him in prison for 45 years on charge of \"spying\", the charge faked up by means of torture.\r\n   An Hak Sop, the second longest-term prisoner in the world, also suffered behind bars for 43 years on the same charge.\r\n   The south Korean rulers have more harshly persecuted Kim In So, Kim Yong Thae, Ham Se Hwan and others who were born in north Korea..\r\n   They, in wanton violation of international law and the Korean Armistice Agreement, put them in prison, intentionally excluding them in the exchange of Pows.   33 years and 7 months in prison made Kim in so disabled. \r\nThough he was released, he is now suffering from an illness in south Korea where he has no relatives.\r\n   Ham Se Hwan was held prisoner, hit by twelve bullets. He was released after twenty years in prison, but he was confined again in the \"Chongju Custody Centre for \r\nPreservation of Public Peace\" for many years, subjected to cruel torture and maltreatment, because he refused to be converted.\r\n   Kim In So, Kim Yong Thae and Ham Se Hwan are now in a critical condition with no relatives to nurse them, deprived of political rights and freedom.\r\n   Especially, Kim In So's life has been at stake in the wake of last year's cerebral haemorrhage.\r\n   The south Korean authorities are still keeping him under supervision for the \"Preservation of Public Peace\", alleging that he is likely to commit a crime again because he has refused to be converted and kept in touch with his family in The north.\r\n   All the facts clearly show that they intend to kill the Pows from the north by continuing to harshly persecute them In south Korea.\r\n   We express the belief that the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and other international and national human rights bodies and democratic organizations and the world's progressive people will make a case of the south Korean authorities' human rights abuses against the Pows and strongly urge the repatriation of the three old men. \r\n\r\n"
