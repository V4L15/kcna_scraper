And it prattled that the United States has been involuntarily involved in arms proliferation for its liberal export policy.\r\n   Commenting on this fact, a news analyst of Rodong Sinmun today says:\r\n   These utterances can be made only by those who do not feel shame at what they have done.\r\n   The United States ranks the first in the world's list of arms exporters.\r\n   The U.S. is now styling itself as an \"impartial mediator\" in the mideast issues.       Against its advertisement, however, some time ago, it supplied 25 F-15 jet fighters to Israel, thus igniting fresh arms race in the region and rendering the issues all the more difficult to be solved.\r\n   U.S.-made weapons were used in 45 of the 50 national and territorial disputes which occured in the world in the early 1990s. These weapons were supplied as a means to realise the U.S. policy of domination. \r\n   It is none other than the United States that has further aggravated the situation in disputed areas and brought waves of arms race all over the world.    \r\n\r\n"

It also definitely guarantees consistent maintenance of the revolutionary principles in socialist construction.\r\n   The revolutionary and socialist principles are, in essence, the working-class principles. Only those steadfast in class consciousness can judge all the matters with the viewpoint and position of the popular masses and always fight to defend the fundamental interests of the revolution.    \r\n   The class consciousness is essential for uncompromising fighting against the imperialists. Those who have firm class consciousness can struggle uncompromisingly against the imperialists' moves to stifle socialism, deeply aware of their class stand and duty.\r\n   With the firm class consciousness, the Korean people boast of being consistent in confidence in socialism and strong in the revolutionary principles.  They also categorically reject the imperialists' ideological and cultural offensive, economic blockade and military threat and never allow others to hurt the destiny and honor of their fatherland.    \r\n\r\n"
