And he organized the Young Communist League of Korea, the vanguard organization in August 1927, to guide all the anti-Japanese mass organizations in a unified way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Having founded the Anti-Japanese People's Guerrilla Army with young revolutionaries of new generation as its backbone on April 25, Juche 21 (1932), he launched the war against the Japanese imperialists and thus achieved the historical cause of national liberation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the hard-fought anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle, the President, looking ahead to the distant future of revolution, set forth the slogan \"Love the future!\" And he had provided best things to the children in his lifetime. His warm love for the children and youth produced a lot of legends. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His youth-centered politics is being successfully carried forward by Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is entirely thanks to the politics that the red flag of revolution continues to flutter and socialism makes a long drive in the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The \"Ulji Focus Lens\" is a test war designed to finalize the commanding and operational system of the forces of aggression and give the finishing touch to the war preparations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nobody can guarantee that the on-going war game may not go over to an actual war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The massive military maneuvers of the U.S. are a downright challenge to peace and an ill-advised criminal act bringing dark clouds of war to the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The war game is so grave because it is a war action declaring the Korean Armistice Agreement null and void. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The current developments give a clear answer as to who is chiefly to blame for beclouding the prospect of the settlement of the nuclear issue, escalating the military standoff and tension on the Korean Peninsula and driving the situation to the brink of war. The U.S. imperialists are the very harasser of peace and security of the Korean Peninsula and chief criminal of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to promptly drop its harebrained foolish hope of realizing its wild aggressive ambition against the DPRK by strength, looking straight into the latter's independent stand and will of retaliation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It stipulated the \"right to free use of the land and the buildings\" in the \"Memorandum of Understanding\" signed with south Korea in 1960. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the USAID stopped its activities in south Korea in September 1980, reducing the MOU to a dead paper. The U.S. has so far refused to pay the rent under the pretext of \"validity of the MOU,\" asserting that some officials of the USAID are still at work in the U.S. embassy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a far-fetched assertion and brigandish behavior unprecedented in the history of world diplomacy, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seems to regard south Korea as its hereditary estate and imposes any demand upon it as a law, utterly indifferent to international practice. How brazen-faced this American way of thinking is. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Of late the U.S. has gone the lengths of forcing the south Korean authorities to cover even the expenses for the transfer of its military bases now under way according to its military strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This fact alone goes to clearly prove that the south Korea-U.S. \"alliance\" is not \"equal and true friendly relations\" as claimed by the pro-U.S sycophants and traitors in south Korea but the relationship in which south Korea is totally dependent on the U.S. in all fields including politics, economy and the military and that the U.S. imperialists are the most shameless aggressors and plunderers as they have brought only unspeakable misfortune, sufferings and damage to the south Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recently disclosed fact teaches a lesson that the south Korean people can never escape disgrace, insult, looting and damage unless the sycophancy towards the U.S. is rooted out in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should clearly see through the true design of the U.S. for aggression and plunder and wage a more courageous just and patriotic struggle to put an end to the history of disgrace and misfortune.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
