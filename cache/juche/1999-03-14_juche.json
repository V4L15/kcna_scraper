Pursuant to the decision 3 liaison channels will be installed through telephone and fax.   Both sides plan to set up a hotline between the top military brasses following the establishment of the emergency network.   They also confirmed a plan to stage joint \"search and rescue\" maneuvers in East Sea of Korea around July.   All this proves that Japanese and South Korean authorities put spurs to preparations for an anti-DPRK war. \r\n\r\n"

The Bangladesh Solidarity Committee for Supporting Korea's Reunification in its Statement on Feb. 25 said the north and south of Korea have already agreed on the threeï¿½@principles of the Korean reunification including the great national unity and that obstacles lying in the way of reunification should be cleared if these  principles are to be implemented.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Congo-DPRK Friendship Association in its statement on March 4 said the proposal of the DPRK was the most realistic measure to promote the independent and peaceful reunification and called upon the world progressive people to lift their voices of solidarity for its materialization.  \r\n  \r\n"

The meeting heard an appeal to the South Korean workers adopted at an emergency meeting of the central committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea, which was followed by speeches.   The speakers said that millions of jobless people are wandering about streets in South Korea owing to the anti-social \"restructuring of business groups\" and lay-off imposed by the rulers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In particular, workers are committing group suicides together with their families, unable to endure their sufferings, they stated, stressing:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The South Korean workers and people should daringly fight it out to defend their vital rights and realize the independence and democratization of society, clearly mindful that they can meet their just demands only through  a struggle.   The United States must not try to intensify the economic domination and plunder of South Korea through the International Monetary Fund but get out of South Korea without delay, taking aggression forces and war equipment with it. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "\"Combined use of Chinese characters\" condemned \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 14 (KCNA) -- Papers here today come out with signed commentaries branding the South Korean ruler's announcement of \"combined use of Chinese characters\" as a thrice-cursed crime of selling even language to outsiders.   The South Korean \"government for the people\" decided to reintroduce the \"policy on the combined use of Chinese characters\" which had been abolished and announced that Korean and Chinese characters would be used together in \"official documents\" and public marks including road indicators.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A news analyst of Rodong Sinmun says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This announcement was prompted by the flunkeyist and treacherous mentality of the present chief executive.   From the days when he was at an opposition party, he advocated the \"combined use of Chinese characters\". After taking office, he repeated his insistence on the combined use, alleging that the \"exclusive use of the Korean language is an error\" as South Korea belongs to the \"cultural sphere of Chinese characters.\"   During his tour of Japan last October, he meekly accepted the demand of the Japanese reactionaries for the use of Chinese characters in South Korea. Afterwards he hurriedly announced the \"policy on the combined use of Chinese characters.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This means that he succumbed to the demand of the Japanese reactionaries for flinging the door wide for the Japanese culture and using Chinese characters in \"official documents\" in reward for borrowing 5 billion dollars from Japanese banks in the form of \"currency exchange\" if a second financial crisis occurs in South Korea.   No preceding rulers of South Korea were as sycophantic and traitorous  as the present rulers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In a word, the present South Korean rulers are traitors who are worse than the \"five traitors of 1905\" who sold the country to the Japanese.   A signed commentary of Minju Joson urges that the reactionary South Korean \"government\" must lend an ear to the unanimous demand of the people and put an immediate end to \"the combined use of Chinese characters.\" \r\n \r\n"

Pak Kwang Gi, chief of its Pyongyang mission, stressed this at a press interview on March 12 on the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the preparatory committee for the foundation of the Revolutionary Party for Reunification of South Korea, the predecessor of the NDFSK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He said:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forerunners of the NDFSK held a meeting in Seoul on March 15, Juche 53 (1964) at which they adopted a declaration on making preparations for the party founding and reached a consensus on naming it \"revolutionary party for reunification.\"   At the meeting they adopted its program of struggle to take the Juche idea as its unique guiding  idea  and ensure its organizational and ideological unity and cohesion on this basis and achieve the independent reunification of the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   With the central committee of the Revolutionary Party for Reunification founded on August 25, Juche 58 (1969), the South Korean revolutionary movement came to have its political headquarters and could advance dynamically.   The party was renamed the National Democratic Front of South Korea on July 27, Juche 74 (1985) to demonstrate its fresh advance.   The NDFSK has deeply rooted among the popular masses and waged a vigorous struggle for independence against the U.S. for democracy against fascism and for national reunification, enjoying their trust and support.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The NDFSK maintains official relations with political parties and fronts of over 100 countries, commanding support of international public circles as well as the South Korean people from the very day of its appearance and solidarity committees for supporting the NDFSK are active in different regions and countries to solidarize with it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
