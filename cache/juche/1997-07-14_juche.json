Since the country's liberation it has chilled the efforts for national unity and reunification, extolling the colonial fascist rule of the U.S. imperialists and their stooges.\r\n   It is a disgrace to the nation and an unbearable insult to the press that there is such a despicable, traitorous newspaper as Chosun Ilbo in the press organs of south Korea.\r\n   This is why political parties, organizations and people of the north have issued statements bitterly condemning Chosun Ilbo.\r\n   The south Korean \"civilian\" authorities and \"Government\"-controlled organizations, however, have defended Chosun Ilbo, describing the north's legitimate countermeasure as \"infringement on the freedom of the press\".\r\n   If calling for \"overthrow of the north's system\" is ffreedom\" as they claim, demolishing Chosun Ilbo is our freedom.\r\n   Nobody will check our exercise of this freedom.\r\n   We express the hope that you will launch patriotic press activities to deal a heavy blow at the anti-national act of Chosun Ilbo, a servant of Chongwadae and the \"Agency for National Security Planning\", anti-communist plot-breeding tool and rapacious press conglomerate, for the sake of national unity and reunification.    \r\n\r\n"
