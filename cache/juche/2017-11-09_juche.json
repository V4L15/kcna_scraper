Por tanto, la publicacion del reciente \"proyecto de sancion independiente\" deviene la conducta ridicula y estupida que revela la situacion miserable del titere colonial que debe lisonjear a su patron para mantener su vida. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tResultan absurdas la \"sancion contra el Norte\" y la esperanza en su \"efecto\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor muy desesperadas las maniobras de EE.UU., las fuerzas hostiles y los titeres surcoreanos para dar presion a la RPDC, no podran detener con nada la marcha vigorosa de los militares y civiles coreanos que avanzan con el poderio de la unidad monolitica hacia la victoria final enarbolando la bandera del Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos titeres surcoreanos deben tener presente que sus locuras de \"sancion independiente\" sera un acto de suicida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEllos pagaran precio carisimo por sus crimenes cometidos contra los connacionales adulando a su amo gangster norteamericano."

            "content": "Portavoz del comite coreano condena nuevas \"declaraciones\" anti-RPDC\r\nPyongyang, 9 de noviembre (ACNC) -- A la pregunta formulada por la ACNC con respecto a que tuvo lugar otra vez la farsa de adoptar las \"declaraciones\" anti-RPDC en un organo internacional de supervision financiera, el Comite Nacional de Coordinacion de la RPDC sobre el Anti-lavado de Dinero y Anti-Financiacion del Terrorismo dio hoy la siguiente respuesta:\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la reunion plenaria de la Fuerza Atareada de Accion Financiera contra el Lavado de Dinero, transcurrida del dia primero al 3 en Buenos Aires de Argentina, se adopto una \"declaracion abierta\" que acusa a la RPDC de no arreglar todavia los defectos en la esfera de prevencion del lavado de dinero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIgualmente, quedo aprobada otra \"declaracion\" adicional que aboga por bloquear la financiacion de la RPDC a la proliferacion de armas de destruccion masiva mediante la implementacion consecuente de las \"resoluciones de sancion\" del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRechazamos categoricamente ese hecho calificandolo de un proceder injusto de ese aparato extremadamente politizado ante la presion de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU., que trataba justificar, abusando del aparato, la sancion financiera anticoreana bajo la sospecha de \"lavado de dinero\", se porta vilmente para bloquear las transacciones financieras de la RPDC al definir las \"resoluciones\" del CS de la ONU como \"pauta internacional\" e imponerlas a los paises miembros.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo comprueba el hecho de que la susodicha \"declaracion\" adicional titulada \"Peligro de la financiacion de la RPDC a la proliferacion de armas de destruccion masiva\" ha copiado los mismos articulos de las \"resoluciones de sancion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa presente farsa deja conocer el cinico intento criminal de EE.UU. que para obstaculizar el incremento de las fuerzas armadas nucleares de la RPDC, trata de tildar todas las transacciones financieras, sean para fines civiles o militares, de \"violacion\" a las \"resoluciones de sancion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi la posesion de armas nucleares por parte de la RPDC con fines de autodefensa fuera calificada de proliferacion de armas de exterminio masivo y las transacciones financieras con otros paises fueran una forma de su financiacion, el culpable principal en este tema es precisamente EE.UU. que mantiene desplegados por doquier del mundo decenas y centenares de armas nucleares e invierte hoy dia tambien sumas astronomicas en su mantenimiento y modernizacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo portador responsable de armas nucleares, la RPDC se incorporara en lo adelante tambien a los esfuerzos internacionales por prevenir el lavado de dinero y la financiacion al terrorismo y a la proliferacion de armas de destruccion masiva, pero no tolerara nunca los intentos de quitarle el artefacto nuclear."
