Osong with over 150 turns on the road, and Panmunjom on the forefront, saying he should go wherever soldiers are. He crossed the long and stiff Chol Pass more than ten times and sailed to Cho Islet through roaring waves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When he finds himself among soldiers, he takes a scrupulous care of their life from cultural and emotional activities to meals, showing them warmer affection than their own parents would. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He took measures to let the soldiers have many photos taken so that they would be able to keep them long as mementos of their military service. When he visited a women's company in a deep valley, he took care that all conditions were taken so they could watch clear and clean TV scenes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After listening to ordinary soldiers singing, he saw to it that their talent was brought into bloom. And, when he saw twelve pieces of pencil sketch \"Soldier's Life\" drawn by a private, he set off a new wave of cultural and emotional activities, \"a sketch storm,\" all over the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Concerned even over the cold wind filtering through needle holes of soldiers' winter clothes, he took care that they were replaced with better ones. He acquaints himself with the room temperature and water quality while making a round of bedrooms, wash-cum-bath houses, kitchens, non-staple food stores and other supply facilities and teaches them food processing methods, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Immeasurable is the warmth of his parental love for the soldiers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n So the hearts of the KPA soldiers are aflame with the fervor to perform brilliant feats in the days of their military service under Kim Jong Il's Songun leadership on the 16th anniversary of the day when he was acclaimed as the supreme commander of the KPA (Dec. 24, 1991).     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a stirring reality which can be seen in the DPRK which holds Kim Jong Il as supreme commander of the revolutionary armed forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the immortal historic exploits performed by him that he has remarkably augmented the political and military might of the country, demonstrating its dignity and honor as a sovereign country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson calls upon all the people to make more vigorous endeavors to victoriously advance the building of a great prosperous powerful socialist nation and finally accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche under the leadership of Kim Jong Il.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Acto por XVI aniversario del nombramiento de Kim Jong Il \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, 24 de diciembre (ATCC) -- Tuvo lugar el dia 23 en la Casa Cultural 25 de Abril el acto central por el XVI aniversario del nombramiento del Dirigente Kim Jong Il como Comandante Supremo del Ejercito Popular de Corea (EPC). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Al acto asistieron los cuadros del partido, el ejercito y el Estado, los presidentes de los partidos amigos, funcionarios de los organos del partido, las fuerzas armadas y el Poder, organizaciones de masas, ministerios e instituciones centrales, oficiales y soldados del EPC, funcionarios de las ramas de ciencia, educacion, cultura y arte, salud publica, prensa e informacion, benemeritos y trabajadores capitalinos. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El informe de la ocasion estuvo a cargo del general de ejercito del EPC Kim Kyok Sik, jefe del Estado Mayor General del EPC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El nombramiento del Dirigente Kim Jong Il como Comandante Supremo del EPC fue un evento trascendental que garantizo con firmeza el desarrollo ulterior de las fuerzas armadas revolucionarias de Corea y el avance victorioso de la causa revolucionaria del Juche y un gran jubilo nacional de gran significado para el destino y el futuro de la patria, senalo el informante y prosiguio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Gracias a la ascension del Dirigente al cargo supremo de las fuerzas armadas revolucionarias, el ejercito popular pudo defender invariablemente el caracter revolucionario de ejercito del partido y del lider y llevar adelante de generacion en generacion la causa de construccion militar allanada y conducida brillantemente por el Presidente Kim Il Sung, y el ejercito y el pueblo de Corea pudieron continuar fielmente la historia y la tradicion del Songun de la revolucion coreana para llevar a feliz termino la causa revolucionaria del Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El periodo desde la decada de 1990 hasta la fecha ocupa suma importancia en la historia de mando militar del Dirigente Kim Jong Il quien durante varios decenios al frente de nuestras fuerzas armadas condujo a la victoria la causa de construccion militar del Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En el periodo mas severo de nuestra revolucion el EPC se fortalecio como poderoso ejercito revolucionario selecto. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Corea, que hace un siglo se vio obligada a sufrir la verguenza de la nacion arruinada por falta de poderoso ejercito nacional, llego hoy a su fisonomia de potencia militar inquebrantable a la que no pueden atreverse a atacar los cualesquier potentes enemigos imperialistas. Todo esto es un milagro secular logrado por haber gozado de la direccion del Comandante Supremo Kim Jong Il, genio en los asuntos militares. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La politica de Songun (priorizacion militar) del Dirigente, verdaderamente independiente y patriotica, dio a luz la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio que encarna el noble ideal de \"entre nosotros, los connacionales\" y luego la \"Declaracion para el Desarrollo de las Relaciones Norte-Sur, la Paz y la Prosperidad\". De esta manera, abrio una brillante perspectiva ante el camino de la nacion coreana enrumbada a la patria prospera reunificada, elevo incomparablemente la dignidad y la posicion de Corea del Songun en la escena mundial y fortalecio extraordinariamente la solidaridad internacional con la revolucion coreana. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Con la gran idea y la dinamica orientacion del Songun el Dirigente formo al EPC como abanderado y grueso numero uno de la revolucion jucheana y logro victorias milagrosas en la batalla de defensa al socialismo y la construccion de una gran potencia prospera y asentar una solida base para la prosperidad eterna de Corea de Kim Il Sung. Estas hazanas del Comandante Supremo luciran eternamente en la historia de construccion militar del Partido del Trabajo de Corea y los anales de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Debemos desplegar una energica lucha de todo el pueblo por abrir a toda costa la gran puerta de gran potencia prospera en 2012 en que se cumplira el centenario del nacimiento del Presidente Kim Il Sung, y de esta manera tenemos que revitalizar todas las ramas de la economia nacional, en particular los dominios que juegan el papel de vanguardia en la economia y la industria basica y avivar las llamas de la revolucion en la agricultura y la industrial ligera para asi producir un viraje decisivo en la mejora de la vida del pueblo.      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
