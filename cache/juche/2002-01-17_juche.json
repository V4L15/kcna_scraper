So, it is by no means fortuitous that the director negatively predicted any development of the DPRK-U.S. relations for this year and even caviled at the humanitarian assistance of the world community to pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This evidently betrays the U.S. insidious intention to isolate the DPRK from the international community and stifle it and fully reveals its design to sacrifice anybody for meeting its own interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already known, any \"crisis\" on the Korean peninsula was entirely due to the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By peddling the story about the possible \"crisis\" on the Korean peninsula the U.S. seeks to invent a pretext for the implementation of its new world strategy based on \"priority to Asia\" and establish its unchallenged domination over the A1ia-Pacific region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean peninsula is the main target of the Bush administration's new military strategy in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tense situation is prevailing on the Korean peninsula, a strategic stronghold in the Asia-Pacific region, owing to the U.S. interest in world domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is now escalating its hardline policy to stifle the DPRK, shifting the blame for the worsened DPRK-U.S. ties and inter-Korean relations on to the DPRK and frequently clamouring about transparence and reciprocity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is foolish enough of the U.S. to dream up the fiction of the \"crisis\" on the Korean peninsula as part of its campaign to isolate the DPRK from the world community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If those experts of the heritage foundation are far-sighted, they should know better who is their opponent, away from their wicked intention to build up a public opinion about the possible crisis on the Korean peninsula.    \r\n\r\n"
