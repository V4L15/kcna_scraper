He highly appreciated the successful performance and extended thanks to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that the light comedy is another monumental masterpiece representing the literature and arts in the era of Songun as it has reached the best level in its ideological contents and in all the elements of depiction, he saw to it that Kim Il Sung Prize was awarded to this work as it serves as a good textbook for the ideological education of the servicepersons and the people of the DPRK and showed great loving care for the creators and artistes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The theatrical troupe, which has carried forward and glorified the precious legacy of the five revolutionary dramas and the work style displayed in creating them, has powerfully demonstrated once again its ability as a prestigious art troupe in the course of creating the above-said light comedy, he noted, adding that this is a striking demonstration of the great potential of the drama creating staff firmly armed with the WPK's Juche-oriented literary and art idea and theory. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Noting that revolutionary dramas in the DPRK serve as effective ideological weapons for training all the members of the society as Juche-type revolutionaries and transforming it as required by the Juche idea for their rich ideological contents and high artistry in line with the need and desire in the new era, he underscored the need to conduct dynamic performing activities to let more people watch them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The theatrical troupe is faced with a heavy and yet honorable task to consolidate the successes and experience gained in making a great turn in producing dramas and create more revolutionary dramas rich in ideological contents and high in artistry on this basis and thus make a contribution to carrying out the cause of modeling the whole society on the Juche idea, he said, setting forth important tasks which would serve as guidelines for the troupe in the art creation and performing activities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Among the audience were KPA Vice Marshal Kim Yong Chun, vice-chairman of the NDC of the DPRK and minister of the People's Armed Forces, KPA General Kim Jong Gak, member of the NDC of the DPRK and first vice director of the General Political Bureau of the KPA, and other commanding officers of the army and armed forces organs, Secretaries Choe Thae Bok and Kim Ki Nam and Department Directors Kim Kyong Hui, Jang Song Thaek, Kim Yong Il and Kim Yang Gon and other leading officials of the WPK Central Committee, and officials in the fields of literature and arts and media."

The U.S. secretary of State, when interviewed by a TV broadcasting service, listed the DPRK as a dangerous state posing a potential nuclear threat, while talking sheer nonsense that north Korea could try whatever it possibly could as it already had access to nukes. The U.S. assistant secretary of Defense for Policy at a hearing held at the Senate Armed Services Committee grumbled that there is an increasing danger of north Korea's possible attack on the U.S. mainland with long-range missiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Monday observes in a signed commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is foolhardy and preposterous for the U.S. to run the whole gamut of wordplays in a bid to charge the DPRK with \"nuclear proliferation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The commentary cites facts to prove that the DPRK has never posed any nuclear threat to other countries but, has been exposed to the U.S. constant nuclear threat for a long time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. has a true willingness to avert a nuclear war and ensure peace, it should substantially cut down its nuclear weapons, without letting loose rhetoric, and refrain from any act of sparking off a fresh arms race, the commentary notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. hypocritical talk about \"reduction of nuclear weapons\" is just a version of the theory of bolstering up modern nuclear hardware, the theory of nuclear threat.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the ulterior aim of the U.S. to threaten the whole world with nuclear and non-nuclear weapons and mount a preemptive attack on any target any moment. Herein lies the reactionary and dangerous nature of the U.S. frantic moves for bolstering up strategic offensive weapons including modern nuclear weapons behind the scene of \"nuclear disarmament\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural for the DPRK to bolster up its war deterrent now that the U.S. is getting hell-bent on developing and bolstering up modern strategic offensive weapons under the pretext of non-existent \"nuclear threat\" from the DPRK and no one can find fault with it."

Por lo tanto, nadie puede  censurarlo."
