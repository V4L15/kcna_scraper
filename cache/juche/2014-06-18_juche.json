            "content": "Minju Joson Blasts Park Geun Hye Group's Anti-DPRK Remarks\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, June 18 (KCNA) -- A few days ago, Park Geun Hye talked nonsense before advisory members at Chongwadae that \"the danger of the north's nuclear development and provocations is ever more increasing and that she would lead the north to changes on the solid basis of security.\" That day a confidant of Park blustered before media persons that it is necessary to \"hamstring the north's efforts to bolster up its nuclear capability,\" claiming that the north is going ahead with provocations including projected nuclear test and missile launch.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson Wednesday observes in a commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is nothing but the last-ditch effort of the Park group to justify its despicable acts of treachery for zealously joining in its U.S. master's scenario for igniting a war of aggression on the Korean peninsula at any cost and tide over its worsening ruling crisis. What is more ridiculous is that the puppet group is crying out for \"total denuclearization of the north\" and \"the settlement of the nuclear issue of the north on a priority basis\" under the pretext of \"the north's moves to bolster up its nuclear capability\" by distorting the essence of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What the Korean nation hopes is the denuclearization of the whole peninsula, not unilateral \"denuclearization of the north\" because the U.S. was chiefly to blame for spawning the nuclear issue on the peninsula and pushing the DPRK to its access to nuclear weapons. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group is set to justify its moves to escalate the confrontation with the fellow countrymen in the north and put more spurs to the preparations for a war against the north under the pretexts of \"settlement of the nuclear issue of the north on a priority basis\" and \"total denuclearization of the north\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will bolster up its nuclear deterrence for self-defence to foil the moves of the U.S. and the Park group for a nuclear war against it and wipe out the enemies at a single strike once they dare attack it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group would be well advised to bear this in mind and stop its reckless remarks."

His appointment to the above-said post is little short of an open declaration of all-out confrontation with the DPRK and a war provocation against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Han Min Gu who was informally designated as the puppet minister of Defense is also a diehard bellicose element who inherited the blood of a pro-Japanese lackey.

Even lawmakers from the ruling and opposition parties are openly calling for the withdrawal of designation of him as a candidate, an indication of uncontrollable furor. This is attributable to what he has done against the compatriots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There are public voices that \"Park who is not fit for president is choosing such guy as prime minister.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park's \"government reshuffle\" is a hideous politically-motivated action against the trend of the times, a clear indication that her true colors as a fascist, dictator and confrontation maniac can never change.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In a nutshell, this is a revelation of her intention to persist in sycophancy and treachery, fascist dictatorship, scandals and moves to escalate the confrontation with the fellow countrymen in the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She is running the whole gamut of despicable political hooliganism in a bid to tide over the worsening ruling crisis and stay in power but the conservative group is fated to meet a political ruin."
