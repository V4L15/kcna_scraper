Out of their nature, the imperialist forces are making desperate efforts to arrest and stamp out the struggle of the progressive forces to build an independent new world. They are running wild as if they were strong but it is nothing but a bluff. They become impotent before the unity of the anti-imperialist forces for independence. This unity serves as an effective method of struggle and an important way for destroying imperialism and building an independent new world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a real picture of the present time that the victory and advance of the revolutionary struggle have been ensured with the might of unity. Today non-aligned and other developing countries are pooling their efforts in the struggle for independence against imperialism and standing against the arbitrary practices of the U.S. imperialists with the strategy of unity. The world people's hatred toward the U.S. imperialists is growing bitterer, driving the U.S. to unprecedented isolation and tight corner. This is a striking demonstration of the unity of the world's anti-imperialist forces for independence against the U.S. imperialists and its might.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
