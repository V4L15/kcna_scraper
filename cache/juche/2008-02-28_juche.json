Some time ago, Japan enacted the new \"law on special measures against terrorism\" despite strong opposition at home and abroad, thus legalizing the resumption of the refueling mission of the Maritime Self-Defense Force in the Indian Ocean. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is beyond any doubt that the Japanese reactionaries will press forward the moves to enact a \"permanent law\" in real earnest in a bid to legalize the constant dispatch of SDF overseas as the new \"Anti-terrorism Law\" is now in force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the invariable intention of the Japanese reactionaries to turn the SDF into regular forces and allow the exercise of the \"right to collective self-defense\" and thus legalize the military actions of these aggressor forces overseas. They are working hard to rewrite the existing law in a bid to let the SDF advance into any region of the world, unhindered, and mount preemptive attacks on other countries in the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pursuant to the above-said scenario for overseas invasion, they are zealously pushing forward their moves to build missile shields while frantically stepping up their moves for turning Japan into a military power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They regard the DPRK as the primary target of their offensive aimed at achieving their goal of overseas invasion. They are accelerating the arms buildup and the moves for converting Japan into a military power under the pretext of \"threat\" from the DPRK and watching for a chance to launch a war for staging a comeback to Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is important for ensuring peace and security of not only on the Korean Peninsula but also in the rest of Asia and the world to decisively frustrate their moves for militarization.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The might of the driving force depends on the might of unity. It is possible to successfully achieve the reunification only when all Korean people firmly unite as one as a driving force for national reunification and strengthen it in every way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The motive power capable of ushering in a new morning of independent reunification represents the wisdom, will and might of the Korean nation united as one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is thanks to the banner of national unity that the Korean nation's movement for national reunification has made a victorious advance despite all challenges of history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality of the June 15 era of reunification which has advanced under the banner of \"By our nation itself\" clearly proves that no force can ever match the might of the united Korean nation and it serves as an engine for accomplishing the cause of independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the unshakable faith of all Koreans that there is nothing impossible and it is quite possible to achieve independent reunification when they join hands and pool efforts, concludes the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
