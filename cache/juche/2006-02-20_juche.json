This was a very just and timely action in view of the essential requirements for settling the issue of national reunification, the prevailing situation and the trend of the development of the reunification movement. \r\n In order to energetically carry out the cause of national reunification this year all the fellow countrymen at home and abroad should wage a dynamic movement for independent reunification under the uplifted banner of \"By our nation itself.\" \r\n The north and the south should strictly observe the principle of independence, closely cooperate with each other and solve all the issues from the viewpoint and stand of attaching importance and priority to the Korean nation, placing the dignity and interests of the nation above all, as required by the idea of \"By our nation itself\" when handling the national issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to bring about a fresh phase of the cause of national reunification this year it is necessary to conduct a dynamic nationwide movement for peace against war. \r\n The north and the south are a community linked with the same destiny as far as the issue of war or peace is concerned. It is quite natural for the north and the south to stand against the U.S. imperialists' war moves. The Koreans are the masters of this land and peace on the Korean Peninsula should, therefore, be protected by their concerted efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To achieve great national unity provides a basic guarantee for accomplishing the historic cause of national reunification as early as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Koreans are to achieve great national unity they should put aside all the differences on the principle of placing the common cause and interests of the nation above anything else. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the fellow countrymen should turn out as one in the patriotic movement for independent reunification, peace against war and great national unity to dynamically advance the cause of national reunification with exceptionally strong patriotic enthusiasm and renewed resolution.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

As a result, the three-revolution standard-bearers and other people are making their lives worthwhile on the sacred road of devotedly safeguarding the leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An energetic drive has been under way to learn from the spiritual world of the unassuming heroes and persons of distinguished services of the old generation who devoted themselves to the prosperity of the country. This resulted in the emergence of more than 21,300 unassuming men of distinguished service and those who displayed the beautiful deeds of helping and leading each other forward. The single-mindedly united DPRK has turned into a big harmonious family. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dynamic progress made in the technical revolution has helped increase the economic self-reliance of the country. Thanks to the vigorous mass technical renovation the number of scientific and technical innovation proposals grew seven times as of February 2006 as compared with that in Juche 64 (1975). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The work to place the national economy on a Juche basis has been actively pushed forward as evidenced by the solution of raw material, fuel and power problems by use of the locally available resources and the industrial inter-sector structures have been further perfected. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The scientists and technicians of the country successfully launched satellite \"Kwangmyongsong 1\", manufactured a scanning tunneling microscope and registered many other successes in latest scientific researches, thereby powerfully demonstrating the scientific and technological potential of the DPRK that has reached the world's level. \r\n The modernization of the national economy has been put on a higher stage.   Thousands of technical innovation proposals have been introduced into the field of machine industry over the last decade. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Industrialization and modernization of agriculture have been accelerated to carry out the policy of the Workers' Party of Korea for rural technical revolution. In this course, there have emerged many exemplary units in the comprehensive mechanization of agriculture including the Migok Co-op Farm and the Wangjaesan Co-op Farm and a solid foundation has been laid for the development of agriculture.\r\n  A fresh turn has been brought about in the cultural revolution, too. \r\n  At least 1.1 million more technicians and specialists have been trained thanks to the higher educational system and the study-while-working system, bringing the nation's number of intellectuals to more than 2.1 million. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The number of holders of academic degrees has increased 25 times as compared with that in Juche 64 (1975). 76.5 percent of them are young scientists. And most of them became doctors and masters in the worthwhile period of the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A lot of monumental masterpieces such as multi-part feature film \"The Nation and Destiny\" and the grand gymnastic and artistic performance \"Arirang\" were created in the filed of literature and arts and the policy for popularizing the sports has also been successfully implemented. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to the dynamic movement to introduce the revolutionary soldier culture spectacular sceneries of socialism appeared in different parts of the country and the appearance of the streets, villages and worksites has changed beyond recognition. \r\n The Korean people have grown stronger in their confidence in the course of the historic Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement as they have grasped the truth that they can bring earlier the day of the appearance of a great prosperous powerful nation of Juche when they meet the requirements of Juche in ideology, technology and culture true to the Songun revolutionary leadership of Kim Jong Il.       \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
