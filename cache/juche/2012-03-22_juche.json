After embarking on the road of the revolution in his early years, he founded the Juche idea, Songun idea and indicated the path of the Korean revolution. He founded the anti-Japanese people's guerrilla army, the revolutionary armed forces on April 25, 1932 and annihilated the Japanese imperialist gangsters, liberating the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter the country's liberation, he achieved the historic cause of the party founding and developed the Korean People's Revolutionary Army into the Korean People's Army, the regular revolutionary armed forces. He also successfully solved the problem of the power our own way and founded the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the period of the Fatherland Liberation War, he aroused all the servicepersons and people to defeat U.S. imperialism and achieved the shining victory in the war.

He also set it forth as the general objective of the Korean revolution to model the whole society on the Juche idea at the Sixth Congress of the WPK, bringing about a decisive turn in the struggle for implementing it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe energetically led the revolution and construction without a moment's rest and passed away in his office.

In the first half of the 1940s he made effort to wind up such military preparedness. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe also worked to establish secret guerrilla bases for KPRA units' activities and all-people resistance forces in mountains of the country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOn August 9, 1945 an order of final attack was issued for the liberation of the country, and the ruling system of Japan in Korea came to collapse in a moment. This was ascribable to KPRA's general attack and activities of many resistance organizations conducted under Kim Il Sung's strategic plan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Japanese imperialists suffered deathblow by KPRA's powerful attack and the armed resistance of all Korean people, and surrendered at discretion on August 15, 1945. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThanks to Kim Il Sung's idea of achieving the independence of the country by the Korean people themselves and his wise leadership, the Korean people at last put an end to the atrocious colonial rule of 40 odd years by the Japanese imperialists and achieved the liberation of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe victory in the national liberation movement was the fruition of Kim Il Sung's absolute trust in his people's strength."

            "content": "S. Korean Newspaper on Political Impact, Economic Efficiency of Kwangmyongsong-3\r\nPyongyang, March 22 (KCNA) -- Thongil News, an internet paper of south Korea, Tuesday carried an article titled \"Political impact and economic efficiency of 'Kwangmyongsong-3'\".\n\t\t\t\t\tThe article said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Korean Committee for Space Technology in a statement of its spokesman on March 16 announced that the DPRK will launch a working satellite, Kwangmyongsong-3, manufactured by itself with indigenous technology to mark the 100th birth anniversary of President Kim Il Sung. It also said the satellite will be blasted off from the Sohae Satellite Launching Station in Cholsan County, North Phyongan Province between April 12 and 16.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe announcement immediately caught the world attention.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHankuk Ilbo said the north informed the U.S. State Department of the plan of the announcement of the satellite launch before releasing it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA spokesperson for the U.S. State Department in a regular briefing on March 16 admitted the earlier contact between the DPRK and the U.S., saying that the New York channel went operational in the later hours on March 15 and the U.S. obviously conveyed the meaning of the satellite launch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe north side is of the stand that the planned launch is not contrary to the North-U.S. agreement. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChoson Sinbo, a Tokyo-based newspaper run by Koreans in Japan, said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAccording to the DPRK's plan, it is inevitable for it to launch earth observation satellite, a working satellite that would contribute to the economic development of the country, to mark the Day of the Sun in 2012 as the next stage of an experimental communications satellite that was launched in 2009. It was clear that the satellite launch plan had been promoted from years ago. It is the north's stand that moratorium on long-range missile launch and the satellite launch are separate issues.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tConventional Satellite: Equipment Essential for the DPRK's Economy\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHan Ho Sok, director of the Institute of Reunification, in an article titled \"'Kwangmyongsong-3' is a satellite with transparency\" quoted a statement of a spokesman for the Korean Committee for Space Technology on February 24, 2009 as saying, \"Under the long-term national plan for space development, we look forward to launching working satellites for communications, resources prospecting, weather forecast, etc. crucial for the economic development of the country in years to come in the first phase and normalizing their operations.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChosun Sinbo on March 16, 2012 said that \"Kwangmyongsong-3\" to be launched by the north is a polar-orbiting earth observation satellite. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe weather satellite is urgently needed for getting awakened of the approach of summer typhoon and getting prepared for regional precipitation and torrential downpour. In particular, the weather information based on close photographing is essential to the north which made the increase of agricultural production a priority of the state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLately the Korean Peninsula has suffered from flood owing to the torrential downpour in summer. The north has suffered from flood every year. It is true that this reduced the agricultural output and adversely affected various fields of the north's economy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe north authorities will naturally seek to get rich analysis of the images of approaching weather in the vicinity of the Korean Peninsula to increase the accuracy of the weather forecast.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPolitical Advantage of DPRK's Launch of Working Satellite\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs the DPRK is expected to start launching a working satellite, now is the time to consider the effectiveness of not only a rocket but a satellite. As a matter of fact, from the viewpoint of the DPRK, the system for putting a satellite into space made its debut in 2009 but what is noteworthy of the forthcoming launch is that a working satellite will be launched. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf Kwangmyongsong-3 which the DPRK is supposed to launch is a polar-orbiting meteorological satellite, it is the one for peaceful purposes. To acquire systematic weather information to protect agriculture and key industries from typhoon, torrential rain and draught is a work for a peaceful purpose for improving the living standard of the people in the DPRK. It, therefore, may not result in disturbing the stability in Northeast Asia but contributing to its peace and prosperity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is not persuasive to claim that the north does not require a meteorological satellite though it must be in the south for stabilizing the people's life. As is the case with the south, the U.S. and Japan, the people in the north should do farming, catch fishes in seas and there is no other option for them to sensitively react to the weather conditions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf the projected launch of Kwangmyongsong-3 is a meteorological satellite as it was mentioned by the north in 2009, this will help the people in the north to escape from flood disasters and obtain systematic information about precipitation and thus increase agricultural production."

This announcement surprised the people but the DPRK's assertion has every reason. The international community should observe it with calm and give the DPRK an opportunity of proving its honesty. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe reason for the strong reaction on the sides of the U.S., Japan and south Korea lies not in the type of satellite but in the carrier rocket Unha-3. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAccording to their theory, a rocket has just the same principle as a ballistic missile and it is convertible to a ballistic missile any time. But there is no evidential proof that what the DPRK is going to launch will not be a satellite. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK announced that it would invite world's experienced experts and journalists to the launching station to prove that it is a satellite that it plans to launch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis also reflects the DPRK's sincerity when viewed from another angle. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is the intention of the DPRK to settle disputes by taking note of the world reaction and by increasing transparency. This attitude deepens people's trust that what the DPRK is going to launch may be truly a satellite. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn case the DPRK proves it, this will considerably downplay the reasoning the U.S., Japan and south Korea will make to pressure the DPRK citing the UN \"Resolution\" 1874. It is because the DPRK has refused to accept the UN \"resolution\" and the UN does not have any regulations curbing a sovereign country from launching an earth observation satellite from its own land. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs the DPRK asserts, the U.S., Japan and south Korea launched even spy satellites for military use. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUN \"Resolution\" 1874 offers the DPRK enough reason to chide south Korea where the situation is similar to it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUnder these circumstances, the international community should take time before denouncing the DPRK and shaping a new confrontation policy and take this opportunity to monitor the DPRK so that it may increase transparency and refrain from converting a rocket into an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf the DPRK truly intends to develop the missile, that will aim to defuse the threat coming from afar and survive. This requires the neighboring countries to jointly work to make the DPRK feel safe so that it can refrain from developing ICBM. In particular, those countries hostile to the DPRK are required to study how to dispel mutual hostility. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn fact, whether the DPRK's satellite launch will deteriorate the regional situation or not depends on the response of the U.S., Japan and south Korea. They all benefited from \"missile crises\" of the DPRK in the past. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey developed spy satellite and missile defense system and tried to develop long-range ballistic missile system. This time will be of no exception. In case the U.S., Japan and south Korea strongly respond, the situation will naturally turn worse. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTherefore, parties concerned should wait with calm for the DPRK's publication of the results of the launch. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt present, the DPRK does not seem to cancel the launch plan. So, there is no need to take more hostile approach to the DPRK."
