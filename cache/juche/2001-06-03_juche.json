Inoue of Hokkaido University, Japan, since 1995 before opening to the public on May 30 a \"staff diary\" worked out by the southern logistics command which directed the Japanese army in areas south of Seoul and a photo of rifles used by it in those days.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"staff diary\" which has been preserved in a library under the defence institute of the Japan Defence Agency said the head of the command who directed the quelling of the peasant army men as deputy staff chief of the imperial headquarters of Japan issued an order to \"kill all peasant army men\" on October 27, 1894. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At least 2,000 army men including the 19th battalion under the command conducted wholesale operations to kill peasant army men in Kyonggi, Kyongsang, Chungchong and Jolla provinces from November that year to March 1895. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard, prof. Inoue in a treatise titled \"Japanese army's killing of peasants\" said that the Japanese army's first massacre of civilians in East Asia was committed against peasant army men during the Kapo peasants war. In those days Japan ordered the logistics command of the Japanese army to kill peasant army men though Japan did not declare a war against the Korean government, which is a violation of modern international law, he said.    \r\n\r\n"
