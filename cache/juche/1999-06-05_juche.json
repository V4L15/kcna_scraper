            "content": "U.S. \"operation plan 5027-98\" \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 5 (KCNA) -- The Consultative Council of Former South Korean Politicians in the North for the Promotion of Peaceful Reunification issued a statement on Friday denouncing the U.S. for working hard to realize the \"operation plan 5027-98,\" a new war scenario for aggression.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The statement said:   This anti-north war plan of the U.S. imperialists reveals their intention to make a preemptive attack on the DPRK any moment and has a phase of \"occupying the north and establishing a rule over it\" at the end of the war. This discloses their sinister design to extend their colonial rule over South Korea to the North Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   For the realization of the plan, the U.S. war hawks are waging a test war and a preliminary war for the Korean  war in Yugoslavia whose terrain is similar to Korea by mobilizing sophisticated offensive means and lethal equipment. In the meantime, they are massively deploying U.S. forces and war equipment in and  around South Korea under the pretext of filling up \"vacuum in U.S. forces\" caused by the Yugoslav crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is ceaselessly staging with the South Korean  ruling quarters large-scale war exercises such as \"joint exercise for wartime reinforcement\" and \"river Amnok exercise\" under the simulated conditions of a  surprise preemptive attack against the DPRK.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The statement bitterly denounced  the moves of the U.S. imperialists and their stooges to put the new war scenario \"operation plan 5027-98\" into practice as a grave provocation against the DPRK and an intolerable challenge to the 70 million fellow countrymen who want peace and peaceful reunification of the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the U.S. imperialists and their stooges unleash a war of aggression in defiance of our repeated warnings,  they will be burnt in the flames kindled by them, the statement stressed. \r\n\r\n"

This is  clearly evidenced by the  collapse of socialism in some countries that had flung the door open to the imperialists' ideological and cultural offensive after discarding ideological education.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The lesson  drawn from the collapse of socialism in some countries is that socialism will go to ruin if the ideological education is neglected.\r\n   Therefore, it is of paramount importance to exert efforts to the ideological education. It is a most revolutionary strategy to  foil the imperialists' strategy of \"peaceful transition\" to give a definite precedence  to the ideological work and, on this basis, step up the economic construction. \r\n\r\n"
