            "content": "Spokesman for DPRK Foreign Ministry on Japan's Attitude toward Resumption of Six-Party Talks \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, November 4 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA on Nov. 4 as regards Japan's senseless behavior regarding the resumption of the six-party talks:\r\nAs already reported, bilateral and multi-lateral contacts with main emphasis on the contact between the DPRK and the U.S. took place in Beijing on Oct. 31.  The DPRK, accordingly, decided to return to the six-party talks on the premise that the issue of lifting the financial sanctions would be discussed and settled at an early date between the DPRK and the U.S. within the framework of the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The international community is now unanimous in hailing the agreement on the resumption of the six-party talks, while highly praising the DPRK's invariable stand and sincere efforts for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But it is only Japan that expressed its wicked intention, letting loose with a spate of balderdashes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No sooner had the agreement on the resumption of the six-party talks been made public than the Japanese prime minister, foreign minister, chief cabinet secretary and others are behaving impudently, asserting \"Japan has no idea of accepting north Korea's return to the six-party talks on the premise that it is a nuclear weapons state.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities have thus clearly proved themselves that they are political imbeciles incapable of judging the trend of the situation and their deplorable position. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has never asked Japan to participate in the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, it was displeased with Japan's participation in the six-party talks, but has properly treated it, taking the relations with other participating countries into consideration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the view of the DPRK that since the U.S. attends the six-party talks, there is no need for Japan to participate in them as a local delegate because it is no more than a state of the U.S. and it is enough for Tokyo just to be informed of the results of the talks by Washington. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government, quite new as it is, must have a lot to do internally. It had better, therefore, mind its own business instead of poking its nose into the work of the talks to its inconvenience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It would be much better for Japan to refrain from participating in the six-party talks and less attendants would be not bad for making the talks fruitful.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is an outright perfidy to the north. It is clear to everyone that the exercises will foster distrust and confrontation between the fellow countrymen, bedevil unstable north-south relations and finally bring a war of aggression to this land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities would be well advised to behave themselves, pondering over the serious consequences to be entailed by their reckless saber rattling.

Rodong Sinmun Sunday says this in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people in the DPRK have the pluck and grit to deal a merciless blow at those who dare invade it, the persevering will to build a more prosperous and powerful country despite any vicious moves of the imperialists and the ardent patriotic determination to glorify any thing Korean. This is their lifestyle and fighting spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National self-respect serves as an ideological and mental source of strength to firmly protect the independent stand in all fields of the revolution and construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Every country should build up a driving force to bring about a bright prospect of its national development and achieve prosperity. All countries should solve any problem by themselves and their own way in conformity with the specific conditions of their revolution as they differ from each other in the nature and duties of the revolution, their circumstances and level of their development. This is the spirit for national independence the Korean people have cherished in the practice of the arduous revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no other way for the Korean people but to go in for independence no matter what others may say. This strong faith powerfully encouraged them to firmly establish independence in the revolution and construction, resolutely meeting the war threat of the imperialists, brushing aside the honeyed words of the flunkeyists and standing up against the pressure of great power chauvinists. This has been clearly proved by the history of the socialist construction in the DPRK, the history in which it has firmly adhered to the principle of Juche in ideology, independence in politics, self-support in economy and self-reliance in national defense. National self-respect serves as a mental asset for giving fuller play to the advantages of its nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people dislike following foreign style, dancing to others' tune and lagging behind them. They prefer Korean dances when they dance and love Korean songs when they sing. They create and develop history and culture in the direction of giving fuller play to the advantages of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Songun culture is being created under the great banner of Songun to inject fresh energy into the whole society and the national lifestyle and beautiful manners and customs peculiar to the Koreans have been developed and enriched to meet the need of the present reality. All this helps deepen the Koreans' love for the country and the nation and their will to glorify them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Precisely for this reason they are defying international conventions and agreements which they deem unfavorable to their hegemonic foreign policy and interests and making last-ditch efforts to handle all the issues arising in the international arena through their arbitrary and high-handed acts, while working hard to expand the sphere of their military influence worldwide including the Korean Peninsula, Central Asia and the Middle East and Africa. The above-said frenzy does not show their mightiness but proves that they are tight-cornered. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAt present the U.S. finds itself in a serious crisis at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. reactionary ruling quarters are getting further isolated and rejected by Americans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ever-worsening economic crisis is increasing the toiling masses' discontent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is in the grip of a serious crisis externally. The Bush administration's policy of strength and anti-terror strategy for implementing it are fated to go bankrupt. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world is growing stronger in its voice branding the U.S. as a chieftain of modern international terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The differences and conflict between the U.S. and its allies are growing more serious. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bluff is nothing but its last-ditch effort to get rid of the abyss of ruin.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Their intention is to bring the inter-Korean relations back to the era of confrontation and war, divert the daily mounting anti-U.S. and pro-north spirit in south Korea to pro-U.S. and anti-north one and create an atmosphere favorable for coming to power again with the U.S. backing.

It analyzed and judged everything in the interests of the Korean revolution, not wedded to the ready-made theories and existing formulas, and pushed ahead with the complicated and arduous Korean revolution by its own efforts according to its faith and determination. The WPK and the Korean people have firmly adhered to the stand of Juche and the line of independence, remaining undeterred by all sorts of the opportunist trends such as modern revisionism. They could firmly defend and glorify Korean-style socialism centered on the masses even under the grave situation where socialism collapsed in various countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Party and people have remained true to the independent revolutionary line under the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il, consolidating the socialist position as firm as a rock. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis political might has served as a sure guarantee for defending the sovereignty of the country and the gains of the revolution, successfully advancing the revolution and construction and frustrating the imperialists' moves for aggression and interference. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A strong army is symbolic of the sovereignty and the dignity of the country and the nation and serves as a sure guarantee for ensuring independent politics. Without a powerful army is it impossible to independently settle the issue of the destiny of the country now that the imperialists impose the order based on the jungle law on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is reality today that a country with a weak army is bound to yield to the demand of the imperialists. A powerful army alone makes it possible to steadfastly enforce independent politics and protect the dignity of the country and the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, November 4 (KCNA) -- The Solidarity for Implementing the South-North Joint Declaration reportedly made public a statement titled \"The government authorities and security forces, stop cooking up a spy ring case\" on Oct 28. \r\n Accusing the security authorities of arresting members of the Democratic Workers' Party and other figures one after another and intensifying the suppression of progressive organizations while widening the scope of investigation into them, the statement said that \"spy ring case\", \"case of an organization\", etc. were faked up according to carefully prearranged scenarios whenever a crisis of war brewed and \"election\" was approaching during the past dictatorial regimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This time, too, the security authorities are working hard to eliminate the progressive forces opposed to a war and helping the pro-U.S. conservative forces grab \"power,\" it said, demanding the \"government\" and security authorities stop at once the brutal suppression of the progressive forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the current crackdown develops into a large-scale \"witch-hunting\" operation against the progressive forces, we will never remain a passive onlooker to this, the statement warned, demanding the \"government\" authorities stop at once the bankrupt plot to cook up the \"spy ring case\" and immediately set free the detainees.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Reckless Remarks of S. Korean Military Authorities Assailed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, November 4 (KCNA) -- Some time ago the minister of \"National Defense\" of south Korea at \"the National Assembly inspection of the administration\" cried out that \"it was necessary to readjust the defense policy including the issue of the principal enemy,\" taking issue with the DPRK. The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland issued information bulletin No. 925 Saturday blasting his outcries.\r\n It said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His reckless remarks are a blatant challenge to the desire of the nation for national reconciliation and unity, the country's peace and reunification and the June 15 joint declaration and an intolerable provocation against the DPRK as they brought into bold relief the sinister attempt to bring the north-south relations back to the past era of confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is the principal enemy of the Korean nation as it is wrecking peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and working hard to spark a war.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Improved inter-Korean relations and Korea's peace and reunification are unthinkable as long as the south Korean authorities are whetting their swords for confrontation and war, while contemplating defining the DPRK, part of the same nation and a dialogue partner, as \"their principal enemy.\" To define the DPRK as the \"principal enemy\" precisely means a declaration on scrapping the June 15 joint declaration and standing in confrontation with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean military authorities are now driving the inter-Korean relations to the phase of confrontation and war by swimming against the trend of the June 15 era to support the U.S. in its moves to stifle the DPRK. They will be held wholly responsible for the grave consequences to be entailed by these acts of treachery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should immediately stop the criminal farce of defining the DPRK as \"the principal enemy\" and all other moves for confrontation with the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
