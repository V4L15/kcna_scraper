It is now trying to build the \"SDF\" into an \"army\" and secure a legal and institutional mechanism for the conversion of Japan into a military power and overseas aggression. These are dangerous developments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All this shows that Japan emerges a real war force posing threat to peace in Asia and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should be mindful that the revival of militarism and overseas expansion moves lead to self-destruction and act with discretion.    \r\n\r\n"

The successive Japanese governments tried to keep the criminal germ warfare buried in oblivion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The crimes of the past committed by the Japanese imperialists have not been redressed. the Japanese government is entirely responsible for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government, far from adopting a correct approach to the crimes of the past, has left no stone unturned to cover them up and avoid the redress for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has been the conscience and morality of Japan to allege that the admittance and redress for the crimes of the past mean persecuting itself of its own accord.\r\n The shamelessness of Japan's conscience and morality is based on very dangerous militarism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the Japanese militarists try to repeat a history in which they plunged the Korean peninsula and the vast Asia-Pacific region into the bloodbath by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is owing to the moves of those seeking to repeat a crime-woven history, instead of redressing the past, that Japan loses international confidence and remains the target of precaution of the world people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Japanese government wants to enjoy the confidence of the international community and dignity, it should show its will to honestly reflect on and redress the crimes of the past before anything else.    \r\n\r\n"

This is why no one could bring the DPRK to its knees and block the advance of its revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the magnificent advance to open a new century of history under the leadership of Kim Jong Il, our revolutionary army and people share the same idea and aspiration and have the same destiny and future. The soldiers of the Korean People's Army and people are the revolutionary comrades and comrades-in-arms who share life and death in holding supreme commander Kim Jong Il in high esteem. It is a social trend that the army and the people love and help each other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army-people grand march is a sacred struggle to highly demonstrate the dignity and might of Juche Korea where all the army and the people are united as one around Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The invincible unity of the army and the people is the root of the society and the source of the inexhaustible strength of the powerful nation of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To put into practice the idea of assisting the army and loving the people is a fundamental guarantee to glorify this year as a year of a new surge in building a powerful nation with all the efforts of the army and the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should give full play to the united strength of the army and the people cemented in adversity so as to make overall leaping progress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The kindred unity of the army and the people serves as a powerful instrument of smashing the reckless military pressure and challenge of the imperialists and defending the dignity and sovereignty of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the officers and men of the Korean People's Army and people should strengthen the might of the army-people unity in every way true to the intention of the party and make this significant year a year of the army-people grand march.    \r\n\r\n"

The journalist wished to know about the prospect of the war as the U.S. imperialists were carrying out a large-scale \"new offensive\" at that time.  The journalist saw something quite different from what he had imagined when he entered the room of the general, guided by an official shortly afterward. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The general was looking at something before an operation table and a soldier telling about something beside him. The journalist was surprised to hear from the official that the general was talking to the soldier expected to study in a foreign country for postwar rehabilitation. The journalist asked the official to permit him to leave the room without any word. The former said in an excited tone to the latter that he had already finished his news coverage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One day in Juche 47 (1958), President Kim Il Sung visited his uncle's house to meet his grandmother. At that time he asked about a new house near the house. An official told him that a new house was built for his uncle's family members as they had lived in an old one storeyed house. The president said in a serious tone that any property of the people and country should not be wasted for any private purpose and even his family should not be an exception. He instructed that the house should be used for other purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Officials had no alternative but to carry out his instruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It happened in one winter day of Juche 39 (1950) when the general was on his return trip to the supreme command from his inspection of the front. The general told his chauffer to stop the car all of a sudden before a sentry post and got down from the car. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The general approached the soldier on sentry duty and asked him if he could stand such a cold weather before closely examining his uniform. The conditions at that time were so hard and complicated that winter caps could not be supplied to the soldiers on time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The general told his adjutant to bring his own fur cap and gloves from the car and give them to the soldier. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After a while, the sentry leader was quite surprised to see the soldier on duty wearing the supreme commander's cap when he came to him with others to relieve sentry.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
