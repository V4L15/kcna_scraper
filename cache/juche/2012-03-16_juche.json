He, at the same time, energetically led the effort for carrying it out.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The report said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to the heroic effort of the builders, the projects for building two breakwaters extending nearly 2 000 meters were completed in a matter of less than two years, though they would have taken more than a decade at an ordinary pace and overall construction projects including the wharf and main building of the port have been carried out 95 percent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The port construction which started on July 29, 2009 reminded one of a big battle from its outset.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A marine route was explored in a brief span of time for transporting construction materials and large-scale blasting conducted more than ten times to secure stones and earth in large quantities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The projects of the northern and southern breakwaters which account for 60 percent of the port construction made a big progress. As a result, the structures of breakwaters, each extending hundreds of meters, made their appearances in a matter of a little over three months.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The introduction of more than one hundred new methods of port construction including the application of framed groundwork structures made it possible to raise the speed of building breakwaters more than five times, ten times at maximum, as compared with that in the past and wind them up as of August last year ahead of schedule.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Overall construction projects including breakwaters, wharfs and the building of facilities made headway in a three dimensional manner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The projects for the construction of wharfs Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 extending much more than a thousand meters and the work for paving the ground for cargo covering tens of thousands of square meters were finished in a short span of time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Rails were laid for port cranes and an observation deck, a bridge and a huge cargo storehouse constructed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The appearance of the port has changed beyond recognition with the construction of two breakwaters stretching far into deep waters of the East Sea, vast wharfs, modern buildings and its afforested compound reminiscent of a big park.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The builders are now putting increased spurs to completing the port construction at a high level."
