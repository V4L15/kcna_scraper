            "content": "South Side to Blame for Incident at Mt. Kumgang Resort \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 12 (KCNA) -- A south Korean who came to tour Mt. Kumgang was shot to death by a servicewoman of the Korean People's Army at around 4:50 a.m. on July 11. A spokesman for the Guidance Bureau for Comprehensive Development of Scenic Spots issued a statement on Saturday in this regard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK feels regretful at this, the statement notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for the cause of the incident, it occurred because the south Korean tourist trespassed on the area under the military control of the north side, going beyond the tourist zone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A particular mention should be made of the fact that the south Korean tourist intruded deep into the area under the military control of the north side all alone at dawn, going beyond the clearly marked boundary fence, even her shoes got wet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When a KPA servicewoman spotted her and ordered her to stop, she did not obey the order but began to run away. She kept running although the KPA servicewoman repeatedly shouted at her to stop, even firing blank bullets. The KPA servicewoman could not but open fire at her. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The responsibility for the incident entirely rests with the south side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south side should be held responsible for the incident, make clear apology to the north side and take measures against the recurrence of the similar incident. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the south side authorities unilaterally announced that they would suspend the tour of Mt. Kumgang for the time being, a challenge to the north side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As it is an intolerable insult to the north side, it will take a measure not to accept south Korean tourists until the south side makes proper apology for the recent incident and takes measures against the recurrence of such incident. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the cause of the incident is very clear and the north side has already confirmed the scene of the incident together with personnel of the Hyundai side right after its occurrence, it cannot accept the south side's proposal for inspecting the area of the north side for investigation. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Aggression and war are the imperialists' mode of existence. They pave the way for the imperialists' unlimited plunder and accumulation of wealth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the imperialists' way of thinking and theory of existence that their escalation of the war of aggression against other countries would make them richer and enable them to wallow in luxury. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists' greed precisely means aggression and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The course covered by the imperialists means a history of aggression and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The two world wars which recorded unforgettable tragedies in the human history in the past century clearly prove that imperialists are the worst enemy of mankind and the most brutal war force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists perpetrated brigandish wars of aggression against the progressive countries, socialist countries in different parts of the world by beginning with the Korean war in the 1950s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are resorting to more vicious and crafty methods to realize their brigandish ambition for aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are becoming more crafty and vicious in their methods to perpetrate aggression and plunder under the changed situation and amidst the trend of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists make no scruple of perpetrating brigandish aggression and military intervention against the sovereign countries under the signboards of the \"establishment of a democratic order\", \"defence of human rights\" and \"guarantee of peace\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If there be any change in the imperialists, it is not their aggressive nature but the more crafty and vicious methods of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Independence and peace do not come of themselves. They can be achieved only through a relentless struggle against the aggressor forces, concludes the article. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
