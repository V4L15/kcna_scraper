This is the most brilliant one of the immortal exploits performed by him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK has adorned the arduous years of the revolution in the 20th century with proud victories holding President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il in high esteem.      It is confidently steering the 21st century with its invincible might. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The party enjoys high dignity and authority as a party leading the new century. It is entirely attributable to the fact that it has Kim Jong Il at its head. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The party is a dignified party whose members are armed with the idea of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His revolutionary idea is a successor to the revolutionary idea of Kim Il Sung and a perfect idea making it possible to achieve the independence of the popular masses century after century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Prevailing throughout the party today is his revolutionary idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK is a party around which the revolutionaries of Juche type, who absolutely follow his idea and are fully armed with it, are single-heartedly united. It is a party which holds fast to his idea as its lifeline and struggles going through thick and thin to put it into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK is an invincible party that thoroughly applies his politics in all fields of the revolution and construction, the editorial notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our party is praised as a great party leading the revolutionary advance in the 21st century to victory for his army-first politics, in particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army represents the party in Korea. The army-first political mode of the WPK perfected and tested under the seasoned leadership of Kim Jong Il will remain unchanged no matter how the situation may change. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK is a dynamic party that does everything in a fresh and innovative manner as required by the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK today has a bright future as it has features as a party leading the revolutionary struggle in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK confidently steering the Juche-oriented revolution inspires all the people to win new victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the general task and consistent line of our party building to hold president Kim Il Sung in high esteem for all ages and to strengthen the WPK as an eternal party of Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The editorial calls for holding Kim Jong Il in high esteem with intense loyalty, glorifying the immortal feats performed by him in the party building generation after generation and wholeheartedly upholding his army-first politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also underscores the need to dynamically accelerate the socialist construction under the party's leadership and thus build up powerful state economic potential commensurate with the 21st century, the new era of the army-first revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson calls upon all the working people to vigorously accelerate the socialist advance of the red flag under the leadership of the WPK rallied close around Kim Jong Il and thus build a powerful socialist nation at an early date and successfully accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
