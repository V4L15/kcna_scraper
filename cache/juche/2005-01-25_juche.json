            "content": "KCNA Slams Plot Hatched by Japan against DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 24 (KCNA) -- The Korean Central News Agency issued a memorandum Monday disclosing before the public at home and abroad the truth about the \"results of examination\" of the remains of Japanese woman Megumi\r\nYokota, a plot hatched by Japan against the DPRK, on the basis of the materials analyzed by the Ministry of People's Security and forensic pathologists, authorized by the DPRK government.\r\n The memorandum says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ultra-right wing forces and political heavyweights of Japan are fanning up an atmosphere of confrontation with the DPRK, crying out for introducing a \"bill on north Korean human rights\" and applying sanctions against it. The Japanese government has totally ignored the sincere efforts made by the DPRK to confirm the whereabouts of those Japanese whose fate it claimed \"unknown\" and their results and suspended the humanitarian aid it had already promised. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring in detail to how the remains of Megumi Yokota were examined in Japan, the memorandum dismisses the results of the examination as a sheer fabrication because there are too many doubts as to the \"objective and correct results of examination\" the Japanese government claimed conducted by the most competent research institution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The memorandum continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The first doubt is that the Police Science Institute failed to get results of a DNA test but Teikyo College succeeded in obtaining them though both of them were entrusted to examine the same pieces of bones. One may call the \"results of the examination\" by Teikyo College a \"miracle\" but it is hard to believe that \"the results\" claiming the remains of one person were those of \"two persons\" are scientific. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters here is that the Japanese government regarded only the \"results of DNA test\" conducted by Teikyo College as absolute without scientifically clarifying the reason why the Police Science Institute failed to get results of the DNA test despite the fact that the institute with a long history and rich experience has been engaged in examination with the world's latest equipment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In case the results of the examination made by one of the two different research institutions of the same object are held absolute, they should be considered as ones lacking scientific nature and objective validity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The second doubt is the method applied to examine the remains. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dead bodies are usually cremated at the temperature of 1,200 degrees C on an average in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Teikyo College claimed it made a DNA test of bones by the method of collecting cells from the remains which were burnt at the high temperature of 1,200 degrees C and cultivating and increasing them. This is hard to believe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The third doubt is that the results of analysis given in the \"report on the DNA test\" made by Teikyo College of her remains are incoherent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The base composition of nucleotide which consists of DNA of the remains of one person should appear in the same form. But it is strange that the composition appeared in three forms and a bone chip among them is analyzed as a mixture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If one is forced to accept such results of examination of the remains, one should regard the remains as those of three or more persons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But this is also contradictory to Japan's conclusion that the remains are not Megumi Yokota's but \"bones of two other persons.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Particularly the results of the first and the second analysis of the fifth bone are different from each other. One cannot but conclude that there was a plot from outside as they are quite contradictory to each other from a scientific point of view. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"test report\" of the college noted it is clear that \"the fifth bone is within the analysis limit and posed a problem as regards its regenerative nature\". This tells that it cannot scientifically guarantee the \"results of the examination.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIf such a sensitive test was made of the remains burnt at the high temperature of 1,200 degrees C to extract DNA from them, there should have been a DNA test of those who handled the remains with their hands while examining substance on the surface of bone chips. But this was not done. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis fact poses not a few questions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This, in the final analysis, makes one draw a conclusion that it was a deliberate move to get the credibility of the \"examination\" recognized or an intelligence agency or a specified organ and person might intentionally provided bones of other persons to the college for examination when they found it impossible to extract DNA from the remains of Megumi Yokota. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are also questions as to the procedures and forms of the examination of the remains. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government is talking about \"probe\", asserting that the \"test report\" without mentioning names of witnesses, names of analysts and seals of the institutions that conducted the analysis is one on \"objective scientific test.\" This can not but be a grave insult to the DPRK. \r\n All the facts go to clearly prove that the \"results of the examination\" of the remains publicized by Japan are a fabrication made by ultra-right wing forces strongly opposed to the DPRK and dishonest persons to attain their political purpose in league with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese side took the remains to Tokyo and displayed them in a hall in Minato ward, Tokyo Metropolis, before launching a smear campaign against the DPRK, asserting that the DPRK unearthed and deliberately cremated the remains in a bid to make it impossible to test them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Worse still, the Japanese side said in the DPRK that it \"felt grateful to it and would like to accept the remains as a token of sincerity\", but as soon as it went back it sent to the DPRK even a document to the effect that \"there was no evidence to support the explanation of the DPRK side and the Japanese government strongly protests against the DPRK's unacceptable and insincere response\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan faked up not only the results of the examination of the remains of Megumi Yokota but took the fingerprint, cutaneous sebum, cell, etc. of her husband and negated even the relations between him and his daughter by resorting to the despicable and conspiratorial method, something unprecedented in diplomatic usage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality patently proves that Japan is so untrustworthy that one cannot be on good terms with it as it claims the dead to be alive, negates the kinship between the father and his daughter and cooks up false remains. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has refused to recognize that the issue of abduction had already been settled, faking up even the results of the examination of the remains and totally negated the sincere efforts made by the DPRK, driving the bilateral relations to the worst phase of confrontation. By doing so Japan seeks to use the issue of the abduction as a subterfuge to evade the liquidation of its past under the pretext of \"sentiment of the people\", a leverage to isolate the DPRK internationally and a good means for attaining its political aim and even for money-making. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter how hard Japan may work to attain its political purpose by resorting to the despicable method of making profound confusing of right and wrong, it can never evade the responsibility for having faked up the results of the examination of the remains of Megumi Yokota and damaged the image of the DPRK. Japan should bear this in mind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the Japanese government insisted that the remains it received are not Megumi Yokota's, it should return them in their original state as demanded by the DPRK more than once, thoroughly probe the truth about the faked results of the examination and sternly punish those responsible for it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This principle of peaceful national reunification has been invariably maintained by leader Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il in his famous work \"Let Us Carry Out the Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung's Instructions for National Reunification\" reclarified that differences of ideology and system between the north and the south of Korea cannot be removed by force and that peaceful reunification is the WPK's principled stand and unchanged line. \r\n In the light of the urgent demand of the Korean nation for peace and peaceful reunification and the realistic conditions in which the different ideologies and systems exist in the north and the south, the best way of realizing national reunification in a peaceful way is to establish a national unified state of federal formula based on one nation and one state, two systems and two governments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the verification of the vitality, scientific accuracy and realistic character of a proposal for reunification of federal formula to have agreed in the historic June 15 joint declaration to go toward reunification in the direction of keeping the commonness of the north-proposed low-level federation and the south-proposed commonwealth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK's revolutionary will to prevent the danger of aggression and war and defend peace in the Korean Peninsula is represented by the Songun politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun politics of the WPK is the politics of defending peace which deters a war in the Korean Peninsula and guarantees the peace of the country and the dignity and security of the whole nation and the treasured sword of justice which mercilessly punishes those aggressors who infringe upon the sovereignty and vital rights of the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Thanks to his new idea of land rezoning and wise guidance, the leftovers of feudal land ownership have been totally cleared away and the paddy and non-paddy fields turned into large-scale standardized fields and fields suitable for machine farming so that the vitality of collective economy can be displayed to the full in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His idea of land rezoning represents the stand of the Workers' Party of Korea to convert all the fields into standardized ones and carry out comprehensive mechanization and thus free the peasants from difficult and labor-consuming work, indicates the truth that the reserves for increased crop production lay in land rezoning under the natural and geographical conditions of the country and shows a scientific way of solving the food problem in a short time with less labor. \r\n With the realization of his idea and policy of land rezoning, passivism was overcame in land leveling and a definite prospect opened for energetically carrying out the mechanization of farming and acquiring more new land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This idea is a unique idea as it newly expounds the outstanding position of land rezoning in shaping the destiny of the popular masses and bringing prosperity to the country and a great banner for completely changing the land of socialist Korea on an overall scale as required by the historic era of the building of a great prosperous powerful nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Its plottage covers 125 square meters, five to seven times that of other houses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is catching the eyes of people is that many relics were unearthed there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are more than 200 earthenware pieces of various kinds and sizes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Among them are 11 jars over 60 centimeters high. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An extra-large jar was unearthed in the western part of the ruined house. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIts mouth is 58.3 cm in diameter and its height 91 cm. It is the biggest one of its kind belonging to the primitive and ancient times discovered in the country. It still preserves its original shape. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Among the remains from the ruined house are seven broken large grinding stones used for husking and powdering grain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One of them is 48 cm long, 32 cm wide and 15cm thick. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The grinding stones are indicative of simultaneous grain processes and the then fairly developed agricultural production at that time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Archaeologists say that, in the light of its size and shape, the ruined house was not a dwelling house but a building used for public purpose and built more than 6,000 years ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has been hardly seen until now that many remains of various kinds were discovered in a ruined house as in No. 89. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The newly discovered historic relics and remains serve as precious historic materials reflecting the developed culture of the Pyongyang area in the period of the Neolithic era.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
