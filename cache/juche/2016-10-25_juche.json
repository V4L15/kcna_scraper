Now with the tenure of his office almost running out he is still spewing out invective against the DPRK, not discarding his bad habit. This is nothing but a rubbish of the guy who has become helpless in the face of the total bankruptcy of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Obama group including Kerry is a herd of illegal gangsters as they overthrew by force the legitimate governments of sovereign states and killed tens of thousands of innocent people in different parts of the world for the mere reason that they courted displeasure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But for the U.S. ruled by such ignorant political hooligans as Kerry, the world would have become a pacific place better to live. This is the unanimous comment of the overwhelming majority of the world people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how desperately the Obama group may work to brand the DPRK as illegal, it will not undermine the strategic position of the DPRK which is demonstrating its dignity and might all over the world with the might of the single-minded unity and tremendous national power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will dynamically advance along the road already chosen by itself no matter what Kerry may say."
