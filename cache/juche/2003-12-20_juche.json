            "content": "S. Korean Authorities' Suppression of Reunification Organizations Denounced \r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 19 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the North Headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification (Pomminryon) on December 18 issued a statement denouncing the present south Korean authorities claiming to be \"a government for people\" for their harsh crackdown on the righteous struggle of the organizations of the reunification movement and workers by invoking the \"Security Law\", an outdated leftover of the military dictatorship.\r\n Recalling that the south Korean fascist authorities have resorted to a premeditated crackdown on the South Headquarters of Pomminryon and other organizations of the reunification movement after groundlessly labeling them as \"pro-north\" and \"enemy-benefiting\" ones, the statement says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have of late become all the more undisguised in their suppression of the student movement by faking up the \"Ajou University incident\" in the wake of a trial of the chairman of the General Student Council of Keimyung University who is a member of the Central Committee of the south Korean Federation of University Student Councils (Hanchongryon), linking them with the north. And they have kicked up a wholesale repressive campaign arresting ten odd persons under the cloak of \"ferreting out forces behind Hanchongryon\" and arresting forces of the reunification movement including the secretary general of the Reunification Solidarity and the former chairman of the South Headquarters of Pomminryon on charges of violation of the \"Security Law\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, the \"Legislation and Judiciary Committee of the National Assembly\" passed a revised \"Law on Assembly and Demonstration\" which bans assemblies and demonstrations on main roads and around schools and military setups in an effort to hold down more strictly the anti-U.S. struggle and actions for democratic freedom and rights by the organizations of the reunification movement and the labor movement and civic organizations. Such suppression is an anti-national, anti-reunification criminal act of negating the June 15 joint declaration and getting on the nerves of the other side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To cry over \"pro-north\" and \"enemy-benefiting\" acts even today when the north and the south committed themselves to reconciliation, unity and reunification is a mockery and perfidy to the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present era is the historic June 15 era when reconciliation, cooperation and reunification are being carried to materilisation in accordance with the idea of \"By our nation itself\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean fascist authorities should look straight into the reality and act with discretion and unconditionally and immediately set free the unreasonably arrested persons. The North Headquarters of Pomminryon will as ever dynamically wage the nationwide action to defend the independence and dignity of the nation and achieve the peace of the country and its peaceful reunification by pooling efforts with the people of all social strata in south Korea including the organizations of the reunification movement.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

But the amount of its illicit money reached 60 billion won, counting only that disclosed in the course of the prosecution's investigation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The alarming financial scam of the GNP was aimed to seize power in a bid to execute the U.S. policy of domination over south Korea on the spot. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This party, however, failed in the last \"presidential election\" and its former President Ri Hoe Chang was forced to quit the political arena. This was an inevitable result of the acts of treachery committed by the party, estranged from the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At a time when south Korea was hard hit by a sudden typhoon, leaving more than 130 people dead or wounded and many people homeless, Choe Pyong Ryol, representative of the GNP, went to the U.S. utterly indifferent to this disaster. There he promised his American master to work hard for south Korea's dispatch of combat troops to Iraq as requested by the U.S. and cried out for imposing sanctions upon the north and pressurizing it irrespective of the six-way talks. It is tragedy and disgrace that there exists in south Korea the GNP represented by Choe Pyong Ryol who has worked hard to please his American master in quest of power in disregard of the fate of the people in south Korea and compatriots in the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP has always placed the outside forces above the nation and unhesitatingly betrayed the sovereignty and dignity of the Korean nation to meet the demand and interests of the outside forces. Such traitorous nature of the GNP can never change as long as it stays. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The poisonous herb should be rooted out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people should liquidate the GNP, the group of sycophantic traitors.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"

The present reality of south Korea is not different from that when it was under the military fascist dictatorship, says Minju Joson today in a signed commentary.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The authorities arrested 45 students for the mere reason that they did not bolt the south Korean Federation of University Student Councils (Hanchongryon) although they called for the legalization of the organization in the early days of their office. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn the past eleven months the security authorities arrested at least 8,260 workers and farmers and took 340 of them into custody, labeling their struggle for the right to existence as \"illegal group violence.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These facts go to clearly prove that the present regime has harshly cracked down upon the struggle of the pro-reunification movement organizations and workers and farmers in south Korea on charges of the violation of the \"Security Law\", a leftover of the era of confrontation, although it styled itself a \"government for people\" after the regime change early this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits serious attention is that they cited the DPRK as a pretext for their suppression of the people demanding national reunification and the right to existence.\r\n This can not but be a criminal act against the nation and reunification as it is in violation of the June 15 joint declaration and provocation to their dialogue partner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities will never escape a ruin if they keep suppressing the people and inciting north-south confrontation, swimming against the trend of the times when the compatriots are heading for reconciliation, cooperation and independent reunification under the banner of \"By our nation itself.\"    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
