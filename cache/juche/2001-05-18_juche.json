This is adversely affecting the situation in the Asia-Pacific and the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration's new plan to create the task force against the DPRK is one more provocative war move to further strain the situation on the Korean peninsula, spark a chain arms race and check the national reconciliation and unity between the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a clear indication that the Bush administration is only keen to realize its ambition to dominate the world by \"force\" although it talks about \"strategic stability\" and \"peace\" in the world and pretends to be interested in improving the relations between the DPRK and the U.S. and between the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people and the army of the DPRK will further heighten vigilance against the U.S. preparations for a war, a threat to its sovereignty and security, and counter the aggressors' provocation with a strong measure for self-defence.    \r\n\r\n"

Yet, the Japanese ruling quarters meekly accepted the U.S. demand without any objection. This clearly shows that the U.S.-Japan alliance is an out-and-out master-servant relationship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Armitage's request came at a time when the Japanese reactionaries are working hard to revise the constitution for a legal guarantee for overseas expansion. This is little short of adding fuel to flames. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States urges Japan to play the role of a shock brigade in carrying out its strategy for world domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is in line with the interests of the Japanese reactionaries so keen on overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For this reason the united states has covertly supported Japan in its moves to revise its constitution and is now openly pressurizing Japan to amend it.    \r\n\r\n"
