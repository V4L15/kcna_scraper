            "content": "KCNA on ill-intentioned remarks of ex-U.S.Secretary of Defence \r\n  Pyongyang, October 19 (KCNA) -- Former U.S. Secretary of Defence William Perry told a press conference that \"there is great possibility that underground facilities under construction in North Korea might be nuclear reactors and that they would be completed in four to five years,\" reported the Japanese Nihon Keizai Shimbun October 16.\r\n   Nowadays, clamourings about \"suspected underground nuclear facilities\" are often made by U.S. conservative hardliners.\r\n   Theirs are no more than groundless allegations.\r\n   We once again make it clear that \"secret underground nuclear facilities\" are none other than civilian underground structures on which any \"doubt\" cannot be cast.\r\n   We openly say that we have constructed a large number of civilian underground structures in all parts of the country.\r\n   Nevertheless, U.S. conservative hardliners, branding them as \"underground nuclear facilities,\" insist that the structures should be inspected. Theirs is a brigands logic infringing upon our sovereignty, motivated by a sinister purpose to disarm the DPRK.\r\n   If the U.S. side persists in inspecting our underground structures, we can show them to it. However, if they prove to be civilian structures, the U.S. side must compensate for its aspersions on the DPRK.\r\n   What it seeks in its allegation is to brand the DPRK as a \"breaker\" of the framework agreement.\r\n   This is like a guilty party filing the suit first.\r\n   Up to date, the United States has not fully implemented points of the DPRK-U.S. framework agreement. Worse still, U.S. conservative hardliners are insisting that the agreement be broken.\r\n   We cannot pardon the attempts of the United States to brand us as a \"breaker\" of the agreed framework.\r\n   The United States had better mind their own business instead of finding faults with others. \r\n\r\n"

We also informed the Japanese side of the result of  our sincere investigation into the missing Japanese in response to the request from Japan.\r\n   The right-wing reactionaries of Japan, however, persist in taking issue with us over a few Japanese who disappeared in their country. Their anti-DPRK diatribe goes only to bring into bolder relief their political and moral inferiority and shamelessness.\r\n   Japan is not entitled to say this or that about such a crime as abduction. During the colonial rule over Korea the Japanese imperialists took away nearly six million of the Korean young and middle-aged men and killed more than one million of Koreans in cold blood.\r\n   Japan, infamous with abduction, is kicking up a racket with the groundless  \"suspicion\" of its own making ignorant of its lot. The racket reminds people of a thief crying \"stop thief \"\r\n   The right-wing reactionaries of Japan must refrain from raising a hue and cry over the \"suspicion of abduction\" and atone for the thrice-cursed crimes committed against the Korean people. \r\n\r\n"

A protocol on fishing was signed at the 11th session of the DPRK-Russia Joint Fishing Committee in October last year.\r\n   Russia's approval for the DPRK's fishing is a matter belonging to the independent rights of the DPRK and Russia.\r\n   Underlying the Japanese authorities' row against the DPRK's  fishing  is their dishonest attempt to create favourable circumstances under which they can take over the four Kuril islands from Russia and fish in troubled waters by driving a wedge between the DPRK and Russia.\r\n   The DPRK does not pardon  anyone who tries to undermine its dignity and interest.\r\n   If the Japanese authorities want things to go well, they should sit calm. Such an imprudent row will bring no good to them. \r\n\r\n"

Korea\r\n   Pyongyang, October 19 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK today made public a statement in connection with the fact that the United States, together with South Korea, plans to stage another large-scale joint military exercise under simulated conditions of \"emergency on the Korean peninsula\" from October 24 to November 2.\r\n   The military exercise will involve the U.S. armed forces present in South Korea and Japan, the South Korean Army, aircraft carriers and other warships and huge military hardware. The United States will reportedly command military operations on blue ridge, the flagship of the U.S. 7th Fleet  anchoring at the Yokosuka Base in Japan.\r\n   The planned joint military exercise is a very dangerous move to unleash another war against the DPRK at any cost by finally completing military preparations to stifle the DPRK. \r\nThis is also a wanton and shameless violation of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement and agreed framework, the spokesman said.\r\n   He continued:\r\n   The fact that the military exercise will be commanded in Japan and it will include a series of mock drills simulating \"DPRK's launch of ballistic missiles\"  fully shows that the United States has rapidly pushed ahead at a full-scale practical stage with its design to militarily contain the DPRK by inveigling Japan into its military system for unified and mobile U.S.-Japan-South Korea military actions.\r\n   The reckless military exercise will be staged around the third \"four-way talks\" to be resumed in Geneva. \r\nThis fact  shows that the United States does not want to abandon its policy of \"strength\"  against the DPRK and that the \"four-way talks\" and other negotiations are nothing but a smokescreen to cover up its arms buildup and war preparations.\r\n   The Korean people will not be frightened or made hesitant by threats and blackmail by the United States and its stooges.\r\n   If the U.S. warmaniacs finally ignite a war of aggression against the DPRK, the Korean people will deal  sledge-hammer blows at the aggressors. \r\n\r\n"
