Then a strong strike of fire was given to an island of the \"enemy\" who were taking desperate counteraction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whenever the artillerymen hit targets, Kim Jong Un expressed his great satisfaction, saying that they were very good at the concentration of fire and such shell-fire would remove the enemy island totally.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the drill he reviewed its results and referred to the defects to be rectified by the artillery units. And he set forth the tasks and ways for further perfecting the Juche-based artillery tactics in conformity with the country's natural and topographical conditions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that he defined in detail the procedure of strike at objects on the enemy islands and its density, he said the drill clearly showed that the artillerymen of the 4th Corps defending the southwestern front are ready to throw the enemies into a crucible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The KPA should totally remove formalism in the military training and conduct actual drills under various conditions of modern warfare so frequently, and it should always be in readiness to go into action and perform its duty immediately once the Supreme Commander gives orders in any time and under any circumstances, he stressed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that the entire army should make their training more intensive, as the anti-Japanese guerrillas did in Mt. Paektu, to prepare all the soldiers as stalwart combatants and turn all units into an iron-willed guards unit and thus bring the anti-U.S. confrontation to the final conclusion by crushing the enemies promptly in case they pounce upon the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Present to watch the drill were commanding officers of KPA large combined units."

Korea's SL Denounced as Evil Law Violating Human Rights\r\nPyongyang, February 21 (KCNA) -- The DPRK Measure Council for Human Rights in South Korea made public an inquiry report on Saturday to disclose before the world the fascist nature of the \"Security Law\" and the shuddering human rights abuses committed by the successive south Korean puppet forces by invoking the evil law.\n\t\t\t\t\t The SL of south Korea is the worst fascist law unprecedented in world history, the inquiry report says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was cooked up by traitor Syngman Rhee on Dec. 1, 1948 to suppress and stamp out progressive figures and other people of south Korea who stood against the pro-U.S. dictatorial regime. It was made up of hideous poisonous articles unprecedented in world legislative history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the most unpopular and reactionary law that was modeled after the colonial suppressive ruling methods used by the imperialists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is just the repetition of \"the Maintenance of the Public Order Act\" which the Japanese imperialists invoked to maintain their colonial ruling system and suppress the Korean people's movement for national liberation against the Japanese during their rule over Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"The Maintenance of the Public Order Act\" which the Japanese imperialists enacted to suppress the communist movement inside Japan in April 1925 was an ill-famed law also in Japan's history of legislation. Provided for in the law were punishment up to death sentence to those who were involved in organization of association or who acceded to it and discussed or agitated the execution of the goal of association with an aim at the \"change of state\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The SL was exactly same as \"the Maintenance of the Public Order Act\" in the light of the objective of its institution, the scope and objects of its application and punishment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The evil law was coercively cooked up by the south Korean puppet clique at the instigation of the U.S. for its colonial rule over south Korea after its illegal entry to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the time of fabrication, the SL was a provisional one as neither \"criminal law\" nor \"criminal procedure code\" was in force in south Korea. It, therefore, should have been repealed after the September 1953 institution of the criminal law and the September 1954 enactment of the criminal procedure code in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No wonder, the majority of the then \"National Assemblymen\" opposed the SL and even the first president of the puppet Supreme Court Kim Pyong Ro held that \"many problems will arise in terms of legislation if criminal law is instituted without abolishing the Security Law\". But Syngman Rhee maintained the evil law under the patronage of the U.S., using it as a means for his dictatorial rule.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The SL is undemocratic and inhuman law violating even the elementary right of human being.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The SL was empowered to the indefinite violation of elementary rights of people on charges of \"endangering the existence and security of state and basic order of freedom and democracy.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The anti-human rights and unethical nature of the SL is that it is blocking the national reconciliation, unity and reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The SL brands the DPRK and organizations of overseas compatriots as \"anti-government ones\" and totally antagonizes the compatriots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its articles contain such words of antagonizing the fellow countrymen as \"anti-government organizations\" and \"their members\" and even label the DPRK an \"enemy.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The SL is also wantonly checking the free visits, contacts and dialogue between the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the fascist atrocities the south Korean puppet group have perpetrated by invoking the SL constitute the height of crimes against humanity and human rights, the inquiry report cites detailed facts to prove them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since Park Geun Hye took office, the SL has gotten ferocious, the report notes, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group is openly pushing ahead with the revision of the SL for the worse, which even traitor Lee Myung Bak dared not do, being hell-bent on fascist suppression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During her early days in office, Park said sheer sophism that \"the May 16 military coup was an inevitable and best choice\". She has resorted to anachronistic fascist dictatorial rule after letting such remnants of \"yusin\" as Kim Ki Chun, Hwang Kyo An and Nam Jae Jun hold important posts of the secretariat of Chongwadae, the ministry of Justice and the Intelligence Service. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In February 2013, the first year of her office, she sponsored the farce of a fascist trial against Ro Su Hui who had visited Pyongyang to express condolences over the greatest loss to the nation, which sentenced him to four-year imprisonment and suspension of qualification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In October that year her group branded the Teachers Union, a typical progressive organization, as a \"heart of followers of the north\", \"enemy in the country\" that had taken the lead in the \"pro-north\" activities and deprived the union of its legitimate status. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Moreover, in December it hurled 5 000 fascist policemen into storming the headquarters of the south Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and arresting more than 130 including its vice-chairman.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group, in a bid to suppress the Unified Progressive Party which had acted as a legitimate progressive political party, cooked up a conspiratorial rebellion case and put a lawmaker from the party into custody in broad daylight.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On December 19, it let the puppet judicial authorities forcibly dissolve the UPP after branding it as a \"political party following the north\" and termed it a \"historic option that firmly protected the liberal democracy.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Early this year, the puppet group made an investigation into the Bar Association for Democratic Society, a progressive organization in south Korean judicial circles, openly revealing its sinister attempt to totally stamp out the progressive forces by invoking the SL, in actuality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Branding even peaceable demonstrations and rallies as \"operations of the pro-north left-wing forces to overthrow the government\", the puppet group arrested and put into custody personages of progressive organizations after branding them as backstage manipulators and suppressed them at random.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has also mercilessly violated the freedom of speech, press and expression by applying the SL.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In south Korea, there does not exist the freedom of criticizing the \"government\" and its confrontational policy, even though there may exist the freedom of defending the regime and slandering the fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Therefore, not only south Koreans from all walks of life but the international community strongly demand the abolition of the SL and even Americans maintain that the SL must be abolished in the light of human rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the Park Geun Hye group made up of matchless human rights abusers and fascist dictators is keen on retrogressively revising the SL, far from repealing it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is ridiculous for those human rights abusers to talk such rubbish as \"human rights issue\" of someone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park Geun Hye group had better face up to the trend of the times, immediately abolish the SL and stop the \"human rights racket\" against the DPRK."

el dia 21 una informacion de investigacion con el fin de revelar la verdad fascista y anti-derechos humanos de la \"ley de seguridad\" y los crimenes atroces de violacion de DDHH cometidos por la banda titere surcoreana en virtud de esta ley infame.\n\t\t\t\t\tLa \"ley de seguridad\" del Sur de Corea es la peor fascista sin precedente y la infame de exterminio de DDHH, critica la informacion y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa \"ley de seguridad\" fue fabricada el primero de diciembre de 1948 por el traidor Syngman Rhee con el fin de reprimir y exterminar la lucha de las personalidades progresistas del Sur de Corea contra el \"poder\" dictatorial proyanqui.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta compuesta por los venenosos articulos anti-DDHH sin precedente en la historia de legislacion del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn primer lugar, la \"ley de seguridad\" es la  mas antipopular y reaccionaria que repite el metodo de gobernacion represiva colonial del imperialismo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImito la \"ley de mantenimiento de seguridad publica\" que despues de ocupar Corea, los imperialistas japoneses aplicaron para mantener el sistema de dominacion colonial y reprimir el movimiento del pueblo coreano por la liberacion nacional antijaponesa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn abril de 1925 los imperialistas japoneses la instituyeron con el fin de reprimir el movimiento comunista en el pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa ley estipula castigar hasta la pena capital en cuanto a la organizacion de asociacion y el ingreso en ella, la consulta y la agitacion  encaminadas a realizar su objetivo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa \"ley de seguridad\" la fabrico por la fuerza Estados Unidos que ocupo ilegalmente el Sur de Corea despues de la liberacion de Corea, incitando a la banda titere surcoreana para su gobernacion colonial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEra la ley provisional establecida bajo la circunstancia en que en el Sur de Corea todavia no fueron instituidos el \"codigo penal\" ni la \"ley de procedimiento penal\", razon por la cual se debia anular merecidamente despues de establecidas susodichas leyes en septiembre de 1953 y en septiembre de 1954.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor lo tanto, en aquel tiempo la mayoria de los parlamentarios se opuso a la \"ley de seguridad\" y el primer presidente de la Corte Suprema titere, Kim Pyong Ro, tambien abogo por la cancelacion de esa ley diciendo que \"si instituye el codigo penal sin anular la ley de seguridad, surgira el problema legal\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero el traidor Syngman Rhee la mantuvo bajo la proteccion de EE.UU. y la tomo como medio para la gobernacion dictatorial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa \"ley de seguridad\" es la antidemocratica y antietica que viola y extermina hasta los elementales derechos de los seres humanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstipula violar ilimitadamente los derechos elementales de los habitantes bajo el pretexto \"legal\", segun el cual se pone en peligro el \"orden principal de la existencia, la seguridad y la democracia liberal del Estado\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl caracter anti-DDHH y antietico de la \"ley de seguridad\" reside en impedir la reconciliacion y la unidad de la nacion y la reunificacion de la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa \"ley  de seguridad\" determina la RPDC y las organizaciones de los coreanos en ultramar como \"entidad anti-estatal\" y considera a los connacionales como enemigo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn los articulos de la ley estan anotadas las expresiones hostiles contra los compatriotas incluyendo la \"entidad anti-estatal\" y los \"miembros de la entidad anti-estatal\" y califica  la RPDC de \"pais enemigo\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIgualmente la ley obstruye perversamente el viaje libre, el contacto y el dialogo entre el Norte y el Sur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDespues de que Park Geun-hye tomo el poder, esta ley se torna mas salvaje en el Sur de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda de Park impulsa abiertamente la enmienda de la \"ley de seguridad\", que no se atrevio a hacerla siquiera el traidor Lee Myung Bak.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde el primer periodo de su mandato, Park Geun-hye disparateo que el \"golpe militar del 16 de mayo fue la mejor opcion inevitable\" e recurrio a gobernacion dictatorial fascista poniendo a los elementos sobrevivientes de \"Yusin (renovacion)\" como Kim Ki Chun, Hwang Kyo An y Nam Jae Jun en los importantes cargos del gabinete de los secretario de Chongwadae, el Ministerio de Justicia y el Servicio Nacional de Inteligencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn febrero de 2013, primer ano de su mandato, la banda de Park juzgo a Ro Su Hui, vicepresidente de la direccion surena de la Alianza Pannacional por la Reunificacion de la Patria, quien regreso despues de visitar Pyongyang para expresar pesame por el fallecimiento del Dirigente Kim Jong Il, y le condeno a 4 anos de prision y a 4 anos de suspension de calidad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn octubre del mismo ano, arrebato por la fuerza la posicion legal del Sindicato Nacional de Ensenantes, entidad progresista representante del circulo de ensenanza surcoreana, y en diciembre lanzo a mas de 5 mil  policias gangsteres a registrar la direccion de la Confederacion de Sindicatos Surcoreanos (CSS), ocasion en la cual detuvo a mas de 130 miembros inclusive su vicepresidente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOrquesto el intrigante incidente de rebelion interna a fin de reprimir el Partido Progresista Unido, organizacion politica progresista legal en el Sur de Corea, y encarcelo al \"parlamentario\" pertenecido al PPU en virtud de la \"ley de seguridad\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 19 de diciembre del ano pasado, instigo a las autoridades de la Justicia a descomponer a fuerza el PPU tildandolo de \"partido pro-Norte\", y elogio el hecho como \"decision historica que defendio firmemente la democracia libre\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn los primeros dias de este ano, mostro abiertamente su intento maligno de exterminar totalmente a las fuerzas progresistas en virtud de la \"ley de seguridad\", al  iniciar la investigacion sobre la Union de Abogados para la Sociedad Democrata, entidad progresista del circulo de justicia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl determinar las manifestaciones y mitines de caracter pacifico como \"operaciones de las fuerzas izquierdas pro-Norte orientadas a derribar el gobierno\", detuvo y encarcelo sin piedad a las personalidades de entidades progresistas acusandolas de controladores traseros y reprimio sin discriminacion a los participantes tildandolos como \"fuerzas para vuelco de regimen\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn virtud de la \"ley de seguridad, la camarilla de Park viola severamente la libertad de expresion de los medios de prensa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy dia, en el Sur de Corea si hay la \"libertad de la expresion\" para proteger el \"gobierno\" y denigrar a los connacionales, pero no  hay la libertad para censurar al \"gobierno\" o criticar la politica conflictiva del gobierno.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor esta razon, diversos estratos del Sur de Corea demandan fuertemente la abolicion de la \"ley de seguridad\" y siquiera en el territorio norteamericano se oye la insistencia en la necesidad de anularla desde el punto de vista de derechos humanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, los maniacos de la banda de Park tratan de enmendar mas maligna esta ley.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTales tipejos se atreven a cuestionar cinicamente el \"problema de DDHH\" de alguien.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa camarilla de Park debe renunciar sin demora la \"ley de seguridad\" viendo correctamente la corriente de la epoca y abandonar de inmediato la campana intrigante de \"DDHH\" anti-RPDC."
