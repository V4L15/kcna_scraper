Korean puppets' moves to block grand festival\r\nPyongyang, July 21 (KCNA) -- Papers here today denounce the South Korean authorities' crafty moves to interrupt the August 15 grand pro-reunification festival and urge them to stop scheming to exclude pro-reunification patriotic organisations from the festival.\r\n   Recently, Kang In Dok, \"Minister of National Unification\" of South Korea, labeling the south headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification (Pomminryon) and the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils (Hanchongryon) as \"enemy-Benefiting organisations,\" set a condition that if their members are to participate in the festival, they should withdraw from their organisations.\r\n   Such behaviour is an act to intentionally bring the north-south pro-reunification festival to a rupture and another intolerable move of confrontation against the north, an analyst of rodong sinmun says, and goes on:\r\n   Kang, who is not supposed to take part in the festival, is trying to play the host, saying that some can participate in the festival and some cannot. This is nonsensical.\r\n   The festival without the south headquarters of Pomminryon and Hanchongryon is unthinkable at all. The sacred festival has no room for Kang In Dok and his clan of the \"Ministry of National Unification\" and his underlings.\r\n   If the South Korean authorities truly want a free contact between non-governmental organisations of the north and south and have willingness to hold the festival with success, they should abolish the \"National Security Law,\" dissolve the \"Agency for National Security Planning,\" take the label \"enemy-benefiting organisations\" off the south headquarters of Pomminryon and Hanchongryon and allow them to sponsor the featival.\r\n   Minju Joson says if the South Korean authorities continue trying to block the festival, they will be cursed and denounced by the nation. \r\n\r\n"

Accordingly, they were removed from their family registers or thus lost their nationality automatically according to the Japanese law after their citizenship of the DPRK.\r\n   This notwithstanding, the Japanese government raised the issue of \"people who abandoned their nationality\" in a far-fetched way when the third hometown visit was put on the order of the day.\r\n   It tried to use their hometown visit for its ulterior design of an anti-DPRK propaganda campaign, not for humanitarianism.\r\n   When staying in Japan, the Japanese-Korean women unanimously praised the advantages of the socialist system of the DPRK which they have felt in their real life and said that General Secretary Kim Jong Il, who has provided them with a true life and happiness, is their real father.\r\n   Upset by this, the Japanese authorities invented the issue of \"people who abandoned their nationality\" in an attempt to lay artificial hurdles in the way of the hometown visit of Japanese-Korean women and bring it to a rupture.\r\n    Their dastardly behaviour devoid of elementary ethics, morality and human feelings is arousing bitter indignation among the Korean and world peoples. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
