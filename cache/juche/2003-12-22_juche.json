Z. Umalatova, chairperson of the party, in her speech said that only victory and glory are in store for the heroic KPA as it holds Kim Jong Il as its supreme commander, noting that in the last period he has significantly augmented the might of socialist Korea with his Songun politics, the ever-victorious treasured sword. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Colonel General N. F. Kizyun, member of the Executive Committee of the party, in his speech said that Kim Jong Il is identical to President Kim Il Sung in the idea, leadership and virtue and the KPA is most fortunate to hold such general and marshal as its supreme commander. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Major General A. I. Makhnach, member of the Executive Committee of the party, in his speech said that the noble revolutionary life of Kim Jong Suk serves as a textbook in the life and struggle of all the servicepersons of the KPA and the Korean people, noting that she is a great model of the spirit of devotedly defending the leader and devotedly carrying out his instructions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A message of greetings to Kim Jong Il was adopted at the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Film shows were held by the Juche Philosophy Study Committee of India and a provincial committee of the South African Communist Party and in cities of Libya including Tripoli from Dec. 5 to 13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Screened at the film shows were Korean films \"Holding Great Illustrious Commander in High Esteem\", \"The Korean People's Army, Steel-like Ranks\", etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Debabrata Biswas, general secretary of the Central Committee of the All-India Forward Bloc, in a statement on Dec. 10 said that Kim Jong Il's assumption of the supreme commandership of the revolutionary armed forces of Korea was an event of historic significance in carrying out the cause of socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lectures, book and photo exhibitions and film shows were held by the Indian Youth Group for the Study of Works of Comrade Kim Il Sung and in Poland and at the National Movie Centre in Egypt from Dec. 10 to 12 on the occasion of the 12th anniversary of Kim Jong Il's assumption of the supreme commandership.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

Moreover, they are working with bloodshot eyes to suppress and stamp out the south Korean Federation of University Student Councils and other pro-reunification patriotic forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts go to prove that the GNP is outdated in its political idea, habit, behaviour and methods and all other aspects and it is too anachronistic that there is no justification for it to belong to this era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation calls on the nation to rise up in a struggle for the immediate disbandment and elimination of such Cold War-minded conservative party and remnant forces of fascism as the GNP. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people from all walks of life in south Korea should come out as one in a movement for throwing overboard the GNP.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Moves to Develop Smaller Nukes Assailed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 20 (KCNA) -- U.S. President Bush recently signed a bill on lifting a decade-long ban on research into smaller nukes and allotting a huge amount of money for it. A signed commentary of Rodong Sinmun today in this regard dismisses this as a grave challenge to the human cause of peace as it is a dangerous measure which may bring a nuclear holocaust to the world.\r\n The U.S. decided to spend 401.3 billion U.S. dollars for national defense in the fiscal 2004 15 million dollars of which will go for developing smaller nukes while 34 million dollars will be spent for the modernization of the nuclear test ground in Nevada, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The lift of the ban on the research into smaller nukes would enable the U.S. to push ahead with its moves to develop them with increased zeal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration adopted it as its policy to mount preemptive nuclear attacks on certain countries after coming to power. It is no secret that it designated the DPRK and six other countries as targets of its preemptive nuclear attacks. The U.S. imperialists are going to indiscriminately use smaller nukes against both nuclear weapons states and non-nuclear states in a bid to serve their dominationist purpose and meet their strategic interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is preposterous for the U.S. to threaten other countries not to \"possess nuclear weapons\" but \"scrap nuclear programs\" although it is developing, manufacturing and testing new type nuclear weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' moves to develop smaller nukes only compel the DPRK to beef up its deterrent force to cope with the nuclear attacks of the U.S. No one is entitled to fault the DPRK as it is a legitimate right for it to maintain and strengthen a nuclear deterrent force as a means for self-defence to cope with the U.S. policy to stifle the DPRK with nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that humankind will suffer an irrevocable catastrophe unless the reckless moves of the nuclear fanatics are frustrated. Therefore, it is quite just for the world to protest against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. moves to develop smaller nukes against the humankind's desire for peace are bound to meet stronger rebuff and denunciation of the world peace-loving people.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
