They have more common points than differences and better conditions for unity than ever before. \r\n   The Korean Student Committee hopes that the dissident organisations in south Korea will resolutely smash the intrigues of the puppet ANSP and hold the August 15 events jointly with \"Hanchongryon\" and Pomminryon's south headquarters at a time when the downfall of Kim Young Sam regime is in sight. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
