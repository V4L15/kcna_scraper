            "content": "DPRK Foreign Minister on DPRK Government's Stand\r\n Pyongyang, September 24 (KCNA) -- DPRK Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho, who is participating in the 72nd UN General Assembly, made a speech at the plenary session of the UN General Assembly on September 23.\n\t\t\t\t\t He said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I feel forced to make comments on the speech uttered 4 days ago by someone called the U.S. president that rendered this sacred UN arena tainted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since Trump uttered such reckless and violent words provoking the dignity of the DPRK supreme leadership and threatening the DPRK at this very platform, I think it is fair enough for me to make a response in the corresponding tone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The absurd reality that the person like Trump, a mentally deranged person full of megalomania and complacency, the person who is chastised even by American people as \"commander in grief\", \"lying king\", \"president evil\" is holding the seat of the U.S. president, and the dangerous reality that the gambler who grew old using threats, frauds and all other schemes to acquire a patch of land holds the nuclear button; these are what constitute the gravest threat to the international peace and security today.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Due to his lacking of basic common knowledge and proper sentiment, he tried to insult the supreme dignity of my country by referring it to a rocket. By doing so, however, he committed an irreversible mistake of making our rockets' visit to the entire U.S. mainland inevitable all the more.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Trump might not have been aware what is uttered from his mouth but we will make sure that he bears consequences far beyond his words, far beyond the scope of what he can handle even if he is ready to do so.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At this forum, I would like to once again remind all the distinguished delegates of the unjust and unfair nature of the \"resolutions\" adopted by the Security Council against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t First, the Security Council fabricated illegal and double-standard \"resolutions\" which only prohibit the satellite launch of the DPRK in violation of the international law prescribing peaceful use of outer space as a sovereign right of every state and without taking any issue with all other satellite launching countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Second, the Security Council cooked up illegal and double-standard \"resolutions\" which arbitrarily prohibit only the nuclear tests of the DPRK, although nuclear test strictly belongs to the sovereignty of every state since the international law on prohibition of nuclear test has not yet entered into force and there are countries that conducted many more nuclear tests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Third, the Security Council condemned the development of nuclear weapons by the DPRK as a \"threat to international peace and security\" and, on that basis, fabricated illegal and double-standard \"resolutions\" in contravention of Article 51 of the UN Charter which recognizes the right to self-defense of every state and without calling into question the other countries that keep on developing latest nuclear weapons of various kinds.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reason these unjust and unfair resolutions continue to be adopted is that the permanent members of the Security Council, all nuclear powers, have common interest in maintaining their monopolistic nuclear status.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the \"resolutions\" on the DPRK adopted at the Security Council are truly lawful and fair, there will be no need that all U.S. ambassadors abroad and even the president and the state secretary turn out to coerce other countries into implementing the \"resolutions\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The day will certainly come in near future when we settle all damages inflicted to our peaceful economic development and improvement of the people's livelihood and all the sufferings imposed on our innocent women, children and elderly by the heinous and barbaric sanctions against our Republic.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The unjust and contemptible acts such as turning a blind eye to the heinous acts of Israel patronized by the U.S. while condemning in every manner only the Syrian government fighting to protect its national sovereignty and security should not be tolerated any longer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK government will certainly defend peace and security of the country with its powerful nuclear deterrence and also contribute to safeguarding world peace and security."

His reckless remarks show that neither peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region including the Korean peninsula nor global peace and security can be guaranteed as long as the U.S., the empire of evils, is allowed to exist.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We do not regard Trump's reckless remarks as his impromptu address or his individual willingness.
