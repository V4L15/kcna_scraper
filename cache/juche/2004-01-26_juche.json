No political mode is, therefore, as efficient as the Songun politics enforced by the WPK and the socialist regime which struggle for the independent and creative life of the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people live and struggle with the faith that they can live without sweets but not without bullets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This clearly proves that the WPK's Songun politics is one for the people and an efficient political mode absolutely supported by the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun politics is the invincible politics guaranteeing the sovereignty and dignity of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Sovereignty is the life and soul of the country and the nation and socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Sovereignty is unthinkable without an army in the present world where the imperialists' military high-handed and arbitrary practices are rampant. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An invincible army is the source of extraordinary pluck, strong national self-respect and dignified and independent diplomacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun politics based on the invincible revolutionary armed forces is the principled and just anti-imperialist independent politics, noble patriotic politics reliably defending the demand for independence of the popular masses and their interests and sovereignty and dignity of the country and the nation from all forms of infringement of the imperialist reactionaries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun politics firmly guarantees independence of the DPRK and helps the socialist motherland fully demonstrate its dignity, honor and might as a bulwark of independence.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The history of the Korean nation with Tangun with as its ancestral father is spanning more than five thousand years. Tangun, the founder-father of Korea, chose the then Walled City of Pyongyang (Pyongyang at present) as a capital and declared the birth of the country and named it \"Korea.\" With the foundation of Tangun Korea the Koreans were the first to usher in the era of the state and civilization in the East. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The five-thousand-year-long history of the Korean nation can be described as a history of struggle during which it has courageously fought against foreign aggressors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The foreign aggressors had incessantly invaded Korea up to date from ancient times. Whenever the aggressors committed invasion, however, the Koreans turned out as one in a sacred fight to defend the country from the invasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aggressors failed to break patriotism and bravery of the Koreans and bring them to their knees. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The five-thousand-year-long history of the Korean nation can also be termed a proud history of creation in which it brought into full bloom and developed the brilliant culture of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are a resourceful and civilized nation that has brought into full bloom the culture of the East and made great contributions to the development of culture of humankind from ancient times. They have created numerous excellent wealths in science, technology, literature and arts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today in the DPRK the advantageous national character of the Korean nation has been carried forward and developed on a high level under the wise guidance of Kim Jong Il, the incarnation of patriotism.

Pro-U.S. sycophantic and traitorous forces in south Korea are throwing hurdles in the way of the process of improving the inter-Korean relations and achieving the cause of reunification by zealously supporting the U.S. in its vicious moves against the north and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such moves of the U.S. and the south Korean pro-U.S. flunkeyists against the north and reunification are stumbling blocks in the way of national unity and independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation should frustrate the war moves of the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean bellicose elements against the north and pave the way for peace and peaceful reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historic June 15 joint declaration is a great programme for national reunification as it reflects the desire of all the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pomminryon should thoroughly reject even the slightest intention to violate the basic spirit of the joint declaration and powerfully encourage all Koreans to implement it and thus give fuller play to its vitality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pomminryon's patriotic cause of reunification is bound to triumph as long as there are the great Songun policy, the will of the Korean nation to achieve the cause of independent reunification of the country and the June 15 joint declaration, a milestone of national unity and reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It goes on:\r\n Any people strong in revolutionary faith and will and countries which resolutely struggle against the imperialists with a principled stand are sure to emerge victorious. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush bellicose forces invaded Afghanistan under the pretext of eradicating the \"kingpin of terrorism\", \"den of terrorists\" and then provoked the Iraqi war to overthrow Saddam's regime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In those wars the U.S. applied every most sinister and cunning method including destructive warfare, horror warfare and psychological warfare. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Weak in the revolutionary faith and will and unaware of the enemy's invasion, the Iraqi army and people were deceived by the U.S. propaganda. They did such folly as harbouring an illusion about aggressors and welcoming them as \"liberators.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whoever lacks faith and will would meet the same tragic destiny as Iraq did in the confrontation with the imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The sovereignty of the country and the destiny of the people are guaranteed by the revolutionary faith and will. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK possess the most transparent revolutionary faith and will. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They do not fear the U.S. high-handed practices but are courageously standing against them with faith in the victory and strong pluck. They are reacting to the U.S. hard line policy with the toughest stand with the firm faith and strong pluck that they will surely emerge victorious in the confrontation with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary faith, gut and pluck of the army and people of the DPRK are the source of their inexhaustible strength and an important guarantee for their victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No force on earth can defeat the people ready to die. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the basis of the revolutionary faith and will of the army and people of the DPRK who value independence as their life and soul. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Having this revolutionary faith and will they will surely win ultimate victory in the confrontation with the U.S. and build a great prosperous powerful socialist nation of Juche on this land.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Urged to Drop Its Hostile Policy towards DPRK\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 24 (KCNA) -- Whether the DPRK-U.S. hostile relations are terminated and a war is averted on the Korean peninsula or not entirely depends on whether the United States drops its hostile policy to stifle the DPRK or not. If the U.S. sincerely wishes to solve the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. and put an end to the relations of confrontation between the two countries, the former should take a practical and bold action to roll back its hostile policy to stifle the latter. Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. It continues:\r\n The present DPRK-U.S. relations present themselves as a most acute and thorny global issue. In order to avert a war on the Korean peninsula it is necessary to terminate the DPRK-U.S. relations of confrontation and opt for improving them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the U.S. to drop its hostile policy to stifle the DPRK is the master key to terminating those ties, easing the tensions on the peninsula and averting the war there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the essence of the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK to topple down the socialist system of Korean style and establish the political system and order of the American style \"free world\" in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The bilateral relations will reach the phase of more acute confrontation should the U.S. take issue with and work hard to destroy the system in the DPRK as it does now. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The escalated moves of the U.S. to invade the DPRK would only reinforce the faith and will of its army and people to further increase its military muscle to protect the country. The U.S. had better drop its attempt to invade the DPRK before faulting its measures to bolster its defence capability. The DPRK will not level its gun at the U.S. if it does not aim its gun at Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. sanctions and blockade against the DPRK should be lifted to terminate the hostile ties between the two countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. sanctions and blockade against the DPRK have lasted for more than half a century. But never before has the U.S. pursued such a desperate strategy to isolate and stifle the DPRK through international sanctions and blockade backed by military force as now, while openly manoeuvring to lay an \"international siege\" to it. This indicates that the U.S. imperialists' start of the second Korean war is becoming a reality. That was why the DPRK government clearly stated that it would consider the U.S. formation of an \"international siege\" and sanctions and blockade against it as military provocations and acts of aggression against it and strongly react against them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. will have nothing to \"concern\" about the DPRK and worry about its \"security\" if it drops its hostile policy to stifle the DPRK and opts for normalizing its relations with Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had better make a switchover in its policy towards the DPRK, though belatedly, properly understanding the do-or die spirit, persevering will and invincible might of the army and people of the DPRK. This would be in line with the trend of the times towards independence, peace, reconciliation and cooperation and helpful to improving the prestige and image of the U.S. The DPRK will closely follow the U.S. move to make a switchover in its policy towards the DPRK and react to it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
