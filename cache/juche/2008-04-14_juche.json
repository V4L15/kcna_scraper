These imperishable exploits will shine for all ages. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It is the immense honor and pride for the army and people to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the founding of the DPRK in the stirring period when the nation's dignity and power have been put on the highest level and they greeted the golden days of great prosperity unprecedented in the nation's history thanks to the great Songun politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Presidium of the DPRK Supreme People's Assembly makes the following decision to eternally celebrate the six decades shining with victory and glory covered by the DPRK: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n1.

In praise of his exploits, the Korean servicepersons and people conferred the title of Generalissimo on him on the occasion of his 80th birthday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This was an appreciation by the history, the will of the nation and the demand of the times.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Paektu, created during the protracted and hard-fought anti-Japanese struggle, is a source of all the miracles wrought by the DPRK in the present times and it is a symbol of heroism displayed by the Korean army and people, says Rodong Sinmun in an editorial article Saturday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With this great spirit the army and people of the DPRK defeated two imperialist formidable enemies and built a powerful socialist country from scratch, the article says, adding that the victory of the Songun revolution won by the DPRK that brought the dawn of a great prosperous powerful nation after successfully concluding the \"Arduous March\" precisely means the victory by the above-said spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean army and people's ideological and moral mainstay is the revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu that was created under the leadership of President Kim Il Sung during the grim anti-Japanese war, it notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This spirit represents absolute and unconditional loyalty to the leader, the spirit of self-reliance and fortitude and the indefatigable fighting spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary soldier spirit displayed by the Korean People's Army, the revolutionary spirit symbolizing and representing the Songun era, is a successful succession to the revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu, and signal creation and change being wrought in the country are a precious fruition of this spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu serves as a solid cornerstone of our army and people's transparent faith in independence and their high national pride. It also serves as an inexhaustible source of strong disposition of the Korean army and people who know nothing impossible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is great spirit that helps the Korean army and people train themselves to be indomitable fighters and live and struggle with matchless courage and pluck with nothing to be afraid of in the world. It is also the bottom of their steadfast working-class stand against imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the unshakable creed of General Secretary Kim Jong Il that there would be no spirit of Korea, the soul of its nation, to say nothing of the victory of the revolution, without the revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today it is a social trait of the DPRK that all the people learn from the noble fighting spirit displayed by the anti-Japanese revolutionary forerunners. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu will encourage the Korean army and people to perform fresh heroic feats, fully displaying its inexhaustible might with passage of time as there is Kim Jong Il who is faithfully inheriting and eternally glorifying the revolutionary traditions created by the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the steadfast will of our army and people to accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche under the leadership of Kim Jong Il to the end, considering the said spirit as an eternal treasured sword. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean revolution was started and has victoriously advanced with arms. There can never be change in the truth of history that arms guarantee the victory of socialism and the independent dignity and prosperity of each country and nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The path of Juche opened up by the President is that of eternal victory and prosperity, and the revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu is the noblest revolutionary spirit that our army and people should fully display in their long journey of struggle. The Korean revolution will always emerge victorious as there are the seasoned and tested guidance of the great Workers' Party of Korea and the single-minded unity and inexhaustible mental power of all servicepersons and people.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
