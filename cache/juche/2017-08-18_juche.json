En particular, el salio suspenso en la asignatura de relaciones intercoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas hablaron mucho sobre el \"dialogo\" y la \"ejecucion de la declaracion Sur-Norte\", pero actuaron en el sentido contrario. Y no paso de ser una expresion superficial e hipocrita la \"mejora de vinculos intercoreanos\", aludida por ellas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl presentar la \"renuncia nuclear del Norte\" como meta del dialogo intercoreano, el mandatario surcoreano expuso su plan antinacional de enfrentarse con la connacional RPDC confabulandose con EE.UU. que dejo dividida en dos partes a la nacion coreana y se obstina ahora en impedir la reunificacion independiente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl problema nuclear de la Peninsula Coreana es un asunto pendiente entre la RPDC y EE.UU. porque fue engendrado debido a la incesante amenaza y chantaje nucleares de EE.UU. contra aquella. Por eso, las autoridades surcoreanas no tienen ninguna justificacion ni derecho para meter su nariz en ese tema.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa doctrina de \"simultanear la sancion y presion con el dialogo\", planteado por el mandatario surcoreano, tambien es la imperdonable teoria conflictiva anti-reunificacion que consuena con la bandidesca campana de presion anti-RPDC de su amo gringo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi las autoridades surcoreanas siguen cometiendo actos serviles a EE.UU. y cooperando con las fuerzas extranjeras en sancionar a la connacional RPDC, seran subyugadas aun mas por el imperio americano y condenadas a la destruccion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEllas deben aprender la leccion ante la situacion catastrofica de relaciones intercoreanas que van de mal en peor."
