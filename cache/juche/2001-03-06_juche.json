            "content": "U.S. assailed for pulling up DPRK over \"drug issue\" \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 6 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK in an answer given today to a question put by KCNA assailed the United States for recently pulling up the DPRK over the \"drug issue.\"\r\n He said:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already reported, the U.S. State Department in an \"annual report on drug control\" released on March 1 asserted that \"the DPRK seems to manufacture and smuggle drugs into other countries\" and it will \"keep tabs on\" the DPRK despite the lack of clear evidence. This is a groundless charge and shameless provocation against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The use of drugs and dealing in them, to say nothing of their manufacture, which reduce people to mental cripples, are strictly banned by law under the man-centred socialist system in the DPRK where a sound way of life prevails. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Moreover, there is a strict order whereby even mental stimulants indispensable for the manufacture of medicines and scientific researches can be imported only by the permission of the state. The DPRK exchanges information with the international drug control council and cooperates well with it in this respect. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This time the U.S. faulted the DPRK on the basis of sheer speculation although it admitted that there is no evidence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is prompted by its sinister intention to cavil at the Korean-style socialist system whose vitality is growing stronger day by day and isolate and stifle the DPRK at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Shortly ago, it slandered the DPRK over \"human rights abuse\" and this time it fabricated the preposterous \"drug issue\" in a bid to tarnish the image of the DPRK and isolate it. However, no one will lend an ear to this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to clearly know that such a trite trick will only bring to light the futility of its hostile policy towards the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"
