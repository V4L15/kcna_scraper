These acts are throwing a stumbling block in the way of achieving the independent development of the nation and peace and reunification of the country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For the Koreans, the U.S. is the arch criminal which divided their country and inflicted misfortunes and disasters upon them and is blocking national reunification. The U.S. is the master and dominator of the ruling forces in south Korea. And the latter is no more than stooges and servants of the former. No one can become \"president\" of south Korea unless he is supported and approved by the U.S and the ruling forces in south Korea can neither speak nor behave as they please without reading the face of their U.S. master. This is their wretched plight.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Neither national reconciliation and unity of the nation can be achieved nor the inter-Korean relations be mended unless the puppet ruling forces roll back their treacherous policy of depending on outside forces and inciting confrontation with compatriots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Only when they take such attitude as placing the nation above all, giving priority to it and making efforts to achieve its unity, can the inter-Korean relations be improved and an avenue be paved for peace and reunification of the country. It is foolish for them to try to settle the issue of north-south relations in reliance upon outsiders by negating the principle of independence."

This fact fully reveals the true colors of the U.S. as the worst abuser of human rights. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To wiretap the secret of communications including private messages to be observed strictly represents the worst abuse of human rights ignoring the elementary conception of human rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than the U.S. that does the worst things in the world, seriously infringing upon human rights in all countries of the world including its friendly countries to meet its interests. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is that the U.S. shamelessly justifies its wiretapping which gets evermore undisguised. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some time ago, the White House said that the U.S. president did not know about the spying cases including wiretapping of foreign leaders made by the NSA. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the accusing finger was pointed at them in the wake of ceaseless disclosures, the former and incumbent officials concerned of the NSA and CIA, which have served the chief executives, could not but admit that they received the instructions for wiretapping dozens of foreign state leaders directly from the White House and the Department of State. Much upset by this, the U.S. secretary of State said that there was no other option but to continue \"security service\" including wiretapping round the clock and for 365 days as there were a lot of forces to hurt Americans in different parts of the world. The director of the NSA justified the wiretapping, claiming that it was inevitable to \"combat terrorism.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. claim that the illegal wiretapping is to \"combat terrorism\" is nothing but an absurd pretext. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The aim of the U.S. large-scale wiretapping overseas is obviously to watch and spy on every move of other countries to realize world domination. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. espionage including wiretapping for aggression and domination is now being perpetrated in different countries of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Wiretapping is playing a big role in the U.S. moves for aggression to attain its goal for dominating other countries by gathering secrets of different fields including politics, military and economy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The NSA wiretaps voices, photos, e-mails and others by setting up the program called \"Prism\" in the worldwide internet servers under the pretext of \"anti-terrorism\". It also watches computers and phone messages in the world by use of the software \"information server without borders\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An official of the NSA openly said that the NSA hears voices of the presidents of any countries. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For its human rights abuse through wiretapping, the U.S. is now standing further isolated, censured even by its allies including Saudi Arabia, U.K., Italy, France and Germany. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural that the U.S. is cursed and condemned by the world people."
