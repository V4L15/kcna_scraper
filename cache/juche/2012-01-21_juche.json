He gave the precious instructions which would serve as guidelines for doing an educational work through revolutionary relics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter acquainting himself with the performance of the unit's duty, he went round military lecture rooms to learn about the training of commanding officers and staff members.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe noted with appreciation that the unit has conducted intensive training under the simulated conditions of an actual battle, thereby preparing all the commanding officers, staff members and servicepersons as a-match-for-a hundred combatants and defying-corps for national reunification capable of independently and positively performing their duties.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThen he went round a company under the large combined unit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWatching with keen attention the training of service personnel at the training room, he encouraged them in undergoing training in an atmosphere of an actual battle true to the WPK's training-first policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt a bedroom, he took its temperature with the help of a thermometer. Taking blankets for soldiers, he learned about their quality and was satisfied to hear that all of them liked warm and soft blankets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLooking at the steam rising from the water tank at the wash-cum-bath house, he asked about how water is kept warm. He told the company commander and political instructor to cooperate with each other and take good care of the living of the soldiers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUpon hearing that a lot of time has passed, he said that the time he spent among soldiers was the most worthwhile and he never considered it as a pity to spend time in such a manner. Then he made the rounds of supply service facilities including mess hall and soybean store.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNoting that his visit to the command helped him to learn that everything including the command and management of the unit was going well, he stressed the need to further improve the command and management of the unit and establish steel-like military discipline through the concerted efforts of the commanding officers and soldiers and thus fully demonstrate the militant spirit and appearance as the most elite revolutionary forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe expressed his expectation and belief that the servicepersons of the large combined unit would display the heroic mettle in the sacred service to defend the country before leaving for the next leg of his inspection tour."

The people were simply stunned by the group which insulted the Korean people's sense of obligation and conscience with unspeakable jargons and twisted the reality by telling sheer lies which no one knows where it borrowed from.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee group deserves the severest punishment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClear is its ulterior intention. In a word, it is aimed to shake the strong single-minded unity of the DPRK and realize its wild ambition steeped in confrontation of systems.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is, however, nothing but a daydream. The confidence and will of the people in the DPRK regarding the headquarters of the revolution as their own lives remain unchanged and the single-minded unity has grown stronger while experiencing the most arduous trial during the mourning. The revolutionary ranks of the DPRK are steadily advancing dynamically along the road of Songun under the leadership of the great Workers' Party of Korea, always holding in high esteem the sun of Juche. It is ridiculous, indeed, for such narrow-minded profiteers to try to hurt the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMinju Joson stresses that the army and people of the DPRK will force the Lee group of traitors to pay dearly for all the thrice-cursed crimes."

It was true bitter tears that we saw in Pyongyang.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission Kim Jong Il passed away on a train on Dec. 17 last year due to serious mental strain he got during his long journey for field guidance, said the travelogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt recounted a story that despite his fatigue and bad health, Kim Jong Il visited South Hamgyong Province for field guidance and as soon as he came back from there on De.15, he set about on his journey to a place in the northern tip of the country for the same purpose.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe travelogue quoted compatriots in the north as lamenting: \"Kim Jong Il demised to our sorrow after undergoing sufferings without having a proper chance to put on a tie all his life.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn 1994 when President Kim Il Sung passed away, I witnessed the \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"unforeseen mourning\" in company with Yang Un Sik, chairman of the American Regional Committee of the Pan-national Alliance for Korea's Reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt that time, Kim Il Sung passed so suddenly that the homeland was not prepared at all and it had never experienced this before so that it looked like a mourning house in very unstable conditions. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTo cap it all, the homeland was hit by consecutive years of natural disasters after the passing of the President. Consequently, it had to make the \"Arduous March\" for several years. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was against the backdrop of this crisis that General Kim Jong Il displayed his ability as a leader of the people, leading the army and people to form a harmonious whole and work such dramatic historic miracle as building a nuclear power despite the outside forces' threats.   \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs these historic experiences are vivid in the memory, the compatriots in the north so bitterly wailed over the untimely passing of Kim Jong Il. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was snowing heavily prior to the ceremony of biding last farewell to Kim Jong Il. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tI thought the sky was so \"heartless\" when looking out of a window of Pyongyang Koryo Hotel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHowever, the Pyongyangites overcome with sorrow over the great loss did not care the heavy snow and the cold weather which registered 10 degrees below zero. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tConcerned that snow might cover the roads to be passed by the car carrying the bier of the leader on Dec. 28, Pyongyangites, men and women, young and old, began covering them with quilts and blankets as one. They also used mufflers and coats.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tQuite many Pyongyangites and people from local areas came out to remove snow and ice from roads. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tI approached a woman and asked. \"Why are you doing it?\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHer answer was clear. \"We do wish dear NDC Chairman Kim Jong Il safe passing.\" She said this in a choking voice with tears in her eyes. Seeing her, I was also moved to tears. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe north has held that the two leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il consistently embodied the idea of love for the motherland and people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnyhow, nobody can deny the fact that through the mourning the north evidently showed before the world the wonderful and beautiful picture of the unity of the party, army and people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMy condolatory visit gave me an opportunity to understand the real meaning of a Korean proverb which says \"One might not visit a wedding house but never miss visiting the house in mourning\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen watching many soldiers and people stand in a solemn atmosphere for about three hours at the plaza of the Kumsusan Memorial Palace where the funeral was held on Dec. 28, I was touched by its process and the perfect order that prevailed among the participants. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tI came back after getting full understanding of the fact that Kim Jong Il had uncomfortable sleep and rice-balls during his field guidance, a story about which I had only heard, and a moving story about slogans such as \"single-minded unity is more powerful than nuclear weapons\" during my participation in the mourning events as one of the Korean residents in the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe compatriots in the north grieved over the passing of Kim Jong Il, beating the ground, but were never disappointed and frustrated. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThat's because they firmly believed that the dear respected Kim Jong Un would build a thriving nation and surely achieve the peaceful reunification of the country despite the imperialists' moves to swallow up the Korean nation."
