With the collapse of the Soviet Union, there is no need for the U.S. to keep its troops in Japan for \"security\" of Japan.\r\n   The United States is claiming that its troops should remain in South Korea because of \"threat\" from the DPRK and of \"instability\" of the situation on the Korean Peninsula. \r\n   Threat on the peninsula comes from the U.S. troops, not from the DPRK. And the \"instability\" of the situation on the peninsula entirely rests with the U.S. troops present in South Korea. It is because the United States pursues the Cold War that it intends to maintain its troops in South Korea for an indefinite period under the unreasonable pretext.\r\n   The pullout of the U.S. troops is fundamental in ensuring peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and in Asia. As long as the U.S. troops remain there, neither peace and security in Asia can be guaranteed nor independence can be realized.\r\n   There is no reason and pretext for the U.S. troops to remain in Asia any longer.\r\n   The U.S. ruling quarters should not resort to crafty moves regarding the pullout of the U.S. troops from Asia but pull them out without delay.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Manpower and equipment are used to greater advantage to cut the turnaround time of cargo vessels.\r\n   Conditions for loading and unloading operations are being improved by organizational measures such as a rational quay arrangement of large vessels and a better coordination of performance between various forms of transport. Work is under way in quays nos. 6 and 9 to install new loaders and conveyer belts.\r\n   Thanks to the high working morale shown by the port workers, the transit capacity will continue to increase even in the face of the manifold difficulties at present.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
