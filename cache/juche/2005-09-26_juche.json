The DPRK government will as ever make patient efforts to realize the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\r\n Choe Su Hon, vice-minister of Foreign Affairs who is leading the DPRK delegation, declared this when addressing the plenary meeting of the 60th UN General Assembly on Sept. 22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK participated in the discussion of the issue with magnanimity and sincerity from its principled and fair stand to realize at any cost the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, its avowed ultimate goal, at the recent fourth six-party talks held in Beijing, thus making it possible to meet all challenges and reach an agreement on the principle for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in a broad sense, he noted.\r\n What is most important at this stage is for the U.S. to provide the DPRK with light water reactors as early as possible as evidence proving its substantial recognition of the DPRK's right to nuclear activity for a peaceful purpose, Choe said, adding the DPRK will closely follow how the U.S. will move in actuality at the phase of action in the future. \r\n He went on to say: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The UN should be reformed as required by the new century if it is to fulfill its mission for global peace and security and the economic and social progress. What is most important here is to materialize UN-centered multilateralism in line with the purpose and principle of the UN Charter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The UN Security Council should be reformed on the principle of ensuring full representation of non-aligned countries and other developing countries who account for an absolute majority of the member nations of the UN. Japan should not be allowed under any circumstances to sit on the Security Council as it has refused to redeem the crimes it committed against other countries in the past and has distorted its history of aggression and driven the regional situation to confrontation. \r\n Turning to the reform of UN organizations on human rights, he said that this reform should give top priority to putting an end to the infringement upon state sovereignty, politicization of human rights, double standards and selectivity, worst human rights abuses at present, and consider it as an ultimate goal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And it is also necessary to strictly observe the principle of ensuring full representation of UN member nations the same way as done in reforming the UNSC, he noted, and stressed: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK government will boost the friendly and cooperative relations with all the countries of the world that respect the sovereignty of the DPRK on the principle of independence, peace and friendship and thus make a positive contribution  to the efforts of the UN member states to build a peaceful and prosperous new world.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Japan seeks to obtain permanent membership of the UN Security Council, increase its political position in the international arena and thus become a political giant who exercises tremendous power in the new century. The world considers Japan's bid to be permanent membership of the UNSC as a dangerous attempt to bring another disaster to humankind in the new century. Under this situation the Japanese reactionaries seek to turn the public mindset favorable for themselves with the help of the U.S. and become a permanent member of the SC at any cost. That is why they serve the U.S. actively, meeting its demands. The Japanese reactionaries are persistently pursuing the policy of toeing the U.S. line, obsessed by a foolish ambition that they may reverse the situation and get permanent membership of the SC despite opposition of other countries if the U.S.  helps them.\r\n Japan is set to emerge a military power and make a decision of permitting a war by law in a few years to come. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's intensification of its policy of toeing the U.S. line is a dangerous action of inciting confrontation and dispute and sparking off arms race in Asia. Meanwhile, the U.S. is seeking to draw Japan to let it play a shock brigade in executing its Korea, Asia strategy. Japan is seeking to dash forward militarization and overseas expansion under the active patronage of the U.S. Therefore, Japan remains as a root cause of threatening and harassing peace and security in Asia even in the new century just as in the last century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Asian people are heightening vigilance against Japan's mean and criminal policy of toeing the U.S. line.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

So, it intends to go unchallenged in the field of strategic nuclear armed forces in a bid to beat its rivals and mercilessly destroy those countries challenging its bid to establish its order of world domination.\r\n Minju Joson Sunday observes this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. new doctrine on the use of nuclear weapons is of increasingly belligerent and offensive nature, the commentary says, and goes on:\r\n The U.S. nuclear hysteria based on the nuke-all powerful conception has reached its height and gone far beyond the tolerance limit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its modification of the above-said doctrine would be inevitably followed by other powers' reexamination of the regime for the use of nuclear weapons to keep the strategic balance. Then it would be as clear as noonday that this would spark off a nuclear arms race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This proves that the U.S. is chiefly to blame for posing the threat of nukes to the world and proliferating them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is beyond doubt that such U.S. high-handed and arbitrary practices as wielding its nuclear stick will become more undisguised than ever before. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such reality eloquently shows what just and wise Songun politics the Workers' Party of Korea has pursued to increase its deterrent for self-defence in every way in order to cope with the daily growing U.S. nuclear threat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK are proud of having built such self-defensive deterrent strong enough to protect the national dignity and security from the U.S. nuclear threat. The U.S. nuclear stick will not work on the DPRK that has extraordinarily strong spirit of independence and has sufficient self-defensive means in place. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. recklessly forces a nuclear war on the DPRK, its army and people will exercise their legitimate right to self-defence as a powerful means of retaliation.\r\n Nuclear weapons are no longer the monopoly of the U.S. and gone are the days when it considered nukes all-powerful. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to cool its head overheated with nuclear hysteria and face up to the reality.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They demanded the Japanese government make an unconditional apology and compensation for the past crimes.\r\n Victims of above-said forcible drafting and their bereaved families testified to the facts that the forcible drafting was the thrice-cursed hideous abduction committed by Japan against humanity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The conference involved panel discussions and plenary session. \r\n Speeches were made at the panel discussions on the subjects of the issue of the \"comfort women\" for the imperial Japanese army, the issue of forcible drafting and massacres, the issue of victims to A-bombs, the issue of history distortion, the issue of militarization, the issue of turning Japan Rightist and the issue of remains of the victims of forcible drafting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The plenary session was informed of the measures for enhancing the function and role of the international solidarity council in order to check and frustrate the Japanese government's base acts of negating its past history of aggression and evading its responsibility for its crimes against humanity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A resolution was adopted at the conference. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It underscored the need to launch a more dynamic movement for probing the truth behind Japan's grisly human rights abuses and demanding their settlement worldwide and conduct a powerful movement against Japan's negating its past crimes and distorting history as an Asian-wide movement in order to shatter such moves without fail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also stressed the need to counter the moves of Japan to veer to the Right and its militarization with a powerful peace movement against war.\r\n In order to carry through the resolution, it is imperative to further expand and strengthen the ranks of the International Solidarity Council Demanding the Settlement of Japan's Past and decisively increase its function and role, the resolution stressed.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It goes on:\r\n The GNP, a wicked group of sycophantic traitors, has closely cooperated with outside aggressor forces and perpetrated the above-mentioned crimes, refusing to face up to the reality and clinging to their coattails despite the advance of the June 15 era of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP clan greedy for power is keen to prolong their remaining days of their political careers in reliance upon flunkeyism and dependence on outside forces without an iota of independence. They do not bother to commit such acts of treachery as cooperating with the U.S. in the pursuance of its hostile policy towards the north, blindly dancing to its tune.  They are so blinded with flunkeyism towards the U.S. and anti-reunification acts and confrontation with the north that they are zealously patronizing and backing its policy of war of aggression aimed at doing harm to the fellow countrymen and threatening the peace of the country and the security of the nation and playing the role as a shock brigade for implementing it.\r\n The GNP is desperately working to boost the anachronistic war \"alliance\" with the U.S.\r\n Whoever truly stands for the peace and the reunification of the country should decisively come out against the anachronistic and treacherous \"alliance\" with the U.S. \r\n The desperate efforts on the part of the GNP clan to preserve the \"alliance\" with outside forces, setting store by it, while antagonizing the fellow countrymen, are aimed at strangulating them by force of arms in collusion with outside forces and realizing their ambition to unify the country by invading the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis is an anti-national action intolerable in the June 15 era of reunification.\r\n The GNP is fanning up an atmosphere of war against the north, dead-set against the U.S. troop pullback from south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The 60 year-long history of national division clearly proves that as long as the U.S. forces are present in south Korea, the clouds of war cannot be removed from the sky of the Korean Peninsula and Koreans will never be safe and peace and the cause of peaceful reunification of the country will encounter repeated challenges. \r\n The U.S. imperialist forces of aggression in south Korea are lording it over in south Korea, frantically pursuing their moves for a war against the north and escalating the military confrontation and tension. This would be unthinkable without the treacherous and anti-reunification reckless acts being perpetrated by the GNP, while begging for the permanent presence of the U.S. forces of aggression in south Korea.\r\n In the case the GNP, a war servant of the U.S., is allowed to come to power, the history of confrontation between the north and the south will repeat itself and the disaster of a nuclear war will be imposed on the Korean nation in the end. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
