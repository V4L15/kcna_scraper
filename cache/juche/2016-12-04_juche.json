            "content": "Vocero de MINREX de Corea denuncia la exigencia injusta de paises europeos\r\nPyongyang, 4 de diciembre (ACNC) -- A la pregunta de un reportero de la ACNC formulada el dia 4 en relacion con que los paises europeos hablan tanto del \"cumplimiento del deber internacional\" bajo el pretexto de la \"resolucion de sanciones\" anti-RPDC aprobada en el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU, el vocero del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea dio la siguiente respuesta:\n\t\t\t\t\tSe dicen que despues de ser inventada la \"resolucion de sanciones\" anti-RPDC del CS de la ONU bajo la instigacion de los Estados Unidos, unos paises europeos como Gran Bretana y Francias exigen a la RPDC a \"observar el deber internacional\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la \"resolucion\" arriba mencionada, el CS de la ONU cuestiono como la \"amenaza a la paz y la seguridad internacionales\" la prueba de explosion de ojiva nuclear de la RPDC efectuada en septiembre pasado. Pero, no existe ningun articulo que califica la prueba nuclear de una amenaza a la paz y la seguridad internacionales ni en Carta de la ONU ni en otros codigos internacionales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi existe ese articulo, los paises que deben ser objeto de sancion seran EE.UU. y otros paises permanentes del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU que realizaron mas que otros las pruebas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC rechaza totalmente la \"resolucion de sancion\" del CS de la ONU porque este organo internacional niega solamente la soberania de la RPDC que tienen todos los paises soberanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl respecto, la RPDC demando en mayo pasado al secretario general de la ONU explicar tal contradiccion juridica de la \"resolucion de sancion\" anti-RPDC. Pero el Secretariado de la ONU no da ninguna explicacion hasta la fecha.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn esta condicion, tienen que dar respuesta a esa pregunta los paises europeos que se jactan de la historia y tradicion constitucionales, lo que es nuestra posicion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi demandan a la RPDC el \" cumplimiento del deber internacional\" sin dar ninguna respuesta en cuestion, lo cual no tiene ninguna persuasiva.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, la presente \"resolucion\" es el producto que refleja las correlaciones entre las fuerzas del Consejo, de ahi que seria una bajeza la ejecucion de la sancion independiente fuera del CS de la ONU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi tienen la independencia, los paises europeos deben meditar y portarse independientemente."

Y seguidamente escenificaron una farsa de publicar el \"proyecto de sancion independiente\" insistiendo en ponerse en la delantera de la ejecucion de \"resolucion de sancion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos titeres registraron en ese \"proyecto\" los contenidos imposibles con su posicion y capacidad incluyendo que se atrevieron a adicionar en la lista de sancion los supremos organos directivos y los funcionarios medulares de nuestro partido y el Estado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa horda de Park necesita recordar el hecho de que la RPDC declaro dignamente que para su existencia no necesita jamas el Sur de Corea y que observara como mantendria este su existencia dando la espalda a aquella.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuanto mas los titeres se entregan freneticamente a la confrontacion fratricida, tanto mas se acelerara su arruinamiento vergonzoso.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark y sus compinches deben saber correctamente que tal payasada deviene el acto de suicidio que adelanta solo su fin miserable."
