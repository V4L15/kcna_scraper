            "content": "Anniversary of Kim Jong Il's Work Observed in Serbia\r\n Pyongyang, August 16 (KCNA) -- The general secretary of the New Yugoslav Communist Party of Serbia issued a statement on August 9 to mark the 16th anniversary of leader Kim Jong Il's work \"Let Us Carry Out the Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung's Instructions for National Reunification\".\n\t\t\t\t\t The work, published on August 4, Juche 86 (1997), formulates the three principles of national reunification, the 10-point programme for the great unity of the whole nation and the proposal for founding the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo (DFRK) as the three charters for national reunification. It also indicates tasks and ways to achieve the cause of national reunification on the basis of them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting the work is a great programme which brought great hope into the Korean people struggling to reunify the country and the world progressive people supporting Korea's reunification, the statement said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t President Kim Il Sung dedicated his all to the country's reunification till the last moments of his life and Kim Jong Il successfully carried forward his cause of national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If reunification is to be achieved on the Korean Peninsula, it is necessary to conclude a peace treaty between the DPRK and the U.S. and make foreign forces withdraw from south Korea to the last man.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how desperately the U.S. and south Korea work, can they never quell the desire of the Korean people to achieve reconciliation and unity in the idea of \"By our nation itself\" and found the DFRK, true to the great programme for reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I am sure that the Korean people will certainly achieve national reunification in the near future under the leadership of Kim Jong Un."
