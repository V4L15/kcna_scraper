This is an unpardonable criminal act prompted by their hostility toward the DPRK and Chongryon and an indication of the moral vulgarity of the Japanese government, it noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It demanded the Japanese authorities stop at once the suppression of Chongryon and make an apology and compensation for the crimes committed by Japan against the Korean people in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Left Bloc of the Austrian Trade Union Federation in a letter of protest expressed resentment at the Japanese authorities' evermore undisguised suppression of Chongryon and Koreans in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It went on:\r\n We lodge a strong protest with Japan against its intensified crackdown upon the Koreans in Japan and its unreasonable search operations against organizations under Chongryon and Koreans in Japan under an absurd pretext. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We bitterly assail the suppression of Chongryon by the Japanese authorities and demand the Japanese government stop it at once and lift the unreasonable sanctions against the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Demolition of Concrete Wall Urged \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 29 (KCNA) -- The military fascist clique in south Korea built a concrete wall 5-8 meters high, 10-19 meters wide at the bottom and 3-7 meters wide at the top, extending more than 240 km in the south side's area along the Military Demarcation Line, since 1977 to bisect the Korean nation at the instigation of the U.S. imperialists. \r\n The concrete wall initiated by the \"Yusin\" dictator and built by anti-reunification military dictators is a wall of division for cutting off the blood veins of the Korean nation and perpetuating its division, says Rodong Sinmun in a by-lined article Friday.\r\n The concrete wall bears witness to the hideous crimes of the traitors who pursued their ambition for power while seeking a way-out in the division of the country, clean indifferent to the destiny of the nation, the author of the article says, and goes on:\r\n The wall is a big shame and blot in the history of the Korean nation that has lived as a homogenous nation down through history spanning 5,000 years.\r\n In the time-honored history of the Korean nation, it built walls to defend the country from foreign aggression and safeguard national dignity and security. But there was no such a wall as the concrete wall built by the south Korean military fascist clique to bisect the country and gratify their greed for power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The concrete wall is never tolerable to the Korean nation which has lived as a homogenous nation, creating brilliant culture and history in one and the same territory for 5,000 years. And it is quite abnormal that such a wall still remains even in the era of reunification after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration.\r\n Huge resources, human and material, were consumed in the building of the wall which cuts across the territory of Korea, dividing it into two. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its demolition is a demand of the times and nation that brooks no further delay.\r\n The group of the Grand National Party of south Korea, forsaken by the nation and pushed to the margin of history, is getting more hysteric in the drive for division and confrontation while desperately clinging to such leftovers of the Cold War era as the \"National Security Law\" and the concrete wall, products of the crimes of their predecessors. This is an outright challenge to the trend of the times and the nation's desire for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The era of \"By our nation itself\" is not compatible with the concrete wall. It must be pulled down immediately.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Children and pupils enjoyed various folk games including kite flying, sleigh riding and top spinning on the day, stirring up the festive mood. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The 4th National Ssirum (Korean Wrestling) Tournament for the \"Grand Bull Prize\" was held at the Ssirum Ground on Rungra Island to mark Chusok (lunar August 15), a folk holiday. Tens of strongmen from across the country gathered there and competed for the grand bull and a gold bell. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The public interest in paduk (go), a folk game, is ever growing among grown-ups and children as days go by. It has been known as an \"intelligent martial arts\" in the world. There were the paduk contest of children in Pyongyang in February and, recently, the 2006 contest for selecting the best paduk players among children in Pyongyang.\r\n The 6th national folk game contest of agricultural working people was held to celebrate the 58th anniversary of the DPRK. More than 400 agricultural working people competed in Taekwon-Do, Yut-game, Ssirum, Swinging, Seesaw and other events.\r\n Efforts have been made to develop the Korean costumes to suit modern sense of beauty this year. New Korean dress samples were created. Their beautiful patterns and gracefully embroidered decorations are in well blend with each other.\r\n The 4th National Korean Costume Exhibition held in September marked a turning point in the efforts to develop the Korean costumes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Efforts have been bent to restore folk songs and classic dances including dance pieces belonging to Koguryo and Palhae period to the original state and reproduce them to suit the requirement of the times. And Okryugum and other national stringed instruments were also improved so as to display to the full the playing technique of national instruments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A deep attention has been directed to the development of folk dishes. The 14th Pyongyang food festival to mark the April holiday and dish shows were held in different parts of the country. At the events, the participants exchanged their experience and technology of processing folk dishes from taste, color and shape of the food to its arrangement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And many folk dishes were discovered and their cooking methods were standardized.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
