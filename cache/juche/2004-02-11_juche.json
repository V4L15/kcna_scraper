This is an undeniable historical fact. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even now tens of thousands of families of victims live in Korea, their bitter grudge against the Japanese imperialists unvented, and there are not a few survivors. Most of the 700,000 Koreans residing in Japan are either victims and their children or their descendents. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Compulsory labor\", \"conscription\", \"student soldier\" and \"voluntary labor corps\" and other words are recorded in the publications and official documents in those days and the modern history related to Korea-Japan relations. Are all these terminologies not evidence proving the truth about the forcible drafting? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Terauchi, who was the first governor general of Korea of the Japanese imperialists, blustered that \"Koreans should abide by the Japanese law or die\". This outcry suffices to show what the \"free will\" granted by Japan to the Koreans was like. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists took away boys and girls, to say nothing of young and middle-aged Koreans, to Japan under this or that pretext from the early period of their occupation of Korea and forced them to do slave labor. They were hell-bent on the forcible requisition of labor force in a bid to settle the shortage of labor force during the continental aggression and the Pacific war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists against humanity can never be concealed nor be negated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the legal and moral responsibility of Japan and the unanimous demand of the international community for Japan to frankly admit and apologize for and repent of its past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan makes a mockery of the history by shamelessly working to tamper with it and inventing lies in a bid to evade its responsibility, it will add to its hideous crimes and will not be able to shake itself of the ill-fame of being a \"war criminal state.\"    \r\n\r\n"

This marked a significant occasion in the history of the party and the revolution. Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says this in a signed article.\r\n The important historic task of carrying forward Kim Il Sung's idea and cause in the Korean revolution was successfully solved by Kim Jong Il possessed of incomparably extraordinary ideological and theoretical wisdom and leadership ability and unusual qualification and trait as a politician of a general type, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His 40-year long history of revolutionary leadership represents a glorious history in which Kim Il Sung's idea and cause have been successfully carried forward. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The cause of perpetuating the memory of the President was most successfully accomplished and one victory after another was won in the confrontation with the imperialists in the 1990s. This was, indeed, an unforgettable decade that represented a revolutionary history of great succession. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Il Sung's revolutionary idea has been steadily carried forward and developed to meet the requirements of the era and serves as a militant banner leading the Korean revolution and the cause of independence to victory. This is the most precious exploit as it helped glorify the history of succession to the revolutionary cause of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il formulated Kim Il Sung's revolutionary idea and clarified its absolute position in the history of human thought in his historic work published on February 19, 1974. It was an event of weighty significance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He published many famous works including \"Socialism Is a Science\" and \"On the Fundamental Problems in Building the Revolutionary Party\" in the 1990s. These works serve as militant banners as they indicated the ways of leading the Korean revolution and the cause of independence to victory despite the imperialists' counter-revolutionary offensive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He, with a deep insight into the ever-changing conditions and environment of the revolution in the 21st century, set out the Songun idea. This is an immortal exploit as he provided a treasured sword for winning a sure victory in the popular masses' cause of independence. It is the greatest feat he performed in carrying forward Kim Il Sung's idea that he has steadily developed and enriched his revolutionary idea to be a weapon to carry out an uninterrupted revolution through his energetic ideological and theoretical activities and glorified the glorious history of the revolution of Juche advancing with the might of ideology.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

He said he was really worried over the tilting of the social trend of south Korea toward anti-U.S. and pro-north.\r\n The commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However desperately Choe may kick and scream, gone are the days when \"pro-north\" was called in question and falsely incriminated. Anti-U.S. and national cooperation are the desire and will of all the Koreans that nobody can dampen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Choe revealed his true colors as a pro-U.S. flunkeyist traitor, an anti-DPRK confrontation fanatic and an anti-reunification element by showing such anti-north hysterics. For this he has made himself a target of bitterer curse and denunciation, rejection and abandonment by the nation. There is no future for those who go against the nation and resort to treacheries and their lot is woefully miserable. This is proved by the end of the preceding ruling quarters of the GNP. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Choe should stop running amuck, mindful that he can never be an exception.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Japan, however, has since openly violated it and escalated its anti-DPRK moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With nothing can Japan justify its reckless perfidious act of violating the declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan will have to be held wholly responsible for the catastrophic consequences to be caused to the bilateral relations by its rash acts, the commentary warns.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
