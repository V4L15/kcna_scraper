In this regard the international law community asserted that declaration of independence is not a threat to the peace or breach of the peace and labeled the adoption of the sanction resolution as an act of abuse of power. And even the writers of the UN Charter clarified that they had drafted Article 39 referring to an act of aggression, not to be invoked for a sanction in a peaceful time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf any nuclear test or satellite or ballistic rocket launch were considered a \"threat to international peace and security\", the UNSC should have made an issue of and enforced sanctions on the United States and other countries regarding their nuclear tests of over 2 000 times, ongoing regular satellite and ballistic rocket launches.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis clearly proves that Article 39 of the UN Charter has no relation with any of nuclear tests or satellite launches.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe acts of fabricating an unlawful and immoral \"sanction resolution\", imposing sanctions of blockade and going as far as to include in the list of targets of sanctions even sports rifles or bullets and bows and arrows by the UNSC are nothing but an act against humanity and civilization, severely threatening the right to live of our people and destroying the modern civilization as well as making the whole world turn back to the medieval dark land.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe hydrogen bomb test, nuclear warhead test and test-firing of various means of strike including inter-continental ballistic rockets are all full exercise of the legitimate right as stipulated in the UN Charter, as self-defensive measures for deterrent power which can wipe out the source of provocation in case of the encroachment upon our sovereignty and right to existence by the hostile forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs long as the United States and its followers keep on nuclear threats and blackmails and as long as they do not stop their war games at our doorstep, disguising them as annual events, our self-defensive capabilities and the capability for preemptive strike with the nuclear armed forces as their pivot will be bolstered significantly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tI hope that the UN Secretariat will discharge its responsibility before the international community by pondering over the questions regarding a legal ground of the \"sanctions resolutions\" against the DPRK and by responding with impartial answers to them in conformity with the basic mission of the UN for international peace and security."

He held \"summit talks\" and a joint press conference and released a \"statement\" in which he honored the memory of the American victims and expressed \"hope that Pearl Harbor would be remembered as a symbol of reconciliation.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Abe also uttered that he felt calmly proud of Japan's going for peace for over seven decades after the war, expressing resolve to \"make sure the horrors of war are not repeated.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the talks with Obama, Abe stressed the need to expand the scope of Japan-U.S. alliance for peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region and further strengthen the tri-angular military alliance with the U.S. and south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He let out a flurry of rhetoric touring here and there but the summary of what he uttered was just a formal gesture of honoring the memory of those killed without making any apology and reflection on the past crimes, the article says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Abe's visit to Pearl Harbor was an action taken by him to take revenge on Obama for the disgrace and insult the former suffered in Hiroshima last year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t And it was, at the same time, a mendicant trip to prevent the Japan-U.S. alliance from rapidly shaking owing to the expected inauguration of the new master of the White House and a hypocritical tour by the boss of the Japanese militarists aiming at realizing the old dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\" under the spurious signboard of \"peace.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter what ulterior purposes Abe may pursue in clinging to the U.S., they will get him nowhere.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The best way for Japan to escape its ruin is to make a sincere apology for its past crimes, pay adequate reparation for them and definitely give up its ambition for reinvasion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The bellicose moves of Abe to realize the scenario for staging a comeback to Korea and the rest of Asia, backed by the U.S. will only result in bringing the archipelago of Japan to the bottom of the sea."
