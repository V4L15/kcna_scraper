            "content": "S. Korean Authorities' Vote for U.S. Resolution against North Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, November 19 (KCNA) -- The south Korean authorities shamelessly showed their hand in favor of a UN resolution on human rights in north Korea at the instigation of the U.S.\r\n A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland in a statement on Nov. 18 dismissed the south Korean authorities' approval of the resolution as a treacherous provocative act of joining in the U.S. criminal act to internationalize the \"human rights issue\" together with the nuclear issue and escalate international sanctions and pressure against the DPRK and an intolerable anti-reunification act of destroying the groundwork of the June 15 joint declaration and hamstringing the development of the north-south relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"human rights abuses\" in the north much touted by the U.S. are nothing but a sheer fabrication aimed to undermine and bring down the DPRK and a poor pretext that can be made only by those who are afraid of the advantage and invincibility of man-centred Korean-style socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities have already sacrificed the humanitarian undertakings between the fellow countrymen to serve outsiders, chiming in with the U.S. moves to apply sanctions and pressure upon the DPRK. They also laid another stumbling block in the way of improving the inter-Korean relations by joining in the collective sanctions against the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities' act of joining in the U.S. anti-DPRK human rights racket adds another crime to their treacherous crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With no clumsy excuses can the south Korean authorities justify their act of slandering the advantageous social system in the north and pushing the north-south relations back to those in the era of confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those maintaining their power by reading the face of outsiders rather than defending the dignity and interests of the nation would have no face to sit with the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities will be fully accountable for all the serious consequences to be entailed by their criminal act of laying another stumbling block in the way of improving the north-south relations.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun says this in a signed article Sunday. \r\n The idea of \"By our nation itself\", the core of the inter-Korean joint declaration, reflects the idea for the Korean nation to resolve the national issue, the issue of national reunification by its concerted efforts with responsibility, not allowing any outside interference, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea reflects the will of the Workers' Party of Korea to achieve national reunification independently and peacefully with the great unity of the nation in the interests of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea opened a new era of national history, the era of independent national reunification which was beyond imagination before. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At present all the fellow countrymen value the idea, the spirit and banner of the times opening and leading the era of independent national reunification, and are full of firm will to defend the honor and dignity of the nation. It is the unshakable determination and will of all the fellow countrymen to achieve great national unity and the peace and independent reunification of the country under the banner of \"By our nation itself\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The vigorous advance of the June 15 era of reunification under the banner of the idea despite the vicious challenge and obstructive moves of the anti-reunification forces at home and abroad clearly proves that the idea is the banner of promoting and leading the development of the era of independent reunification and the idea of the whole nation representing tremendous validity and vitality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It can be said that the advance of the June 15 era of reunification was the process of applying the idea of \"By our nation itself\". All the achievements made in the struggle for national unity and reunification since the publication of the June 15 joint declaration are the brilliant fruition borne by the idea of \"By our nation itself\", the main spirit of the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea is more shining in the struggle for defending peace of the country and security of the nation and advancing the cause of independent reunification today when the U.S. imperialists have become all the more undisguised in their moves to provoke a new war against DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With no desperate efforts the separatists at home and abroad can stamp out the idea of \"By our nation itself\" deep-rooted in the hearts of the Korean nation and block the advance of the June 15 era of reunification under its banner.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The commentary urges Japan to fully apologize and compensate for the crimes of its colonial rule over Korea.\r\n The \"Ulsa Five-Point Treaty\", which was rigged up on Nov. 17, 1905, is an illegal and hideous treaty unprecedented in history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the strength of the illegal treaty the Japanese imperialists deprived the Korean nation of national rights and forced them to the miserable fate of slavery under their harsh colonial rule of many years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Since they occupied Korea by force of arms and turned it into a big prison, they had inflicted uncountable human and material calamity on the Korean nation and schemed to exterminate the Korean nation itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n More than a century has passed since the treaty was fabricated for the purpose of shackling the Korean nation to the fetters of colonial slavery and 60 years since the defeat of the Japanese imperialists. However Japan has not yet apologized and compensated to the Korean nation for its hideous act of aggression and unethical crimes against the Korean nation. On the contrary, the Japanese reactionaries have distorted and justified their blood-stained history of aggression. They have become evermore frantic in their moves for comeback to Korea, claiming Tok Islet, a sacred territory of Korea, as their land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They let loose extreme provocative outcries that Japan may launch a war with the north, openly resorting to a hostile policy towards the DPRK, pursuant to the U.S. imperialists' moves to provoke a war of aggression against Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is an inveterate and sworn enemy of the Korean nation in the view of the past history and the present reality. The Japanese reactionaries would be well advised to immediately drop their wild dream of staging comeback to Korea which will be entailed a catastrophic disaster.      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is an intolerable provocation against the DPRK and a treacherous crime seeking to act as a shock brigade in executing the U.S. nuclear war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This clearly proves once again that it is not just accidental that the south Korean warlike forces are spurring on war exercises against the north and arms build-up with the backing of the U.S., but it is prompted by their sinister purpose to launch a new war together with the outsiders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"preemptive attack on the north\" means provocation of a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean warlike forces, nuclear war servants of the U.S., had better behave with discretion, bearing in mind that they, along with their masters, will never escape a shameless defeat in face of merciless and just counterattack from the north.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Such genuine democracy is socialist democracy, says Rodong Sinmun Sunday in a signed article.\r\n There can never be genuine democracy in the capitalist society where all the state power is in the hands of a few capitalists and it is based on individualism, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The popular masses cannot seize power and they are excluded from independent political activities and the state power is in the clutches of a handful capitalists. This is one of main reasons why there can never be genuine democracy in the capitalist society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another reason why there can never be genuine democracy in the capitalist society is that this society is based on extreme individualism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Democracy claimed by the imperialists is sham democracy and it is no more than a camouflage to deceive the popular masses and cover the reactionary nature of bourgeois dictatorship and the unpopular nature of the capitalist system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bourgeois democracy, so-called democracy in the capitalist society, provides freedom and rights to the privileged capitalists only and no rights and equality are given to the broad grassroots masses. This democracy, therefore, can not be called democracy in its true sense of the word. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The false and reactionary nature of bourgeois democracy can be found in the socio-political lives of Americans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are many youngsters roaming about to get food and homeless and unemployed people in the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The freedom of speech and the freedom of the press in the U.S. where the reactionary American rulers loudly propagandized about the application of democracy are no more than bourgeois democracy, bogus democracy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Free election campaigns which the U.S. rulers advertise as model of democracy clearly prove the true nature of bourgeois democracy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They say equal opportunity and equal freedom and rights are provided to all people but, in fact, it is only a handful of privileged strata who benefit from them.
