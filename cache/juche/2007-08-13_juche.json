By this act, they robbed the Koreans of their vast area of land and forests including tideland and cultivated land and legally protected landownership of feudal landlords and used it as a foundation for enforcing their colonial rule over Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A spokesman for the History Society of the DPRK said this in a statement issued Sunday, 95 years since the fabrication of the \"act.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They looted as many as more than one million hectares of land by force of the above-said \"act.\" As a result, a great many Korean peasants were deprived of land, a means of living handed down to them by their ancestors, and reduced to colonial slaves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While deriving Koreans of land in such brutal manner, the Japanese imperialists robbed Korea of its natural resources lock, stock and barrel during their colonial rule. They even committed such unprecedented atrocities as depriving Koreans of their spoken and written languages and their own names.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, Japan has refused to repent of the past crimes it committed against the Korean nation though more than six decades have passed since its defeat. Worse still, it is becoming more desperate in its confrontation with the DPRK, while whitewashing its crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's moves to revive militarism, racket of confrontation with the DPRK, actions to grab Tok Islet and campaign to destroy the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) are reminiscent of the Japanese imperialists' robber-like aggression of Korea before a century and their brutal actions to exterminate the people of Korea, their colony. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The Koreans will never pardon the hideous crimes committed against the Koreans by Japan, their sworn enemy, and its moves to exterminate the Korean nation in this century but force it to pay for them a thousand times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It should make an immediate apology and compensation for those crimes and stop at once the suppression of Chongryon.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Gone are days never to return when the Western powers could decide on the destiny of humankind and international issues while perpetrating such arbitrary practices as dominating, subjugating, threatening, blackmailing and pressurizing other countries in the international arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The war moves of the U.S. imperialists against peace are touching off strong protest and denunciation among people in different parts of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Afghanistan and Iraq which the U.S. occupied by force of arms have turned into pitfalls of death for the U.S. troops. The U.S. neo-cons who arrogantly vociferated about \"strength is almighty\" are now being ousted from power. The U.S. ruling quarters who had asserted \"victory\" in Iraq have grown impatient, uneasy and frustrated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists' failure of the policy of strength has become a stark reality in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n History shows that all those keen to swallow up other countries went to ruin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists would be well advised to properly understand history and drop their anachronistic ambition to dominate the world by force of power.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's Shameless Moves to Deny Its Past Crimes under Fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, August 11 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a by-lined article condemns the Japanese reactionaries for leaving no stone unturned to deny Japan's crime-woven history and evade their responsibility for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japanese ultra-right conservatives conveyed a written protest to the U.S. embassy in Tokyo demanding the withdrawal of the resolution adopted by the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee urging the Japanese government to make an official apology for forcing women into sexual servitude for the Imperial Japanese Army. Their action is a base one intended to deny Japan's aggression and keep it buried into oblivion in history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's moves to deny and falsify the historical facts are an intolerable challenge to justice and human conscience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' claim that Japan had never forced women into sexual slavery is a sheer lie and an artifice to shirk the responsibility for the crime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is more intolerable is that the Japanese reactionaries are working hard to use the voices demanding Japan make an apology and compensation for the crimes ringing out louder from among the Korean people and other Asians as a good opportunity to stoke bitterness towards the DPRK among Japanese. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are persistently raising the issue of abduction which had already found a solution, while keeping mum about the issue of \"comfort women\" for the Imperial Japanese Army. They are driving the DPRK-Japan hostile ties to an extreme pitch of tension, insisting that it is impossible to improve the bilateral relations without resolving the abduction issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The on-going fascist crackdown upon the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) and Koreans in Japan is a deliberate and premeditated political provocation aimed at showdown with the DPRK in all aspects. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' outrageous suppression of Chongryon only adds to the crimes perpetrated by Japan against the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are talking about \"anger\" and the like over the world's mounting protest and condemnation of the sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army. This is little short of calling on the Japanese to more vigorously wield militarist swords in the samurai spirit, remaining undeterred by the just voices of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present times are the era of independence against imperialism, and peace. The rash acts of the Japanese reactionaries will lead Japan to isolation and self-destruction only.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Kanbaek between Mts. Paektu and Sobaek. It has favorable natural and geographical conditions for the stationing of a large unit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The camp served as a base for the training of core elements for an all-people resistance and as an assembly area of units for the final battles with the Japanese imperialist during the national liberation operations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President came to the camp in September 1938, June 1941 and several other occasions where he put forward the strategic and tactical policies for expanding the anti-Japanese armed struggle into the homeland and accelerating the historic cause of national liberation and wisely led the efforts to implement them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is a monument to the President's proposition in the camp. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Preserved there are the headquarters' log cabin where the President guided the work with the small groups of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army, groups of political underground workers and underground revolutionary organizations active in the northern areas of Korea and the work of training core elements for the all-people resistance, and the house for guards near the cabin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Sites of barrack, cooking, campfire, hospital, military drill ground and others are seen in the camp. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kept there are trees bearing such revolutionary slogans as \"General star of Mt.
