The Lee group is the worst pro-U.S. and pro-Japanese traitors putting \"the five traitors of 1905\" into the shade and the enemy of the nation as it stoops to any treachery to do harm to the fellow countrymen. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the Asians including the Koreans can never escape a nuclear war disaster as long as the Lee group is allowed to be at large. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thrice-cursed traitor Lee Myung Bak is bound to meet a miserable end in face of all compatriots' rebuff and condemnation as he has been hell-bent on despicable sycophancy and treachery to serve the U.S. and Japan since the very day of his seizure of power."

            "content": "Ministry of Post and Telecommunications Denounces Lee Myung Bak Group's Smear Campaign\r\n Pyongyang, May 18 (KCNA) -- The group of rat-like Lee Myung Bak, hordes of the worst traitors, is making its desperate efforts, sticking to its bad habit of escalating the confrontation with fellow countrymen. \n\t\t\t\t\t The group is busy staging a new farce and smear campaign against the DPRK over the damage done by jamming. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications gave the following answer to the question put by KCNA in this regard on Friday:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to the formal announcement by the politicians including the chairman of the Broadcasting and Communication Committee and media of south Korea, all parts of south Korea had been in mayhem due to jamming for 16 days from April 28 to mid-May. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t More than 670 planes and 110 odd ships suffered from jamming. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There was the possibility of big accidents likely to claim big casualties. Airplanes, subject to jamming just before landing, had to divert their courses and circle in the air before landing in horror.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Drone S-100 of the south Korean navy on its test-flight was jammed and suddenly struck like a \"missile\" the vehicle which controlled it, leaving several people dead and seriously wounded. There were such accidents in which aircraft belonging to the U.S. forces in south Korea and the south Korean army could not fly properly during war exercises targeted against the north and were forced to land hastily. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There were a lot of abnormal happenings in which control systems of sailing warships of the south Korean navy and many civilian ships were paralyzed due to the troubled GPS satellite navigation system and lost their directions. It is not easy to guess the mayhem as south Korean warships which should be in the waters south of the Military Demarcation Line were detected to be on the land of South Hwanghae Province of the DPRK. A 29,000-ton class passenger ship and oil transport lost their courses and they were in the danger of bumping against each other. There occurred such cases for several consecutive days in which fishing boats during their operations sailed beyond fishing grounds toward the north. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was reported that on the ground, the main communication system used by the puppet army units was jammed, compelling it to switchover to an emergency wire and wireless communication system which was supposed to use as a reserve one.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sky, land and seas of south Korea are in utter confusion due to this jamming plus mad-cow disease. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is said that the Heaven knows who does the most evil thing and metes out punishment to him. No wonder, there is a rumor in south Korea that the group of traitors is paying a dear price for its thrice-cursed crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters is that the group of traitors, which was so stunned by such terrible mayhem that it kept mum for sometime, came to its senses, though belatedly, and began staging the above-said farce and smear campaign against the DPRK.   \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At first, the group was so stupid as to assert radio signals seemed to come from the north but later denied itself the story, saying this was not scientifically confirmed for fear of something.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then the group said in the end it was clear those signals came from Kaesong. Recently it spread misinformation that the north used a vehicle-shape means for jamming the GPS imported from Russia and stopped the jamming operation under the influence of China which was allegedly urged by Lee to tell the north to halt it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Rat-like Lee Myung Bak group is behaving like sleep-walking patients. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In a word, the group is sticking to its inveterate bad habit of accusing others in a bid to shake off the disgrace. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When an attempt to send a \"written protest \" to the DPRK in the name of the chairman of the puppet Broadcasting and Communication Committee and Media was frustrated, puppet forces are busy visiting the International Telecommunication Union and the International Civil Aviation Organization, etc. as part of their ridiculous diplomacy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As an old fable of Korea says, for one trying to pass the buck for one's wrongs to others is an attribute peculiar to a rat.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is well known to the world that after fabricating the Cheonan warship sinking case, the Lee group deliberately brushed aside so many suspicions raised at home and abroad and labeled it  the case \"linked with the north\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was brought to light that the group wrote letters \"No. 1\" on the propelling body of the torpedo in a bid to prove that the case was \"linked with the north\" and it was recorded in the history of nation as unprecedentedly hideous fabrication. The group, however, failed to drop that bad habit.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen the system of the financial computer network of the \"Agricultural Cooperative\" of south Korea was thrown into the worst state of paralysis in April last year to cause a loss to the tune of a hundred million won and suffer disgrace in the eyes of the world, the puppet group instructed the puppet intelligence service and prosecution to draw a conclusion that they were caused by the \" north\" and hastily make it public. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At that time even members of the cooperative, the victim, asserted that the above-said announcement was a hasty conclusion as it lacked a scientific ground and even the security planning board of the puppet army formally clarified that the above-said happenings could not be described as an attack of the north Korean military. All these things took place later. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It also took place shortly ago that the Lee group blamed the north for even the \"cyber-terror against the election management committee,\" a product of the mean scramble of the ruling party for power, only to suffer bitter disgrace. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Looking back on history, it was none other than the rat-like Lee group that foolishly behaved to put under control all untoward incidents, big and small, which happened inside south Korea due to wrong politics by spreading stories that the north was linked with them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is obvious is that all the misinformation that something was done by the north and something was linked with it floated by the group finally turned out to be a farce and fabrication for escalating confrontation with compatriots without an exception. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The story about the north's jamming spread by the group of traitors is nothing but a desperate effort to shirk off even a bit the heavy responsibility for its thrice-cursed high treason. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group is making its last ditch-efforts to escape punishment for its crimes but it should know that it is too late. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What remains to be done by the group is to make apology to the whole nation and the world and commit suicide. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group stuck to its inveterate bad habit of shifting the blame for the scandals committed by its clan onto compatriots. This once again fully revealed that the Lee group is no more than a group of rats in human skin. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group should bear in mind that evil doers are bound to suffer greater misfortune and disasters."

            "content": "Korean Jurists Committee Issues White Paper Denouncing U.S. Application of Double Standards against DPRK\r\n Pyongyang, May 18 (KCNA) -- The American-style logic of strength is undisguisedly applied at the UN Security Council due to the U.S. application of double standards, gravely infringing upon the independent rights of sovereign countries including the DPRK. The Korean Jurists Committee Thursday made public a white paper denouncing these practices.\n\t\t\t\t\t The white paper discloses the criminal aims of the anti-DPRK campaign staged by the U.S. by wire-pulling the UNSC and its reactionary nature. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. anti-DPRK campaign amounts to the most shameless act of aggression as it denies the ideology and system in the DPRK and stifle it and realize its ambition for dominating the whole of Korea, the white paper notes, and goes on: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has frantically lobbied to get the UNSC adopt \"resolutions on sanctions\" against the DPRK by applying double standards. This is a criminal scenario to implement its policy for dominating the whole of Korea with ease, taking advantage of the situation created due to the change in the balance of international forces after the demise of the era of the Cold War and the environment in the international arena where it can resort to high-handed and arbitrary practices, styling itself \"the world's only superpower,\" in particular. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should be viewed as an absolute entity and any country and any international body should obey its instruction and it has the right to claim it and disregard international bodies. This is the U.S. way of thinking and its stance as the \"world's only superpower\" on the international organizations after the demise of the era of the Cold War. Even UNSC permanent members are taking attitudes of conniving at the practices of prioritizing their own interests rather than assuming responsibility for preserving world peace and security. This makes the U.S. application of double standards more undisguised. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The white paper deals with illegality of the \"resolutions on sanctions\" against the DPRK cooked up by the U.S. at the UNSC by applying its double standards. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the anti-DPRK \"resolutions\" cooked up by the U.S. at the UNSC are products of its anti-DPRK moves to antagonize the DPRK and pressurize it and illegal ones fabricated in disregard of the universally accepted international laws. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their illegality lies firstly in that they blatantly disregarded the requirements of the UN Charter in the light of their purpose and motive.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As far as the DPRK's nuclear test is concerned, it is a measure for self-defence to cope with the U.S. nuclear threat from A to Z. If the issue is to be properly settled, the UNSC should take issue with the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK and its nuclear threat to the DPRK, to begin with.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Moreover, there is no ground whatsoever for the UNSC to handle the issue of the DPRK's satellite launch. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The UNSC, however, took a wrong step of taking issue with the DPRK's satellite launch only by applying the double standards, acting beyond the mandate invested in it by the UN Charter under the U.S. pressure. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their illegality lies secondly in that they were fabricated in violation of the principle of the UN activities which calls for respecting the rights and duties of the member states stemming from the international treaty and strictly basing themselves on it.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After acceding to the international space treaties before launching satellites for peaceful purposes, the DPRK exercised its right as a sovereign state regarding space, strictly observing the commitments stipulated in the treaties as a member of them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If this was wrong, there can be only the conclusion that the above-said treaties were wrong and all the satellites launched by members of the treaties after acceding to them were wrong. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As it is the inveterate stand of the U.S. to view and approach everything done by the DPRK from its viewpoint of confrontation, it has systematically used the UN for internationalizing its hostile viewpoint and policies that the use of nuclear energy and space development for peaceful purposes should be unconditionally checked as they may lead to bolstering the military muscle, a threat to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. should bear in mind that it can neither disarm the DPRK nor stifle it economically by dint of UNSC \"resolutions on sanctions\" which lack any propriety of international laws in a bid to bring down the ideology and system chosen by the Korean people, the white paper stresses, and continues: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the legitimate sovereign right of the DPRK is infringed upon even a bit by dint of UNSC presidential statement or resolutions or by dint of worse ones, the DPRK will vehemently oppose and repudiate them.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean Jurists Committee, expressing expectation that all judicial institutions and organizations and jurists of the world would echo the Korean people's voices of justice critical of the U.S. application of the double standards, strongly urges some states not to blindly follow the U.S. in its hostility towards the DPRK, under the influence of its high-handed and arbitrary practices."

If the triangular military alliance is concluded, it will mean an emergence of the above-said military alliance perfected in military and legal terms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already mentioned, the appearance of the triangular military alliance is little short of a dangerous military adventure bringing the dark clouds of the era of a new cold war and a new world war to hang over Northeast Asia including the Korean Peninsula as it is an appearance of NATO of Asian-version, pursuant to the U.S. Asia strategy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a matter of fact, the U.S. decided to start the first tripartite joint military drill depending on the conclusion of this military agreement under the pretext of coping with increasing \"military threat\" and \"provocation\" from someone and consult the issue at the 11th Asian Security Dialogue to be held in Singapore in coming June. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters is that the rat-like traitor Lee opted to conclude the military agreements which even by the successive rulers of south Korea hesitated to do so though they were pro-U.S. and pro-Japanese, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is more intolerable is that he made such decision at a time when the Japanese reactionaries are getting undisguised in their ambition for territorial expansion and, consequently, the anti-Japanese sentiment of the Korean nation and other Asian peoples is mounting as the days go by. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee is steeped in pro-Japanese tendency that he seems to have decided not to remain part of the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since he came to power, Lee has been keen on disgraceful acts of serving Japan, talking about \"future-oriented relations, not asking about the past\" and \"a new era of cooperation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With his office drawing to a close, he is busy advertising \"Japan's role\" and creating conditions for the conclusion of military agreements with Japan, asserting that it recognized Japan as the \"country which assisted\" it and the like. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He is working hard to create an atmosphere of extreme confrontation on the Korean Peninsula and in its vicinity under the pretext of \"military threat\" from someone and \"joint counteraction\" in a bid to calm down the anti-Japanese spirit of the Korean people and other Asians and pave the way for the Japanese reactionaries' reinvasion of Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His intention is to remain a pro-Japanese element till his death.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For this reason, people from all walks of life and public in south Korea brand the group of rat-like Myung Bak as traitors worse than \"the five traitors of 1905.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As proved by history, heinous Lee Myung Bak is bound to meet the most miserable end."

Esto es el punto de pensamiento de EE.UU. sobre las organizaciones internacionales despues del fin de la guerra fria y la posicion de la \"unica superpotencia\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tE incluso, la aplicacion de la pauta de doble rasero de EE.UU. se torna cada dia mas brutal porque los paises miembros permanentes del CS de la ONU toleran el acto del imperio dando prioridad a sus intereses mas que las responsabilidades por el mantenimiento de la paz y la seguridad internacionales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa carta revela la ilegalidad de la \"resolucion de sancion\" anti-RPDC inventada por EE.UU. aplicando la pauta de doble rasero en el CS de la ONU, y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas \"resoluciones\" anti-RPDC inventadas por EE.UU. en el CS de la ONU son frutos de las maquinaciones anti-RPDC de EE.UU. para hostilizar y reprimir esta y falsificaciones ilegales inventadas por el imperio despreciando las leyes internacionales generales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa ilegalidad reside, primero, en despreciar cruelmente la demanda de la Carta de la ONU en el proposito y motivo de la aprobacion de la resolucion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC hizo la prueba nuclear como medida autodefensiva frente a la amenaza nuclear de EE.UU. Por lo tanto, el CS de la ONU debe cuestionar, ante todo, la politica hostil anti-RPDC y la amenaza nuclear de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor colmo, el CS de la ONU no tiene ninguna razon de tratar el lanzamiento del satelite artificial de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA pesar de esto, tomo las injustas medidas aplicando la pauta de doble rasero solo en cuanto al lanzamiento de satelite artificial de la RPDC por encima de su autoridad atribuida por la Carta de la ONU bajo la obligacion de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOtra ilegalidad reside en que las resoluciones fueron trazadas en contrapelo de los principios de actividades de la ONU de respetar los derechos y deberes de los paises miembros provenientes de los tratados internacionales y basar cabalmente en ellos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAntes de lanzar los satelites artificiales con fines pacificos, la RPDC se ingreso en los Tratados Espaciales Internacionales y ejercio los derechos de un Estado soberano sobre el espacio observando correctamente el deber estipulado en ellos como pais miembro signatario.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi esto es la cosa erronea saca la conclusion de que son erroneos los mismos tratados espaciales internacionales y todos los lanzamientos de satelites realizados por los paises miembros signatarios.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl imperio acostumbrado en tratar toda la cosa de la RPDC desde el punto de vista conflictivo, abusa sistematicamente de la ONU para internacionalizar la concepcion hostil y la politica de impedir a ciegas el uso de energia nuclear y el desarrollo espacial con fines pacificos de la RPDC porque esta puede utilizarlos en el fortalecimiento de las fuerzas militares para amenazar al primero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, EE.UU. debe darse clara cuenta de que con la \"resolucion de sancion\" del CS de la ONU que no tiene ninguna adecuacion de la ley internacional, no puede derribar la ideologia y el regimen optados por el pueblo coreano desarmando y sofocando la economia de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAunque se adopten otros documentos mas rigurosos que la declaracion presidencial y la resolucion del CS de la ONU, la RPDC los rechazara categoricamente si violan su justo derecho soberano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Comite de Juristas de Corea expresa la esperanza de que todas las organizaciones y entidades juridicas y los juristas del mundo se sumen a la voz justa del pueblo coreano que rechaza las maquinaciones de aplicacion de la pauta de doble rasero de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Y demanda a algunos paises no obedecer ni actuar a ciegas en cuanto a los actos hostiles anti-RPDC  de EE.UU. cohibidos ante su coaccion y arbitrariedad."
