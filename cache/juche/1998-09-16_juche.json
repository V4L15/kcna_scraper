            "content": "Sheer absurdity of Japan =KCNA commentary=\r\n    Pyongyang, September 16 (KCNA) -- Japan is acting rashly in the wake of the DPRK's launching of an artificial satellite.\r\n   A delegation from the ruling Japan Liberal Democratic Party, when meeting with delegates of leading member nations of the United Nations Security Council in the United States, begged for a \"statement on apprehensions about North Korea's missile launching.\"\r\n   The \"missile launching\" is false propaganda designed to distort the DPRK's launching of the first artificial satellite. It is not a matter that should be discussed at the UN the delegation, therefore, got a chilly reception, refuted to its face at the UN  the mendicant diplomacy which comes when politicians of Japan are resorting to a frantic anti-DPRK campaign in Japan brings into bolder relief the viciousness and shamelessness of the right-wing reactionaries of Japan.\r\n   Japan, which still remains \"enemy state\" in the UN charter, must repent of its history of crimes committed against the Asian people, including the Korean people, and apologize to them. Instead it is now slandering the DPRK. \r\nIts misbehaviour cannot be pardoned at all.\r\n   Reactionaries of Japan with an old ambition for the \"greater East Asia coprosperity sphere\" are stepping up the building of Japan into a military power, overheated with war fever, clamouring about unstable situation on the Korean peninsula and in the Asia-Pacific region.\r\n   No sooner had the DPRK launched the artificial satellite than Japan claimed that a \"missile\" was launched. Even after it was officially reported that the carrier rocket of the artificial satellite was successfully launched and the artificial satellite was put into orbit Japan is getting frantic in an anti-DPRK campaign, persistently claiming that a \"missile\" was launched.\r\n   All this proves that the \"missile launching\" advertised by politicians of Japan as part of their anti-DPRK campaign is a product of their shameless plot for the criminal purpose of  building up public opinion at home and abroad over what they call \"military threat\" and justifying their arms buildup and the policy of building Japan into a military power. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
