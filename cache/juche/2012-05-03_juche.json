He asked commanding officers to convey his words that he highly estimated the service personnel who took part in their research and development.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He once again highly appreciated the enterprising work style of the officers of the unit with which they are making uninterrupted innovations and making leap forward while planning and conducting all the military and political work on a high level true to the WPK's idea of pushing back the frontiers of latest science and technology. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had a photo session with the service personnel of the unit, expressing expectation and conviction that they would firmly defend with arms the socialist country advancing for final victory, keeping themselves in a posture fully ready to go into action."

The number of satellites and space vehicles put by various countries into orbit by the end of 1989 reached 3 960. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world considers the level of space development as a yardstick for an advanced state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Space industry is regarded as a major one in the 21st century along with IT and nuclear industry.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has steadily advanced along the road of space development for peaceful purposes in line with the global trend of space development.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's launch of satellites by carrier means manufactured by itself and with its indigenous technology a hundred percent is a noticeable success in the world history of space development. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whether a country more frequently conquers space in this age of ultra modern science and technology or not is a matter on which its fate hinges -- whether it stands on its own foot in politics, economy and military affair or relies on others.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is clearly evidenced by the fact that the U.S. seeks to dominate the world through its Global Positioning System (GPS) and different countries and regions are making efforts to develop their own system to counter it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is an inviolable independent right for a sovereign state to develop the outer space for peaceful purposes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since the period of Cold War the U.S. has unilaterally put an embargo on the export of satellites and their related equipment in this field and has played the role of a disturber. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was the aims sought by the U.S. and its allies to bar other countries including anti-imperialist independent countries from putting satellites into space and monopolize it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. feigned ignorance of those countries meekly obedient to it launching satellites or inter-continental ballistic missiles, while disallowing those countries incurring its displeasure to launch even satellites for peaceful purposes and malignantly slandering them. This is the wicked intentions of the U.S. and its allies. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their application of such double standards has reached an extreme phase over the satellite launch of the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The history of the world space development does not know such precedent in which satellite launch for peaceful purposes has been interpreted as a missile launch. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Only the DPRK has become the target of the U.S. and its allies' pressure and smear campaign in which its satellite launch is labeled long-range missile launch. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and Japan took the lead in pulling up the DPRK over its satellite launch though they have rushed headlong into space militarization, going against the trend of the times, and polluted space. Why? \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their ulterior aim is to deter the DPRK from growing stronger in its national power and sovereignty through space development and prevent it from emerging a power at any cost. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's struggle to conquer space is a just struggle to achieve economic development and the prosperity of the country and defend the sovereignty of the country and the nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No one can block the DPRK in its grand drive for conquering space. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Many more satellites of the DPRK will be launched into space."

Crafty Japan seeks to gloss over its responsibility for its past crime by letting a nongovernmental organization pay a petty amount of money to victims of sexual slavery in a form of compensation. This is another insult and mockery of those victims. They urge the Japanese government to fulfill its state and legal responsibility for the crime, instead of paying a petty amount of money.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan refuses even to admit its crime-woven history, prompted by its militarist wild ambition. Japan has long dreamed of realizing its wild ambition for reinvasion. It was already right after its defeat that Japan nurtured this ambition. It has become more desperate to realize it with the rapid revival of militarism. This is the main reason why the Japanese reactionaries have remained unchanged in their stance not to admit their history of aggression and crimes, lending a deaf ear to the voices of human conscience.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world conscience demands Japan choose between the two options: to prick its own eyes itself or honestly settle its inglorious past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whether Japan will remain an honest member of the international community or not will entirely depend on itself."
