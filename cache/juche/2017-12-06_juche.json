These confrontational warmongering remarks cannot be interpreted in any other way but as a warning to us to be prepared for a war on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Worse still, the CIA director has made a provocation against us by impudently criticizing our supreme leadership which is the heart of our people. This is the revelation of the U.S. cunning and heinous intention which is to instigate our strong countermeasures and use them to ignite the fuse for a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The large-scale nuclear war exercises conducted by the U.S. in succession are creating touch-and-go situation on the Korean peninsula and series of violent war remarks coming from the U.S. high-level politicians amid such circumstances have made an outbreak of war on the Korean peninsula an established fact. The remaining question now is: when will the war break out.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The careless remarks of war by the inner circle of Trump and the reckless military moves by the U.S. substantiate that the current U.S. administration has made a decision to provoke a war on the Korean peninsula and is taking a step-by-step approach to get there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world should not harbor any prejudice in discerning who the main culprit behind the tense situation on the Korean peninsula is and who the violator of world peace and stability is.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is going frantic in advertising the nuclear war on the Korean peninsula every day and this invites our due vigilance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We do not wish for a war but shall not hide from it, and should the U.S. miscalculate our patience and light the fuse for a nuclear war, we will surely make the U.S. dearly pay the consequences with our mighty nuclear force which we have consistently strengthened.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. does not want to be burnt to death by the fire it ignites, it would better behave with prudence and caution."
