            "content": "Minju Joson ironiza conducta asquerosa de banda conservadora surcoreana\r\nPyongyang, 17 de mayo (ACNC) -- Con motivo de las elecciones \"presidenciales\" en el Sur de Corea, se conocio nuevamente el atributo repugnante de la banda del Partido de Corea Libre y la chusma pro-Park Geun-hye, de que se burla ahora todo el mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t Hong Jun Phyo, candidato \"presidencial\" por el \"Partido de Corea Libre\", pronuncio unos disparates tales como la \"gran unidad de conservadores\" y la \"eliminacion de las fuerzas izquierdistas pro-Norte\" y permitio reingresar al partido a los magnates conservadores, que habian sido expulsados del partido durante la \"limpieza de las fuerzas pro-Park\", y hasta a los que salieron voluntariamente para componer el otro \"Partido Parun\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por otra parte, los elementos pro-Park tambien se unieron al \"Partido de Corea Libre\" diciendo que \"no pueden depositar el destino en las fuerzas izquierdistas pro-Norte\" y \"estan en el dilema de vida o muerte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esto no pasa de ser una locura de las escorias humanas que sin tener el sentido elemental ni la capacidad de distinguir la realidad, hacen esfuerzos desesperados por evitar el arruinamiento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Asi ironiza el periodico Minju Joson en un comentario individual difundido este miercoles y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por sus inauditos crimenes cometidos desafiando a la opinion publica, fue dimitida y sometida al juicio la traidora Park Geun-hye quien recurria con frenesi a la infame politica antipopular, la dictadura fascista, la confrontacion fratricida y las maniobras de guerra de agresion a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSus complices conservadores y partidarios tambien estan a punto de ser condenados por la historia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ya hace mucho tiempo, los habitantes surcoreanos dieron espaldas a esos traidores, incluyendo los tipejos del \"Partido de Corea Libre\" y los conservadores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Crear nueva politica y nueva vida enterrando cuanto antes en la tumba de la historia a los politicos deformados y basuras humanas, esto es la aspiracion y voluntad de la poblacion surcoreana."
