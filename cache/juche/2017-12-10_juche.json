And the U.S. State Department seeks to modify such phrases as \"consent of flag states\" and \"reasonable grounds\" in the UN \"sanctions resolution\" 2375 into \"by use of all necessary measures\" in a bid to secure legal justification for sea blockade.\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun Sunday says:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. scenario for sea blockade against the DPRK can never be tolerated as it is just a wanton violation of its sovereignty and dignity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not content with kicking up the largest-ever nuclear war drills at seas and in the air after bringing huge strategic assets to the vicinity of the Korean peninsula, the U.S. is now talking about sea blockade against the DPRK. This is just a hideous provocation pushing the situation to an \"uncontrollable catastrophe\" and the brink of war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation clearly proves that the U.S. is just the thrice-cursed criminal wholly to blame for worsening the situation on the Korean peninsula and wrecking global peace and security and that the Trump cult deserves worldwide criticism for its sanctions racket to stifle the DPRK, a heinous crime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will regard the U.S. and its vassal forces' project for sea blockade against it as wanton infringement on its sacred sovereignty and dignity and another open declaration of war, and will never remain passive.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hostile forces should bear in mind that if they show a slightest sign of putting the blockade project into practice, a merciless countermeasure will be taken by the DPRK immediately."
