Japan plans to spend a huge amount of fund for 4 years for improving all the 4 Aegis ships it has in place. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This fact indicates that having embarked upon the road of overseas troops dispatch in real earnest with the backing of the U.S. in the wake of the September 11 incident Japan is speeding up the arms buildup for a war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's reckless arms buildup and its moves to become a military power not only escalate the tensions on the Korean peninsula but pose a great threat to the peace and security in Northeast Asia and other regions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though Japan has always talked about somebody's \"threat,\" the nature of its frantic arms buildup and its alarming scale go to prove that Japan is, indeed, chiefly to blame for stoking arms race in the Asia-Pacific region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Despite its prolonged economic stagnation Japan is rushing into reckless arms buildup. It is clear to everyone that this is intended to re-invade Korea and the rest of Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities incited war atmosphere, while adopting a decision to launch more spy satellites for espionage against the DPRK recently. They called for \"being on high alert as the international situation remains serious.\" This clearly indicates how desperately they are working to seize an opportunity and invent a pretext for launching reinvasion.    \r\n\r\n"
