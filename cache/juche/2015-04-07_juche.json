The mission of the satellite is to \"gather information\" on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t Earlier, Japan put into service at the maritime \"self-defence force\" new heli-capable escort craft Izumo with almost the same mission as that of aircraft carrier.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on this, Minju Joson Tuesday says this cannot be construed otherwise than a reckless military action of those obsessed by the wild ambition for militarization and the reinvasion of the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan talks such rubbish that the satellite launch and the escort craft deployment are aimed at meeting Japan's interests but it is just a lame excuse to cover up its true colors, the commentary notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the present regime, in particular, the Japanese reactionaries have become all the more frantic in their moves to become a military giant while revamping all legal and institutional mechanisms standing in the way of overseas invasion. This openly reveals their intention to revenge on the \"shame\" Japan sustained due to the defeat of its imperialism in the past and realize its old dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is the primary target of the Japanese reactionaries' overseas aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries calculate that they cannot realize their ambition for continental invasion without bringing down the DPRK which has emerged an invulnerable fortress of socialism and independence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Therefore, they are rushing headlong into militarization after laying a springboard from which to launch aggression overseas by taking the advantage of the U.S. policy for invading the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries would be well advised to stop their reckless acts, clearly understanding that their overseas aggression will only lead them to self-destruction."
