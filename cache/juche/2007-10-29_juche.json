The Japanese government is not opting to improve the bilateral relations under the pretext of the \"abduction issue\". This is affecting the resumption of the talks for the establishment of the Japan-DPRK diplomatic relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government should apologize and compensate for the unspeakable sufferings and pain imposed upon the Korean people in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the present Japanese government has not yet abandoned its wrong attitude toward the past wrongs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n I cannot repress resentment at preceding Dietmen's visits to the \"Yasukuni Shrine\" and Japanese rightwing organizations' moves to distort history textbooks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when the abnormal relations between Japan and the DPRK are brought to the earliest possible end, can the two countries become near and close countries, not near yet distant countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Society for the Japan-Korea Culture strongly demands the Japanese government give up its hostile policy toward the DPRK and retract its decision to extend the sanctions against the DPRK including a total embargo on the ship \"Mangyongbong-92.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will in the future, too, extend invariable support and encouragement to the struggle to achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea, promote Japan-DPRK friendship and protect the rights and national education of Koreans in Japan.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

elevarian la funcion y papel combativos de las celulas del partido para asi contribuir activamente al fortalecimiento y desarrollo del PTC y al cumplimiento de la causa de la construccion de la gran potencia prospera socialista. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El informe de la ocasion estuvo a cargo de Choe Yong Rim, quien dijo en particular: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En los primeros dias de la lucha revolucionaria antijaponesa, el Presidente Kim Il Sung presento la original teoria de construccion del partido a base de la idea Juche, organizo primero la organizacion de base del partido y, a manera de ampliarla y fortalecerla, fundo un partido revolucionario. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La idea, la teoria y las proezas de orientacion del Presidente para el fortalecimiento de las celulas del partido se llevan adelante por el respetado camarada Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En los primeros tiempos de su orientacion al PTC y la revolucion coreana, el Dirigente sistematizo integralmente la idea Juche y la teoria de construccion del partido jucheano y aclaro el rumbo y los medios para el fortalecimiento de las celulas del partido, organizacion de base del partido. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ademas, en su curso de orientacion a muchas celulas del partido preparo un brillante modelo en la labor de las celulas del partido. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El Dirigente condujo sabiamente el trabajo para convertir todas las celulas del partido en las de fidelidad y llevo a una nueva etapa la lucha historica por fortalecer el PTC en el eterno partido del Presidente Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La historica carta enviada el 10 de mayo del 80 (1991) de la Era Juche a los participantes en el cursillo nacional de los secretarios de celula del partido \"Fortalezcamos las celulas del partido\" resulta un gran programa que debe ser mantenido siempre por todas las celulas del partido. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  A lo largo de este ultimo decenio que data de la conferencia de secretarios de celula de todo el partido, las celulas del partido se han fortalecido en las puras entes ideologicas que comparten la ideologia y el proposito con la Direccion de la Revolucion y han glorificado su honor de poderoso fundamento para la defensa del socialismo y ejecutor de la politica del partido. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La tarea general que se presenta ante las celulas del partido es agrupar compactamente a todos los militantes y otros trabajadores en torno al Dirigente y llamarlos energicamente a la marcha general para conquistar las altas metas de la construccion de la gran potencia prospera socialista siguiendo a la direccion del partido sobre la revolucion mediante el Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Las celulas del partido deben actuar con la meta mas alta conveniente a la demanda del nuevo siglo para consolidar todas las celulas del partido en las filas revolucionarias infinitamente fieles al Dirigente y contribuir activamente a elevar la funcion y papel combativos del partido. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@En el conclave hubo intervenciones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@El foro continua.       \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
