The Japanese government was officially informed of the results of search through an appropriate channel.\r\n   Originally, Japan attempted to charge the DPRK with being \"kidnapper\" by raising outcries over the \"suspected kidnapping\" of Japanese persons by the DPRK.\r\n   But it is real kidnappings that the Japanese imperialists took millions of Koreans to Japan before the liberation of Korea and Kim Dae Jung was abducted in Tokyo in the '70s.\r\n   Japan, which is recognized as a perpetrator by history and the international community, gravely insulted the DPRK's sovereignty and dignity with outcries over \"kidnapping\" in a bid to paint itself as a victim. Its hostile act can never be tolerated.\r\n   Though the Japanese authorities cancelled the word of \"suspected kidnapping\" and requested the DPRK to find out missing persons, the results of search finally prove that their missing has nothing to do with the DPRK, either.\r\n   As we have stated, the normalization of DPRK-Japan diplomatic relations and food assistance are not compulsory. \r\n   It is a legitimate right of the Korean people to make Japan compensate for its past crimes and it is the unswerving will of the DPRK government to exercise the right by all means. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
