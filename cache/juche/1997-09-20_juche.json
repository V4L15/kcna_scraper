It is a sophisticated warship with nearly 100 fighter planes and various types of missiles on board.\r\n   The preparations of such aggressive warships for action in \"case of emergency\" on the Korean Peninsula are aimed at unleashing war.\r\n   The extreme tension on this peninsula is entirely attributable to the frantic arms buildup and military exercises of the U.S. warhawks and the south Korean puppets.\r\n   On the pretext of \"threat from the north,\" the U.S. warhawks are aggravating military confrontation and tension op this peninsula in a bid to find an excuse for justifying the movement of armed forces to south Korea and making an adventurous war against the DPRK.\r\n   If the United States sticks to the policy of stifling the DPRK, far from removing the belligerency with the DPRK, we will have to act commensurate with their action.\r\n   Military pressure and means of strength can never work on the DPRK.\r\n   The United States and the south Korean puppets would be well advised not to try the military strength of the DPRK. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Chosun Ilbo's anti-national, anti-social crimes disclosed\r\n\r\n   Pyongyang, September 20 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland on Friday published an indictment against the south Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo's anti-national, anti-social crimes.\r\n   The indictment first discloses the criminal activities of Chosun Ilbo being a disseminator of the sycophantic and flunkeyist idea.\r\n   The heinous crime of this treacherous venal paper is that it has advocated flunkeyism and dependence on outside forces.\r\n   The paper justified the relations of dependence on the United States, saying: \"The U.S. is an ally and a friend with which south Korea has maintained more friendly relations than with any other allies. It is quite natural that we do honor to this ally before the north of Korea.\"\r\n   It also said, \"The U.S. Holds the most important position for south Korea in view of security and the economy.\" \r\n\"Scrapping the south Korea-U.S. security pact and breaking the long-standing alliance will lead to s. Korea's ruin and so such things should never be done,\" it urged.\r\n   The paper took the lead in supporting the \"International Cooperation System\" called for by Kim Young Sam and defending the traitor who opened south Korean rice market to the United States and offered all other economic life line to outsiders.\r\n   Arguing \"We have incited bad sentiments toward Japan more than necessary since national liberation,\" the paper has engaged in anti-national propaganda, which insulted the Korean nation's resentment towards the Japanese imperialism, branding it as wrong.\r\n   Chosun Ilbo has also made itself infamous as press servant of the fascist dictatorship and as strangler of democracy and people's rights, the indictment points  out, and says:\r\n   The paper described the successive dictators of south Korea as \"heroes\", while lauding \"May 16 military coup\" as \"Worldwide monumental event\".\r\n   It also made false propaganda that the birth of the Kim Young Sam \"Government,\" though it was cooked up through the worst fraudulent elections totally backed by power and money, \"is a symbol heralding democratization of south Korean society.\"\r\n   When the people called for a probe into the truth behind the May 18 Kwangju massacre and for the punishment of the murderers, the paper made an insult to and a mockery of them, claiming that \"the truth has been probed to some extent through hearings and compensation money paid.\"\r\n   The paper slandered the people's strikes against the retrogressively revised \"Law on the Agency for National Security Law\" and \"Labour Laws\", as \"illegal\", saying that \"the revised 'Labour Laws' are modelled after those of developed countries in several aspects.\"\r\n   It also sided with the Kim Young Sam group branding the South Korean Federation of Univeristy Student Councils (Hanchongryon) as \"organization benefitting the north, the enemy\" and \"violent organization\". Slandering Hanchongryon, it argued that \"we can no longer exist without our system.\"\r\n   Referring to the anti-reunification crimes of Chosun Ilbo, the indictment says:\r\n   Chosun Ilbo, as a venal trumpeter of the south Korean rulers, has incited distrust, confrontation and war among the fellow countrymen to layobstacles to the reunification of the country.\r\n   It is this paper which viciously slandered the northern half of Korea as \"anti-state organization\" and \"area to be taken back\" and which clamoured about non-existent \"north's invasion\" and \"provocation by the north\".\r\n   Inciting north-south confrontation among south Korean people, the paper recklessly calls for war and does not hesitate to make distorted propaganda in a bid to check humanitarian aid to the fellow countrymen.\r\n   All the materials and information used by Chosun Ilbo for confrontation among the fellow countrymen were and are offered entirely by the puppet Agency for National Security Planning, the indictment stresses.\r\n   Chosun Ilbo, which has made unpardonable crimes against the country and the nation, the indictment holds, should not be allowed to exist any longer and should immediately be removed with the Kim Young Sam \"civilian\" regime which has been driven to the edge of ruin. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It committed an invasion of Cuba and has also persistently tried to isolate the country politically, diplomatically and economically.\r\n   The United States has escalated anti-Cuba manoeuvres. It is well known a fact that the united states made \"helms-burton law\" for the purpose of stifling Cuba economically.\r\n   The Cuban people, however, have advanced the revolution, smashing the enemy's moves in every way under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of Cuba headed by comrade Fidel Castro.\r\n   Through the bomb blasts the United States and its followers sought to make impressions that Cuba has suffered a political confusion and keep tourists from going to Cuba.\r\n   Now the Cuban people are convincingly advancing along the road chosen by themselves in defiance of the anti-Cuba manoeuvres.\r\n   The Korean people will as ever fully support the just cause of the Cuban people, who are advancing under the banner of socialism. \r\n\r\n"
