These were hideous crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t Not content with making desperate efforts to isolate the DPRK internationally, the U.S. cooked up such base \"resolutions\" by abusing the UNSC, its hand-raising machine. This was the most vivid expression of its wild ambition to stifle the DPRK and last-ditch effort to escalate its campaign against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The imperialists have reduced the UNSC to such an alarming \"impeachment tribunal\" as a religious court in the medieval ages. They ran the entire gamut of high-handed and arbitrary practices at the UNSC in wanton violation of the interests and rights of small countries and anti-imperialist and independent countries to meet their interests. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Countless are unpardonable crimes the imperialists have committed against the world by abusing the UNSC for their aggressive purposes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The U.S. emerged the world's \"only superpower\" when the balance of forces was upset in the international arena after the demise of the Cold War. The U.S.-led imperialists reduced the UNSC to a lawless one under the reign of the law of the jungle by dominating it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The 78-day-long barbarous air raids committed by the U.S.-led NATO forces on former Yugoslavia late in the  20th century were, in fact, a war of monstrous genocide in which they indiscriminately  dropped bombs on peaceable inhabitants by the mandate of the UNSC in utter disregard of international law. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In 1998 the U.S. and the West kicked off a pressure campaign to brand Yugoslavia as a \"war criminal\" over the Kosovo issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They brought the issue up for discussion at the UNSC and prodded it into adopting a resolution on taking steps for an embargo on arms export to Yugoslavia and a resolution on pressurizing it to accept a UN investigation into \"human rights abuses\" in Kosovo. Finally, the UNSC cooked up a resolution calling for taking \"a crucial additional international step\" against Yugoslavia unless it makes a truce in Kosovo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This gave a green light to a military intervention in Yugoslavia. Extremely arrogant NATO forces launched indiscriminate air raids on Yugoslavia in March, 1999 without getting any UNSC's approval, a procedure they were obliged to go through under international law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world public expressed strong anger and deep concern over the illegal air raids made by NATO in disregard of the UN and the UNSC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"NATO forces' air raids on Yugoslavia may serve as a funeral song for the UN.\" \"It cast a dark shadow on the mode of establishing a new international order after the demise of the Cold War.\" \"The UN was founded for the purpose of preventing a conflict, but NATO air raids put its existence at peril.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No wonder, the then Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs of Russia Vasily Sredin said at a meeting of the UN Human Rights Commission that \"Yugoslavia was attacked today, but tomorrow another country may fall victim to an attack.\""

            "content": "Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU, aparato a favor de despotismo de imperialistas (1)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPyongyang, 19 de marzo (ACNC) -- Como ya esta conocido, Estados Unidos abuso del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU para fabricar una tras otra \"resoluciones de sancion\" tan groseras y crueles cuestionando el lanzamiento de satelite con fines pacificos y la tercera prueba nuclear subterranea de autodefensa de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\tInsatisfecho con tales fanaticas maniobras tendentes a aislar a la RPDC en la arena internacional, movilizo hasta la maquinaria de votacion del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos imperialistas cometen el despotismo y las arbitrariedades de toda indole abusando del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara satisfacer sus intereses, infringen flagrantemente los intereses y los derechos de los paises pequenos y los independientes y antiimperialistas y convirtieron el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU en el lugar de \"denuncia\" igual a la tribuna religiosa de la edad media. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl abuso del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU en el designio agresivo de los imperialistas es un crimen nunca tolerable. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, con motivo del desequilibrio de la fuerza en la palestra internacional despues del fin de la guerra fria, EE.UU. y otros imperialistas propagaron la ley de la selva en el mundo manejando a sus caprichos el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU, lo cual es el crimen nunca perdonable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ataque aereo de 78 dias contra ex Yugoslavia, cometido a finales del siglo XX por las fuerzas de la OTAN bajo el mando de EE.UU., fue una masacre ilegal contra los civiles pacifistas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn 1998, EE.UU. y otros paises occidentales armaron la campana de presion tildando a Yugoslavia de \"criminal de guerra\" en cuanto al problema de Kosovo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInstigaron al Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU aprobar las resoluciones de prohibir la exportacion de armas a Yugoslavia y de permitir la investigacion de la ONU sobre los \"actos de violacion de DDHH\" en Kosovo. Por ultimo, hicieron aprobar la resolucion advirtiendo que \"tomarian importantes medidas internacionales adicionales\" si no se da la tregua en Kosovo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto dio luz verde a la intervencion militar en el problema de Yugoslavia. Y las fuerzas de la OTAN comenzaron en marzo de 1999 el ataque aereo indiscriminado sin recibir el consentimiento del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU, despreciando la ley internacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"El ataque aereo de la OTAN a Yugoslavia seria la musica funebre de la ONU\", \"Haria gran sombra al nuevo orden mundial despues de la guerra fria\", \"Se pone en peligro la existencia de la ONU, fundada con el fin de prevenir los conflictos\"…\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa opinion publica expreso gran indignacion y preocupacion por tales atrocidades ilicitas de la OTAN. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo es casual el que en la reunion de la Comision de DDHH de la ONU, el vicecanciller ruso de aquel entonces, Vassily Sredin, dijo que \"hoy Yugoslavia se hace blanco de ataque, y manana, sera atacado otro pais\"."
