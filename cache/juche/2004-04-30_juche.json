But that will only throw a higher hurdle in the way of the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is putting pressure upon the DPRK, talking about \"irreversible\" or something like that although it is not a defeated nation. If the U.S. insists on this stand, the DPRK does not feel any need to sit at the negotiating table with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will participate in the above-said meeting with patience and magnanimity but any efforts made by it alone are not enough to make the meeting successful. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Everything will depend on the U.S. attitude. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. attempt to while away time, insisting on its wrong assertion, would not do it good, either. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is by no means impatient.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This time, too it spearheaded the railroading of another resolution full of lies and fabrications through the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the DPRK has clarified more than once, it is the consistent policy of its government to guarantee all its citizens their rights in a responsible manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They enjoy genuine freedom and rights under the man-centered Korean-style socialist system whereby the whole country has become a large family and the leader, the Party and the masses are single-heartedly united. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the EU got the \"resolution\" passed in utter disregard of this actual human rights performance in the DPRK. This only goes to prove that the EU has become undisguised in conspiring with the U.S. in its hostile policy towards the DPRK aimed to impair the image of the DPRK and isolate and stifle it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is preposterous for the EU to deliberately say about someone's \"human rights situation,\" behaving as if it were an international \"judge of human rights.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, the U.S. should be forced to sit in the dock before any other countries when international and regional organizations discuss the issue of human rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The lives and inviolable rights of the people are constantly infringed upon in the U.S. society where firearms flood and various kinds of crimes including murder are rampant. It is the U.S. where racial discrimination and human rights abuses are the worst. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. not only is beset with the most serious human rights issues at home but has turned the international arena into an abattoir of man slaughter, a graveyard of human rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Iraqi war started by the U.S. last year in disregard of the UN and the international community is turning Iraq into a sea of blood as defenseless peaceable civilians are indiscriminately killed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. killed at least 10,000 civilians and children and contaminated the Iraqi land with radioactive fallout by using about 1,700 tons of depleted uranium shields and over 10,000 cluster bombs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. crimes against humanity are not confined to Iraq but are ceaselessly reported in Afghanistan, Kosovo and other parts of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The pressing issue in the field of human rights is rights to life and existence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is killing people in cold blood and trampling down upon their right to existence, under the signboard of \"protection of human rights.\" It is strange enough for the EU to turn aside from this genocide when claiming that it discusses the issue of human rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the EU considers as its \"human rights standards\" the jungle law that any crime of the strong should be regarded as a good deed and any good deed of the weak as a crime, then where is justice? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the EU is truly concerned about human rights, it should call the U.S. inhumane killing to task and hold it accountable for it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is, therefore, a matter of serious concern not only for Japan but for other Asian countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The shrine keeps mortuary tablets of war criminals who imposed catastrophic disasters not only upon the Japanese but upon all other Asian people in the past. Their visit to such a place is a rash act of insulting the war victims and seriously getting on the nerves of its surrounding countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese politicians have become evermore zealous in paying group visit to the shrine after forming what it called \"society of Dietmen\" in a bid to politically legalize their worship for and praise of the symbol of militarism and ultranationalism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In October last year, visits were paid to the shrine by 19 Dietmen and 49 others on behalf of Dietmen, sparking furor and inviting strong criticism at home and abroad. But the recent visit drew more Dietmen than the previous one. This clearly shows how reckless the ultra-right reactionary forces have become in their moves for turn Japan to fascism and to the Right under the patronage of the Japanese government and at its tacit connivance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The desperate efforts of the chief executive and Dietmen to justify the visits to the shrine, blatantly challenging history, clearly prove the dangerous militarist and ultranationalist tendency of Japan and its wild ambition for reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's blood-stained history of aggression in the 20th century has its origin in militarism and ultranationalism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hence, the controversial issue of the visit to the shrine is not only a domestic political issue of Japan as it is related to rooting out the origin or not but a serious issue of its foreign policy to verify its stand and view toward the Asian countries which suffered tremendous damage due to the Japanese imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is preposterous, indeed, for the chief executive and his close associates and other politicians to assert that other countries' criticism of visits to the shrine is interference in Japan's internal affairs. If the Japanese politicians are to sincerely repent of its history of wars of aggression and get rid of the ill-fame of \"enemy state\", they should stop such reckless acts as visiting the shrine to incite anachronistic idea of militarism and ultranationalism.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

No one can vouch that the new war of aggression sought by the U.S. and Japan against the DPRK would be confined to the peninsula. In the final analysis, this may seriously destabilize the strategic balance in Northeast Asia including the Korean peninsula and touch off a new arms race and another Cold War. This can never be allowed in view of the desire of humankind and the trend of the developments in and around the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and Japan should look straight into the reality and immediately stop their moves to strengthen military tie-up for a sinister purpose.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
