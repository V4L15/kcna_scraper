            "content": "Minju Joson on Taean work system \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyngyang, November 9 (KCNA) -- Minju Joson today carries a signed article on the occasion of the 37th anniversary of President Kim Il Sung's famous work \"On Further Developing the Taean Work System.\"\r\n   The work made public 37 years ago today comprehensively propounds the essence and superiority of the Taean work system and clarifies the tasks and ways of further developing the system.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Taean work system is an original Juche-oriented economic management system of Korean style, an embodiment of the immortal Juche idea and the revolutionary mass line based on it,  the article notes and goes on: &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The system is an economic management system which regards the people as the master of economic management. It provides the working masses with ample conditions for acting the master in economic management as required by the Juche idea and exercising  their substantial rights and fulfiling their responsibilities and duties as such.\r\n   The system enables all the working people to make positive efforts and display creative energies to increase production and improve industrial management under the guidance of the party committee. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Embodied in the system is the traditional revolutionary mass line of the Workers' Party of Korea. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Herein lies one of the important essentials of the system and the characteristic features of the system quite different from the old one. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Under the Taean work system the revolutionary mass line is applied to all the processes of economic management and this finds concentric manifestation in planning in particular. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This system calls on the producer masses to show concern for all matters related to industrial management including not only planning but also maintenance of equipment, supply of raw and other materials and supply service and participate in the work to solve them as masters and thus fulfil their duties and responsibilities as such. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Based on the Juche idea and the revolutionary mass line, the Taean work system is fully demonstrating the might of unity and cooperation, positive efforts and creative energies of the masses as a Juche-oriented economic management system fully meeting the intrinsic requirements of the socialist society based on collectivism and the validity of the work system whereby the party leadership is fully ensured at the lowest unit. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The experience gained in practice proves that there is no better socialist economic management system in the world than the Taean work system.    \r\n\r\n"

Although they were set free after scores of years of prison life, they sleep in the open air and are subjected to all sorts of maltreatment under the \"security law.\" &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They have strongly demanded their repatriation to the DPRK, their homeland. however, the South Korean authorities have rejected it for the mere reason that they refused to make a conversion. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Expressing indignation at the inhuman and savage human rights abuse by the South Korean authorities who serve the U.S., the appeal called on the peace-loving progressives of the world to strongly urge the South Korean authorities to take a measure to immediately send them back to the DPRK where their families are awaiting them.    \r\n\r\n"

Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article stresses the brigandish nature of U.S. and its aggressive policy of strength remain unchanged.\r\n   The article says: &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The general strategic goal of the United States is to stifle the anti-imperialist independent forces of the world and turn the whole world into a unipolar world under its thumb so as to exercise unlimited supremacy over it. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   To this end, the U.S. are resorting to the policy of strength, still placing their hope on it. It is nothing but a reckless act of those who have fallen into expansive delusion. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The present times is the era of independence. no force in the earth can block the just struggle of peoples against all forms of domination and subjugation and for independence of each country and nation. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   U.S. took upperhand in strength temporarily on the international arena after the end of Cold War, but is losing it with each passing day. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Those countries, which were once attacked by it without making decisive counteraction or voiced protest and condemnation, are seeking ways and taking steps to defend themselves. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   With military expenditure increased, the U.S. economic crisis is getting from bad to worse. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States' trade deficit last year was 168,590 million dollars, all-time high. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Its economic potentials are too weak to support their reckless policy of strength.\r\n   It is needless to say that the U.S. is unable to provide manpower for world domination. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   U.S. is seeking to invite allied nations to make up for its limited strength but most of them are reluctant to make response to it. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Inevitable is the failure of its policy of strength. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If it persists in such policy, it will only accelerate its own destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
