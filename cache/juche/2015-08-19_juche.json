Purge is an essential means for the puppet forces to prop up their regime as they resort to repression and bestial suppression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park grumbled that the north is \"wrecking peace and going against south-north integration\" while not responding to the \"proposal for dialogue\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If she had been sincere in her proposal for dialogue, she would have buckled down to creating an atmosphere for it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From the outset of the year, Park and her group, however, have escalated confrontation totally going against the resumption of dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This time, she trumpeted about the inviolable nuclear issue of the DPRK once again. Not only all the Koreans but the world public regards the DPRK's nuclear deterrence as a treasured sword for protecting the peace of the country and security of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Only Park is denying this universally accepted truth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She vociferated about the trite \"north's deed\" peppered with intrigues and fabrications.

Lurking behind this is her ill purpose to calm down the people's mindset against her self-opinionated and shameless unpopular rule.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This time, she talked nonsense that she would create \"world ecology peace park\" in the Demilitarized Zone to make it a \"new axis for realizing cooperation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nonsensical is her call for creating the \"peace park\" in the biggest hotspot in the world, where the worst confrontation persists and a war may break out any moment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She also made all kinds of spurious remarks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Explicitly speaking once again, she should set right the bad situation in south Korea before caring for and discussing the life of someone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how glittering make-up she may put, it is too late to prevent the foul smell from reeking off from her body interwoven with sycophancy, treachery, confrontation and hostility.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What she should do for the nation is to leave Chongwadae, the doghouse of the U.S., shut her unshapely mouth and get her crime-ridden body buried in the ceremony at an early date."

However, Korea was still maintaining its status as an independent state and exercising its sovereignty. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As for Empress Myongsong, she was the then representative of the state power who was taking the helm of state affairs representing Emperor Kojong. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese militarists stormed the imperial palace of an independent and sovereign state and cruelly murdered the Empress. This was a hideous crime against humanity as it was wanton violation of sovereignty of Korea and an intolerable infringement upon the dignity of the Korean people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By committing the Ulmi incident in breach of the basic principles of international law, the Japanese militarists sought to turn Korea into its exclusive colony.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Ulmi incident was the state-sponsored terrorist crime committed by the then Japanese government. It was proved by all facts including the purpose of the incident, how it was carried out and disposal of the aftermath. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The purpose was to block Czarist Russia's expansion of power toward Korea and realize the ambition for unchallenged domination. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To this end, Japan tried to remove Empress Myongsong, head of pro-Russian group, to easily realize the ambition for aggression. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After finding the murder of Empress Myongsong as the best way for changing the Korean feudal government's pro-Russia policy into the pro-Japanese policy the Japanese militarists planned to assassinate the Empress by the use of pro-Japanese element Pak Yong Hyo, the then minister of internal affairs of the Korean feudal government, through Japanese minister resident to Korea Inoue. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Shocked by the failure of assassinating the empress, the Japanese government directly worked out a plot to kill the Empress in a bid to turn in its favor the policy for aggression of Korea that faced the crisis of total destruction. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The whole process in which the Empress was murdered by Miura-led Japanese murderers fully proved that the Ulmi incident was cooked up by the Japanese government. It was also proved by what Japan did later to deal with the aftermath of the incident. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Ulmi incident was the brigandish crime showing brutality and shamelessness of the Japanese militarists. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The murder of the Empress was the most brutal and monstrous one unprecedented in the history of the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its brutality and cruelty were proved by the eyewitnesses and testimonies of people in different countries who investigated the fact later. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The then Japanese militarists also admitted its brutality and cruelty. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The shamelessness of the Japanese militarists was fully revealed by the cunning moves they resorted to cover up the truth of the Ulmi incident and shift the blame for the incident on to Koreans. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the Japanese militarists tried to distort the fact to give impression that it had nothing to do with them under the foolish calculation to evade the responsibility for the crime. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Later the Japanese militarists obtained the exclusive possession of all the historical materials of the Korean feudal government and removed all the records related to the killing of Empress Myongsong so that they would not be an object of future controversies as far as the responsibility for the incident was concerned. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, no fraud can cover up the historical truth. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean people will never forget the crime related to the Ulmi incident committed by the Japanese militarists but force Japan to make an apology without fail."

estudiarla y reconocer que ella misma es la autora de la provocacion y amenaza. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn cuanto a la Declaracion Conjunta del 4 de Julio, ella dijo atrevidamente que \"todavia se da la oportunidad\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEntonces, ?si simpatiza por el principio de la independencia que demanda resolver todos los problemas que se presenten en las relaciones intercoreanas en la posicion de dar prioridad a la nacion sin depender de las fuerzas extranjeras ni recibir la intervencion de ellas?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi reconoce el principio de reunificacion pacifica que implica el espiritu patriotico de defender el terreno de vida de la nacion desde los desastres de la guerra y garantizar la prosperidad comun de la nacion?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi tiene la voluntad de aceptar el espiritu de \"Entre nosotros, los connacionales\" y de gran unidad nacional que es el modo de subsistencia de la nacion y fuerza motriz de la mejora de las relaciones intercoreanas?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ante tales preguntas severas de la nacion, ella se quedara ruborizada de verguenza por sus locuras conflictivas hechas hasta la fecha. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo mas indignante es que ella solto las sofisterias astutas como si tuviera interes en la solucion del problema de \"familiares separados\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tElla recurre persistentemente a la palabreria irreflexiva con el malsano intento de apaciguar a la poblacion indignada por las politicas antipopulares de caracter egoista y cinico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta vez, expuso la decision absurda de formar un \"parque ecologico mundial de paz\" en la zona desmilitarizada como un \"nuevo eje de la cooperacion\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Es ilogico crear el \"parque de paz\" en la zona mas candente del mundo donde perdura el estado de enfrentamiento y puede estallar la guerra en cualquier momento. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark solto otros disparates agradables. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAntes de hablar o preocuparse de la vida de alguien, ha de arreglar la situacion miserable de la sociedad surcoreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa es tarde para embellecer su historia caracterizada por el servilismo a grandes potencias, la traicion a la nacion, el enfrentamiento y la hostilidad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo que puede hacer Park para la nacion es retirarse de Chongwadae que sirve de perrera de EE.UU. y sepultarse cuanto antes en el cementerio publico."

Esto constituye el acto criminal anti-etico de gran tamano siendo la violacion violenta e intolerable de la soberania de Corea y la dignidad del pueblo coreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La realizacion del avasallamiento colonial monopolista de Corea fue el objetivo malsano que perseguian los militaristas japoneses que provocaron el incidente arriba referido violando gravemente a  los principios principales de la ley internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El incidente en cuestion fue el crimen terrorista estatal provocado precisamente por el gobierno japones, lo cual se comprueba por todos los hechos incluyendo el objetivo y el proceso de provocacion y los trabajos realizados despues del incidente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Japon provoco este caso con el objetivo de impedir la expansion de las fuerzas de Rusia zarista a Corea y realizar su ambicion de dominacion exclusiva.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por eso, intento lograr facilmente su ambicion agresiva eliminando la emperatriz Myongsong, cabecilla de la fraccion pro-Rusia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  A fin de convertir la politica pro-Rusia del gobierno feudal de Corea en la pro-Japon los militaristas japoneses tramaron como mejor medida el asesinato de la emperatriz Myongsong. Conspiraron con Inoue, ministro japones en Corea e hicieron a al elemento projapones Pak Yong Hyo, ministro del interior del gobierno feudal de Corea, asesinar cautelosamente a ella.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El gobierno japones que recibio un fuerte impulso por el fracaso de su conspiracion, se vio obligado a tomar parte directamente en el asesinato para rotar a la inversa su politica de agresion a Corea enfrentada con la crisis de destruccion total.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Todo el proceso del incidente en cuestion cometido por los bandidos japoneses encabezados por Miura, comprueba indiscutiblemente que el incidente del ano Ulmi fue tramado y perpetrado totalmente por el gobierno japones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Otros datos historicos demuestran tambien que el gobierno japones es el promotor del incidente del ano Ulmi.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Este caso demuestra a todo el mundo el caracter bestial y descarado de los militaristas japoneses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa barbaridad del asesinato de la emperatriz Myongsong se ha revelado por los testigos de aquel entonces y los investigadores extranjeros. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHasta los militaristas japoneses de entonces reconocieron ese crimen atroz. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl incidente de Ulmi fue un tremendo crimen que demostro no solo la barbaridad sino tambien el cinismo de los imperialistas japoneses. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon el calculo pueril de eludir la culpabilidad, los militaristas japoneses actuaron con astucia para tergiversar la verdad como si ellos mismos no tuvieran nada que ver con el caso. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY despues, usurpo todos los datos historicos del gobierno feudal coreano y elimino los registros sobre el incidente de asesinato de la emperatriz Myongsong, de modo que no se presentara nunca mas la acusacion por el respecto. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, no pueden ocultar con ningun fraude la verdad de la historia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl pueblo coreano cobrara sin falta el perdon de Japon por sus tremendos crimenes incluso el incidente de asesinato de la emperatriz Myongsong."
