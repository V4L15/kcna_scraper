He provided a militant program which should be grasped in labor administration by issuing his historic work \"On Further Improving and Strengthening Labor Administration\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is his undying feat that he has brought into full bloom the flower garden of the revolutionary traits of labor in the whole society in the era of Songun. Under his revolutionary Songun leadership, our people victoriously made the \"Arduous March\" and the forced march with their creative labor and firmly defended Korean-style socialism, the precious heritage left behind by President Kim Il Sung, inspired by revolutionary optimism reflected in the slogan \"Let's Always Be Cheerful Although Our Path Is Thorny\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the unshakable faith and will of the Korean people to build the country into a great prosperous powerful socialist nation where everything prospers and the people are as well-off as any other, under the revolutionary Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il, declares the editorial.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Urged to Withdraw Military Bases from Historical and Cultural Sites \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 4 (KCNA) -- It is an intolerable insult to and mockery of the Korean nation and an act swimming against the trend of the times to keep military bases, U.S. military bases in particular, at sites of historical and cultural interest, treasures common to the nation, says Rodong Sinmun Thursday in a signed commentary.\r\n Noting that military setups of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces and the south Korean army are found at eight historical sites in south Korea, the commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are more than 200 countries and regions in the world, but it is only south Korea which leaves historical and cultural sites, even those spots listed as world cultural heritages, to foreigners as their military bases, not content with installing its own military bases there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean flunkeyist traitors who were top-class stooges and war servants of the U.S. imperialists took an active part in the U.S. anti-DPRK moves in disregard of national dignity and interests as they attached more importance to the alliance with the U.S. rather than to the preservation of historical and cultural relics. So they committed such a hideous criminal act of offering historical sites listed as world cultural heritages to the occupation forces as ground for military bases to stifle fellow countrymen with much ado about \"strengthened alliance\" and \"promise.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present \"government for people\" should have valued the dignity and interests of the nation and withdrawn military bases from historical and cultural sites since it cried for \"independent diplomacy\" and \"horizontal relations\" between the U.S. and south Korea. However, far from doing so, it egged riff-raffs on to call for registering the Demilitarized Zone along the Military Demarcation Line, a symbol of national division, as a world heritage and opening it to international tourism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should dismantle all the military bases at historical and cultural sites at the earliest possible date, clearly understanding what a big crime it is to kowtow to the U.S.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun Thursday says this in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To avert the danger of a new war and achieve durable peace on the Korean Peninsula is a pressing task pending an urgent implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation is making efforts to achieve national reconciliation, cooperation and independent reunification true to the June 15 joint declaration in a bid to reunify the country in a peaceful way without any fratricidal war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the danger of a new war is growing on the Korean Peninsula due to the U.S. threat of aggression against the DPRK. This has thrown hurdles in the way of the Koreans' movement for achieving independent reunification by implementing the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The U.S. is massively shipping into south Korea ultra-modern war hardware under the pretext of \"bolstering its forces\" while talking bout the \"cutback\" of its forces in south Korea. At the same time it is busy with the \"transfer of its military base\" and \"relocation\" of its forces in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n��Given that the danger of a new war is increasing on the Korean Peninsula every moment due to the U.S. imperialists' reckless moves to ignite a war against the DPRK and the movement for reconciliation, cooperation and independent reunification has hit a snag, the Koreans' anti-U.S. and anti-war struggle for defending peace has entered a new phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-U.S. and anti-war sentiment is mounting higher than ever before in south Korea as south Koreans are becoming increasingly aware that it is the key to protecting peace on the Korean Peninsula to check and foil the U.S. war moves against the DPRK over the nuclear issue between the former and the latter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-U.S. and anti-war sentiment has rapidly mounted in south Korea and the anti-U.S. struggle has become an irresistible trend of the times. This is a great achievement made by the Koreans in their struggle for peace and peaceful reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun policy serves for a sure guarantee for preventing the U.S. imperialists' nuclear war on the Korean peninsula and defending peace of the country. The Korean nation will certainly emerge victorious in their struggle against the U.S. and war and achieve independent reunification thanks to this Songun policy.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

When several KRA groups were dispatched into the homeland, Kim Hyong Gwon, a commanding officer of the KRA, led one of them to conduct brisk political and military activities in the homeland. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Advancing into Phungsan County (at that time) in August Juche 19 (1930), his group stormed the Japanese Police Substation in Phabal-ri and shot to death a police sergeant nicknamed Opashi (stinging-bee) and thus instilled in the minds of the people under the Japanese colonial rule the truth that the struggle was the only way to save the nation and the armed enemy should be defeated with arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even after his arrest by the Japanese police, he, with an indomitable revolutionary belief, did not stop fighting for implementing the line of armed struggle set forth by the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The gunshot fired by Kim Hyong Gwon in Phabal-ri still teaches the Korean people that the dignity and sovereignty of the nation can be defended only with arms.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
