Madcap arms buildup,  reckless military exercises staged under the simulated conditions of an actual war, evermore undisguised  ultra-nationalist utterences and moves to place Japan under a fascist system are arousing the international community's apprehension. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through the review expansionist Japan seeks to justify its militarist moves under the pretext of \"threat\" from someone and shift the responsibility for the unstable regional security onto him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is well advised not to forget that such a nasty and cunning way of thinking as taking issue with others for no reason has never gone down with anyone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The review only revealed the true colours of Japan obsessed with hysteria of militarist overseas expansion.    \r\n\r\n"
