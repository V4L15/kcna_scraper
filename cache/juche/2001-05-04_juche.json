The rainfall on March 14 stood at 3 mm on an average. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To be exact, drought has persisted for more than 60 days since early March. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To go back to historical records, Pyongyang was hit by drought from March 3 to May 4 in 1928, drought lasted for 63 days from March 1 to May 2 in 1982 and for 58 days from March 1 to April 27 in 1993. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Precipitation from last March 1 up to this date is registered 15mm on an average in all parts of the country, only 18 percent of 83 mm, the annual average. precipitation in north and south Hwanghae provinces on the west coast, in particular, was registered 9 mm, the lowest in rainfall observation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Drought has persisted for 58 days in all parts of north and south Hamgyong provinces on the east coast, doing huge damage to various fields of the national economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Results of the soil survey showed that 8-15 cm deep soil of the farm land in all parts of the country remained dry, going far beyond the germination limit. Most of the sown  seeds have already dried up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A forest fire is reported in an unbroken chain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Forest fires broke out in scores of cities and counties including Thongchon, Phyonggang, Cholwon, Ichon and Phangyo counties, Kangwon Province, Tokchon and Sunchon cities, Hoechang, Maengsan and Unsan counties, South Phyongan Province, and north and south Hwanghae provinces, north and south Hamgyong provinces, Jagang Province and Pyongyang in April, thus causing a huge loss of forest resources, satellite information said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As communication networks were cut off by forest fires, various forms of accidents broke out one after another, hard hitting various fields of the national economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Drought is expected to persist till the first part of May. \r\n\r\n"

This is quite obvious in view of Japan's past history and its present political and military tendency. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's dangerous attempt to modify the constitution should be decisively checked.     \r\n\r\n"
