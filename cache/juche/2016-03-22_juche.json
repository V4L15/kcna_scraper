            "content": "KCNA Urges U.S. to Roll back Its Hostile Policy towards DPRK\r\n Pyongyang, March 22 (KCNA) -- U.S. experts on Korean affairs and foreign media are becoming increasingly vocal urging the U.S. administration to opt for concluding a peace treaty with the DPRK in order to find a solution to the issue of the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t Benette Ramberg, policy researcher at the agency for political and military affairs under the former Bush administration, said in his commentary contributed to Reuters that north Korea is a nuclear power both in name and reality, urging the U.S. to recognize its status as an irreversible nuclear power and hold a dialogue with it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Joel Wit, former official for Korean affairs of the U.S. Department of State, asserted that the U.S. should \"pursue a compromise proposal by responding to north Korea's offer for concluding the peace treaty as the recent resolution on sanctions would not go down with the latter. He added that it is possible for the U.S. to discuss and issue an official declaration on putting an end to the Korean War at the first phase of the negotiations for concluding the peace treaty and discuss and press ahead with specific measures including a halt to the U.S.-south Korea annual joint military exercises and the removal of the Military Demarcation Line at the next phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Media including the U.S. website Reddit said: North Korea is steadily improving the capability of its nuclear weapons but the U.S. cannot strike them. The U.S. failed in its test for intercepting north Korea's missiles. In the final analysis, negotiations are the only option for defusing north Korea's nuclear and missile threats.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A director of the Chinese Foundation for the International Studies noted that it is the most pressing and urgent task to prevent the outbreak of a war on the Korean peninsula. To this end, it is necessary to put an end to the truce on the peninsula and conclude a peace treaty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These are the strong assertions that the U.S. should not persist in its megalomaniac quixotic policy but boldly recognize the status of the DPRK as a nuclear power, opt for improving the relations with it and discuss the issue of concluding the peace treaty with it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK had access to H-bomb to safeguard the sovereignty and right of the country and nation to exist from the U.S. aggressive policy and nuclear blackmail and threat which have lasted for the past several decades, thus proudly joining the advanced ranks of nuclear powers.  Nothing can disable its nuclear deterrent for self-defense.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is bolstering up its merciless striking capability at multi-phases with increased speed to cope with the ever-escalating U.S. moves for a war of aggression. This is the reality which the world people witness at present.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is busy staging the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle 16 joint military exercises with huge troops and preemptive nuclear offensive weapons deployed in south Korea and the vicinity of the Korean peninsula. This madcap saber-rattling does not show off its aggressive force but betrays its fear of the tremendous military muscle of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ceaseless military exercises being staged by the U.S. and south Korean puppet forces under various codenames in south Korea are the basic factor of a war on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is no guarantee that such drills will not lead to an all-out war on the peninsula. In case a war breaks out, it will quickly spill over to a world war and nuclear war among nuclear powers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Disregarding this hard fact, the U.S. is still crying out for someone's \"dismantling of nuclear weapons\". This is a way of thinking little short of escape from reality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As long as the U.S. does not abandon such way of thinking, there can be no progress in settling the issue of the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK persistently threatens the latter's existence and both sides are still technically at war, the U.S. assertion that peace can settle on the peninsula only when the latter unilaterally dismantles its nuclear weapons, to begin with, is sheer sophism understandable to no one.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world will only see the DPRK's tremendous nuclear deterrent growing stronger on the peninsula unless the U.S. does not roll back its hostile policy toward the DPRK including joint military rehearsals."

Fracaso tambien en la prueba para interceptar los misiles del Norte de Corea. Al fin y al cabo, el unico remedio para extirpar la amenaza de armas nucleares y misiles del Norte de Corea reside en realizar las negociaciones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUn director de la Fundacion China de Estudios Internacionales subrayo que prevenir el estallido de la guerra en la Peninsula Coreana es la mas apremiante y urgente tarea, para lo cual es necesario poner punto final al estado de armisticio en la Peninsula Coreana y concertar el convenio de paz.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los argumentos significan que EE.UU. debe reconocer audazmente la posicion de la RPDC como potencia nuclear sin insistir en la megalomana politica a estilo de Don Quijote, optar el camino de la mejora de las relaciones con la RPDC y deliberar el problema de la concertacion del convenio de paz RPDC-EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy en dia, la RPDC poseyo la bomba de hidrogeno para defender la soberania y el derecho a vivir del pais y la nacion desde la politica agresiva y el chantaje y amenaza nucleares de EE.UU. que se han aumentado durante decenios, y entro dignamente en la fila delantera de los paises poseedores de las armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl disuasivo nuclear de autodefensa de la RPDC no pueden destruirlo con nada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuanto mas se fortalecen las maniobras de la guerra agresiva de EE.UU., tanto mas se intensifica rapida y escalonadamente nuestra capacidad de golpe implacable.  Esto es la realidad que ven y sienten personalmente los pueblos del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos ejercicios militares conjuntos Key Resolve y Foal Eagle 16 que EE.UU. libra con frenesi tras introducir en el Sur de Corea y los alrededores de la Peninsula Coreana los enormes efectivos militares y las armas de ataque preventivo nuclear, no manifiestan el caracter demostrativo y amenazante de la banda de agresores sino comprueban evidentemente el potente poderio militar de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos simulacros que EE.UU. y la banda titere surcoreana desarrollan constantemente bajo distintos rotulos en la Peninsula Coreana, devienen la causa principal que trae el nubarron de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo hay ninguna garantia de que dichos entrenamientos no traigan la guerra total en la Peninsula Coreana y en este caso, ella se extendera facilmente a la guerra mundial y la guerra nuclear entre las potencias nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero EE.UU., despreciandolo, todavia aboga por la \"anulacion nuclear\" de alguien. Esto es el modo de pensamiento que evade la realidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras EE.UU. no se libere de tal pensamiento, nunca habra el avance en la solucion del problema de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn actualidad, sigue la politica hostil de EE.UU. que amenaza nuestra existencia, y la RPDC y EE.UU. estan todavia en la beligerancia. Bajo tales circunstancias, no puede persuadir a nadie la insistencia de este imperio yanqui en que si la RPDC renuncia unilateralmente las armas nucleares, podra llegar la paz.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi EE.UU. no abandona todas sus politicas hostiles anti-RPDC, inclusive los simulacros militares conjuntos, causa raigal de la agravacion de la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana, sera intensificado mas el disuasivo nuclear ilimitado de la RPDC."
