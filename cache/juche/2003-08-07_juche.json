Korean GNP's Treachery Denounced \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 6 (KCNA) -- The Grand National Party of south Korea recently railroaded a \"resolution\" on the north's \"human rights issue\" through the \"national assembly\" where it holds a majority.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary dismisses this as an unpardonable insult and another blatant challenge and provocation to the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP is a group of traitors seeking a way out in the confrontation with the north, as it keeps raising a hue and cry over \"human rights\" to add fuel to the fire though the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. assumes more serious nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This time the GNP pulled up someone over the non-existent \"human rights issue\", shelving the serious human rights abuses in south Korea. This is nothing but nonsense which can be talked only by dolts who are totally unaware of reality and sophism made by the criminals out of guilty conscience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP is becoming more zealous in its pro-U.S. sycophantic acts to more desperately pursue confrontation with the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such behavior of the GNP is nothing but the last-ditch frenzy of the doomed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP's loudmouthed \"cooperation\" with the U.S. is no more than a desperate effort of those who have been thrown into an abyss of ruin and its ridiculous clamour for \"human rights\" is nothing but a shrill cry of those who are in the depths of despair. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One's evil doings will rebound on oneself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP is fated to be buried in the grave of history like preceding traitors.    \r\n\r\n"
