His outstanding Songun leadership provided a powerful military guarantee for stepping up the building of a new country, the reporter said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The historic victory in the Fatherland Liberation War was one of the President's Juche-oriented military idea and iron will and prominent commanding art. It was a military miracle in the 20th century that the DPRK shattered the myth of \"mightiness\" of U.S. imperialism in the world eyes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The President's guidance over the People's Army enabled it to invariably preserve its character as the revolutionary armed forces of the party that inherited the tradition of the anti-Japanese armed struggle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also advanced the military line of self-defence and the slogan \"A-match-for-a hundred\" so as to bolster the defence capability of the country in every aspect.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The cause of Juche-based army-building pioneered and led by the President was creditably carried forward by leader Kim Jong Il. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il formulated the Songun politics as a main political mode under socialism in the 1990s and put forward the People's Army as the driving force of the revolution on the principle of putting the army ahead of the working class.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to his experienced and seasoned leadership, the People's Army could demonstrate its might as an elite army strong in idea and faith and a matchless revolutionary army of Mt. Paektu that is possessed of its own versatile war methods and experience of sure victories and equipped with Korean-style offensive and defensive means capable of fighting any form of modern warfare.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The cause of Juche-oriented army-building started on Mt. Paektu has been vigorously advanced by Supreme Commander Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The congratulatory speech made by him at a military parade in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the President's birth serves as a beacon and an immortal programme that indicated the way ahead of the army and people of the DPRK who are advancing along the road of independence, the road of Songun and the road of socialism. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The revolution of Juche is sure to triumph thanks to the outstanding leadership of Kim Jong Un and the powerful revolutionary armed forces and single-minded unity of service persons and people."
