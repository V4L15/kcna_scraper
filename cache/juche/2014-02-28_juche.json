However, Japan has neither made any sincere apology for the crimes committed by it against Koreans in the past nor probed the truth behind those crimes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In recent years alone, the Japanese chief executive blustered that there is no evidence proving that the Imperial Japanese Army forcibly drafted women as comfort women. In January this year the new president of NHK justified the shuddering sexual slavery, claiming that there were comfort women in any country which fought a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A hundred and dozens of politicians thronged to the Yasukuni Shrine to honor the memory of those war criminals who imposed horrible disasters upon the Korean people and others in Asia. They even let loose absurd sophism that there is still no clear definition about aggression worldwide, stunning the international community. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is happening in Japan reminds people of its real picture in those days before its defeat when it frantically rode on a chariot of imperialism, advertising its war of aggression as a \"war of justice\" obsessed with the daydream of \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan should never forget that if it lends no ear to the voices of justice, persisting in its anachronistic moves to evade the settlement of its past crimes and distort history, it will throw itself and people into the abyss of ruin again. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan had better drop its wrong view on history and way of thinking, though belatedly, and opt for honestly paying for all losses and sufferings it brought to Korea and its people and other peoples of Asia."

This is a striking demonstration of the wise leadership provided by the party and the leader for thoroughly implementing the theses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il energetically led the efforts to raise the cultural standard of the peasants and build rural villages into highly civilized socialist ones good to live in.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to the wise leadership of the party and the leader, Chongsan-ri Spirit and Chongsan-ri Method have been fully applied to the guidance over agriculture and a system was established, whereby the co-op farm management committee of a county guides co-op farms in an industrial method and on a sci-tech basis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The idea and exploits of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il have been successfully carried forward under the wise leadership of Marshal Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un set agriculture as a major thrust of the drive for building an economic power and improving the people's standard of living and has brought about a new leap forward and innovations in agriculture through his energetic leadership.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reporter underlined the need to bring about fresh progress in finally settling the rural question by thoroughly implementing the tasks set forth by Kim Jong Un in his letter to the participants in the national conference of subworkteam leaders in the agricultural sector \"Let Us Bring About Innovations in Agricultural Production under the Unfurled Banner of the Socialist Rural Theses\"."

            "content": "ACNC publica comentario sobre \"informe\" de \"comite de investigacion\" de ONU\r\nPyongyang, 28 de febrero (ACNC) -- Publico recientemente un \"informe\" el \"comite de investigacion\" sobre la situacion de derechos humanos de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea, fabricado en el Consejo de DDHH de la ONU. \n\t\t\t\t\tAl igual que los otros publicados anteriormente, es un documento falsificado que hace vista gorda de la verdadera situacion de DDHH del pueblo coreano y se basa en los infundados datos brindados por algunos \"fugitivos\" y criminales profugos norcoreanos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor eso, muchos paises y hasta los medios del Occidente dicen con preocupacion como fue posible que ese informe parcial haya sido circulado como documento oficial de un aparato de la ONU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn su articulo \"invento de la ONU\", la revista online rusa Tibilrus senala que ese documento se habra elaborado por un pedido y agrega que el problema es por que la ONU rebaja su autoridad distribuyendo como \"informe\" tales datos absurdos e inciertos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo sospechoso es que el \"informe\" fue publicado cuando la RPDC realiza esfuerzos inauditos por mejorar las relaciones intercoreanas y lograr la reunificacion del pais dividido en dos partes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl especialista del Instituto de Estudios Estrategicos de Francia, Jean-Vincent Brisset, dijo en entrevista con el periodico La Croix que no se puede reconocer el \"informe\" porque carece de confirmacion y es documento infundado y no cientifico. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tApunto que el \"informe\" debe revelar, por el contrario, como EE.UU. practico durante varios decenios la politica hostil a la RPDC y como invalido los exitos alcanzados por ambas partes coreanas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa vicepresidenta del Partido de Patria Libre de Brasil, Rosanita Campos, hizo publica en el rotativo Hora do Povo el articulo intitulado \"Sirviente de Obama inventa el informe nazista contra la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl articulo transmite que nadie sabe quien es Michael Kirby, quien suele a declarar de repente a los medios de prensa pagados y monopolicos de varios paises para la demagogia contra la Corea socialista. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tParece que Michael Kirby es el presidente de un comite de la ONU encargado de los asuntos coreanos que actua bajo el mando de EE.UU., critica y agrega que su mision es inventar las \"pruebas\" contra la RPDC a peticion de Washington y servir en la cooperacion internacional manipulada por EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tProsigue que el nunca ha visitado a Pyongyang ni conversado con los representantes del gobierno de la RPDC, sino fue invitado en varias ocasiones por Seul, que dispone de todas las estructuras capaces de fabricar las \"pruebas\" necesarias a la fabricacion del \"informe\" fraudulento a traves de las entrevistas con algunos surcoreanos y \"fugitivos norcoreanos\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa interpretacion al estilo nazista de Michael Kirby sobre la RPDC persigue manchar la imagen de la Corea socialista como Estado nazis violador de DDHH y acusarla a la Corte Penal Internacional que sirve para los intereses politicos de EE.UU. y sus aliados, denuncia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos datos arriba mencionados evidencian una vez mas que el presente \"informe\" resulta una provocacion politica para derrocar el regimen norcoreano al manchar su prestigio en la arena internacional e intensificar el grado de presion, siendo producto de los actos hostiles cometidos durante varios decenios por EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. es el peor violador de DDHH que con su agresion e intervencion asesina a las personas inocentes y causa incontables desastres por doquier del mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tViola flagrantemente los derechos humanos en los Estados soberanos como Iraq, Libia, Afganistan, Pakistan, en particular, en Siria y otros paises independientes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInstalo carceles en Guantanamo y otros rincones del orbe donde son maltratados los prisioneros. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa sociedad estadounidense es infierno de DDHH donde se cometen las escuchas ilegales y la vigilancia ilicita. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPues, es ilogico y ridiculo que EE.UU. cuestione la situacion de \"DDHH\" de alguien. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. es el peor violador de DDHH del mundo que ya debio ser acusado a la Corte Penal Internacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los militares y civiles coreanos no toleraran jamas tales actos asquerosos de los que habituados al veto al socialismo coreano centrado en las masas populares, calumnian la dignidad y el sistema de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSera condenado duro por la historia el intento ridiculo de las fuerzas hostiles de utilizar el tema de DDHH en su malsano objetivo politico, violar la soberania de la RPDC y derrocar su regimen socialista."
