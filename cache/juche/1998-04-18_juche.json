Under the new \"guidelines\" Japan's \"assistance to the U.S.\", which was available in \"Emergency in Japan\", is  greatly magnified in \"Emergency around Japan\". In other words, the Japanese \"Self-Defence Forces\"  may participate in coordinated operation with the U.S. Forces in the region and stage comeback.\r\n   After the announcement of the new \"guidelines\" the U.S.-Japan aggressive military tieup has further been tightened than ever before under the pretext of \"joint reaction to emergency\" around Japan. The point is that  the Japanese reactionaries are trying hard to make a legal and institutional mechanism to justify the military fusion under the new \"guidelines\".\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries, who established some institutional mechanism through the revision of the \"guidelines\" last year, are going to completely justify the overseas aggression by the \"SDF\" by railroading the \"bill\" through the diet.\r\n   It is the common purpose and design of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries to hold domination over Asia.\r\n   Clear is the aim of the Japanese warmaniacs.\r\n   They seek to make a preemptive attack on North Korea under the pretext of \"reaction to emergency around Japan\", overheated with the ambition for reinvasion of the Aisa-Pacific region. They should be mindful that their dangerous act will bring  them fatal consequences.\r\n   If the Japanese reactionaries, prompted by the ambition for \"Greater East Asia Coprosperity Sphere\", take the road of reinvasion with the backing of the U.S., they will meet a disgraceful end.    \r\n \r\n\r\n"
