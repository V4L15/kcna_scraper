And the list of the DPRK side's verification group who is expected to cross the MDL and DMZ has already been sent to an institution concerned of the south side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. talk about \"list of verification group\" and \"permit\", therefore, can not be construed otherwise than a blatant challenge to the Korean nation's desire and wish to reconnect the severed blood ties of the nation and its divided land as they are nothing but premeditated and deliberate tricks of the U.S. to hamstring the projects of reconnecting railways and roads between the north and south of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The projects of reconnecting the east and west coastal rail and road links are making brisk headway after they were simultaneously kicked off in the relevant areas of the north and the south amidst the great expectation and concern of all the Koreans and the mine clearing is at its final stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is universally known that not only the north and south of Korea but also the whole world including countries concerned and Europe are welcoming this development, viewing it as the nation's historic event of reconnecting its arteries that have remained cut for more than 50 years and a stride toward national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With nothing can the U.S. justify its acts of hampering this important project, swimming against the trend of the times. Its acts, therefore, can not but arouse worldwide criticism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the South Korean media put it, it is not hard to guess the true aim sought by the U.S. in asserting that there is a problem when the mine-clearing is at its final phase although it has kept mum for nearly two months since the work started. \r\n Prompted by its strategic purpose to escalate international pressure upon the DPRK, disarm it and force it to surrender while zealously peddling its nuclear issue, the U.S. seeks to totally bar the inter-Korean relations from warming and push the military and political situation on the Korean Peninsula to confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation will never tolerate the U.S. dog-in-a-manger act of putting a brake on the Korean nation's undertaking of reconnecting its blood ties, much displeased with the process of improving the inter-Korean relations.    \r\n\r\n"

This has caused the institution concerned and the people of the DPRK to strongly assert that it is necessary to reconsider a moratorium on the missile test-fire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and the people of the DPRK are expressing bitter indignation at Japan which is hell-bent on the anti-DPRK smear campaign over the issue of a few kidnapped Japanese while refusing to disclose its unprecedented state-sponsored crimes committed against the Korean people in the past including the forcible drafting of millions of Koreans, crimes related to comfort women for the Japanese imperial army, massacres and other crimes aimed to exterminate the Korean nation, and unlimited plunder of cultural treasures and natural resources and to make compensation for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK expressed its willingness to keep moratorium on missile launch beyond the year 2003 in the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang declaration despite the grave threat posed to its sovereignty and right to existence by the U.S. escalated attempt to stifle the DPRK and Washington's scenario to mount a preemptive attack on it. This was, in fact, a most vivid manifestation of the DPRK's good faith, which took the ardent request of Japan into consideration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the Japanese authorities are breaking faith with the DPRK, quite contrary to the promise made to it. Some elements in Japan do not bother to assert that \"Japan may fight a war against North Korea\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The opinion in Japan over the issue of abduction has gone to such extremes entirely because of the dishonest forces seeking confrontation with the DPRK at the instigation of outside forces, far from trying to find a solution to the issue with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The promise made between the countries should be kept on the basis of reciprocity under any circumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"People's feelings\" do not exist in Japan only.    \r\n\r\n"

But, the U.S. Forces are now suddenly raising the issue of \"permit by the Armistice Commission\" in a bid to check the progress of this work, the statement notes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRecalling the fact that since the projects are under way in the area along the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) where both warring parties stand in acute confrontation, the north has already held a sufficient consultation and reached an agreement not only with the south side but also with the U.S. Forces side on all the problems arising in this regard, the statement says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHowever, the U.S., resorting to all forms of high-handed practices to encroach upon the Korean nation's right to existence and sovereignty, is now behaving in a dog-in-a-manger manner to hinder the relinking of the nation's severed blood ties and, furthermore, obstruct the co-prosperity and common interests of the world. Such moves can be justified with nothing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many personages of the north and the south have passed through the area along the MDL, waters along its extension and air above it by vehicles, ships and planes till now. But the UN Forces side has never asked for lists of those passing through the, and the DPRK has never presented such lists to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. is insisting on such unprecedented assertion, while backpedalling the agreement reached between the DPRK and the U.S. and hamstringing even the implementation of the north-south agreement. This is aimed to regain the justification to keep the UN Forces which exist only in name and bar the inter-Korean relations from warming. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such behavior of the U.S. is an arrogant and brigandish act of not only opposing the reconciliation and cooperation between the north and the south and peace and reunification of Korea but ruthlessly trampling underfoot even the interests of the countries concerned and European countries as it is a high-handed practice of a colonial occupationist. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We can never allow the U.S. to obstruct the projects for reconnecting inter-Korean rail and road links. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the mine clearing is blocked in the area along the MDL and the reconnection of east coastal temporary roads slated to be completed late in November and an experimental tour of Mt. Kumgang by land transport scheduled to take place early in December, which had been already agreed upon between the north and the south, are delayed and the construction of the Kaesong Industrial Zone is not kicked off as scheduled, the U.S. will be wholly responsible for this.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on U.S. violation of international treaty and agreements \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 17 (KCNA) -- The United States is spreading a whopping lie that the DPRK violates the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework. \r\n The lie is aimed to tarnish the international prestige and authority of the DPRK and isolate the DPRK on a worldwide scale. And it is a cunning plot to cover up the criminal nature of the U.S. posing nuclear threats to the DPRK and divert the public attention at home and abroad elsewhere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun says this in a signed article today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Owing to the U.S. deliberate delay of light water reactors project, the DPRK has suffered a great loss of power and undergone grave economic difficulties. And it is seriously threatening the DPRK right to existence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. described the DPRK as part of an \"axis of evil\" and listed it as a target of preemptive nuclear attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. warmongers are now clamouring for a preemptive strike on the DPRK, presupposing the use of nuclear weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a declaration of war, a nuclear war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTherefore, the U.S. openly violated and destroyed the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework and nullified the north-south joint declaration on denuclearization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the independent right and the peace initiative of the DPRK that it proposed to the U.S. to conclude a non-aggression treaty between the DPRK and the U.S., a reasonable and realistic way for solving the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the U.S. to accede to the DPRK's proposal is its legal and moral duty as a nuclear weapon state. It is in full accord with the main spirit and purpose of the NPT and the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to clearly understand the reality and make a right option.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
