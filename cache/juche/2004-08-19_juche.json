Its main aim is to use the U.S. Third Armored Army Corps as an overseas reinforcement unit, conduct an \"operation for destabilizing the rear of the DPRK\" through joint air strikes by the U.S. forces in south Korea and the south Korean army, start a \"full-dress northward expedition\" in particular and \"siege and occupy Pyongyang\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are focusing their efforts on bolstering up their forces in south Korea in a bid to put their war scenario into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They officially informed the south Korean military authorities of the plan to \"reduce\" a total of 12,500 troops till next year through various channels including the 10th meeting of the Consultative Council for the Future of the South Korea-U.S. Alliance Policy Initiative. A shipment of military equipment of the Second Brigade of the U.S. Second Division has already left Pusan Port for overseas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are busy with the transfer of their bases.

Earlier, various types of uptodate war equipment including PAC-3 missiles had been introduced into south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Aegis destroyer equipped with missiles and the latest nuclear-powered aircraft carrier are to be deployed in the East Sea of Korea and its surrounding waters soon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration's \"reduction\" of the U.S. troops aimed to carry out a new strategy is in the process of being rounded off step by step with the massive amassing of armed forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' frantic moves to put into practice the \"operation plan 5027-04\" lay bare their true colors as war fanatics.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This will only result in destroying the foundation for the settlement of the nuclear issue. Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says this in a signed commentary.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the last talks the U.S. set out the \"forthcoming proposal\" advocating \"dialogue\" and \"negotiations\" for the settlement of the nuclear issue. There is, however, no noteworthy change in its stand and attitude. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The basic foundation of the six-party talks is collapsing due to the recent reckless smear campaign of the U.S. against the DPRK over issue of \"human rights,\" \"drug\" and \"defectors from the north\" aimed at the \"overthrow of the system\" in the DPRK and \"its change.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is deploying ultra-modern combat equipment in and around south Korea in real earnest and intensifying the blockade against the DPRK and war exercises against it under the cloak of \"reduction and relocation\" of the U.S. forces in south Korea, blustering that \"the option for the use of force is on the table.\" This is little short of laying a \"time bomb\" in the way of the six-party talks and a deliberate act of driving the talks to a collapse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some of the U.S. ruling quarters even assert that the six-party talks are unnecessary and meaningless and the next round of the talks may be put off till the time after the presidential election slated for November. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Judging from these facts, one may come to a definite conclusion that the U.S. is not interested in the talks but is keen only on stifling the DPRK as it did in Iraq. It is none other than the U.S. that is hamstringing the settlement of the nuclear issue and driving the talks to a breakdown. With neither excuse nor lie can the U.S. justify its criminal attempt or lay the blame at other's door. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to lend an ear to the demand of other participants in the talks, withdraw its unjust proposal and assertion and take a right option to have a sincere and well-intended way of thinking and stand. The fate of the talks and the prospect of settling the nuclear issue depend on the U.S. attitude.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
