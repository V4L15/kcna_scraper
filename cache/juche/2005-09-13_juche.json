And according to the historical document \"The Chronicles of the Three Kingdoms\", the King of Silla ordered the government office to keep ice in storage in November 504. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All this shows that the Korean nation had used ice in their life from old times while storing it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The sokbinggo stores in Haeju and Kyongju prove this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The sokbinggo in Okgye-dong, Haeju, South Hwanghae Province, is a half-underground structure with crescent ceiling which was built around the 10th century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was built by the method of erecting 12 arch-shape granite frames at intervals of 1.4meters and covering on them with large-sized flat rocks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The inside of the building is 28.3 meters long, 4.5 meters wide and about 6 meters high. \r\n The structure is mounded 1.5 meters thick with earth mixed with lime and clad with turf densely. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The sokbinggo in Kyongju, North Kyongsang Province, is similar to that in Haeju except its size. \r\n Its floor is inclined so the ice water may flow out and there are three ventilators on the ceiling. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Each sokbinggo was built with hundreds of trimmed stones without using adhesives. Thousand and hundreds of years have passed since their construction, but they remain as they were. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Sokbinggo shows the then developed stone architecture of the Korean nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 12 (KCNA) -- The commander of the U.S. forces in south Korea recently claimed that they are modifying their military strategy in the direction of depending on ultra-modern weapons to cope with any military conflict with north Korea while talking about its threat of conventional weapons and biological and chemical weapons.\r\n These remarks go beyond the tolerance limit as they reflect the U.S. policy stance which presupposes military conflicts, more specifically a war of aggression in dealing with the \"north Korean issue\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The gravity of such remarks lie in that they were made when the international community and countries concerned are calling for utmost self-restraint in provoking any dialogue partner, giving the soon-to-be-resumed six-party talks for the settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula due political and moral consideration.\r\n Those belligerent remarks clearly reveal the U.S. arrogant stand toward the talks and its bitter hostility toward the dialogue partner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through such remarks the U.S. once again disclosed its sinister intention to chill the atmosphere for peace, reunification, reconciliation and cooperation prevailing on the peninsula and launch a war of aggression on it at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIf its military strategy is being modified in the above-said direction, as he claimed, this will pose a more serious problem. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is well known that the U.S. military bases in south Korea are the biggest war powder magazines in the Far East built according to the U.S. strategy to dominate Asia.\r\n Deployed there are thousands of tactical nuclear weapons, a large number of depleted uranium shells, various types of aircraft including F-16 and F-15 fighters, nuclear delivery means, and Lance, PAC-3 and hundreds of other type missiles, atomic artillery pieces and various other type military hardware. This has converted south Korea into an area where strategic weapons are deployed more densely than any other parts of the world and the most dangerous nuclear arsenal in Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such being a stark fact, the U.S. strategy calls for equipping its forces in south Korea with ultra-modern weapons, a clear indication of its dangerous ambition to launch a war at any cost instead of ending the military stand-off with the DPRK.\r\n  The U.S. war to put Asia under its control in the new century, using south Korea as a springboard, is unavoidable and it may break out any moment as long as there remain U.S. military bases in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. military moves intensified in and around the Korean Peninsula are increasing the military tension in the region and sparking off a new arms race.\r\n Gone is the 20th century when the U.S. justified their military presence in south Korea. \r\n The end of the Cold War worldwide and the strong trend in the peninsula toward reconciliation, cooperation and independent reunification after the publication of the historic June 15 joint declaration prove that there is neither reason nor pretext for the U.S. to keep its military bases in south Korea any longer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. truly stands for detente and peace in and around the peninsula, it should behave itself swimming with the strong trend towards peace in the region and take a bold decision to withdraw its forces, the root cause of instability in the peninsula, from south Korea at an early date. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the requirement of the times.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
