            "content": "Decision adopted at joint meeting of political parties and organizations in DPRK hailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- The joint meeting of political parties and organizations in the DPRK held here on May 28 to pave the way for achieving reunification by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation called for holding a grand national symposium on Mt. Kumgang, a famous mountain of Korea, with people from all walks of life in the north, south and abroad attending on the occasion of the first anniversary of the publication of the north-south joint declaration.\r\n It also discussed such issues as organizing colorful events in the north, south and abroad according to their specific conditions, steadily staging a movement and functions to successfully implement the declaration and escalating them nationwide during the \"June 15-August 15 Period of the Movement for Promoting National Reunification.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary says that the proposal and decision made at the meeting are very significant and timely ones as they represent the nation's will and aspiration after reunification and the requirements of the reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over the last one year since the historic Pyongyang meeting and the publication of the joint declaration great progress has been made in the struggle for national reunification.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But, it is now facing a grave challenge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are desperately trying to throw a stumbling block in the way of the Korean nation's independent reunification, talking about \"hard-line\" toward someone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In South Korea large-scale joint military exercises against the DPRK are being staged one after another and pro-reunification patriotic organizations are being suppressed one after another on absurd charges of being \"enemy-benefiting\" organizations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The main purpose of the joint meeting is to hold those functions for reunification nationwide during the June 15-August 15 period and foil the outsiders' and anti-reunification forces' challenges through the unity of the whole nation and provide an opportunity to effect a new upswing in the movement for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One's stand and attitude toward the decision and call made at the joint meeting precisely mean an approach to the joint declaration and a criterion showing whether he or she wishes reconciliation, unity and reunification of the nation or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whoever is truly concerned about the destiny of the country and the nation and desirous of national reunification should positively respond to the decision and call of the joint meeting.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA brands U.S. as wrecker of world peace \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- Official figures of the U.S. administration in different places recently let loose a string of balderdash that \"the U.S. is ready to cooperate with Japan in exercising its right to collective self-defence\" and \"Japan should exercise its right to collective self-defence even by revising its constitution\".\r\n This is a proof that the Bush administration's attempt to turn Japan into a military power and use it as a shock brigade in executing the U.S. strategy for world domination has reached an extremely adventurous phase. \r\n The Japanese right-wing forces are now working hard to formally upgrade the \"Self-Defence Forces\" to an army and  rewrite the \"peace constitution\" so as to lay legal foundations for overseas aggression. If Japan is allowed to have regular armed forces and \"exercise the right to collective self-defence\", it will certainly turn into a military power and launch reinvasion of Asia. This is quite clear from Japan's past and its present political and military tendency. \r\n Japan is a war criminal state which inflicted monstrous disasters upon humankind and the only country obsessed with the wild ambition for aggression, far from liquidating its criminal past. \r\n That's why the international community has been very vigilant against Japan's moves for rearmament and for its conversion into a military power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the United States rearmed Japan and used many Japanese servicemen as a shock brigade for aggression during the Korean War and is now pushing it to those moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts go to prove that the U.S is the very one who sparks an arms race in Asia and wrecks the world peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration, seized by an arrogant and self-opinionated design for world domination, seems to forget that Japan's moves to emerge as a military power and realize militarization are far from beneficial to the U.S. itself. \r\n\r\n"
