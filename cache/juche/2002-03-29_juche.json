It was crowded with many people who were vying with each other to donate their bones, flesh and blood to his daughter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This was something beyond his imagination. He was so touched by this scene that he wrote a story about it on the spot and sent it to the provincial newspaper office. but the manuscript was sent back with a cold reply that it was not worth publicity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He could not tolerate this behavior. He could not understand the assertion of the office that the happening was not worth reporting though it was a most striking manifestation of human conscience, sense of obligation and morality. He was more deeply moved to see a pile of manuscripts at the editorial department. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There were stories about a doctor who cut conjunctivas from himself and his daughter and transplanted them to a blind and young men and women who devoted their lives to save their revolutionary comrades and volunteered to be life-long partners of disabled soldiers of the special category. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was hard for him to believe everything he saw and heard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many stirring happenings wherever he went in the motherland prompted him to write a note \"my motherland where angels live.\"\r\n"
