It has started a full-scale production.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round the process to learn in detail about the production of quilts and their quality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was pleased to see various types of equipment in the process producing different bedclothes including quilts for winter, summer, spring and autumn and wedding and bedcover.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that success of the light industrial policy largely depends on how the light industrial factories turn out goods favored by the people, he stressed the need for the mill to mass-produce quality quilts popular among them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The next leg of his visit was the workers' hostel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t While visiting the mill in last June, he promised the construction of a new hostel for workers at the highest level. He personally chose its site and guided its layout, dispatched a powerful construction force of the People's Army and settled all problems arising in the project one by one.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe soldier-builders have successfully completed the six storied hostel with a total floor space of more than 8,910 square meters in a matter of less than six months since the ground-breaking ceremony. It has a dining room, room for birthday party, sports and amusement room, bedrooms, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round various places of the hostel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pleased to hear employees of the mill call the newly-built hostel a palace and hotel for workers rare to be found in the world, he emphasized that such hostel could be built in the DPRK only as it is a society for the working class. \"How happy President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il would have been if they had seen such hostel,\" he said with deep emotion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the hostel of the mill represents a monumental edifice showing the high level of the nation's architecture at present when a high level of civilization is being attained in the era of the Workers' Party and a golden era in construction is unfolding, he highly praised service personnel of KPA Unit 966 for having devotedly carried out the order given by the Party and gave them thanks of the Supreme Commander of the KPA.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The mill is a pivot one in the field of light industry, he said, expressing belief and conviction that its officials and workers would as ever set an example to be followed by the whole country in the year's dynamic drive for improving the standard of people's living.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by An Jong Su, department director of the C.C., WPK, Jo Yong Won and Pak Myong Sun, vice department directors of the C.C., WPK."

The following are the ten shocking events made in the DPRK last year.\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Completion of the Sci-Tech Complex\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On the New Year's Day of 2016 the DPRK declared the completion of the Sci-Tech Complex, a grand seat of learning for all the people in the 21st century. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The presence of respected Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un at its opening ceremony marked a historical event declaring the firm will of the Workers' Party of Korea to step up the building of a thriving country by dint of science and technology and outpace the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. The successful first H-bomb test of Juche Korea\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The successful first H-bomb test on January 6, 2016, was a noteworthy event in the Korean nation's history of 5 000 years as it made the DPRK imposingly rise as a nuclear power in the East. It was a solemn warning of Juche Korea to the U.S. imperialists, the mastermind of aggression and war, and their vassal forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Launch of earth observation satellite Kwangmyongsong-4\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At 9:00 on February 7, 2016, Kwangmyongsong 4, an earth observation satellite, was launched into space, demonstrating the spirit of the great Paektusan nation. It was a demonstration of the dignity of the DPRK dashing into outer space with its own efforts, technology and resources.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t4. The construction of Ryomyong Street, demonstration of Songun Korea's invincible strength\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un declared the construction of Ryomyong Street in March 2016 when upset by the DPRK's nuclear test for self-defence and launch of satellite, the U.S.-led imperialist allied forces went desperate in their unprecedented moves to stifle it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t5. Completion of the Paektusan Hero Youth Power Station No. 3, demonstration of the youth power's dignity\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Paektusan Hero Youth Power Station No. 3 was completed in April last year. This served as an occasion that displayed the might of the youth power which will further prosper under the leadership of Kim Jong Un, who put forward the young people as the reserve combat unit and detached corps of the Supreme Commander, true to President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il's idea of prioritizing the youth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t6. The Seventh Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The 7th WPK Congress was splendidly held in May last year, which showed the true picture of the glorious WPK and the single-minded unity of Kim Il Sung's nation and Kim Jong Il's Korea dashing toward the final victory by rallying the army and people with the revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu and the self-development-first principle under the guidance of Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t7. The successful test-fires of ground to ground medium-and-long range strategic ballistic rocket Hwasong-10 and submarine-launched ballistic missile Pukguksong\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The test-fires were crucial events that confirmed the truth that the indomitable will of the DPRK army and people and the determination of the WPK precisely mean practice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t8. The nuclear warhead explosion test in September\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nuclear scientists and technicians of the DPRK decorated the September holiday with the detonation of victory, displaying the might of Juche Korea's strong nuclear attack capabilities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The test was a solemn declaration that the DPRK is ready to mercilessly react to any provocation, as an actual counteraction to the U.S. and other hostile forces' escalated nuclear war threat and sanctions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t9. Mysterious miracle wrought in flood-hit northern part of the country\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK created new heroic myth by winning the great victory in the campaign to recover the northern part of the country hit hard by the biggest flood since the liberation of Korea between August 29 and September 2.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMore than 11,900 dwelling houses were built and dozens of new streets and villages emerged in a little over two months.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t10.  The First Conference of Chairpersons of the Primary Committees of the Workers' Party of Korea\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Conference in December 2016 was a declaration of victors in the 200-day Campaign and a new landmark in strengthening the Party and building a socialist power."

            "content": "Vocero de cancilleria coreana condena a EE.UU. que cuestiona los preparativos de lanzamiento de ICBM de la RPDC\r\nPyongyang, 8 de enero (ACNC) -- A la pregunta de un reportero de la ACNC formulada con respecto a que los Estados Unidos cuestiona los preparativos del lanzamiento de ICBM que esta en la etapa final en la RPDC, el vocero del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de la RPDC dio hoy la siguiente respuesta:\n\t\t\t\t\tEl desarrollo del ICBM de la RPDC es una parte del trabajo para fortalecer la capacidad de autodefensa nacional frente a la cada dia mas recrudescente amenaza de guerra nuclear de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, el pais norteamericano habla de las sanciones y presiones calificando de \"provocacion\" y \"amenaza\" los justos preparativos del lanzamiento de ICBM de la RPDC, igual que un incendiario que grita primero \"!fuego!\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl dia 5, el subsecretario de Estado norteamericano chismeo que ha llegado a la etapa tan extremada la amenaza del Norte de Corea y que seguiran como ahora la sancion y la presion contra la RPDC en cualesquier administraciones norteamericanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA esta peroracion de la banda de Obama se incorporan las gentuzas de especialistas y hasta algunos medios de prensa conservadores. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tVolvemos a aclarar que el autor que nos empujo al desarrollo del ICBM es EE.UU., que durante los decenios pasados ha venido recurriendo perversamente a la anacronica politica hostil para exterminar la soberania y el derecho a existencia de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo las sanciones y presiones sin precedentes, la RPDC desarrollo la bomba H acelerando el desarrollo en el nivel alto de armas nucleares con una velocidad inimaginable apoyandose en la capacidad de autofortalecimiento y sin ninguna ayuda externa y poseyo hasta la ojiva nuclear estandarizada. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl cohete balistico intercontinental se lanzara en cualquier momento y lugar decididos por la Direccion Suprema de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Maximo Dirigente Kim Jong Un dijo que mientras continuen el chantaje nuclear de los Estados Unidos y sus seguidores y no dejen de realizar en nuestras propias narices los ejercicios de guerra con la excusa de que es una tradicion efectuarlos ano tras ano, la RPDC seguira reforzando la capacidad de autodefensa y de ataque preventivo centrada en las fuerzas armadas nucleares. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tQuienquiera que quiere tratar con la RPDC, debera conocer bien primero a la RPDC y tener un nuevo modo de pensar."
