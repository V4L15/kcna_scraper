This goes to clearly prove that the nuclear issue raised by the U.S. imperialists is a product of their aggressive plan to disarm and stifle the DPRK by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Raising a hue and cry over the north's \"southward invasion,\" a fiction, the U.S. imperialists have got the South Korean military authorities involved in their moves. Through this they seek to incite confrontation between the north and the south and militarily threaten the DPRK in a bid to attain its sinister aim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is ready both for dialogue and war. Anyone who attempts to make a preemptive strike at the DPRK can never go safe, the commentary warns.    \r\n     \r\n"

They remain content only if the army is strong, though they do not enjoy an affluent life. This is the faith enshrined by them. They are giving priority to the development of the national defence industry in the economic construction. Everything is subordinated to this work in the creation and construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people assist the army, regarding their devotion to the servicepersons as something very rewarding and proud.        \r\n\r\n"

It also listed the DPRK as a target of its preemptive nuclear attack, an open declaration of a nuclear war against it. Moreover, it instigated the International Atomic Energy Agency to escalate the moves to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK can never remain a mere onlooker to the cry made again by the U.S. defense secretary for an attack on the DPRK at a time when there is the real danger of a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula due to the U.S. vicious hostile policy toward it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rumsfeld again dubbed the DPRK the \"biggest ballistic missile disseminator in the world\" in a bid to justify the U.S. strategy for reckless preemptive assaults. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is, in fact, not in a position to talk about the proliferation of ballistic missiles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. tops the list of countries producing and selling mass destruction weapons including nuclear weapons, and has the world's biggest military spending to produce and develop those weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has exported 44.8 billion dollars worth of weapons in the last 5 years, becoming the biggest arms exporter. Last year it allocated 281.4 billion dollars as its military spending, stunning the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. keeps vociferating about a preemptive attack on the DPRK, asserting the need to contain the missiles developed and produced by the DPRK to defend the sovereignty of the country as they can reach not only Japan but the U.S. this once again clearly indicates that the U.S. has no intention to normalize the relations with the DPRK, considering it as the principal enemy of the U.S. and is waiting for a chance to invade it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such reckless moves of the U.S. only compel the people and the people's army of the DPRK to further increase the self-defensive military capability to cope with the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"
