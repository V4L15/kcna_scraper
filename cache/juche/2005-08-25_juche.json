Nevertheless, it has persistently evaded its responsibility for the crimes and, on the contrary, is now hell-bent on the anti-DPRK moves while peddling the issue of the remains of \"abducted Japanese\" which had been already settled. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The association, on behalf of all the Korean victims of forcible drafting and their bereaved families, bitterly denounces such shameless behavior of the Japanese authorities, branding it as the most despicable inhumane crime.\r\n The Japanese authorities should have a clear understanding of the will of the Korean nation and make a thoroughgoing probe into the truth about all the inhuman crimes committed by Japan against the Korean people in the past.

All Koreans in the north, the south and overseas should fully realize cooperation for peace against war to deal telling blows at the U.S. imperialists keen to start a new war through their concerted efforts and fulfill their responsibility and role as masters in hewing out the destiny of the nation and achieving national reunification.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says this in a signed article. It goes on:\r\n The \"Ulji Focus Lens-05\" joint military exercises launched by the U.S. imperialist warmongers again in south Korea are a blatant challenge to the Koreans desirous of reunification and a serious threat to the peace and security on the peninsula. To achieve the above-said cooperation represents a struggle to frustrate the moves of the foreign forces for a war of aggression and preserve the peace and security of the country by the concerted efforts of the Koreans.\r\n It is an urgent and essential requirement for hewing out the destiny of the Korean nation to realize the above-said form of cooperation.\r\n In the 50s of the last century the United States provoked a war of aggression against the DPRK in order to dominate the whole of Korea, inflicting war disasters upon the Koreans. It has watched for a chance to invade the DPRK for scores of years. It has steadily modified and supplemented its operation plans to mount a preemptive attack on the DPRK and staged such joint military war drills as RSOI, \"Foal Eagle\" and \"Ulji Focus Lens\" in an effort to grasp and round off them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Cooperation for peace against war that calls on the Koreans to pool their efforts in the struggle against war indicates a right way of providing a peaceful precondition for national reunification and prosperity. \r\n The above-said form of cooperation is urgently required by the era and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fellow countrymen living in the June 15 era of reunification wish to achieve the reunification and prosperity of the nation in the spirit of \"By our nation itself.\" War and division are quite contrary to the will of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said form of cooperation means the response of the fellow countrymen to the call of the era and nation and a basic way of frustrating the U.S. moves for a war of aggression against the DPRK. \r\n The struggle for peace against war is one sure to triumph, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The on-going saber-rattling is, therefore, a preliminary operation to provoke the Korean war of aggression.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The exercises are aimed to round off the preparations for a preemptive attack on the DPRK, ratchet up the situation on the Korean Peninsula to an extreme pitch of tension, hamstring the favorable process of reconciliation and cooperation between the north and the south and pressurize the DPRK by force of arms to meet the unreasonable demands it raised at the six-party talks.\r\n Should the U.S. persistently escalate its military provocations and war moves against the DPRK, showing no change in its policy of stifling it as now, the prospect of confidence building between Pyongyang and Washington will be remote and the situation will turn more complicated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality compels the army and people of the DPRK to heighten vigilance against the U.S. sophism that it would \"neither attack nor invade the DPRK\" and reinforce its determination to bolster its military deterrence in every way.\r\n The U.S. bellicose forces should ponder over the serious consequences to be entailed by their madcap military exercises against the DPRK and immediately stop the Ulji Focus Lens-05 joint military exercises that go against peace and dialogue.    \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In the 1980s, too, he wisely led the drive for further strengthening and developing the People's Army into a revolutionary army unfailingly loyal to the Party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il developed in depth the Songun politics and Songun leadership to meet the requirements of the developing revolution and trained the army to be vanguard ranks of devotedly demanding the leader, a strong revolutionary army of Mt. Paektu in the 1990s. He is wisely leading the army holding higher the banner of Songun in the new century so that the army may form an integral whole with the supreme commander and fulfill its noble mission in the first line of the Songun revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter said that all the officials and servicemen should prepare themselves as the first-line fighters, first-line human bombs in defence of the headquarters of the revolution headed by Kim Jong Il and strengthen the ideological might of arms. He underscored the need for serviceman to put spurs to strengthening the combat power of the army and completing preparations for fighting with firm anti-imperialist and working class consciousness and fighting spirit and mercilessly wipe out the enemies and accomplish the historic cause of national reunification if the enemies invade even an inch of sky, land and sea of the sacred country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The meeting was attended by KPA Vice Marshals Jo Myong Rok, director of the KPA General Political Department, Kim Yong Chun, chief of the KPA General Staff, and Kim Il Chol, minister of the People's Armed Forces.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
