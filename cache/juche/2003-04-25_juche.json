Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They pointed out that Kim Jong Il put forward the original Songun revolutionary line and the Songun political mode, regarding as a basis and starting point of socialist politics the idea and line of attaching importance to military affairs invariably maintained by President Kim Il Sung in the whole course of the Korean revolution, firmly convinced that the independence and prosperity of the country and the nation can be achieved only in reliance on the arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il's Songun policy is the mode of revolutionary leadership and socialist politics as it regards the military affair as the most important state affair and helps defend the country, the revolution and the socialist system and step up the overall socialist construction by drawing on the revolutionary spirit and militancy of the People's Army, they noted, adding: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His Songun revolutionary line and policy are a strategic revolutionary line and political mode that should be consistently adhered to as long as the imperialists remain on the earth.         \r\n\r\n"

This international situation requires humankind to hold higher the banner of independence, peace and friendship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The foreign policy of the WPK and the DPRK reflects the wish of humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Friendship and solidarity among peoples advocating independence provide a fundamental guarantee for frustrating imperialists' moves for aggression and war, ensuring independent progress of all countries and successfully carrying out global independence. \r\n Now that the imperialists seek to topple progressive countries one by one in alliance with the reactionary forces, it is important for all the countries and peoples advocating independence to strengthen friendship and solidarity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK and the DPRK government will strive to improve relations with even those countries which were hostile to the DPRK if they respect its sovereignty and drop a hostile policy toward it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will work hard to implement the idea of its foreign policy in hearty response to the calls of the WPK Central Committee.         \r\n\r\n"

71st birthday of the heroic Korean People's Army, the revolutionary armed forces of the Workers' Party of Korea.\r\n KPA vice marshal Kim Il Chol, vice-chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission and Minister of the People's Armed Forces, made a report. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said that 71 years covered by the KPA was a glorious history in which the KPA has grown to be a main force of the Korean revolution and emerged victorious thanks to the outstanding idea of army building and the tested leadership of President     Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that the president declared to the world the birth of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army, the Juche-oriented revolutionary armed forces, the first of its kind in Korea, on April 25, Juche 21 (1932), the reporter said that this marked the beginning of the glorious history of the People's Army of Korea and the building of the revolutionary armed forces in the era of independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA which was founded by the president and grew stronger under his leadership has reached the high watermark of its development thanks to Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The greatest feat performed by supreme commander Kim Jong Il in accomplishing the cause of army building is that he has successfully carried forward the president's Juche-based idea and theory of army-building and perfected the unique theory of building revolutionary armed forces based on the Songun idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the highest honour of the KPA that it has grown to be an army of the party, the leader and the supreme commander devotedly defending the headquarters of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA has grown to be one-match-for-a hundred revolutionary armed forces firmly equipped with Kim Jong Il's Juche-oriented military strategy, idea and tactics and possessed of high combat technology and an invincible army with offensive and defensive means strong enough to wipe out any formidable enemy at a single stroke relying upon its self-supporting and modern national defence industry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA has become an invincible revolutionary army capable of mercilessly striking and destroying aggressors coming in attack on socialist Korea no matter where they may be on earth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis is a great victory of Kim Jong Il's Songun idea and the Juche-oriented line of army-building and a great pride of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the supreme task of the KPA to devotedly safeguard the headquarters of the revolution, the reporter said, underscoring the need for the KPA to wage a vigorous movement to obtain the Title of O Jung Hup's 7th Regiment and turn the whole army into the 7th regiment today which devotedly defends the headquarters of the revolution and train all the servicepersons to be human bombs and fighters ready to blow up themselves so as to protect the supreme commander at the cost of their lives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He called for organizing all the work on the principle of giving top priority to military affairs and directing primary efforts to increasing the military potential of the country true to the WPK's idea of attaching the greatest importance to the army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should hold fast to the WPK's strategic line of giving priority to the development of the national defence industry and implement to the letter its policy to put all people under arms and turn the whole country into a fortress so as to give full play to the advantages of the all-people, nationwide defense system, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the complicated and acute situation the Korean revolution is facing, the reporter said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists, persistently pursuing their policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK, are staging madcap war exercises one after another after hurling a huge task force into South Korea and its vicinity under the pretext of the \"nuclear issue\" of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's revolutionary armed forces are closely following the U.S. belligerent forces' ever-more undisguised moves for aggression and war and keeping themselves fully ready to deal telling blows at the aggressors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. warhawks are well advised to behave with discretion, properly judging the might of the KPA and its will to annihilate the enemy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. imperialists and their followers intrude into even an inch of the inviolable sky, land and sea of the DPRK defying the DPRK's serious warning, the KPA will deal merciless deadly blows at the aggressors and achieve a final victory in the confrontation with the U.S., he stated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The meeting was attended by senior party, state and army officials, chairpersons of the friendly parties, senior officials of military institutions, commanders of the three services and arms of the KPA, the chief of the Pyongyang mission of the National Democratic Front of South Korea and overseas Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Also present there on invitation were diplomatic envoys of different countries and members of the military attaches corps here and other foreign guests.         \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
