Korea Combined Military Exercises\r\n Pyongyang, November 28 (KCNA) -- The National Peace Committee of Korea issued a statement on Sunday as regards the fact that the United States and the south Korean puppet group finally kicked off the largest-scale combined military exercises aimed at armed invasion of the DPRK in the West Sea of Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t The madcap aggression war exercises launched by them in the sea and the sky near the extension of the Military Demarcation Line in the West Sea of Korea are putting the Korean Peninsula at a state of ultra-emergency while creating the grave situation whereby peace and security are exposed to serious threat, the statement points out, and says:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The West Sea of Korea is the most acute and sensitive area where military conflict might break out anytime due to the illegal \"northern limit line\" unilaterally drawn by the U.S. and the ceaseless provocation of the south Korean puppet group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the U.S. and the south Korean puppet group kicked off in this area the military exercises with huge aggression armed forces including nuclear powered carrier involved before the recent smoke of shelling disappeared. This is no more than an attempt to find a pretext for aggression and ignite a war at any cost.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In October last they planned to stage the frantic anti-DPRK war games with U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier George Washington again involved in the West Sea of Korea only to be checked by the unanimous protest at home and abroad. But this time they carried such scheme into practice at last under the pretext of the Yonphyong Island incident.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the height of folly for the U.S. and the puppet group to browbeat the DPRK with such nuclear-powered aircraft carrier.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the puppet group of traitors will be wholly held accountable for having escalated the tension in the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia and wrecked the regional peace and security with their reckless war maneuvers."

This was a legitimate exercise of the right to self-defence taken to defend the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK from the provocateurs' reckless moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Sunday stresses this in a signed commentary.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent provocation by the south Korean warmongers is part of their vicious scheme to defend the brigandish \"northern limit line\" by persistently letting their warships into the territorial waters of the DPRK side under the pretext of \"intercepting fishing boats\", the commentary points out, and says:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities are now busy issuing the alert order to the entire puppet forces and examining the declaration of \"posture for combined control over crisis\" with the U.S. like a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\" This is intended to shirk off their responsibility for the serious military provocation and justify their scheme for confrontation with the DPRK and moves to ignite a war against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There only exists in the West Sea of Korea the extension of the military demarcation line fixed by the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"northern limit line\" adhered to by the south Korean authorities is an illegal ghost line aimed at escalating the anti-DPRK moves and provoking a war against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such moves for confrontation and war with the DPRK made by the puppet war maniacs under the pretext of \"defending northern limit line\" will bring nothing but shameful self-destruction to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will deal a merciless military counter-attack at any provocative act of intruding into its territorial waters in the future, too."
