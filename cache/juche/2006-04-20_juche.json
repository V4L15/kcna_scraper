He in the article noted that the independence, democracy and reunification so much desired by the uprisers have not yet come true. \r\n Even in this 21st century the U.S. imperialists are keeping their aggression troops in south Korea and instigating the pro-U.S. traitorous forces to block the independence and progress of the south Korean society and perpetrate rowdyism against reunification and the nation in a bid to realize their brigandish ambition to dominate the whole of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The adoption of the June 15 joint declaration paved a wide avenue for independent reunification on this land but the rash acts on the part of such group of traitors as the GNP are rendering the drive for the abolition of the \"National Security Law\", a draconic law against reunification, futile and blocking the advance of the people to realize the justice of the society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP group identical to its predecessors in its pro-U.S. flunkeyist mentality and unpopular nature is whetting its sword to restore fascist dictatorship in an effort to return to power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is, however, nothing but a foolish dream and a last-ditch effort of those who are marginalized by the strong trend of history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson in an article calls for realizing the desire, which the April 19 uprisers failed to achieve, through a patriotic movement for independent reunification, peace against war and the great national unity with main emphasis on the anti-U.S. struggle.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is publicly recognized in the light of historical facts and from the international legal point of view. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is a war criminal state and a defeated state as it invaded Asian countries while advocating the \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\" in the past.\r\n Such being a stark fact, Japan is keen to realize its old dream, rushing headlong into militarism and moves to turn it into a military power under the patronage and backing of the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such ambition for militarist territorial expansion pursued by Japan taking advantage of the U.S. strategy to hold world supremacy is posing a serious threat to peace and security not only in the Korean Peninsula but in the rest of Northeast Asia.\r\n The Korean working class and the trade union members who hold the sovereignty of the country and the dignity of the nation dearest will never tolerate such moves of the Japanese reactionaries for territorial expansion as seeking to grab Tok Islet but resolutely shatter them with the forces bolstered up with the might of Songun.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
