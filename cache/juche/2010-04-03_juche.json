At the outset of 1948 they were crafty enough to bring to it the \"UN Temporary Commission on Korea\" abusing the name of the UN in a bid to perpetuate their colonial domination by setting up a \"separate government\" in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The people on Jeju Island rose in a popular armed uprising against the unilateral \"May 10 separate elections\" carried by the stooges of the U.S. imperialists. They waged powerful just resistance, attacking and destroying institutions for enforcing a repressive rule and restoring the people's committees forcibly disorganized by them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Much scared by this, the U.S. imperialists dispatched Robert, \"head of the U.S. military advisory group\" in south Korea, to the spot to command an operation to put down the uprising. The fascist tyrants indiscriminately murdered at least 70,000 persons or one fourth of the population of the island.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through their bloody resistance the patriotic people on the island taught all the Koreans truth that the U.S. imperialists are the enemy of the Korean nation with whom they cannot live under the same sky and to wage an indomitable anti-U.S. struggle is the only way of achieving independence and democracy in south Korean society and national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Much water has flown under the bridge since the uprising but the south Korean people are still witnessing the dignity and sovereignty of the nation being trampled down and democracy and human rights wantonly violated by foreign forces and traitors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The struggle of people from all walks of life to put an end to the foreign domination and interference and achieve the peace and reunification of the country by their concerted efforts in the spirit of \"By our nation itself\" is mounting higher in south Korea. This clearly indicates that the south Korean people, awakened in the course of the struggle, are filled with the will not to tolerate any longer the arbitrary practices of the aggressors and the anti-reunification moves of the traitors but to bring about a landmark phase in the movement for independent reunification under the uplifted banner of the north-south joint declaration."
