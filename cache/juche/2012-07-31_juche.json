            "content": "FM Spokesman Slashes at U.S. Anti-DPRK Smear Campaign\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, July 31 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the DPRK issued the following statement on Tuesday:\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. authorities are vying each other to commit politically-motivated provocations against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. chief executive asserted that the DPRK's nuclear deterrent for self-defense \"threatens the world\" while its military chief made oft-repeated trumpeting about \"provocations.\" Officials of the Department of State including its secretary groundlessly slandered the DPRK on the basis of a variety of wild rumors about its situation without their own judgments to distinguish truth from lies. They are still pulling up the DPRK over its launch of satellite for peaceful purposes in a clumsy bid to justify their hostile policy toward it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The outbursts let loose by the authorities, prompted by their inveterate rejection and hostile intents on the ideology and social system chosen by the people of the DPRK clearly proved that the U.S. remains unchanged in its hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is known to everybody that the U.S. is hostile to the DPRK. But the point is why the authorities of its administration are all out to kick up an unprecedented anti-DPRK smear campaign this time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This reflects their fear of the fact that world people are rapidly growing stronger in their admiration and expectation for the rosy future of the DPRK led by the dear respected Kim Jong Un admired by the whole world. Also lurking behind this is their black-hearted intention to calm down bitter denunciation and pressure of the international community to the effect that it is impossible to ensure durable peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula unless the U.S. drops its anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. claims that it has no hostile intent on the DPRK while malignantly slandering it. This is no more than sheer hypocrisy aimed to deceive the public, to all intents and purposes, because it is an incoherent one. This is proved by what the U.S. is now doing quite contrary to its claim.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is busy staging large-scale joint military exercises against the DPRK one after another after massively introducing ultra-modern war means into south Korea and its vicinity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t While talking about \"people's living\" in the DPRK, the U.S. is persisting in its harshest and protracted sanctions and blockade against it, threatening its vital rights and barring it from developing the economy and  improving people's living standard.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is talking to the DPRK that its people would live well if it dismantles its nukes. This reminds one of a wolf preaching that it would not hurt sheep if the sheep has its horns curved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the DPRK's steadfast option to counter the U.S. hostile policy with bolstered nuclear deterrent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that the DPRK has powerful nuclear deterrent and strong munitions industry capable of steadily bolstering it, it is capable of putting spurs to the building of an economic power, undeterred by the U.S. persistent hostile policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK does not need any advice from others as it has strategy and orientation of its own style to develop the economy and improve the standard of people's living and ways to carry them out.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It will surely build a thriving socialist nation while countering the U.S. hostile policy with its toughest policy, with everybody holding arms in one hand and a banner of industrial revolution in the new century in the other."

            "content": "DPRK Will Take Corresponding Measures against Terrorism: CPRK\r\n Pyongyang, July 31 (KCNA) -- The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) issued the following statement on Tuesday:\n\t\t\t\t\t As reported, there were press conferences with Pak Jong Suk and Jon Yong Chol shortly ago. Pak came back to the DPRK after being lured and abducted to south Korea by the south Korean puppet regime and Jon, a defector to the south, was arrested after infiltrating into the DPRK to destroy statues symbolic of the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and its monuments under the manipulation of the U.S. and the south Korean regime. The press conferences fully revealed the truth about the U.S. and the south Korean regime's allurement and abduction of residents of the DPRK and their attempted terrorism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now the service personnel and people of the DPRK and all other Koreans are expressing irrepressible resentment at those attempted terrorist acts and they have aroused concern and shock among the world people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their attempted terrorism is a blatant challenge to the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK, a wanton violation of its sovereignty and a grave breach of international law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This indicates that the hostile forces' moves for subversion and sabotage against the DPRK have entered a very dangerous phase of action. The above-said cases go to clearly prove once again that \"defectors to the south\" and \"human rights in the north\" much touted by the U.S. and the south Korean group of traitors are nothing but hypocrisy and their real aim is to do harm to the single-minded unity of the DPRK and bring down its social system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Much upset by the disclosure of their crimes in the eyes of the world, the U.S. and the south Korean regime are letting loose a spate of sheer sophism that they \"have no hostile intents\", it is \"an individual deed\" and it is \"a unilateral smear campaign of the north\" in a bid to mislead public opinion, Worse still, they are making desperate efforts to conceal the recent cases by such base methods as killing and eliminating those involved in them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With nothing, however, can they conceal or hush up their unethical and hideous crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Moreover, it is becoming clearer with each passing day that the recent attempted terrorism was an organized and premeditated crime of the U.S. and the puppet regime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Wicked traitor Kim Yong Hwan was recently arrested by the Chinese security authorities before being expelled to south Korea. His crime once again confirmed how desperately the regime is working to destroy and sabotage the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts clearly prove that the U.S. and the puppet regime are the worst human rights abusers and chieftains of abduction and terrorism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that the U.S. and the puppet regime are luring and kidnapping residents of the DPRK in wanton violation of international law and attempting nefarious terrorism against the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK, it has a legitimate right to take all corresponding steps, pursuant to the DPRK Law and the International Convention on Human Rights and Anti-Terrorism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea is authorized to solemnly state as follows in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. The U.S. and the south Korean puppet regime should stop at once the act of luring and abducting DPRK citizens, make an official apology for the hideous politically-motivated, state-sponsored terrorism against the dignity of its supreme leadership and sternly punish the prime movers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should immediately disband anti-DPRK plot-breeding and terrorist organizations including the \"Front for Liberation of North Korean People\" and the \"Society for Destroying Statues\", despicable groups of traitors, and discontinue such base and reckless acts as bribing human scum and hurling them into crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. In case the DPRK's just demands are not met, there will follow corresponding measures including punishment of criminals involved in monstrous terrorism and other subversive and sabotage acts against the DPRK and the operations to lure and abduct its citizens.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We declare that among the targets to be punished will be Kim Song Min, representative of the \"Radio Free North Korea\" who is the prime mover of the recent attempted terrorism, Pak Sang Hak, representative of the \"Federation of the Movement for Free North Korea\" who is keen on abduction, terrorism and plots, Jo Myong Chol, former director of the \"Unification Education Institute\", and Kim Yong Hwan, a despicable renegade.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. We will in the future, too, never allow those abductors, terrorists and saboteurs who dare hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK, encroach upon its sovereignty and threaten the safety of its citizens and their organizers and those involved in them to go scot-free even by scouring all parts of the earth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the south Korean conservative group will be wholly accountable for all this.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is an inviolable and legitimate right of the DPRK to devotedly protect the dignity of its supreme leadership and safeguard its sovereignty and the safety of its people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those who dare hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and its social system and people will not be safe no matter where they are and they will not be able to escape merciless punishment of the army and people of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the rat-like Lee Myung Bak group should clearly understand that the steel-strong single-minded unity of all the service personnel and people of the DPRK is unbreakable as they are under the great illustrious commander."
