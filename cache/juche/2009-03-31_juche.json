Now the Korean people are looking back on the grim days of struggle with deep emotion. \n\t\t\t\t\tThis march continued for more than 100 days from December Juche 27 (1938) to March next year. It was a road of ordeals surpassing human imagination and a glorious course in which the unit emerged victorious in bloody battles by fighting like an immortal day and night. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn that winter the Japanese imperialists fell upon the unit tenaciously on all sides by setting in motion a huge force hundreds of thousands strong and even flying corps, making the KPRA headquarters as the main target of the so-called \"massive clean-up operation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTo make matters worse, food ran out in the severe cold around 40 degrees Celsius below zero coupled with heaviest snowfall in 100 years. Under this worst condition the main unit of the KPRA had to fight bloody battles with the enemy coming in attack desperately in the front and rear and right and left every day. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis march involving struggles with rigorous element, acute food shortage and fatigue, terrible diseases and the brutal enemy was a hard fight accompanied by a struggle with oneself for surmounting bitter ordeals. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBut difficulty could not break the indomitable mental power and will of the guerrillas who were confident that the Korean revolution would surely win as long as they were guided by the President. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the days of the march, they defended with their very lives, politically and ideologically, the President who constantly fortified their revolutionary fighting spirit, looking after them with paternal affection, and trounced the enemy by bold and superb commanding art and guerrilla tactics. And they solidified the unity and cohesion of the unit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe loser in the battles for more than one hundred days that lifted the Korean revolution to a new upsurge was none other than the Japanese imperialist aggressors who blared they would \"totally destroy\" the KPRA.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe spirit of devotedly defending the leader and the indomitable fighting spirit, the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle and revolutionary optimism displayed by the anti-Japanese revolutionary forerunners in those days are being steadily carried forward by the younger generation today, named the spirit of \"Arduous March\", and they serve as an ideological and mental weapon in the struggle of the Korean people to build a great, prosperous and powerful socialist nation without fail, breaking through whatever difficulty."

Japan is taking the lead in this racket though it has committed the biggest crimes against the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t Japanese authorities including Prime Minister Aso are making much ado, asserting that the above-said satellite launch poses a \"threat\" to their security. Ship-and ground-based interceptor missiles and monitoring means of the \"Self-Defense Forces (SDF)\" are being deployed in the East Sea of Korea and its vicinity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are asserting that in case the satellite is launched, Japan will independently apply additional sanctions against the DPRK and bring up the issue for discussion at the UNSC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They blustered that they would \"intercept\" the DPRK's satellite, counting on the support from their master. But when their master flinched because of the strong stand of the Korean People's Army, they found themselves in such a miserable position as to modify their assertion by uttering that they would intercept it only when the debris of the multi-stage carrier rocket falls down on the land of Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Clear is the reason why Japan is kicking up such a row to disturb the world, doggedly insisting that the DPRK's launch of satellite is aimed at developing the missile technology. The primary aim sought by Japan through this is to bring the six-party talks to collapse and delay the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and thus justify its ambition for nuclear weaponization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Looking back on the history of the six-party talks, Japan has done only wicked and wrong things obstructive to the denuclearization of the peninsula since their very start. The whole world, to say nothing of the parties to the talks, has a common understanding of this.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan has opposed every effort to abide by the principle of \"action for action\" for the denuclearization as evidenced by its stand against the delisting of the DPRK as a \"sponsor of terrorism\" and persistent refusal to fulfil its commitment to offer energy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's deliberate obstruction is intended to frustrate the denuclearization of the peninsula at any cost in a bid to secure a pretext for justifying its nuclear weaponization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Another aim sought by Japan through this is to use the DPRK's satellite launch as the best pretext for facilitating the militarization of the Japanese society and weathering its political crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the Japanese authorities admitted, they have neither guarantee nor conviction that they can intercept the DPRK's satellite.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What they seek more than anything else through their opposition to the said satellite launch is political and military aims.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In other words, they are working hard to focus the attention of the people at home disillusioned with the corrupt political landscape on \"threat to security\" with an eye to incite militarism, gain time to tide over the political crisis and lay a springboard from which to push forward in real earnest the moves to turn Japan into a military power including the building of a joint missile shield with the U.S. in the future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the ulterior aim sought by Japan in hyping \"the missile threat from north Korea.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The war blackmail and all other hostile acts Japan is resorting to, describing only the DPRK's satellite launch as the development of missile technology are little short of a declaration that Japan does not recognize the September 19 joint statement calling for embodying \"the spirit of mutual respect and equality.\" This is, in the final analysis, an act of overturning the six-party talks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is not afraid of any attempt of Japan to intercept \"Kwangmyongsong-2.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Should Japan dare recklessly intercept the DPRK's satellite, its army will consider this as the start of Japan's war of reinvasion more than six decades after the Second World War and mercilessly destroy all its interceptor means and citadels with the most powerful military means."
