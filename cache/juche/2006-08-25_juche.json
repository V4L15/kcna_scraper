His energetic Songun revolutionary leadership helped perfect the all-people, nationwide defence system and effect fresh renovation and turn in political, economic, cultural and all other fields. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was a century-old political and military miracle wrought by the great Songun politics that the Korean army and people have defended the banner of independence, the banner of socialism, while countering the ever-more undisguised moves of the U.S. imperialists and the imperialist reactionary forces to stifle the DPRK with a super hard line in the recent ten odd years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the tasks facing them, the reporter called on the whole Party and the entire army and all the people to form Songun revolutionary ranks of a harmonious whole sharing idea and intention with Kim Jong Il and consolidate the single-minded unity of the Party, the army and the people rallied close around the headquarters of the revolution in every way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He also underlined the need to develop national defence industry, thoroughly establish the trait of attaching importance to military affairs in the whole society and steadily carry through the Party's policies of putting all the people under arms and turning the whole country into a fortress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation of the Korean Peninsula, which is growing tense due to the U.S. base and vicious hostile policy toward the DPRK, clearly proves how just it was that we have maintained our firm stand that the sovereignty of the country and the dignity of the nation can be defended only by our own powerful strength and carried through the principles of Songun to bolster up the war deterrent for self-defence, the reporter said, stressing: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Korean people will keep a close watchful eyes on the moves of the U.S. and Japan and their satellites to stifle the DPRK, do their utmost to bolster up the war deterrent for self-defence under the revolutionary banner of Songun, unhindered by anything, so as to glorify the ever-victorious history of the Korean revolution that has been carried forward century after century.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And the south Korean authorities should discontinue the criminal act of joining the U.S. in its war moves to impose nuclear disaster upon the peninsula and exterminate the Korean nation, going against the June 15 era of independence and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement ardently called upon all the organizations and public figures of the world aspiring after peace to demand the U.S. immediately halt the war exercises and drop its hostile policy towards Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is nothing but an exercise of power to deprive the people of other countries of their rights to choice of ideology and suppress freedom and an act of denying democracy itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its moves to \"spread freedom and democracy\" are an extension of its \"war on terrorism\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. exported \"democracy\" to spark such color revolutions as \"orange revolution\" and \"rose revolution\" which culminated in the regime changes in some countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Much pleased with this development, the U.S. adopted the theory of \"spreading freedom and democracy\" as a lever for realizing its ambition for world domination with ease without shedding any blood and is now keen to put it into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. annually spends a billion dollars for its operations to bring down governments in other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also escalating its economic pressure and blockade against other countries under the pretext of \"spreading freedom and democracy\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its much vaunted \"spread of freedom and democracy\" is a link in the chains of its moves for \"globalization.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is deeply interfering in the internal affairs of other countries in a bid to model all fabrics of social life in those countries such as politics, economy and culture on the American pattern. In a word, the reactionary nature of the U.S. moves to \"spread freedom and democracy\" lies in that it is aimed at Americanizing the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Different regions and countries of the world including Mideast, Central Asia and Africa are made targets of the U.S. moves to \"spread freedom and democracy\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is vital for defending the sovereignty of countries and the dignity of nations and ensuring true democracy to heighten vigilance against the U.S. assertion for \"the spread of freedom and democracy\" and frustrate it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is impossible to defend the destiny of a nation when it is taken in by the U.S. crafty preaching of \"democracy\", the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The aphorism expounds the profound idea that the ideological consciousness of people has a great influence upon the destiny of a nation.\r\n The motive force in shaping the destiny of a nation is the nation itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aphorism gives a serious lesson that when all the members of a nation are armed with the steadfast consciousness of independence and vigorously turn out in the struggle for sovereignty, they can achieve an independent development of their country, and when they are absorbed in flunkeyism and dependence on foreign forces, their country is bound to ruin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The worship of big powers and dependence on outside forces have a gravely detrimental influence on the existence and development of a nation. The Korean people experienced such heart-rending trouble already in the beginning of the last century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aphorism serves as a motto of struggle that the Korean people should keep in the minds under the present grave situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In recent years, the United States' moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK have been further intensified than ever before. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-reunification forces in south Korea imbued with the idea of worshiping of and submitting to the U.S. are hell bent on \"cooperation\" with outside forces in pursuance of the latter's policy of aggression against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The grave situation prevailing on the Korean Peninsula has been created by the hostile policy of the U.S. toward the DPRK and the acts of the south Korean anti-reunification forces worshiping of and submitting to the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aphorism, as a guideline in raising the independent consciousness of the Korean people, is inspiring the whole nation to the cause of independent reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
