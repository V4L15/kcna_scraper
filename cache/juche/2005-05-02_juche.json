They should get fully ready to form workers' divisions or regiments and rise up in a sacred fight for defending the country just as they did in the l950s' if hard times come again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All workers should fully display patriotic zeal in the on-going worthwhile general march for Songun revolution in the same spirit as was done in the period of postwar reconstruction and in the same spirit as was displayed during the \"Arduous March\" to overcome stern trials and thus brilliantly decorate the 60th anniversaries of the Workers' Party of Korea and the liberation of the country as the great festivals of victors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter declared that the workers and other people of Korea will unite with the world people in the idea of independence, peace and friendship to vigorously struggle to protect national sovereignty and world peace from the arbitrary and high-handed practices of the U.S. imperialists and fulfill their noble international duty for the human cause of independence and socialist cause.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's Invariable Ambition for Reinvasion under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 30 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Saturday in a signed commentary brands the Japanese reactionaries' distortion of Japan's history as moves for ideological and moral agitation aimed at militarizing and fascistizing the Japanese society and a revelation of their ambition for reinvasion.\r\n Denouncing Abe, acting secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, for taking the lead in the persistent moves of the Japanese right-wing conservatives to tamper with its history and grab Tok Islet, the commentary notes: As if it were not enough with having let loose a spate of reckless remarks beautifying and praising the crimes of the Japanese imperialists, Abe groundlessly charged that Asians' daily-mounting protest and denunciation of Japan over the issue of the history textbooks is an \"interference in its internal affairs.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries have stubbornly negated, distorted and praised the crimes committed by Japan against Korea and other Asian countries in the past as they are nostalgic for the bygone days of militarism and seized by the ambition to reinvade Asia.\r\n Through the above-said agitation the Japanese right-wing conservatives seek to arm the rising generation of Japan with the aggressive idea and drive them to militarism, fascistization and reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is written in the new history textbooks that Tok Islet belongs to the \"Japanese territory.\" This is a shameless distortion of history and little short of grabbing it. The Japanese reactionaries are now claiming that they have \"no idea of making any more concession\" as regards the issue of the islet but should \"defend it to the end.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through their moves to seize the islet the Japanese right-wing conservatives seek to spark a territorial dispute and complicate the regional situation in a bid to invent a pretext for reinvasion. \r\n In the past the Japanese imperialists ran amuck for war of aggression only to suffer a defeat. If the Japanese reactionaries opt for repeating the crime-woven past, instead of drawing a lesson from its past defeat, they will certainly go to ruin again.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA on U.S. Dangerous Military Moves \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 30 (KCNA) -- The U.S. has gone into extremes in its wild ambition to establish its political and military domination over the Asia-Pacific region.\r\n The U.S. is contemplating replacing the present system whereby the U.S. troops are stationed in limited regions and countries on a permanent basis by a new system whereby they are reorganized into \"task forces\" having fast maneuverability and armed with high-tech hardware to be deployed in different parts of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is stepping up in real earnest the work to redeploy the U.S. forces favorable for carrying out wars of aggression under the pretext of \"redeployment of U.S. troops worldwide\" to suit \"a new security environment\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is clearly evidenced by the fact that the U.S. is working hard to turn the U.S. troops present in south Korea into a \"vast regional force\" and, at the same time, keep huge armed forces capable of playing the function of a joint command of the three services in Japan through the transfer of the 1st corps of the U.S. Army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through the large-scale war drills staged across south Korea in March, the U.S. examined the capability of the U.S. troops present in south Korea to extend the sphere of their operation to the vicinity of the Korean Peninsula any moment after making them play the role of a \"vast regional force.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this course the U.S. intends to achieve the purpose of enabling its forces in south Korea to have the capacity to mount a more prompt and effective preemptive attack upon the DPRK and, at the same time, turn the Korean Peninsula into an advance base for its war of aggression against the Northeast Asian countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. planned establishment of a maritime anti-missile system in the East Sea of Korea is part of its moves to round off its preparations for mounting a preemptive attack upon the DPRK and laying a military siege to China and Russia in a bid to realize its hegemonic ambition to dominate the Asia-Pacific region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Asia-Pacific region still remains the focus of the U.S. world strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The main thrust of the U.S. Asia strategy is to deter by force other big powers from expanding the sphere of their influence in this region and thus establish the American-style order of domination there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As generally known, the U.S. Northeast Asian security strategy is aimed at maintaining the Cold War structure for containing the DPRK, China and other countries on the basis of its security alliance with Japan and south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan proper and Okinawa are used by the U.S. as advance attack bases of its forces in Northeast Asia as they are near from the Korean Peninsula and hosts many U.S. military bases. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Precisely for this reason one may say there exist in Japan \"U.S. conning towers\" for commanding the three services of its forces present in different parts of the Asia-Pacific region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seeks to use Japan as the most important stronghold from which to carry out its Asian strategy, the strategy of containing the DPRK and big powers in a bid to establish domination over the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is by no means fortuitous that experts observed the U.S. is keen to use Japan as a key position of brains and information in the Asia-Pacific region through the realignment and reorganization of the U.S. troops\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such U.S. military moves are fraught with potential danger. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. troops in south Korea and Japan have been reorganized in such a way as to carry out the strategy of long-range operation. This made it impossible for south Korea and Japan to escape regional disputes and international armed clashes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reorganization of the U.S. forces present in the Asia-Pacific region is nothing but, from every point of view, a redeployment aimed at a new war of aggression, a prelude to the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is chiefly to blame for escalating tensions in the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia.    \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Attempt to Revive \"UN Forces\" Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 30 (KCNA) -- The United States seeks to drive the six-party talks into a rupture while bringing up the nuclear issue at the United Nations in a bid to induce sanctions against the DPRK without difficulty. And it is going to let the multi-national forces under the helmet of the \"UN Forces\" intervene in the issue automatically and start a total war against the DPRK. This is the real intention of the U.S. to revive the \"UN Forces,\" says Rodong Sinmun Saturday in a signed article.\r\n The article further says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some time ago, Laporte, commander of the U.S. forces in south Korea, told at a U.S. congressional hearing that the role of the nations which participated in the Korean War should be increased to form a multinational staff camp capable of uniting the strength of the allies of the \"UN Forces Command.\" In support of his statement, other high-ranking officers concerned of the U.S. forces present in south Korea said that the increase of the role of the \"UN Forces Command\" would provide groundwork able to let the international community join in the issue of the Korean Peninsula more naturally through the \"Command\" in case of emergency. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This betrays the criminal design of the Bush warlike forces to repeat the method of aggression in the 1950s when the U.S. unleashed the Korean War and introduced multi-national forces into it by abusing the name of the UN. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"UN Forces Command\" in south Korea is nothing but an illegal body of aggression forcibly set up by the U.S. to realize its ambition for invasion of the DPRK during the last Korean War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The monstrous crimes committed by the U.S. in violation of the international law and under the name of the UN during the war cannot be justified with anything. For them, the U.S. was bitterly cursed and rejected by the world peace-loving people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thirty years have passed since the dissolution of the \"UN Forces Command\" was declared at the 30th UN General Assembly. However, the U.S. has kept its aggression forces in south Korea while maintaining the nominal \"UN Forces Command\" so far in a purpose to realize its ambition for invasion of Korea at any cost. That is to say, the U.S. has intended to revive the \"UN Forces\" when the time comes and mobilize multi-national forces to attain its aims at invading the DPRK it failed to do last century. This intention is now being carried into practice. The U.S. attempt to militarily stifle the DPRK and realize its domination over the whole of Korea has reached a very serious\r\nand dangerous stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is by no means accidental that the U.S. has replenished and perfected the war scenario against the DPRK while unprecedentedly stepping up the reinforcement for the U.S. forces in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality shows that it is the most urgent and vital task to completely dismantle the \"UN Forces Command\" in south Korea and get the U.S. imperialist aggression forces withdrawn from there.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

National independence is a lifeline and a shortcut to national reunification and it is an internal affair of the nation to be solved by the nation itself, they pointed out, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The peasants in the north and the south should turn out in the nationwide patriotic struggle to remove the source of war from this land this year under the banner of peace against war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north and south Korean peasants' organizations should consolidate the successes achieved in the past reunification movement and make efforts to realize solidarity and unity at a higher level so as to glorify this significant year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the achievements jointly made by peasants in the north and the south in the reunification movement in the past five years, they called for making this year the year of independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They called upon the peasants in the north and the south to fulfill their responsibility and role in opposing war and defending peace for the independence and peace of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then representatives of the north and the south made speeches, and a joint resolution was adopted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The resolution clarifies the issues for the peasants in the north and the south to invariably maintain the June 15 joint declaration that indicates a shortcut to national reunification, turn out in the reunification movement for its implementation, solidarize each other to keep national sovereignty and the food sovereign right of the south side and make joint efforts for a unified development of agriculture.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
