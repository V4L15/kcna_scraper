If any nation is to defend the banner of independence against imperialism, it should pursue army-based policy as the DPRK does. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The harmonious whole of the leader and soldiers and the indomitable fighting will of the Korean People's Army which is consistent with absolute trust in the supreme commander and the spirit of devotedly defending him are, indeed, a \"patent weapon\" of the DPRK more powerful than any nuclear weapons and missiles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Supreme Commander Kim Jong Il is firmly defending socialist Korea. The army-people unity is reaching a higher stage in the DPRK thanks to his army-based policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality clearly shows that the army-based policy is a weapon to defend socialism and the most powerful political mode in the present era.    \r\n\r\n"

The rate of root-taking of transplanted plants reaches over 95 percent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The methods can be introduced separately or together according to soil conditions. They have proved successful in any case. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The methods not only considerably raise the rate of root-taking of trees on sandy soil but economize a great deal of labor and irrigation water.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA accuses IAEA of speaking for U.S.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 10 (KCNA) -- The board of governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on Nov. 29 adopted an unreasonable resolution on the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula.\r\n The DPRK can never accept this as it is a unilateral and biased one utterly disregarding the root cause of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the DPRK Foreign Minister clarified in a letter addressed to the general director of the IAEA, the nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula is totally attributable to the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK and the IAEA's biased attitude pursuant to the U.S. policy. This is clearly evidenced by the course in which the DPRK-U.S. dialogue was held and the agreed framework adopted between the two countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula is a product of the U.S. policy to turn South Korea into its nuclear base. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK acceded to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in December 1985 pursuant to its peace-loving policy aimed to turn the Korean Peninsula into a nuclear-free, peace zone. It signed the safeguards accord under the NPT with the IAEA in January 1992 and has since sincerely implemented it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. has posed constant nuclear threat to the DPRK, far from honoring its commitment as a nuclear weapons state to remove the threat of a nuclear war from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. resumed the Team Spirit joint military exercise, a nuclear war drill, with South Korea in 1993. Timed to coincide with this, some elements of the secretariat and a few member nations of the IAEA subservient to the U.S. adopted at its board of governors on February 25 a resolution on conducting special inspection of military facilities in the DPRK, which have nothing to do with nuclear activity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This compelled the DPRK government to issue a statement on March 12 declaring its withdrawal from the NPT as a measure to protect the supreme interests of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the DPRK's fair and aboveboard and principled stand, the first phase of the DPRK-U.S. talks was held in New York in June 1993 and on June 11 both sides issued a joint statement and the DPRK took an independent measure to declare moratorium on its withdrawal from the NPT.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our resolute and principled stand compelled the U.S. to shift its policy towards the DPRK to a \"carrot policy\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a result, a statement on the DPRK-U.S. Agreement was published at the third-phase negotiations held in Geneva on August 1994 and the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework (AF) was released at the second round of the third-phase negotiations held from September 23 to October 21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The AF published on October 21, 1994, is a landmark for the solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and a document of historical significance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The IAEA adopted \"resolutions\" groundlessly pulling up the DPRK over the issue of nuclear inspection while the third-phase negotiations were under way but its attempts ended in failure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the historical facts go to prove that a serious crisis was bred because the IAEA unfairly handled the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, applying double standards under the U.S. manipulation and, in consequence, its dignity and honour as an international organization were damaged and it was excluded from the efforts to solve the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the IAEA board of governors adopted a resolution representing the will of the u.s. once again only to betray that it is no longer an international organization true to the principle of impartiality. This is little short of forgetting its past historical lesson and repeating its disgraceful past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. dubbed the DPRK part of an \"axis of evil\" and a target of the preemptive nuclear attack, creating a serious crisis. But the IAEA is not calling this into question. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This proves once again that the organization is representing the political intention of the U.S., unilaterally siding with the U.S. which is chiefly to blame for the nuclear threat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Neutrality and impartiality are the principle the organization should observe in its activities, the main mission of which is nuclear non-proliferation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The IAEA is seriously mistaken if it intends to interfere in the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula as a tool of U.S. pressure and its mouthpiece away from this principle.    \r\n"

The dishonest elements in Japan are seriously mistaken if they calculate they can evade the settlement of the past by dragging on it by the method of forcing Pyongyang to shoulder upon itself the \"obligation to compensate\" those Japanese. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK will never allow this to happen but force Japan to pay a high price come what may.    \r\n"
