It has become an incurable disease in capitalist society which is based on extreme individualism and liberalism and where money is almighty. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The demos taking place almost every day in capitalist countries prove absurdity of \"class cooperation\" and \"welfare policy\" much touted by monopolists and ruling quarters. They also show that such malignant evils of capitalist society as concentration of wealth into a handful of the richest persons and emergence of huge army of jobless persons have reached the extremes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The concentration of capital and wealth into a tiny handful of forces in capitalist countries is the main cause of the economic catastrophe. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Governments and capitalists in capitalist countries at present have neither way nor plan to reduce the widening gap between the rich and the poor. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some capitalist countries are reportedly working hard to shore up the economy and tide over the crisis of unemployment, but there can never be a fundamental solution without reform of system. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With any desperate efforts, capitalism can never escape from the present crisis. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The wider the gap between the rich and the poor becomes, the fiercer the struggle of working masses against it will grow.
