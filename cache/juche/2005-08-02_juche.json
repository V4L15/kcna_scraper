            "content": "More Than 160 Cases of U.S. Aerial Espionage Committed against DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 1 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists committed at least 160 cases of aerial espionage against the DPRK in July, according to a military source.\r\n Involved in them were strategic and tactical reconnaissance planes with various missions that took off U.S. air force bases in south Korea and overseas. \r\n U-2s flew in the air above the areas 120 km west of Tokjok Islet and 40 km east of Phochon and Sokcho almost every day to spy on the depth of the DPRK and its strategic targets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On July 3, 6 and 27 RC-135 made shuttle flights in the air above the areas 20 km east of Taebu Islet, Yangphyong and Yangyang to spy on military strongholds of the DPRK. On July 7 an EP-3 flew in the sky above the East and West seas of the north to spy on its coastal areas and seabed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An E-3 commanding plane committed aerial espionage against military targets on the forefront, while commanding and controlling fighters engaged in various war drills including a drill for striking ground targets and a drill for close air support in the air above Kumsan, Koesan, Ansong and Ronsan for several days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, RC-7B, RC-12 and other tactical reconnaissance planes committed aerial espionage against the front and coastal areas of the north day and night. The planes involved numbered 7 on July 6 and 6 on July 12, 19, 22 and 27 each. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This goes to clearly prove that though the U.S. imperialists talk they have no intention to invade the DPRK whenever an opportunity presents itself, they, in actuality, are watching for a chance to mount a military attack on the latter.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Security Council, it should sincerely fulfill its commitments to be trusted by the international community.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday observes this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Drawing attention to the recent reckless remarks made by Japanese heavyweights denying the decision made by an international tribunal against militarist war criminals of imperial Japan, openly supporting and justifying the distortion of history in textbooks and backing the visits to the \"Yasukuni Shrine,\" the article says: All these moves of Japan are a challenge to human conscience and an act of swimming against the trend of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These rash actions would not help Japan get international confidence and hold a responsible post at the U.N. If Japan is to take a new road of development, it should not repeat the wrong acts perpetrated as regards the relations with other countries in the past but reflect on them and opt for developing the true ties of friendship with them. \r\n The Japanese imperialists committed too hideous crimes against the world and humankind as a most barbaric aggressor, plunderer and murderer in the first half of the 20th century. Had Japan felt even an iota of guilty conscience and responsibility for the crimes committed in the past, it would not have tampered with history and sought militarization so undisguisedly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world regards Japan as one of the most dangerous forces of aggression in the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The danger of the Japanese reactionaries' moves for militarization finds a more vivid manifestation in its establishment of war-time system, arms build-up and escalated military presence overseas. In case Japan rushing headlong into militarization is allowed to sit on the U.N. Security Council, it will perpetrate aggression and war in different parts of the world without hesitation by abusing the power of the U.N. and bring horrible misfortune and disasters to humankind, while behaving as a political and military power. How can the world trust such country as Japan and permit it to hold a responsible post at the U.N which handles important international issues. The more desperate efforts of the Japanese militarist forces to grab other countries' territories, justify visits to the \"Yasukuni Shrine\", distort history and revive militarism would only render Japan further isolated in the international community. \r\n Japan would be well advised to behave itself to be trusted by the world community, well aware of how the world views and approaches it. What is essential for Japan is to redress its past crimes. This is top priority for Tokyo.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is the true way for them to eternally glorify his immortal exploits performed for national liberation and the nation-building and do their bit as his soldiers and students.
