The committee strongly denounces the south side authorities for torpedoing under the pretext of unreasonable \"May 24 step\" the joint academic seminar which the north, the south and overseas sides agreed to hold in Kaesong in order to resolutely hold in check Japan's moves to grab Tok Islets, which touched off bitter resentment among all Koreans at home and abroad, and force Japan to settle its past crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3.

This made it possible to foil the Japanese imperialists' scheme for invasion of the Soviet Union without giving any pretext for them. Thus, it helped the Soviet Union accelerate the victory in the Patriotic War by moving a large number of its elite divisions in the east into the western front.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Later Kim Il Sung issued an order for the final attack to the whole units of the KPRA in August 1945 to liberate Korea after penetrating deep into the rapidly changing situation with the Soviet Union's declaration of war against Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The soldiers of the Soviet Red Army took part in the sacred war for Korea's liberation, performing brilliant merits. The Korean people always remember this and the Liberation Tower, erected at the foot of picturesque Moran Hill, serves as a symbol of the DPRK-Russia friendship still now.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Il Sung visited the Soviet Union nine times and strengthened the ties of the DPRK-Russia friendship through meetings and talks with its party and state leaders. He also saw to it that cooperation and exchange had been boosted in political, economic, cultural, military and other fields between the two countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Leader Kim Jong Il has worked heart and soul to develop the DPRK-Russia friendship in keeping with the requirement of the new century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The historic meeting and talks between Kim Jong Il and the then Russian President Putin and the adoption of the DPRK-Russia Moscow Declaration in August 2001 can be said to have been a great event in view of the history of the bilateral friendly relations or the  progressive development of mankind in the new century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Earlier on July 19, 2000, such documents were adopted between the two countries as a joint declaration and the bilateral treaty of friendship, good neighborliness and cooperation signed by their leaders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During Kim Jong Il's visit to Moscow, the leaders of the two countries reconfirmed the historic significance of these documents and, on this basis, reached an agreement on the specific orientation and measures to further develop the bilateral cooperation in political, economic, military, scientific and technological, cultural and other fields as well as in the issues of ensuring peace and stability in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world and establishing a righteous and new world structure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In August 2002 Kim Jong Il visited the Far East Region of Russia, which became one of major events drawing the world attention.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Russia's Far East Region shares the River Tuman with the DPRK, and the two countries have common interests in the region in economic and military aspects.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this region the state leaders of the two countries met with each other this time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their historic meeting and talks are further hardening the historic roots of the DPRK-Russia friendship and deepening this friendship.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The excellent friendly relations of the two countries with deep roots will remain unchanged in the future, too."

While cruising the lake, Kim Jong Il recollected in profound reverence the brilliant life and exploits of the President who devoted his all to the friendship among countries and the human cause of independence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said the lake, a scenic spot of picturesque Siberia, is a pride of the Russian people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Situated between the Buryatiya Republic and Irkutsk Region like new moon, Baikal which means \"a deep and rich lake\" is a natural lake. It is known as the deepest one in the world. It covers over 31, 700 square kilometers and its perimeter is 2,100 kilometers, it lies 455 meters above sea level and its center is 1,643 meters deep.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The lake is believed to have been formed as a result of various phase precipitation for tens of millions of years. It was known by Russians and Buryats who explored Siberia in the latter half of the 17th century. It is famous for its water remaining transparent as deep as more than 40 meters, spectacular natural scenery, inhabitation of different living things including Baikal seal, Baikal white salmon, sturgeon and legends about it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From olden times inhabitants around the lake used to call it a sea. Its 610 km-long length is equivalent to that of the distance between Moscow and Sankt-Peterburg.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There are many legends about the lake which has 336 rivers flowing into it and the River Angara, the only river that flows out of it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t One of them says:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An old man named Baikal had 300 daughters. He loved daughter named Angara more than any others for her beautiful looks though she was not as obedient to him as others. One day he detained her inside a high tower to protect her from any misfortune.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even its wall was of no help. She eventually ran towards her lover Yenisei in quest of freedom. But they failed to meet each other because her angry father threw rocks in her way. Inhabitants around the lake created this legend hundreds of years ago to answer the question as to why the River Angara does not flow into the lake but goes out of it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There are about 1,200 species of animals and plants on the lake. Majority of them are hardly found in any other places except the lake. Among them are shellfishes and fishes of dozens of species and even about 100,000 seals.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Baikal is a large natural laboratory in the true sense of the word.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Baikal Museum is one of the three lake museums in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  It is the view of scholars in the world that even centuries' study of the Lake Baikal is not enough to clarify all the secrets of the lake."

El CCN decidio celebrar el 29 de agosto que viene, 101o aniversario del \"Tratado de Anexion de Corea a Japon\", en Pyongyang y en Seul el Seminario Academico Conjunto Norte-Sur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Su nombre oficial sera \"Seminario academico conjunto para frenar la nueva agresion de Japon al islote Tok y urgirle la liquidacion del pasado\" y su tema, \"La liquidacion del pasado de Japon y el problema del islote Tok\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　2. El CCN denuncia fuertemente a las autoridades surcoreanas, que pretextando injustas \"medidas del 24 de mayo\", impidieron el seminario conjunto planeado por el Norte, el Sur y ultramar en Kaesong con el fin de frustrar tajantemente las maniobras de Japon para usurpar el islote Tok, que provocan gran indignacion de toda la nacion en el interior y exterior del pais, y liquidar sin falta los crimenes del pasado cometidos por ese pais isleno. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　3. El CCN desplegara en alianza con los partidos politicos, entidades y personalidades en el interior y exterior del pais diversas actividades para rechazar las maniobras de Japon para la nueva agresion y ajustar la cuenta de sus crimenes cometidos contra la nacion coreana."
