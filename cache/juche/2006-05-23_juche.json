All the Koreans, it stresses, should significantly celebrate the 6th anniversary of the publication of the north-south joint declaration as an event common to the nation by putting together their patriotic intention and will for reunification, irrespective of differences in ideology, idea and system and thus stir up the reunification movement.\r\n Calling for bringing into high tide the atmosphere of reconciliation and unity within the nation, bolstering the reunification movement and holding the common reunification event of the nation on a grand scale on the occasion of the \"Day of By Our Nation Itself,\" the article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A grand festival of national reunification is expected in the area of the south side on the occasion this year. The festival will serve as another milestone in demonstrating the nation's will for reconciliation, unity and independent reunification and spurring on the national reunification movement. All the Koreans from different strata in the north and the south and abroad should hold the event in a grand style with remarkable patriotic zeal. The authorities of the north and the south in particular should take an active part in the festival as already agreed upon so as to make it a nationwide one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is important in grandly celebrating \"Day of By Our Nation Itself\" as one common to the nation is for all the Koreans at home and abroad to conduct a dynamic three-point patriotic movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Everyone should positively support the three-point patriotic movement and devote themselves, body and soul, to this movement, if this anniversary is to be greeted magnificently. All the Koreans should turn out vigorously in the movement for national reunification with firm resolution to mark the anniversary with proud successes in the patriotic movement.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
