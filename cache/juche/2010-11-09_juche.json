Learning about the manure they had applied to fields insufficiently, he asked the reason.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With nobody finding proper words to reply, he said manure should be produced sufficiently to raise per-hectare yield as the country had limited cropland.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also said all of the houses should breed domestic animals such as pig, chicken and cattle to produce large quantities of quality manure for increased grain output.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After his visit, the peasants organized a stockbreeding team under the cooperative and raised many domestic animals and mowed the grass extensively to apply enough manure to fields.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since then, the village has witnessed increased grain production and improvement of the peasants' living."
