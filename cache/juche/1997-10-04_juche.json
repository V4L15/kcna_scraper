The looks of the province have changed with the construction of the Wonsan-Mt. Kumgang Railway Line and the Wonsan-Losong Highway and other projects.\r\n   He also visited Ryanggang Province on more than 30 occasions after he led the first expedition team to the Mt. Paektu revolutionary battle field in June Juche 45 (1956). \r\nHe gave the province important instructions on more than a hundred occasions. The province now has turned into a grand open-air revolutionary museum.\r\n   The world-famous west sea barrage, Kangson, home of Chollima, Taean and Chongsan field, home of the great Chongsanri spirit and method, in Nampho municipality are also associated with his leadership.\r\n   He has long since paid deep attention to the development of Kaesong municipality, saying that the living conditions of the people in the area adjacent to the Military Demarcation Line should be improved so much as to turn the gap between the north and the south into that between heaven and earth. The municipality has become a city of history and culture with modern light industry and developed agriculture. \r\n   The delegates expressed their firm determination to vigorously fight on in the spirit of \"Arduous March\" and the revolutionary spirit of soldiers with intense loyalty to Secretary Kim Jong Il, who represents their destiny and future. \r\n   The conferences will be recorded as occasions for great change in the historic advance for the Juche revolution and as special events in the development of the Party and revolution of Korea. \r\n\r\n"
