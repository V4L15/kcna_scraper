It can never be a stage for justifying interference in the internal affairs of other countries and the racket for putting pressure on them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the U.S. is using the UN Human Rights Council entrusted with the mission and duty to contribute to guaranteeing human rights in the world as a means for interference in the internal affairs of those countries incurring its displeasure and subversion of their social systems.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Question is why the U.S. is getting keen on kicking up the groundless \"human rights\" racket.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By nature, the U.S. has left no means untried to stifle the DPRK out of its inveterate bitter repugnancy against the latter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its practice never works on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK has faced the fate of bankruptcy. Just as a drowning man catching at a straw, the U.S. is resorting to the false \"human rights\" racket against the DPRK in the face of successive bitter defeats. Its aim is to internationalize \"human rights\" issue in the DPRK and kick off a worldwide campaign for putting the \"maximum pressure\" on the DPRK. In the end, it seeks to bring down the social system in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation makes one bear in mind the immutable truth that human rights precisely mean the state right and the sovereignty of the country and the nation, and that the military capabilities for self-defence have to be strengthened to defend them."
