This is the unshakable stand of the WPK advancing under the uplifted banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has successfully achieved the unity of servicepersons and people in thinking and fighting spirit on the basis of the revolutionary soldier spirit of the Korean People's Army under the Songun leadership of the WPK, thus remarkably bolstering the driving forces for the Korean revolution and demonstrating its dignity as an invincible political and ideological power which has attained the great unity between the army and people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present emotion-charged reality in which all the servicepersons and people are bringing about a signal leap forward in building a great prosperous powerful socialist nation, single-mindedly united around the headquarters of revolution, is a striking demonstration of the tremendous vitality of the WPK's Songun politics which meets the requirements of the Juche idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean revolution which advances under the uplifted banner of Juche has not yet been completed but has a long and thorny path to cover.

Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, April 18 (KCNA) -- Members of civic and social organizations and personages of cultural and art, religious and other circles in south Korea called a press conference in Seoul on April 14 to denounce traitor Lee Myung Bak for his planned U.S. visit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Speakers at the conference noted that during his U.S. visit such matters would be discussed as the military expansion and arms buildup, the establishment of MD which will cause military tension in the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia, and south Korea's involvement in the \"PSI.\" This will be a process of the efforts to wholly put into practice the U.S.-led unilateral policy for domination, they charged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that the U.S.-south Korea high-level negotiations were held on import of beef from the U.S. that day, they described this as a \"present\" Lee should bring to the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lee's call for the \"restoration of relationship\" with the U.S. is an act of reversing the last one decade-long history which has witnessed evermore strengthened anti-U.S. struggle, they noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Lee makes any agreement violating peace and people's vital rights during the visit, he will be bitterly denounced by the people, they warned.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
