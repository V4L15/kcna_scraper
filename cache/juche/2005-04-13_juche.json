This is evidenced by the fact that Chief Cabinet Secretary of Japan Hosoda asserted at the joint meeting of officials of the Liberal Democratic Party concerned with the Cabinet held on March 24 that the issue of Tok Islet should be brought to the International Court of Justice. This comes under fire by a signed commentary of Minju Joson Tuesday. It says:\r\n  The Korean people will never allow the Japanese reactionaries to infringe upon the sovereignty and interests of the Korean nation and bring again war disasters to Asia.\r\n Tok Islet, though small, is a symbol of the sovereignty of the Korean nation and its precious treasure which can not be bartered for anything. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean ancestors discovered the islet earlier than the Japanese and listed it as a treasure of the country. It has long been used by Koreans to make a living. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's claim to the islet betrays the true colors of the robbers who are keen to loot others' things. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The modern history of Japan is recorded with its invasion and plunder of other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present political situation in Japan reminds one of the idea and fervor for overseas invasion veiled with what it called \"nationalism\" and \"patriotism\" which had prevailed there before its launch of continental aggression in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Frustrating Japan's moves to grab the islet is an issue of protecting the dignity and sovereignty of the Korean nation and, at the same time, a just struggle for checking the Japanese militarists' ambition for overseas expansion and preserving peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Worse still, it forced at least 200,000 Korean women into sexual slavery for the imperial Japanese army. However, there is no reference to these crimes in those new history textbooks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the contrary, their publishers wrote that Japan�fs colonization of Korea &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nhelped it in its modernization and described Tok Islet, part of the inviolable territory of Korea, as part of the Japanese territory, openly revealing its 100 year-old ambition to grab the islet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan falsified truth by describing such wars of aggression as War for Greater East Asia and Pacific War that brought unspeakable misfortune and pain to the Asian people as a war for self-defence\" and \"a liberation war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan distorted its history in textbooks despite the torrents of protest  and denunciation of the Korean people and other Asians. This is an intolerable insult to the Korean nation demanding Japan liquidate its past and an open challenge to international justice and conscience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's recent move to tamper with its history textbooks has reached an extremely grave phase as it undisguisedly laid bare its militarist ambition for reinvasion of Korea and other Asian countries, to say nothing of its design to cover up its past crimes and evade the redemption of its past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind such move is the persistent and sinister intention of the Japanese reactionaries to arm their descendants with the reactionary idea of aggression through the education in the distorted history and woo them to follow in the footsteps of their ancestors and go out for reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThrough this Japan seeks to realize the old dream of Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere at any cost and emerge the leader of Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is 100 years since Japan�fs illegal occupation of Korea and 60 years after its defeat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries, however, have totally denied and grossly distorted Japan's blood-stained history of aggression even this time which reminds people of the crimes committed by it in the past. The reality once again clearly indicates that they are fanatic militarists whose physiology is aggression and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n History can never be changed by any distortion nor be erased by any attempt to cover it up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With no desperate effort can the Japanese reactionaries ever erase Japan's blood-stained history of crimes committed against the Korean and other Asian peoples or shirk the responsibility for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Should Japan embark upon road of militarist reinvasion instead of drawing a lesson from the defeat and disgrace it suffered 60 years back due to its aggression and plunder, it will meet stronger protest and condemnation from the Asian countries and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will never tolerate the Japanese reactionaries�f distortion of history but certainly force them to pay for all its past crimes.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The reporter went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Reflected in the flower are the sincere feelings of the Indonesian people including Soekarno, the first president of Indonesia, and progressive people of the world who revered and praised Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n President Soekarno invited Kim Il Sung to visit his country when the commemorations of the tenth anniversary of the first meeting of Asian and African countries were scheduled to be held in Bandung of Indonesia in April Juche 54 (1965). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When Kim Il Sung visited the world-famous Bogor Botanical Garden, the reverence of the Indonesian people for him was expressed to the full. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Soekarno guided Kim Il Sung to a potted flower, beautiful and rare, and explained the reason why an Indonesian famous botanist had bred and cultivated the new flower heart and soul and expressed his wish to name it after the President of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Il Sung, very humble as he was, declined this offer, saying there was no need to give his name even to the flower as he had achieved nothing particular. Hearing this, Soekarno repeatedly asked Kim Il Sung to accept this offer, noting he deserved such high honor as he had done a lot for the good of humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis happened on April 13, Juche 54 (1965), a significant event recorded in history. It was thanks to Soekarno's son who remained true to his father's lifetime intention that the botanical name of Kimilsungia was formally registered at the International Orchis Family Society to be known as a world famous flower. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is ascribable to the benevolent leadership of Kim Jong Il that Kimilsungia has been in full bloom all over the world generation after generation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Two potted Kimilsungias that struck their roots in the land of Korea have been massively propagated in a brief span of time under the care of Kim Jong Il. This flower has been widely distributed in different countries of the world thanks to the sincere efforts of many foreign friends. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il saw to it that the First Kimilsungia Festival was held in April Juche 88 (1999) and the Kimilsungia Festival was made an annual event. He specified the form and methods of organizing the festival. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter said that the Korean people would keep Kimilsungia and Kimjongilia in fuller bloom with all wisdom and intense loyalty and beautifully decorate the immortal flower festivals in order to powerfully demonstrate the strong spirit and might of Juche Korea advancing full of confidence of sure victory and optimism.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
