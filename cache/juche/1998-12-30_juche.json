The state machinery of the DPRK has grown  stronger and developed into a powerful political instrument for carrying into practice his ideas and politics. That was an important political event that marked a turning-point in consolidating the politico-ideological strength of the DPRK, the might of monolithic unity around Supreme Commander Kim Jong Il and in comprehensively realizing his plan for building a powerful country. The DPRK launched an artificial satellite \"Kwangmyongsong 1,\"  the first of its kind in history of Korea, into orbit with its wisdom and technology. \r\n   That  is a success worthy of special mention, a solemn gunreport of the building of a powerful country of Juche.\r\n   All the people have displayed the Kanggye spirit, the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, this year.\r\n   As a result,  more than 5,000 minor power stations were built and solid foundations  were laid for putting production on a steady footing in metal and machine-building industries and many other sectors and units.\r\n   A prospect has been opened for attaining self-sufficiency in food through a great upswing in potato farming. The April 25 Hotel, September 9 Street and many other monumental edifices were built and signal achievements made in land management and socialist cultural construction including science, education, culture and art, public health and sports under difficult conditions.\r\n   With great efforts directed to the implementation of the policy of the Workers' Party of Korea on turning all the army into a cadre army, modernizing the army, arming all the people and turning the whole country into a fortress, the people's army has developed into an invincible army and all-people,  nationwide defence system has been consolidated considerably.\r\n   The Korean people have been able to lay solid foundations for the building of a powerful country this year thanks to the wise guidance of Marshal Kim Jong Il.     \r\n \r\n  \r\n"

            "content": "On Kumgang Mountain tour\r\n   Pyongyang, December 30 (KCNA) -- The Kumgang Mountain tour, a non-governmental undertaking which began under an agreement between the Korean Asia-Pacific Peace Committee and the Hyundai Business Group of South Korea, is now facing a grave obstacle with the New Year at hand as a result of the obstructions of some forces at home and abroad.\r\n   On December 28 the Japanese Yomiuri Shimbun reported that while visiting South Korea early in December, the U.S. coordinator of North Korean policy, Perry, said as regards the Kumgang Mountain tour that a huge amount of money remitted to the north may be exclusively used as military spending and so the South Korean authorities are keeping the Hyundai Business Group from making a remittance.\r\n   Earlier, a South Korean radio said the South Korean authorities accepted an application file from the Hyundai Business Group on the payment for the Kumgang mountain tour on December 23, but they said it is difficult for them to permit it within this year because it they say will take a month to go through formalities and the file is insufficient.\r\n   What matters as regards the tour is to define the period of the right to use the sightseeing facilities as three decades. When the problem was raised by the Hyundai Business Group, we made clear the position that the definition is a serious political issue related to the prospects for the reunification of the country, that if the period is defined as three decades, it may disappoint the Korean people who are longing for the reunification of the country and that for this reason we cannot approve it at all. We have since maintained the position.\r\n   The Korean Asia-Pacific Peace Committee and the Hyundai Business Group had understanding of this matter and other issues and reached a satisfactory consensus. The historic Kumgang Mountain tour, a non-governmental cooperation work, began on November 18 amidst the expectation and interest of the whole nation. It has proceeded well up to this date.\r\n   With a view to achieving the great national unity, helping even a bit realise the reunification of the country, the supreme task of the Korean people, and realising the desire of the South Koreans for sightseeing the famous Kumgang Mountain of the nation, we agreed to a document on the Kumgang Mountain tour for  realising the non-governmental tour program with the Hyundai Business Group and gave the Hyundai Business Group a document of the  DPRK government guaranteeing the undertaking and made every possible effort for the successful program.\r\n   Mt. Kumgang is adjacent to the military demarcation line. \r\n   The DPRK is in acute military confrontation with the U.S. and South Korea with the MDL in between. Despite the situation we approved the Kumgang Mountain tour program and took other compatriotic steps. We have given full play to great magnanimity and patience for  the successful promotion of the program in the face of the escalating tensions triggered by the never-ceasing provocation manoeuvrings of the U.S. and the South Korean authorities.\r\n   The U.S. and the South Korean authorities, however, described the program as a \"success\" of their North Korea policy. While using the program for their sinister political purpose, they left no stone unturned to block the successful promotion of the program.\r\n   The U.S. President, Clinton, visited South Korea in late November, a few days after the beginning of the tour. He made provocative remarks against the north at U.S. military bases, rendering the situation strained on purpose.\r\n   The South Korean authorities, dancing to the tune of the their U.S. master, brought the situation to the extreme pitch of strain through the medium of large-scale military manoeuvres.\r\n   As foreign newspapers reported and recongnised, the U.S. and the South Korean authorities are putting the brake on the program, clamouring about the period of the tour when the program, based on the compatriotic stand, is smoothly proceeding. The U.S. and the South Korean authorities went so far as to link the payment for  the program with military spending in a far-fetched manner.\r\n   The U.S. and the South Korean authorities will be held responsible entirely for the ensuing consequences of the possible suspension of the Kumgang Mountain tour and other undertakings for economic cooperation between us and the Hyundai Business Group.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n"
