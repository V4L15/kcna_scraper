Accordingly, the DPRK and the U.S. are committed to implement the communique. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As part of the steps to honor it, the U.S. Secretary of State visited the DPRK recently and handed Kim Jong Il a personal letter carrying the view of President Clinton on issues related to the improvement of the DPRK-U.S. relations and sincerely discussed them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The improved relations between the two countries are in line with the desire and interests of the two peoples. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The improved DPRK-U.S. relations are not only good for both countries but will greatly help preserve peace and security on the Korean peninsula and in the Asia-Pacific region and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will do its best to develop the DPRK-U.S. relations on the principle of mutual respect for sovereignty and non-interference in other's internal affairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should keep its faith and promise and honor its commitments. \r\n\r\n"

The Korean nation is one from a national point of view. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite possible to achieve great national unity irrespective of classes, strata and ideologies if all members of the nation love the nation and set store by its sovereignty, identifying their lot with the destiny of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through the historic Pyongyang meeting and the publication of the June 15 north-south joint declaration the respected leader Kim Jong Il brought about a turning point in the efforts to achieve national unity and paved an avenue for the whole Korean nation to attain the country's reunification by its own efforts as the master responsible for reunification, the article concludes. \r\n\r\n"

Its rhythms and composition were so easy, clear and natural as to remain widely popular through the ages. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean dance has peculiar features in rhythm and movement tailored to national sentiment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In general, the oriental dance stresses the movements of the upper part of the body relative to the lower, while the western dance is the opposite. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In contrast, Korean dance is anchored on the movements of arms with a proper combination of feet, affording a harmonious movement of both the upper and lower halves of the body to the time of gentle rhythm. The whole body seems to flow naturally in lyrical beats, with a dominant movement of arms. It is characterized by an obvious lack of impulsive or too-flamboyant movements and  a preponderance of delicate and gentle yet vigorous movements. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a reflection of Korean's diligent working life and virtuous customs, the folk dance underwent age-old polishing, its rhythms rich in national spicing. This serves as a priceless asset in furthering national dance in the light of modern needs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The provincial stocks of folk dance are steadily tapped for representation and development on the modern stage. \r\n\r\n"

It will be the starting point of promoting mutual confidence between Japan and the DPRK for Japan to make an apology and compensation for the colonial rule it enforced over the Korean people for over 40 years in the past, he noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He called for undertaking in various forms and ways a vigorous movement for friendship with the Korean people and the establishment of diplomatic relations between Japan and the DPRK in all parts of Japan. \r\n\r\n"

This resulted in completing the digging of waterways and the driving of intake tunnels and wall concrete tamping. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Officials and builders from Pyongyang are now busy with the construction of embankments along channels after completing the digging of hundreds of metres of channels and the building of structures through a meticulous organization and command of bold and ambitious construction operations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Builders from South Hwanghae Province recently succeeded in driving a waterway tunnel through a hill and finished the construction of structures, thus opening a bright prospect of completing the project in a short span of time. A work to widen the tunnel and bring the project to completion is now in full gear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Constructors from Jagang Province, North Hamgyong Province and other provinces are also successfully pushing forward the waterway project despite difficulties. \r\n\r\n"
