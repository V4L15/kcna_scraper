He is, indeed, a great thinker and theoretician, the chairman stressed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A round-table talk was held at a company in Linz, Austria. Speakers there noted that Kim Jong Il has performed great feats in building a great prosperous powerful socialist nation and fulfilling the cause of Korea's reunification and the human cause of independence with his leadership of the Songun revolution. They underscored the need to intensify solidarity activities powerfully supporting the Korean people in their efforts to build a great prosperous powerful nation and achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the country this year which marks the fifth anniversary of the publication of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Japan is one of the worst human rights violators in the world. It is ill-famed for the number of cases of suicide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such being a hard reality, the reactionaries of Japan are joining the U.S. in its smear campaign against the DPRK over its \"human rights issue\" in an effort to overturn its system. This is, however, nothing but a daydream of the wicked and stupid guys. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries had better properly understand who their rival is and give up their futile attempt to bring down the system in the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Nevertheless, the U.S. is keen on keeping its forces in south Korea and this is a link in the whole chain of its hostile policy toward the DPRK, the very source of difficulties in the settlement of the nuclear issue between it and the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should withdraw at once its forces from south Korea, shaking itself free from the theory and mode of thinking of the old era which is run through with distrust and hostile feelings toward others.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This touched off a spate of argument and criticism dominated by the public opinion that the step taken by the ministry was an act of reading the face of Japan.\r\n Commenting on this, a Rodong Sinmun analyst Monday says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a submissive act of being afraid of freely visiting one's own land, standing in awe of Japan, the sworn enemy of the Korean nation, and a despicable pro-Japanese sycophantic humiliating act of impairing the sovereignty and dignity of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities say quite often that Tok Islet belongs to Korea but, in actuality, commit an act contrary to this as in the afore-said case. This disclosed their pro-Japanese toadyism. Their behavior is still graver in view of the fact that the Japanese reactionaries are openly claiming the islet belongs to Japan. Disallowing the visit to the islet on the pretext of \"diplomatic controversy\" and not going there by accepting it are the same pro-Japanese humiliating acts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people should turn out vigorously in the struggle against outside forces to put an end to their domination and interference and win sovereignty at an early date.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

However, the U.S. pressurized the south Korean authorities to relinquish the land, insisting on building its embassy there just as gangsters would do. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is an intolerable disregard and mockery of the south Koreans demanding national dignity and sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. pressurized the south Korean authorities and usurped the land which it had promised to return to south Korea, thus seriously violating once again the dignity and self-esteem of south Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. scheme to build its embassy in Ryongsan can never be allowed as it is an arbitrary practice of occupation force to dominate south Korea, lording it over as a de facto ruler for an indefinite period, while infringing upon the national spirit for independence of the south Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An end must be put to the disgraceful history of the U.S.  occupation of south Korea, a history of domination and submission, in the present era which is orientating toward the country's reunification after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration and the Ryongsan area must be returned to the south Korean people to be used for their livelihood together with the sites of all other U.S. military bases in south Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Of course, it is true that there are \"National Assembly\" and administrative tools in south Korea, but political sovereignty there has been seriously violated by the U.S. which has wire-pulled pro-U.S. forces and interfered in its internal affairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. signed many \"treaties\" and \"agreements\" with south Korea including the \"Mutual Defence Treaty\" in its own interests and has accelerated the enslavement of the south Korean society through them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The political catastrophe and the social chaos that have persisted in south Korea are a token of the political backwardness of south Korea caused by the U.S. military occupation and domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But for the U.S. troops' occupation of south Korea, there would not have been the \"May 16 military coup\", the Kwangju massacre and death of young middle school girls and, moreover, the Korean nation would not have undergone the 60-year-long tragic division. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now is the time for the south Koreans to put an end to the disgraceful U.S. military occupation and restore sovereignty when all the countries and nations are fighting for independence and dignity.

This tragedy is an offspring of the south Korea-U.S. \"Status of Forces Agreement\" which came into force on February 9, 1967.\r\n The agreement consists of \"criminal jurisdiction\", \"usage of land and facilities\" and \"taxation\". It is an out-and-out slavish agreement which provides extraterritorial rights to the U.S. imperialist aggression forces and imposes sufferings upon the south Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the patronage of the \"agreement\", the U.S. troops have committed more than 3,500 offences such as murder, violence, rape and environmental destruction in south Korea on an annual average. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities dealt, at first trials, with only 234 cases out of nearly 40,000 crimes committed by U.S. troops till 1987 since the appearance of the \"agreement\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In recent years U.S. troops drove an armored car over middle school girl students to death, discharged poisonous water into the River Han and perpetrated group violence against south Korean inhabitants. But the criminals have not been punished but protected. As a result, not a day passes without seeing south Koreans shedding blood. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Worse still, the authorities, shackled by the \"agreement\", cannot but close their eyes to the hair-raising atrocities committed by the U.S. forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have not made even a word against the unwarrantable \"judgment\" that they should compensate to the inhabitants in Maehyang-ri for the damage caused by decades of military exercises of the U.S. forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people should turn out in the struggle for realizing the three-point cooperation for national independence, peace against war, and reunification and patriotism to abolish the slavish document, a legacy from the old era, at an early date and to put an end to the U.S. domination and interference.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
