This demand was made in a message of protest sent to the Japanese prime minister on July 28.\r\n  The message charged that the government's refusal to allow the entry of the delegation is a disgraceful act because it meant its abandonment of the principle for settling the issue of remains out of humanitarianism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To invite bereaved families and listen to them is part of the work to be done by Japan to settle the issue of remains and it is an important matter in leading to a positive direction the public of Japan which are neither aware of it nor interested in it very much, the message noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The refusal to permit the entry into Japan of even aged bereaved families is an act of going against humanitarianism the government has advertised and it is unpardonable in view of the sense of obligation, it said, adding: The entry into Japan of bereaved families of Korean victims of forcible drafting should not be subject to any circumstances of the state and it should not be disallowed for the mere reason that the two countries have no diplomatic relations and the government should let the bereaved families see their remains.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean Teachers Union under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, August 4 (KCNA) -- The suppression of the National Teachers Union of south Korea by the neo-conservative forces including the Grand National Party is fascist rowdyism aimed at destroying the pro-reunification patriotic forces, says Rodong Sinmun Friday in a signed commentary.\r\n As for the teaching materials on reunification made by the union, there is nothing problematic as they give a relatively objective description of the truth of history on the principle of historicism and with the north-south reconciliation into due consideration, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP-led conservative forces' suppression of the union on charge of preparing its teaching materials on reunification clearly proves that they are remnants of the old era of confrontation who are still seized by extreme prejudice. This is same anti-reunification fascist hooliganism as crackdown perpetrated by the fascist dictators who antagonized their fellow countrymen and suppressed the people after branding their mere talk about reunification as \"pro-north\" and \"pro-communist\" acts. The reality clearly proves that neither genuine education nor reconciliation, unity and reunification of the nation are thinkable in south Korea with the GNP, the leftover of the old era of confrontation, left intact. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind the GNP group's desperate efforts to negate the truth of history and justice is a sinister aim. This traitorous party has sought its way-out in the north-south stand-off, siding with and serving the U.S. in utter disregard of the reunification of the country, greedy for power and wealth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This party is getting evermore frantic in its moves as the history of its hideous crimes has been brought to daylight and there is no room for it to stay in the June 15 era of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter how desperately the GNP may try it can never stem the trend of the history of the nation towards independent reunification.

And he clarified fundamental principles and detailed tasks and ways for achieving the reunification of the country on the basis of these charters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to the proposal for achieving broad-based unity and the policy for improving the inter-Korean relations he put forward in this work and a nationwide struggle for implementing them there came into being the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and there dawned a new era of independent reunification in which the Koreans work hard to achieve reunification by their concerted efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The years since the publication of the work have been a period in which he has held high the banner of independence in the movement of the Korean nation for reunification as intended by the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il considered it as an important principled matter in the struggle to carry out the President's instructions for national reunification to firmly uphold the banner of national independence and has since worked heart and soul to make the spirit of national independence prevail all over the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is important in the exploits performed by him in wisely steering the Korean nation's movement for reunification as instructed by the President was that he brought a strong tide of great unity of the whole nation to the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He has embraced anyone standing for national reunification with national conscience and helped him take the road of reunification. This noble patriotism and profound care of Kim Jong Il brought about a new phase in the movement for national unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He took signal measures to ensure that compatriots in the north and the south meet with each other and talk to each other open-heartedly and pool their will and efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans in the north and the south and overseas are turning out as one in the movement for national reunification, united close under the banner of the June 15 joint declaration irrespective of ideology, political view and religion. Today compatriots of all strata work together and chant the same slogans for reunification though they differ in ideologies and political views. This is a shining fruition of his policy of great national unity, concludes the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
