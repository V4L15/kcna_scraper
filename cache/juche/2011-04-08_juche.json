He highly appreciated their feats.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is thanks to the devoted struggle of all the people including the workers and intellectuals that the WPK's idea of pushing back the frontiers of latest science and technology is being translated into brilliant reality to consolidate the foundation of the DPRK's self-supporting national economy and put the level of the country's industrialization onto a higher  stage, he said, adding that this tremendous strength is providing a sure guarantee for accomplishing the cause of building a thriving nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He set forth the tasks facing the enterprise and expressed expectation and conviction that its workers would as ever successfully play the role as a vanguard and shock brigade in implementing the Party's economy policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The second leg of his guidance was the Jagang Machine Plant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  He went round a processing shop, assembling shop and other places of the plant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching CNC-based machine tools that stand in rows at every worksite and products, he was greatly satisfied to learn that the workers of the plant are making leaping progress in the machine production by successfully putting the production processes on a modern and scientific basis. He highly estimated their feats. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The most important task facing the plant is to dynamically push forward the work to radically increase the manufacture of new products, he said, underlining the need for the plant to continue dynamically dashing ahead towards a higher goal of science and technology on the basis of the achievements made in placing its production processes on a CNC basis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The plant should set an example not only in modernizing itself but in establishing cultured practices in production and hygiene, he said, expressing expectation and conviction that the officials and other working people of the plant would register greater successes in production and technological updating in the future, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The third leg of his guidance was the February 8 General Machine Plant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching the worksites that look like a palace and new machines that stand in rows, he expressed great satisfaction over the fact that the officials, workers and technicians of the plant successfully carried out the technological updating of all the production processes by pooling efforts with teachers and researchers from Kim Chaek University of Technology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The teachers and students of the university are treasures of the country as they are successfully playing a vanguard role in putting industry on a modern and scientific basis, he said, highly praising them for remaining intensely loyal to the Party and the revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He met with those who greatly contributed to the drive to study and introduce cutting-edge technology and appreciated their patriotic deeds.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Looking at varieties of daily necessities produced by the plant, he said they are useful and good products. It is of weighty significance in improving the standard of people's living for the central industrial enterprises to boost the production of varieties of daily necessities by making an effective use of by-products. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then he made the rounds of supply service facilities including a canteen and took warm care of the living of workers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Seeing buildings kept neat and tidy in a thick forest and the compound of the plant which look like a thick woodland and greenery, he highly praised the workers of the plant for having spruced up their workplace to meet the need of the era of Songun with ardent patriotism and love for it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He advanced the tasks facing the plant and expressed great expectation and conviction that the workers of the plant would bring about uninterrupted innovations and leap forward in the van of the drive for effecting a great revolutionary surge in the building of a thriving nation under the uplifted red flag of the revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Never has the dignity of the nation been exalted so highly and never have the Korean people felt so confident of the future as today when they are reviewing a century-long history of Kim Il Sung's Korea, he said, once again ardently calling on them to realize the desire of President Kim Il Sung to build a thriving nation without fail by giving full rein to the Songun Chollima and putting further spurs to the  general offensive till a final victory is won in the drive for building a thriving nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Kim Jong Un, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission of the WPK, Kim Kyong Hui, member of the Political Bureau and department director of the C.C., the WPK, Jang Song Thaek, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the C.C., the WPK and vice-chairman of the NDC, Pak To Chun and Thae Jong Su, alternate members of the Political Bureau and secretaries of the C.C., the WPK, Ju Kyu Chang, alternate member of the Political Bureau and department director of the C.C., the WPK, and Ju Yong Sik, chief secretary of the Jagang Provincial Committee of the WPK."

            "content": "KAPPC Spokesman on New State Measure for Tour of Mt. Kumgang\r\n Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee (KAPPC) issued a statement on Friday, three years after the unilateral suspension of tour of Mt. Kumgang by the south Korean authorities.\n\t\t\t\t\t It is deplorable that the tour of Mt. Kumgang which had lasted for ten years as a symbol of cooperation between the north and the south and reunification was ruthlessly suspended in less than five months after the present south Korean authorities took office, the statement said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is well known that the south Korean authorities are avoiding the resumption of tour of Mt. Kumgang not because they are concerned about the personal safety of tourists but because they consider it as part of the sanctions against the DPRK to block the tour, regarding it as someone's means for \"earning money.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an unpardonable insult and mockery of the DPRK and all the fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a matter of fact, the DPRK has conducted a deficit operation by giving the south side the greatest special benefit as regards the tour of Mt. Kumgang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has exercised utmost patience for nearly three years. There is no more prospect of resuming the tour of Mt. Kumgang. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This situation compels the DPRK to opt for exercising its right as the party to the agreement according to its law and international law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this regard it informed the Hyundai side of its stand that it may terminate the validity of the provision of the agreement on tour of Mt. Kumgang signed with the Hyundai side which calls for granting it monopoly over the tour, the DPRK may take charge of the tour through the areas of the north side and entrust an overseas businessman with the tour and the Hyundai group may continue conducting the tour through the areas of the south side and formally handed an official document related to it to the side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accordingly, the KAPPC and the General Guidance Bureau for the Development of Scenic Spots of the DPRK proposed a relevant organ of the DPRK to take a legal measure as regards the tour of Mt. Kumgang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A state measure will be taken soon to renew the tour of Mt. Kumgang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Hyundai side's loss of the exclusive right to conduct the tour of Mt. Kumgang is entirely attributable to the south Korean authorities' moves to escalate the confrontation with fellow countrymen and scuttle the tourism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Trust and cooperation between the DPRK and the Hyundai Group will go on in the future, too, and the DPRK remains unchanged in its stand to realize the desire of the south Koreans to tour Mt. Kumgang."

This constitutes a great exploit performed by him as he provided an all-powerful treasured sword for winning a shining victory in the defence of the socialist country and the anti-imperialist, anti-U.S. struggle and strengthening and developing the DPRK and accomplishing the socialist cause. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sacred chronicle of the DPRK adorned with victory and glory goes to clearly prove that the Songun political mode and the state structural system on the principle of putting main emphasis on national defence provide a sure guarantee for protecting the socialist system and the destiny of the people, eternally glorifying the country as the state of Kim Il Sung and completing the Korean revolution with arms to the last. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The whole country is closely united as a community linked with the common destiny of the whole party, army and all people with the spirit of devotedly defending the leader as the core. This single-minded unity serves as the source of inexhaustible strength of Songun Korea demonstrating as an invincible politico-ideological power and a powerful driving force for building a thriving nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reporter called on all the service persons and people to confidently advance along the road of victory indicated by him, bearing deep in mind the honor and happiness of carving out the new chronicle of building a thriving nation and winning the victory of revolutionary cause of Juche under the leadership of Kim Jong Il, the center of unity for the Songun revolution and the center of idea and leadership. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t National defence is the most important affair in building a thriving nation. It is the invariable principled stand of the WPK and the DPRK to give top priority to boosting the defence capability. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Referring to the provocative and aggressive nuclear war exercises being staged by the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppet group against the DPRK, the reporter declared: The army and people of the DPRK will never remain a passive onlooker to them but resolutely frustrate them with the might of Songun which has been built up in every way."

Korea's Crimes Committed for Three Years of Office under Fire\r\n  Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of Korea published an indictment Friday disclosing the crimes the south Korean authorities committed for three years of their office ill-famed for lies and deception and the disastrous consequences entailed by them. \n\t\t\t\t\tAccording to it, the south Korean economy has become more stagnant and the people's living deteriorated to an extreme pitch while irregularities and corruption and social vices have become rampant. Due to the economic bankruptcy the puppet government is saddled with debt amounting to 1,448.6 billion U.S. dollars, that of enterprises is 1,155 billion U.S. dollars and that of the inhabitants households more than 700 billion U.S. dollars.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There are at least 4.6 million unemployed people and more than 8.6 million under-employed people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Various kinds of taxes are on a steady increase. There are three million extremely poor households which eke out their living by a meal offered by charity bodies. The poor who make their living on a daily earning number ten million and the children who go without lunches number more than 1.2 million. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t More than 7 million households or 38 percent of all of them live in rented rooms. There are 680 000 households that live in small rooms like hencoop, shacks, dugouts and cave-like places, left without any proper shelters. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 1.25 million women find no other means but prostitution, unable to endure abject poverty. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 42 persons commit suicides on a daily average due to the unbearable economic difficulties and destitution, topping the world list of suicide rate. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has become clear that the most of 16 major economy policy commitments made by the puppet conservative group have no prospect of fulfillment. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"National Assembly\", administration, prosecution and media have become a marionette serving the one-man dictatorship. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Various repressive machines including the puppet National Intelligence Service have been dramatically reinforced while the political investigation has been revived and there reappeared the Paekgol Corps which earned an ill-fame in the days of the erstwhile military fascist dictatorial regime. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe dissident groups have been purged en mass from the \"government\", public organs and different media organs. More than 10,000 public servants and over 19,000 personnel of public institutions have been expelled for the past three years.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The organizations and trade unions which had been formed as legal organizations under the previous regimes have been labeled illegal ones and the religious organizations that incurred the authorities' displeasure have become targets of suppression after being branded as heretical ones. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thousands of demonstrators were wounded due to suppression and arrested for the past three years. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The just struggles of workers for the right to existence have also been brutally suppressed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The group has driven the inter-Korean relations into the worst catastrophe during the period. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The moves of the group brought the contacts and exchanges to suspension though they had made good progress in an atmosphere of reconciliation and unity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Red Cross humanitarian undertakings including the reunion of separated families and relatives have not been properly carried out due to the dishonest attitude of the group. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has brutally suppressed the reunification movement organizations, non-governmental organizations and personages that advocated reconciliation, unity and exchange and cooperation on charges of violation of the \"National Security Law\", a fascist law, after labeling them \"pro-north\" and \"enemy-benefiting\" organizations and persons and \"spies.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has gone to extremes in its anti-DPRK confrontation rackets and moves for a war of aggression against the DPRK, blinded by its ambition to achieve \"unification under liberal democracy\" and take advantage of \"contingency\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What the seizure of power by the puppet group has brought the south Korean people is nothing but frustration, pain and sacrifices. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group is making last-ditch efforts to tone down the public anger now on the brink of explosion in a bid to tide over its serious ruling crisis. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The more desperately the group pursues the fascist dictatorship and confrontation with fellow countrymen against the nation's will, the earlier it will face its final destruction, warned the indictment."

But this was a big political fraud to garner votes though he had no intention to fulfill it as the south Korean paper Kyunghyang Daily News put it on April 1. After realizing their wild ambition for power by running the whole gamut of gimmicks, the south Korean ruling forces frantically pursued the unpopular policy meeting the interests of the privileged circles and their clan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The plan was cancelled in pursuance of the policy. They have perpetrated too many acts against the people's mind-set. They include the import of American beef harmful to the lives and health of the south Korean people, projects for improving the four big rivers and the \"revised plan for the construction of Sejong City\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These crimes are very dangerous as they are nothing but the last-ditch efforts of the forces driven into the inescapable abyss of ruin by the popular masses' denunciation and protests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reckless efforts made by the south Korean authorities to step up the unpopular policy cannot be construed otherwise than a desperate bid to achieve the \"political\" purpose which the conservative forces have pursued for the last decade they termed \"lost decade.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The more vicious the puppet group gets in its moves, the more saliently it will reveal its true colors as the wicked enemy of the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Media of south Korea reported that \"furor\" sparked by the cancellation of the above-said plan \"would not easily subside.\" This clearly suggests the firm will of the public to judge the present ruling forces.
