He even defended the U.S. nuclear war exercises against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This proves that he has become so biased as to openly support the hostile forces in their moves for stifling and isolating a sovereign state, a UN member, oblivious of the elementary principle of activities as an official of the international body. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Unbecoming his post as UN Secretary General, Ban is not yet away from his behavior of kowtowing to the U.S. as south Korean \"minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade\".

The nuclear threat posed by the U.S. during the Korean War was a nightmare for the Korean people in the true sense of the word. MacArthur, commander of the U.S. forces in the Far East, blustered in December of 1950 that the U.S. would form a radioactive corridor in the northern part of Korea from the East Sea to the West Sea. There will be no living bodies in this corridor in 60 years or 120 years, he noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A long procession of A-bomb evacuees appeared on the Korean Peninsula during the war due to the U.S. A-bomb blackmail. This forced millions of Koreans to live separated into the north and the south still today.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. brought a great number of nuclear weapons to south Korea, turning it into the land with the densest distribution of nuclear weapons in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. shipped and deployed the first batch of tactical nuclear weapons to south Korea in 1957, nuclearizing the peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. deployment of nuclear weapons in south Korea has steadily increased and their number exceeded 1,000 in the mid-1970s.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has escalated nuclear war exercises against the DPRK in a phased way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The first U.S.-south Korea joint nuclear war exercises codenamed Focus Retina in 1969 was followed by Freedom Bolt, Team Spirit, RSOI, Key Resolve, Foal Eagle and Ulji Freedom Guardian for the past decades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the new century the U.S. designated the DPRK as part of an \"axis of evil\" and openly put it on the list of preemptive nuclear strike, escalating nuclear threats.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such situation compelled the DPRK to manufacture nuclear weapons to avert a war and defend its social system and destiny.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's access to nukes clearly proved to the world that the days are gone when the U.S. unilaterally made nuclear blackmail against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Foreign Policy Focus said Bush approached the DPRK in a wild way militarily and diplomatically in the early days of his office and thus made the DPRK a nuclear weapons state. The New York Times said the DPRK's declaration of its possession of nukes is a \"mistake\" made by the U.S. administration by pushing the DPRK to isolation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a bitter lesson drawn by the DPRK that only nukes can most reliably safeguard the security of the country and the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Gone never to return are the days when the U.S. threatened and blackmailed the DPRK with A-bomb."
