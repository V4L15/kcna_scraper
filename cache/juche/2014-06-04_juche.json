In a bid to help the Park group get rid of the pretty fix, he accused the DPRK in an effort to divert elsewhere the public criticism of the group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not content with floating fictions about the \"April nuclear test by the north\" and \"drones from it\", he wooed military gangsters into cooking up a story about \"north's shelling\" in the most sensitive hot spot of the West Sea of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t While turning a deaf ear to the voices of bereaved families calling for finding dead bodies of those missing and the angry public mindset in south Korea, the Kim-led military gangsters undisguisedly revealed their wild ambition for confrontation with compatriots in the north, as evidenced by their opening of the \"5-phase military strategy toward the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim should be punished by the public as he has gone busy kicking up anti-DPRK confrontation hysteria in a bid to help Park get rid of the worst ruling crisis caused by her sycophancy towards the U.S. and unpopular rule, far from working hard to rescue those missing. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This notwithstanding, Park is about to appoint such a hooligan to  the post of the chief of the security office of Chongwadae even before the tears shed by bereaved families are dry after throwing away the \"promise\" she made to the people like a pair of old shoes.  This is another farce staged against the south Korean people calling for probing the truth behind the ferry Sewol disaster and taking measures for it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park's intention to appoint Kim to the important post of \"unification\", diplomacy and security is a blatant challenge to the compatriots desirous of peace and security on the Korean peninsula and the public mindset at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already known to the world, Kim is no more than a diehard pro-U.S. lackey and the worst traitor who brought the greatest danger of a war to the peninsula as a war servant and special-class stooge of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After adopting with the U.S. bellicose forces the \"tailored deterrent strategy\" aimed to mount a preemptive nuclear strike at the DPRK, he further intensified military provocations against the DPRK than ever before after allowing the U.S. introduce nuclear carriers into the East, South and West Seas of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Moreover, he let U.S. nuclear-capable B-52s fly into the sky above the Korean peninsula and conduct bombing drills.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim is, at the same time, a wicked confrontation maniac who pushed the north-south relations to a catastrophe.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was none other than Kim who incited the \"outlook on security\" and \"outlook on the principal enemy\" within the puppet south Korean army and inspected its frontline posts to cry out for \"countering first and making a report next.\" He was the arch criminal who hurled gangsters of the puppet army into perpetrating such a thrice-cursed crime as firing at the targets hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and its social system after setting them up in their drill grounds.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Entering this year, he ordered commanding and staff officers of units at various levels to make preparations for high-handed counter-actions against the \"north's provocations,\" terming the proposal made by the DPRK for the improvement of the north-south relations as \"double-dealing tactics\" and \"camouflaged peace offensive.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No sooner had an agreement on terminating the smear campaign been adopted between the north and the south than he desperately pursued the anti-DPRK campaign, blustering \"psychological warfare against the north is not a smear campaign.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the final analysis, what Kim has done is nothing but dangerous criminal acts aimed to bedevil the inter-Korean relations and ignite a war against the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality clearly shows that the north-south relations can never improve in line with the expectation of the nation and the situation on the peninsula will become more strained as long as diehard confrontation maniacs like Kim are allowed to go scot-free. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Hye will be held wholly responsible for all the consequences to be entailed by her appointment of the wicked guy as chief of the security office of Chongwadae."

            "content": "ACNC comenta la farsa de \"destitucion\" de responsables de la tragedia de Sewol\r\nPyongyang, 4 de junio (ACNC) -- La mandataria surcoreana Park Geun-hye nomino el dia primero al ministro de Defensa Nacional Kim Kwan Jin como sustituto del jefe de la Oficina de Seguridad de Chongwadae. \n\t\t\t\t\tDe esta manera, se ha revelado el caracter enganoso de la \"promesa\" de Park de castigar a los responsables de la tragedia del ferry \"Sewol\", hecha el 19 de mayo al publicar su \"declaracion al pueblo\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Kwan Jin es el criminal de primera clase que debe ser sentenciado por la poblacion surcoreana por el caso de hundimiento del barco de pasajeros \"Sewol\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi bien controla los equipos de auxilio, los aparatos de buceo para el rescate y otras enormes fuerzas armadas, el no procedio a la operacion de rescate tratando de eludir la responsabilidad. Para salvar a la banda de Park en crisis, acuso groseramente a la RPDC tratando de distraer el enfoque de lucha antigubernamental. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDifundio el rumor infundado de \"prueba nuclear en abril\" y de \"drones norcoreanos\" e invento el caso de \"canonazo\" de la RPDC en la zona mas candente del Mar Oeste de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesoyendo las voces de los familiares de victimas y de la poblacion surcoreana en demanda de la busqueda de los cadaveres de los desaparecidos en la tragedia de Sewol, demostro abiertamente la ambicion de confrontacion fratricida publicando la \"estrategia militar de 5 etapas contra el Norte de Corea\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, Park Geun-hye quiere nombrar ese canalla como jefe de la Oficina de Seguridad de Chongwadae. Esto es otro engano a la poblacion surcoreana que demanda el esclarecimiento de la tragedia del ferry \"Sewol\" y un desafio a la opinion publica interna y externa y a la nacion coreana aspirante a la paz y estabilidad de la Peninsula Coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo ya es conocido por todo el mundo, Kim Kwan Jin es el vendepatria proyanqui y traidor a la nacion que trajo la peor crisis de guerra a la Peninsula Coreana actuando como sirviente mas fiel a EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAprobo con los belicistas del circulo militar norteamericano la \"estrategia del disuasivo de forma de ajuste\" para asestar el golpe nuclear preventivo a la RPDC e intensifico mas que nunca las provocaciones militares introduciendo el portaaviones nuclear norteamericano en los mares Este, Oeste y Sur de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY permitio al bombardero estrategico norteamericano B-52 cargado de armas nucleares librar los ejercicios de lanzamiento de bombas nucleares en el espacio aereo de la Peninsula Coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, Kim es el maniaco de enfrentamiento que llevo a la ruptura las relaciones intercoreanas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEse traidor infundio en el ejercito titere la \"concepcion de seguridad y de enemigo principal\" e instruyo \"reaccionar primero y avisarlo despues\" en su inspeccion por los puestos militares avanzados. E hizo en los campos de entrenamiento del ejercito titere disparar balas contra los objetos que simbolizan la maxima dignidad y el regimen de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste ano tambien, ordeno a los comandantes y miembros del Estado Mayor de las unidades militares a todos los niveles tomar las contramedidas intransigentes a la supuesta \"provocacion del Norte de Corea\" insultando la propuesta norcoreana por la mejora de relaciones intercoreanas como \"tactica de dos caras\" y \"ofensiva de paz disfrazada\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTan pronto como se aprobara el acuerdo Norte-Sur sobre el cese de calumnias a la contraparte, dijo que \"la campana psicologica anti-RPDC no se incluye a la categoria de calumnias\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo vemos, lo que hizo Kim Kwan Jin es haber roto los vinculos Norte-Sur y cometido crimenes para desatar la guerra de agresion anti-RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras existen en suelo surcoreano los maniacos de enfrentamiento como Kim Kwan Jin, no se mejoraran las relaciones intercoreanas de acuerdo con la esperanza de la nacion sino se empeorara mas la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark Geun-hye se responsabilizara de todas las consecuencias que emanen de la nominacion de Kim Kwan Jin."

            "content": "Japon debe pedir perdon e indemnizar sus crimenes del pasado, insiste Rodong Sinmun\r\nPyongyang, 4 de junio (ACNC) -- Hace poco, en Japon se abrio la reunion del grupo recien fundado para investigar el proceso de publicacion de la declaracion de Kono, ex director del secretariado del gabinete, quien reconocio el arresto forzado de esclavas sexuales para el viejo ejercito japones. \n\t\t\t\t\tEn el pasado, Japon insistio tanto en continuar la declaracion de Kono, pero ahora tergiversa su historia criminal negando hasta las medidas tomadas por los gobiernos anteriores. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto es la expresion del malsano intento de los reaccionarios japoneses de encubrir su historia criminal negando la verdad y la justicia y realizar a toda costa la ambicion de nueva agresion convirtiendo la sociedad japonesa en la militarista y derechista, revela el diario Rodong Sinmun en un comentario individual de este miercoles y continua: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas atrocidades cometidas en el siglo pasado por el imperialismo japones son crimenes antieticos nunca vistos en la historia de la humanidad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstan registrados muchas guerras y actos de agresion en la historia, pero no hubo los agresores tan barbaros como los imperialistas japoneses que arrestaron a 200 mil mujeres coreanas y las convirtieron en esclavas sexuales diciendo que asi se puede estimular mejor a la agresion a los uniformados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn los ultimos anos, los reaccionarios ultraderechistas japoneses niegan el caso de esclavitud sexual insistiendo en la revision de la declaracion de Kono. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa negacion de crimenes del pasado y la tergiversacion de la historia significan el preludio de nueva agresion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn lugar de intentar inutilmente tachar de la memoria de la humanidad sus crimenes del pasado y los hechos de la historia, Japon debe pedir disculpas e indemnizarlos. Esto es la unica via para salir de la ignominia de pais enemigo."
