This is a crime unprecedented in history.\r\n What should not be overlooked is the fact that Japanese venal historians marked Tok islet, an inalienable part of Korea's territory, as \"Takeshima\" in the textbook and absurdly asserted that the DPRK is demanding dominium over \"Takeshima\" though it belongs to Japan. They went the length of writing about the theory of \"Mimana Miyake\" in the book while deleting such hideous crimes as crimes related to the \"comfort women for the army.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This goes to clearly prove that the textbook is a retrogressive revision of the present history textbooks for junior high schoolers which describes the issue of Tok islet as an \"outstanding\" one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fact that Tok islet is an inalienable part of the territory of Korea admits of no argument and the theory about \"Mimana Miyake\" claimed by Japan is the height of folly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was written in textbooks that Japan kept Mimana, the southern part of Korea, under its control for hundreds of years since the 4th century after establishing the \"Japanese administrative office\" there. But this was proved to be a forgery by the results of study conducted by historians in the north and south of Korea and fair-minded Japanese historians long ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Of course there are in Japan men of intellect who can see through the essence of history and politicians who are concerned about the serious consequences to be entailed by the distortion of history. Then how can such practices as tampering with history be committed with the official approval of the government authorities? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind this is a sinister aim sought by the right-wing conservative politicians of Japan to cover up Japan's shameful past crimes and imbue the younger generation with the militarist idea in a bid to drive them to overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities can never evade the historical, political and moral responsibilities for this despicable distortion of history.    \r\n\r\n"
