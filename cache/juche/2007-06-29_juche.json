            "content": "Revolutionary Principle of Juche Idea  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 28 (KCNA) -- The revolutionary principle of Juche idea is that the masses of the people are masters and the motive force of the revolution and construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle is the truth that President Kim Il Sung found out and acquired as faith in the early period of his revolutionary activity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He, with the principle as the guidelines, created a new guiding idea and pioneered the revolutionary cause of Juche under its banner. He also victoriously led the two revolutionary wars, social revolutions of two stages, socialist construction and others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He had carried the great idea into practice, without restricting himself to the existing theories and formulas. He, therefore, could defeat the Japanese imperialists and liberate the country by leading the Korean people in the anti-Japanese revolution when others said that it was impossible to make the national liberation revolution without recourse to the working class of the suzerain state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Not a small number of people across the world apprehended whether the DPRK could defeat the U.S. imperialists with their own efforts in the Fatherland Liberation War. Then, he wisely organized and mobilized the army and people so as to crush the numerical and technical superiority of the invaders and safeguard the freedom and independence of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He accomplished the socialist revolution within four to five years in reliance upon the revolutionary strength of the Korean people though foreigners said that it was not possible to carry out the socialist transformation of the rural economy before the industrialization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the late 1980s and early 1990s when Eastern European socialist countries collapsed one after another, the Korean revolution, with the might of the Juche idea, defended the people-centered socialism as firm as rock. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the period of the \"Arduous March\" and the forced march in which the Korean people had to undergo difficulties caused by the intensified economic blockade of the imperialists and the unprecedented natural disasters, they overcame the difficulties by themselves without pinning hope to others, thus advancing forward towards the bright morrow of a great, prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean revolution is replete with heroic events and world-startling changes. The reality has proved the truth and vitality of the idea that the power of the popular masses is the decisive factor for the victory of the revolution and construction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But the struggle met one setback after another as it was not guided by correct line and policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the first days of his revolutionary activities, President Kim Il Sung put his heart and soul into the establishment of the correct guiding idea of the Korean revolution, rejecting flunkeyism and dogmatism and analyzing the radical shortcomings of the preceding movements. And he made the historic report \"The Path of the Korean Revolution\" at the Kalun Meeting which was held from the end of June to the beginning of July Juche 19 (1930). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He, in the report, expounded the idea that the masters of the Korean revolution are the Korean people themselves and that the revolution should by all means be carried out by themselves suitable to the actual conditions of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He advanced the policy of organizing and waging an armed struggle against Japanese imperialism as an important task for the successful fulfillment of the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Kalun Meeting which put forward the Juche-oriented line of the Korean revolution marked a historic turning point by proclaiming the foundation of the Sungun idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since then, the Korean revolution has all along covered the road of victory under the banner of the Songun idea based on the Juche idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nUnder the great Songun revolutionary leadership of the President, the DPRK achieved the historic cause of national liberation, reliably protected the sovereignty of the country from the armed invasion of the U.S. imperialists and built a powerful socialist country of independence, self-sustenance and self-defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nToday the great Songun politics of Kim Jong Il has further consolidated the Korean socialist system centered on the popular masses and provided a solid military guarantee for the prosperity of the country.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
