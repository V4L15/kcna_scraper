Young people are subject to physical sufferings resulting from the chemical weapons carelessly left by the Japanese imperialists in different parts of Asia. A large number of people who had been taken by the Japanese imperialists to alien countries at the point of the bayonet have undergone unbearable misfortune for several decades, without knowing the whereabouts of their kith and kin. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This being hard realities, the Japanese authorities are behaving impudently, oft-repeating their far-fetched assertion that the issue of Japan's settlement of its past had already been solved legally though neither victims nor the international community recognize it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese authorities have persistently evaded the responsibility to make apology and reparation to Korea, the biggest victim of the Japanese imperialists, though more than six decades have passed since their defeat.

Not content with this, it is now enforcing the measure to restrict and cut off even the mail exchange between the non-governmental organizations of the DPRK and Japan, etc., something one can hardly imagine with normal thinking power in the present IT age.

The resistance organizations in Cholwon and Popdong in Kangwon Province and in Yomju and Sakju in North Phyongan Province also fought bravely to control the enemy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to the bold offensive of the KPRA and courageous fight of the people's resistance organizations of the country combined with the former, the Japanese imperialists surrendered unconditionally on August 15, 1945, a week after the operation against Japan started.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At last the cause of national liberation for which the Korean nation had eagerly longed was realized brilliantly under the wise leadership of President Kim Il Sung who led the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle to victory, going through the grim ordeals and difficulties for 20 years."

Entonces, el embajador japones acreditado en el Sur de Corea los censuro de tal o cual manera y dijo que \"Japon desea la division porque la tragedia de la reunificacion de Corea es mas grande que la de la division\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos reaccionarios japoneses calumniaron tambien el proyecto de la fundacion de la Republica Federal Democratica de Coryo, la propuesta de creacion de la zona desnuclearizada y de paz en la Peninsula Coreana, la de desarme de gran envergadura en esta region y otros proyectos para la reunificacion de Corea y preconizaron activamente la linea divisoria del Sur de Corea. Tan pronto como las autoridades surcoreanas publicaron la declaracion \"7 de julio\" de caracter divisorio, Japon la apoyo primeramente como si esa fuera un supuesto \"medio\" para la reunificacion de Corea y se encargo del papel de \"puente\" de la \"politica sobre el Norte\" de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tambien, presento el \"proyecto de invitacion condicional\" para que no participara el representante de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea en la 20a asamblea general y otras asambleas generales de la ONU y actuo vilmente malgastando el dinero para llevarlo a cabo. Tambien, en la asamblea general de la ONU maniobro taimadamente para que no se disuelva la \"Comision de la ONU para la unificacion y rehabilitacion de Corea\", aparato de agresion inventado por EE.UU. abusando del nombre de la ONU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hasta la fecha en que paso el medio siglo, los reaccionarios japoneses recurren freneticamente a las maniobras para aplicar la sancion y presion contra la RPDC adhiriendose a la politica hostil a esta de EE.UU. y multiplican sus crimenes contra la nacion coreana."

            "content": "ATCC comenta teoria de ataque preventivo nuclear de Japon\r\n Pyongyang, 14 de agosto (ATCC) -- En una rueda de prensa concedida el dia 9 el premier japones Aso preconizo abiertamente tal teoria.\n\t\t\t\t\t El dijo que negar el ataque preventivo nuclear \"no es real\" en la garantia de la seguridad de Japon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En una palabra, es que la seguridad de este pais isleno reside en el ataque preventivo nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La palabra de Aso demuestra fehacientemente que  se torna mas realista y grave la amenaza nuclear de Japon sobre los paises vecinos y el resto del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El pais isleno esta protegido por el \"paraguas nuclear\" de Estados Unidos y dispone no solo del combustible nuclear sino  tambien  de las tecnicas de fabricacion de las armas nucleares y medios de su transporte \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Esto significa que Japon ya esta plenamente armado con  las armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A base de esto, los reaccionarios japoneses tratan de tomar el camino de la guerra nuclear mas aventurera.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tambien, la palabra de Aso vuelve a demostrar claramente la absurdidad y la peligrosidad de la insistencia de EE.UU. y otros paises en que la posesion nuclear de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea azuza a Japon a la posesion  nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El rumor de la \"reaccion en cadena\" de la posesion  nuclear, de que debido a la de la RPDC, Japon saldra en el futuro al armamento nuclear, es erronea desde su premisa logica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El armamento nuclear de Japon no es cosa del futuro sino la del presente. Por lo tanto, resulta absurdo tal rumor de \"reaccion en cadena\" basada en la premisa injusta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Cuando recrudece la aspiracion de la humanidad al mundo desnuclearizado, Japon esta preso del fanatismo de la guerra nuclear, lo cual es el producto directo de doble rasero que aplican  EE.UU. y otros paises en el tratamiento del problema nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Estos aplican el doble rasero en este problema con la sofisteria no cientifica como el rumor de la \"reaccion en cadena\" en la posesion nuclear, pero, no pueden liberarse de la responsabilidad de que Japon  llega a hablar  del ataque preventivo nuclear como hoy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hasta la fecha cuando este pais isleno habla abiertamente de la teoria de ataque preventivo nuclear y perpetra abiertamente la amenaza nuclear contra la RPDC y otros paises vecinos, ellos no dicen ni un pio del particular.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El \"problema nuclear del Norte de Corea\" no fue inventado a base de alguna imparcialidad sino segun la politica hostil a la RPDC de EE.UU. tendente a aplastar a esta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Las conversaciones a 6 bandas se fracasaron por tales desigualdades: algun pais puede insistir en el ataque preventivo nuclear y el otro debe ser obligado a la renuncia nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La situacion de hoy demuestra elocuentemente cuan justas son las medidas de la RPDC sobre la posesion del disuasivo nuclear autodefensivo y la retirada de las conversaciones a 6 bandas y cuan clave es la renuncia de la politica hostil a la RPDC de EE.UU. en la solucion del problema nuclear."
