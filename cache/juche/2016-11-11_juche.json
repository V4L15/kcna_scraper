He had a photo taken with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He gave the soldiers a pair of binoculars, an automatic rifle and a machine gun as gifts and had a photo session with all service personnel and officers' families of the defence detachment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accompanying him were Vice-Marshal of the KPA Hwang Pyong So, director of the General Political Bureau of the KPA, Vice-Marshal of the KPA Ri Myong Su, chief of the General Staff of the KPA, Army Col.
