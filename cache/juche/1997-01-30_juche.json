The \"suffrage\" farce of the south Korean puppets and the Japanese reactionaries is aimed at making the Koreans in Japan Japanese citizens by naturalizing and assimilating them.    \r\n   The \"suffrage\" farce is also aimed at destroying Chongryon and creating grave obstacles in the way of realizing the democratic national rights of Korean citizens in Japan.\r\n   If the Koreans in Japan are put in the position of an ethnic minority with Japanese nationality, Chongryon, which is the mouthpiece and protector of their rights and interests, will lose the legal position as the overseas citizens' organisation,  and the Koreans in Japan will fall political victims to Japanese laws.\r\n   The \"suffrage\" farce is also a grave act to totally destroy the unity of Koreans in Japan by inveigling them into Japanese politics.\r\n   It is aimed at laying obstacles to the political and legal protection and support of the DPRK for the Koreans in Japan.\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries and the south Korean puppet clique must give up the anachronistic and anti-national \"suffrage\" farce at once and take hands off the provocative moves to stifle the DPRK and Chongryon. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Security Council, still less trust from the world community, but will face isolation.\r\n   Japan must take a sincere approach to postwar settlement in no time as Germany did, so that the atonement for its past crimes against humankind may not be postponed into next century. This will be good for Japan itself. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
