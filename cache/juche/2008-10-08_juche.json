Esto desvirtua el aparato legal de Japon que prohibe la participacion de las \"fuerzas de autodefensa\" en las operaciones militares ultramarinas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Lo que persiguen ellos es legalizar el ejercicio del \"derecho a la autodefensa colectiva\" que posibilita enviar sin restriccion alguna sus \"fuerzas de autodefensa\" a cualquier region del mundo a fin de desplegar la operacion militar agresiva.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Es obvio que la estrategia militar de Japon paso de la \"defensa exclusiva\" a la ofensiva preventiva y la esfera de operacion militar se extiende de los alrededores de Japon a la region de Asia-Pacifico y las demas regiones del mundo. El fortalecimiento de la capacidad de coleccion de informacion y la medida del ministerio de defensa de Japon para despachar las \"fuerzas de autodefensa\" son la medida practica para extender al ambito mundial su accion de agresion a ultramar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Japon abandono el rotulo de \"estado pacifico\" que  portaba mas de medio siglo de la postguerra y asi puso al desnudo su naturaleza de pais belico y de fuerzas dominacionistas belicas que suenan con la conquista del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Japon debe justipreciar la realidad de hoy y poner inmediatamente fin a las maniobras de expansion militarista a ultramar."
