            "content": "Papers Denounce S. Korean Puppet Conservative Group for Opposing Abolition of \"State-compiled Textbooks\"\r\n Pyongyang, June 6 (KCNA) -- Some days ago, the south Korean puppet Ministry of Education officially announced that it would enforce the system of issuing history textbooks of middle and high schools by changing it into the original \"system of screening textbooks\" from the \"state-compiled textbooks system\". So, the \"state-compiled history textbooks\" by traitor Park Geun Hye to praise her pro-U.S., pro-Japanese history and \"yusin\" dictatorship rule are to be thrown into the dustbin of history.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Tuesday in a commentary says this is the result of the south Korean people's dynamic struggle to make a clean sweep of all Park's evils against democracy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Great irony is the fact that Park and puppet conservative remnants driven into a ruin are making desperate efforts to put a brake in the wheel of the moves for abolishing the \"state-compiled history textbooks\", the leftover of Park, the commentary notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet conservative group is doggedly opposed to the abolition of the \"state-compiled history textbooks\". It is, in essence, another history coup to revive the fascist dictatorship system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean people will never pardon the reckless moves of the wicked conservatives desperately running amuck to turn back the wheel of history while swimming against the trend of the times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet conservative group would be well advised to be dead before making desperate efforts for getting rid of the ruin.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson in a commentary says it is clear that the conservative group would be further split than now when the \"state-compiled history textbooks\" are abolished. That's why the conservatives including the \"Liberal Korea Party\" are persistently opposed to the \"abolition of the Park Geun Hye's evils\" such as the abolition of the \"state-compiled history textbooks,\" it concludes."

It is, indeed, a burlesque that makes even a cat laugh, the commentary notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As for military equipment of the south Korean puppet army like radar, they are all second-handed ones the majority of which were offered by the U.S. and are little short of scrap iron. Grafts of the brass hats massively brought no-guarantee weapon systems and defective equipment to the puppet army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Soldiers of the puppet army are wishing that a war would not break out during their service. Such an army with poor hardware and without OPECON is often bluffing, crying out for not \"pardoning the provocation of the north\" and inflicting \"resolute punishment.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This, indeed, provokes side-splitting laughter."

Por eso, ya comenzaron desde hace decenios los esfuerzos por prevenirlo. Como su resultado, quedo aprobado el Acuerdo de Paris para reducir la cantidad de emision de gas carbonico en cada pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa presente declaracion de Trump produce la gran condena y censura a EE.UU. en la palestra internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa \"prioridad a EE.UU.\" que preconiza Trump trajo la retirada del Acuerdo de Paris, lo cual deviene el climax del egoismo y la bajeza moral que persigue solo su vida rica en lugar de sacrificar a todo el mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, constituye un acto de miope y absurdo de no entender la verdad de que la proteccion del medioambiente de la Tierra es util tambien para el pais americano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl acto egoista de EE.UU. ejerce una grave influencia a los empenos internacionales por proteger el ambiente y causa gran peligrosidad a otros sectores. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSu ejemplo mas representativo es la actitud de EE.UU. en cuanto al problema nuclear de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInsatisfecho con la politica hostil anti-RPDC, EE.UU. impone a otros paises suspender las relaciones con la RPDC para la seguridad de su pais, lo que es un acto sumamente injusto y peligroso.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl mundo no debe vacilar mas, sino elevar la vigilancia ante la peligrosa corriente ideologica que se presenta en el suelo norteamericano junto con la aparicion de la administracion Trump. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY todos los paises deben tener bien presente que si siguen actuando ciegamente temidos por la fanfarronada de la banda de Trump se pondran en la misma posicion igual con EE.UU, cuando este se presente ante el tribunal de la historia."
