If they are displayed, the U.S. will feel regrettable for its action that will lead to its self-destruction.    \r\n\r\n"

When a war breaks out in this land, it will bring big sacrifice and damage to all the Koreans in the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to frustrate the aggression and war moves, all the fellow countrymen in the north, south and overseas should get united into one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north and the south solemnly vowed to achieve peace and reunification of the country with the united efforts of the nation in the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Flunkeyism and dependence on outsiders should be thoroughly rejected in the struggle to frustrate the aggression and war moves of the Yankees through the united efforts of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army-based policy is not only for the DPRK. It is a patriotic policy to preserve dignity, security and interests of the whole nation including South Koreans. It also serves as a treasured sword of justice to deal a telling blow to aggressors infringing upon national sovereignty and right to existence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to the steel-like self-defensive military power built under the army-based policy the peace has been ensured on the Korean Peninsula and the South Koreans have lived in peace under the DPRK's self-defensive umbrella. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when the fellow countrymen in the north, the south and overseas devotedly uphold the patriotic army-based politics in firm unity, the U.S. imperialists' arrogant and criminal policy of aggression on the DPRK will go busted.    \r\n\r\n"

And the commanding general for the ground self-defence force stationed in the western part of Japan has justified the Japan-U.S. joint military exercises as \"ones to deter North Korean attack.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This bellicose behavior of Japan is arousing the DPRK's vigilance as it is a very dangerous move that may bring the military situation on the Korean Peninsula and its surrounding areas to the brink of a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These ill-boding military moves in Japan prompt the DPRK to feel deep apprehension about the fact that Japan's reinvasion policy, which had been persistently pursued over the past years, is reviving today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The point at issue is the behavior of the Japanese right-wing reactionary forces quite contrary to the desire of the Korean and Japanese peoples to settle the unpleasant past between the two countries, solve the pending issues and establish fruitful political, economic and cultural relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such deliberate and intentional, dishonest remarks made by those forces greatly threatening the peace and security of the DPRK can never be justified with anything. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What cannot be overlooked is the fact that they are hellbent on war moves to realize the strategic intention of the United States which is strengthening \"international cooperation\" in a bid to disarm the DPRK under the pretext of its \"nuclear issue\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is an expression of their cunning attempt to fish in troubled waters by acting a shock brigade to carry out the U.S. reckless strategy based on preemptive nuclear strikes and currying favor with it. The United States is now insisting on its assertion that the DPRK should scrap its \"nuclear program\" first, while turning down the latter's fair and aboveboard proposal for the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between the two countries in a bid to bring the DPRK to its knees at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people and army are watching the anti-DPRK moves in Japan with heightened vigilance and making full readiness to counter them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that Japan is zealously joining in the U.S. policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK, there is no need for the DPRK to show such magnanimity as maintaining moratorium on missile test fire any longer so as to clear security concerns of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The right-wing bellicose forces of Japan should not act rashly, clearly mindful that the Korean people's army and organs concerned of the DPRK are increasingly assertive for the reconsideration of the moratorium.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
