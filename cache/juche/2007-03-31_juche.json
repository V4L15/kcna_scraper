            "content": "KCNA Blasts Japan's Nasty Behavior to Derail Six-party Talks \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 30 (KCNA) -- The chief executive and other politicians of Japan let loose a spate of balderdash over the action taken to defreeze the DPRK's funds at Banco Delta Asia in a bid to throw a hurdle in the way of the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Taking issue with the DPRK over its principled stand on the above-said measure, Abe impertinently blustered that \"such attitude would get north Korea nowhere\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He, insisting on the \"abduction issue\" which has nothing to do with the agenda of the talks, threatened that Japan would not participate in \"energy aid\" to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK dismisses this as nothing but a nasty attempt of the Japanese politicians to derail the talks come what may, displeased with the progress made there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its participation in the talks or wish to see a satisfactory solution to the issue of defreezing its funds at the bank are not intended to get something from someone or to receive any aid. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As clarified by the DPRK more than once, its purpose is to realize the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and have its right to the legal funds regained. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is behaving so at a time when the world public and the countries concerned are becoming more vocal in calling for creating an environment for the resumption of the talks. Its behavior cannot be construed otherwise than a wrong deed of a political dwarf. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No wonder, AFP, quoting an official of the U.S. State Department, said that at the department there is an atmosphere of commenting that Japan has gone too far. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the purpose of the six-party talks to denuclearize the peninsula and the economic and energy assistance to the DPRK promised by the participating countries in the Feb. 13 agreement is part of the projects to achieve the above-mentioned purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a matter of fact, Japan has neither qualification nor justification to participate in the talks. It cannot but be a big trouble-maker as it is behaving so badly after poking its nose into them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should be mindful that it will suffer bitterer disgrace and stand sidelined in the international community should it continue working mischievously instead of striving for the success of the talks and implementing the agreed points.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He led the Korean revolution to victory with this love. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His comradeship represents absolute trust in the revolutionary comrades and total dedication to them and invariable love for them because he had always shared his destiny with anyone with whom he once shared his will. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The noble tradition of the single-minded unity unprecedented in the history of revolution was provided in the period when the Korean revolution was just kicked off and has been steadily carried forward and developed thanks to the ardent and genuine comradely love between the leader and his soldiers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our revolutionary ranks have not been affected by any ideological factions and alien ideological trends since their inception because the President's revolutionary idea is great and all their members have been pervaded with revolutionary faith and comradely obligation to remain true to his idea and intention though they might die. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His revolutionary history is an immortal chronicle during which he laid an eternal foundation on which the Korean revolution can always emerge victorious under the banner of comradeship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the DPRK has a powerful driving force of revolution made up of the party, the army and the people that are closely rallied around the headquarters of the revolution. The party and the leader trust the people and vice versa. This powerful driving force of the Korean revolution in which the leader, the party and the masses are linked by the same destiny is based on the noble comradeship of Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our revolutionary ranks are demonstrating their might as the ranks of faith and will as all the servicepersons and people are closely rallied around the headquarters of the revolution with do-or-die spirit and will and an unshakable community linked with the same destiny as they are determined to remain true to their pledge in the way of the long journey for the Songun revolution despite rain or snow. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today socialism in the DPRK is shedding its rays as a big harmonious family all members of which revere Kim Jong Il as their father and a genuine human society in which all the people help and lead each other forward with one mind and intention, sharing bitters and sweets. The party and the state look after the people's destiny and living in a responsible manner and all the people absolutely trust and follow the party and a beautiful and noble human relationship is in bloom everywhere in the society on the basis of revolutionary comradeship. Such an advantageous society as the socialist society in the DPRK can hardly be found anywhere else in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary history of Kim Il Sung who created the ever-victorious epic with the revolutionary comradeship has been successfully carried forward thanks to the Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il's ardent comradeship, characterized by absolute trust in the comrades, the army and the people, produced the Songun political mode, the mighty socialist political mode in our times, and the invincible revolutionary armed forces, a heir to the traditions of Mt. Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is thanks to the comradely love between the leader and the servicepersons and the people who have always shared the intention and destiny that the DPRK has been able to heroically overcome the worst adversity and greet the bright dawn of a great prosperous powerful nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

En este mundo no hay otra sociedad tan ventajosa que el socialismo coreano donde el partido y el Estado se responsabilizan totalmente del destino y la vida del pueblo y los cuidan, el pueblo confia y apoya absolutamente al primero y todos los miembros de la sociedad se entrelazan en las nobles y hermosas relaciones personales a base de tal camaraderia revolucionaria. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La historia del Presidente, quien escribio una epopeya de victorias siempre con la camaraderia revolucionaria, se lleva adelante hoy por la orientacion del Songun del Dirigente Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Gracias a la camaraderia del Dirigente signada de la absoluta confianza en los camaradas, en el ejercito y el pueblo, nacio el Songun, modo politico socialista mas poderoso de la epoca actual, y se formaron las invencibles fuerzas armadas revolucionarias del monte Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Por el amor camaraderil entre el lider y decenas de millones de militares y habitantes, quienes con el mismo proposito comparten la vida y la muerte, nuestro pais pudo superar heroicamente las peores adversidades y acoger la esplendida alborada de la gran potencia prospera.      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
