Stealth technology was introduced into the fighter jet called the fifth-generation one and Japan reportedly started its development in the middle of the first decade of the 21st century. \n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun Friday says:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The test-flight revealed once again the wild ambition of Japan to emerge a military giant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The successive governments of Japan have spurred the projects for bolstering up and modernizing its air force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Aware of the efficiency of air strikes in wars of aggression before any other countries, Japan had put spurs to manufacturing war planes such as fighters and bombers while building warships by taking advantage of its booming industry since the \"1868 Meiji Restoration.\" The Japanese imperialists launched the blitz on Pearl Harbor with fighter bombers and this became a prelude to the Pacific War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since the end of the Second World War, it has bolstered up its Air \"Self-Defense Force\" by reviving its military air industry and lavished funds on buying various type fighter jets from the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the scenario of Japan to ignite a surprise war of aggression and carry out its blitz tactics by dint of its air force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What merits particular attention is that Japan opted for independently modernizing its arms and equipment. This means Japan is confident of its potential acquired in the decades-long course of turning itself into a military giant. In another word, Japan is mulling increasing its own capability for executing a war of aggression, without being dependent and subject to the U.S. Japan's ulterior design is to round off the preparations for launching overseas invasion single-handed any moment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The revival of Japanese militarism would only mean a starting point in going to its final ruin, concludes the commentary."
