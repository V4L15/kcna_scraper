The U.S. infiltrated USS Sherman into Korea long ago, revealing its attempt at aggression of the Korean Peninsula and split of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His outcries have a thread of connection with those of the U.S. and the pro-U.S. conservative forces including the GNP. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary urged the cardinal not to leave a blot in history by making pro-U.S. sycophantic remarks going against the times but to turn out in the movement for independent reunification of the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
