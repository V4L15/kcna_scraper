            "content": "Strong Defence Power Called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 23 (KCNA) -- A military build-up is a key issue on which hinge victory or defeat of a revolution and rise or fall of a country and nation as the struggle for a victory of the people's cause of independence, the cause of socialism, is bound to be accompanied by a confrontation with the imperialists and all the counter-revolutionary forces in strength, says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article.\r\n The people's cause of independence, cause of socialism, requires a military build-up, the build-up of strong revolutionary armed forces, the article says, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A revolution can triumph only when it has strong revolutionary armed forces. Only when a nation has strong revolutionary armed forces, can it achieve national independence and emerge victorious in the revolutionary struggle for the social and class liberation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to have strong revolutionary armed forces to defend the triumphant revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists are more desperately clinging to the \"logic of strength\". They are working hard to put the people under the yoke of colonial slavery again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is impossible to defend the triumphant revolution without strong revolutionary armed forces. This is clearly evidenced by what happened in Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Had Iraq built up strong national defence power, it would have beaten back the U.S. imperialists' armed invasion and defended the sovereignty of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to have strong defence power to independently carve out destiny of the country and the nation. This is a serious lesson drawn by the army and people of the DPRK from their confrontation with the U.S. imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Last year the U.S. imperialists more openly disclosed their wild ambition to stifle the DPRK by force of arms. But the DPRK neither hesitated nor flinched from the confrontation with the U.S. imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has always reacted to the U.S. hard-line policy with the toughest stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. dared not to provoke the second Korean war as it was overawed by the DPRK's might. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Socialism can never be defended through begging and compromise with enemies. It can be defended only by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Arms of justice alone can guarantee victory of the revolutionary cause and the independence and prosperity of the country and the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Pressure and High-handed Practice under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 23 (KCNA) -- The United States recently forced south Korea to cover all the expenses for the transfer of the U.S. military base in Ryongsan in Seoul. A signed commentary of Rodong Sinmun today dismisses this as a despicable pressure and high-handed practice of the aggression forces.\r\n At the 6th meeting of the council for shaping the future policy for cooperation between south Korea and the U.S. the latter forced the former to accept its demand. They decided to transfer the whole base, except 25,000 phyong of land and some offices, to Phyongthaek, an area south of the River Han by the end of 2006. South Korea was pressurized to cover all the expenses for the transfer, the commentary notes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The paper terms this an unjustifiable agreement, a product of the master-servant relationship between the U.S. and south Korea and a tragic event proving the deplorable position of the present south Korean authorities still subject to the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is now staging this farce in a foolish bid to deliver the U.S. troops present in south Korea from the striking range of the north in case the U.S. provokes the second Korean war on the Korean peninsula according to its military strategy toward Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration's stepped-up transfer of its base in south Korea proves that it is going to ignite a war on the Korean peninsula sooner or later. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The transfer of the base is part of its preparations for a war against the north. This means that the expenses for this transfer will be covered with the taxes collected from south Koreans to bring the disaster of a nuclear war to them. This goes to clearly prove that the U.S. is a shameless and brigandish aggressor keen to impose a nuclear war upon the Korean nation at the sacrifice of the south Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should bear in mind that they will suffer bitterer shame and meet a catastrophic fate in future for their disgraceful behaviour yielding to the U.S. pressure.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
