As a result, the basic principle has been made clear that man holds the position of master in the world and plays an important role in transforming it.\r\n   Independence, creativity and consciousness of man do not stem from his natural and biological attributes and are not their development and completion, but are shaped and developed socially and historically, and man is the only social being in the world.

This was a new miracle. It is recorded in the world history of war that when one side made a surprise attack, the other side yielded to it or went over to a counterattack after experiencing pains for some time.\r\n   At dawn on July 2, 1950, four torpedo boats of the second torpedo-boat fleet of the KPA navy attacked the 17,000-ton heavy cruiser baltimore, a 12,000-ton light cruiser and a 3,000-ton destroyer of the U.S. navy in the East Sea off Jumunjin and thus sank or destroyed them.\r\n   In the Taejon-liberating battle which took place between July 18 and 20, 1950, KPA servicemen encircled and completely destroyed the U.S. 24th infantry division by employing superb war methods including frontal and flank strikes based on proper coordination of all units and dispatch of some units behind enemy lines. This is a brilliant example of modern siege warfare. The 18th infantry regiment of the KPA marched more than 40 kilometres overnight with heavy loads on their backs and intercepted enemy's retreat.\r\n   The defenders of Wolmi islet frustrated the attempt of the U.S. landing group composed of several hundred warships, 1,000-odd planes and over 50,000-strong men for three days from September 13 to 15, 1950 with only four artillery pieces. This struck a terror into the hearts of the enemy.\r\n   Besides, KPA servicemen created unique war methods without an equal in the world history of war such as disturbing the enemy's rear through cooperation between combined units and guerrillas and conducting an active positional defence with the help of durable pits. By doing so, they dealt a telling blow at the U.S. imperialists, their satellites and the south Korean puppets. \r\n\r\n"
