            "content": "U.S. strong-arm policy for aggression under fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 11 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article describes the first year of the 21st century as a year of failed U.S. aggressive foreign policy and a year that precipitated its international isolation and frustration.\r\n Last year the U.S. sparked various clashes and disputes with different countries including big powers, creating complications and chaos in international relations and bringing the international situation to an extreme pitch of tension, the article notes, and goes on: the U.S. imperialists further escalated the tensions on the Korean peninsula.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration, advocating a hard line towards the DPRK, brought pressure to bear upon South Korea to follow it, and massively beefed up the U.S. forces of aggression and staged war exercises of various forms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. formally declared its withdrawal from the ABM treaty on December 13 last year and carried out a series of tests for the Missile Defence System (MD). It did not bother to commit such a high-handed practice as placing national laws above international laws. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In late March last year, it formally refused to implement the \"Kyoto Protocol\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It made accusations against many other countries and interfered in their internal affairs as part of pressure upon them by applying its own \"human rights standards\" and \"religious law\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration's hard-line foreign policy failed, throwing the U.S. into the abyss of international isolation and frustration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The upbeat U.S. worked hard to play the role of a world leader but failed to lead the trend of the international situation as it wished last year. And its efforts to stem the trend of multi-polarization also proved futile. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its withdrawal from the ABM treaty and moves for MD were protested and denounced by many countries. Despite of the U.S. refusal to implement the \"Kyoto Protocol\" a series of advances were made in its fulfilment thanks to the efforts on the part of EU countries and other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In may last the U.S. was unseated in the U.N. human rights organization and the U.N. drug control organization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A resolution against the U.S. sanctions toward Cuba was adopted at the 56th UN General Assembly with the approval of 167 countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. persistently pursues its policy of hegemony and domination going against the trend of the era and the aspiration of humankind in the new century, it will not be able to escape from international isolation and destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the main point in the review of the U.S. foreign policy of aggression last year.     \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA on \"missile threat\" \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 11 (KCNA) -- The United States reportedly set up a special missile unit allegedly to protect its forces in South Korea and the South Korean army from \"missile threat\" of the DPRK.\r\n This dangerous development once again fully betrays the trite method employed by the U.S. for beefing up its forces under the absurd pretext of \"threat\" from others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is well known that the U.S. is ridiculed and criticized by the international community for pushing forward its moves to establish the dangerous \"Missile Defence\" System (MD) on the plea of \"missile threat\" from small countries including the DPRK. The U.S. creation of a special missile unit in defiance of world opinion shows how incoherently the U.S. is behaving before the world community after the end of the cold war, styling itself as the \"only one superpower.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is the arch criminal posing a real missile threat in the world at the moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No independent sovereign country has ever threatened the U.S. with its missiles unless the latter made a preemptive strike at the former. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This notwithstanding, the U.S. is going ahead with the MD under the pretext of the \"missile threat\" from other countries though it is the world's biggest possessor of missiles. Not content with this, Washington set up even a special missile unit on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is one more outright provocation to the DPRK and a criminal move to disturb the strategic stability on the Korean peninsula and in the Asia-Pacific region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. design to inveigle South Korea into the special missile unit is heightening the Korean people's vigilance as it is a wicked criminal intention to aggravate the inter-Korean relations and block the reunification of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK, considering the recent creation of the special missile unit as an unpardonable challenge, will channel more efforts into increasing its capabilities for self-defence.    \r\n\r\n"
