            "content": "Rodong Sinmun comenta disparates de Lee Myung Bak \r\nPyongyang, 13 de julio (ATCC) -- Hace poco, en la \"ceremonia inaugural\" del 14o periodo del \"Consejo Consultivo por la Democracia y la Reunificacion Pacifica\", el traidor Lee Myung Bak volvio a insultar a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea con unas palabras rutinarias como \"provocacion\" y \"amenaza\". \n\t\t\t\t\t  Insatisfecho con esto, dijo absurdamente que \"aunque fuera dificil y paulatino, arreglaria las relaciones Sur-Norte\" y que \"el Norte no deberia empeorar por mas tiempo la situacion\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En un comentario individual difundido este lunes, el diario Rodong Sinmun califica ese discurso frivolo del traidor Lee de ultimo esfuerzo desesperado por eludir la responsabilidad por el empeoramiento de las relaciones Norte-Sur y de sofisteria descarada que distorsiona la realidad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El traidor Lee, que persigue la division nacional y los intereses de un punado de los vendepatrias, no tiene ni la minima calificacion para hablar de las relaciones Norte-Sur ni tiene la voluntad de desarrollarlas, senala el comentarista y continua: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Si el traidor Lee no hubiera negado las declaraciones conjuntas Norte-Sur y su espiritu ni politizado la confrontacion fratricida, las relaciones intercoreanas, que se desarrollaban favorablemente, no se habrian caido en la coyuntura tan critica de hoy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En realidad, la banda del traidor Lee declaro la participacion total en la \"Iniciativa de Seguridad contra la Proliferacion (PSI en ingles)\" cuestionando el ejercicio de derechos soberanos por parte de la RPDC, y se pone al frente de la campana internacional para aplicar la \"sancion\" contra ella en contubernio con las fuerzas extranjeras. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El traidor Lee nunca podra ocultar sus artimanas anti-reunificacion y su ambicion de enfrentarse con la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Aunque el fuera maestro en imputar a otros las responsabilidades, no podra hacerlo en el caso de la ruptura total de las relaciones intercoreanas y la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana al borde de la guerra."
