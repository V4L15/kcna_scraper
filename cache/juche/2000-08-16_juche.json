He always stood at the head of the fighters and personally commanded all operations and battles with superb tactics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the first half of the 1940s he made historic speech \"on preparing for the great event of national liberation,\" set forth new fighting guidelines to successfully fulfil strategic tasks and wisely led the struggle to implement them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As the great event of national liberation drew near, he pushed ahead with preparations for all-people resistance against Japanese. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   On August 9, Juche 34 (1945) the President issued an order to all the units of the KPRA to launch a final attack for national liberation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The KPRA units broke through fortresses on the borderline which the Japanese imperialists advertised as \"impregnable defence lines,\" liberating vast areas of the homeland. They were joined by small units and political operatives of the revolutionary army and people's armed contingents and broad masses of people across the country who stormed into ruling machines of the enemy and wiped out remnants of the defeated army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese imperialists, badly beaten by fierce attacks of the KPRA units and all-people resistance, declared an unconditional surrender on August 15, Juche 34 (1945), one week after the start of the anti-Japanese operation to liberate Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people were thus finally liberated from the Japanese who kept Korea under their military occupation for nearly half a century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The victory in the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle saved the Korean people from the crisis of life or death, brought them the sovereignty of the nation and independence of the country and enabled the popular masses to emerge as masters of new Korea. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan warned against tampering with history \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, August 16 (KCNA) -- A \"Society for New History Textbook\" made up of Japanese ultra-right elements compiled a history textbook in which they described aggression of Asia by the Japanese imperialists as a \"national liberation war in Asia\" and a war for \"self-defence\" and submitted it to the Ministry of Education for its examination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The textbook praised the aggression of Asia as a \"praiseworthy deed\" which instilled \"dream\" and \"courage\" to win independence into the peoples of south Asia, India and Africa. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary dismisses the Japanese imperialists' past aggression of Asia as a never-to-be-pardoned crime which no one can deny. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their description of the aggression as a \"liberation war\" and an act which instilled \"dream\" of independence into the peoples is an outright challenge to the international justice and human conscience, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The world calls for fully redeeming aggression and other war crimes committed in the present century before greeting a new century. However, Japanese reactionaries are totally negating their history of aggression instead of swimming with the trend of the times and behaving, as guided by human conscience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What is more serious is that they intend to awaken the younger generation to war of aggression and hurl them into overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese ultra-right reactionaries' farce of editing the twisted history book can never be pardoned as it is a revelation of their ambition for aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Negation of history leads to national ruin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the Japanese reactionaries negate their history of aggression and embark upon overseas invasion again, they will meet only self-destruction. \r\n\r\n"
