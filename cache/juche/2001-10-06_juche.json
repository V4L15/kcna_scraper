This is a legitimate right of a country and nation advocating independence and a mode of independent counter-action to emerge victorious in the confrontation with imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world progressives will strengthen the force of justice and wage a strenuous anti-imperialist struggle under the banner of independence to powerfully advance the human cause of independence, the cause of peace, and build a new, free and peaceful world without fail.    \r\n\r\n"

This is the unanimous and unbiased comment of the world public. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the IAEA decided to verify and inspects the nuclear facilities of the DPRK, not the U.S. This eloquently proves that the IAEA is applying double standards, dancing to the tune of others after departing from the principle of justice and impartiality in its activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a matter of fact, some dishonest elements of the IAEA are acting upon the script written by the united states, pursuant to its policy, in a bid to make \"nuclear threat\" from the DPRK an established fact. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is needless to say that this unjust stand will only result in crippling the international community's confidence in the IAEA and inviting strong worldwide protest and denunciation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will certainly make the IAEA pay a high price for persistently urging the DPRK to accept verification and inspection while uttering not a word about the U.S. which continues conducting nuclear tests in wanton violation of international conventions.    \r\n\r\n"
