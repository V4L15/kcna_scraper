Paek in Hamju county, South Hamgyong Province, and empties into the sea off Jongphyong county. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The construction of the dam caused a big lake to appear on the upper reaches of the river, making it possible to supply sufficient water to more than 4,500 hectares of paddy and non-paddy fields and generate much electricity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The electricity to be generated by the power station where equipment assembling is being stepped up at the final stage and the power stations whose construction is now under way down it would be enough to provide lighting to the dwelling houses, operate local industrial factories in the county and ensure the heating of dwelling houses for more than 3,000 families in the township. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Efforts are made to decrease the width of the river so as to put more than 500 hectares of land under the plough, turn the lake into a fish farm and build the area into a holiday resort. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The county is building an excursion boat for the pleasant rest of working people.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
