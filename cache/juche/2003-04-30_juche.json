            "content": "U.S. urged to stop anti-DPRK smear campaign \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 29 (KCNA) -- The further the U.S. intensifies its anti-DPRK smear campaign and escalates its moves to stifle the DPRK, the more actively the DPRK will increase its physical deterrent force, says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose forces are now blustering that there is increasing nuclear and missile threats from the DPRK, describing it as a factor of threatening world stability. They went so far as to say that the DPRK's economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These remarks reflect the uneasiness and fret of the U.S. reactionary rulers over the ever-growing might of the DPRK and the rapid decline of the U.S. and betrays their foolish attempt to put the brake on the drive in the DPRK to build a great prosperous socialist power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By resorting to the anti-DPRK campaign the U.S. warhawks try to build up public opinion in a bid to hype the danger of nuclear and missile threats from the DPRK, step up arms buildup for world domination under this pretext and put into practice its strategy for a preemptive military attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK remains unfazed in ideological, political, economic and military aspects. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. wishes to see the economy of the DPRK going bankrupt. But it is a pipe dream. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not in the DPRK but in the U.S. that the economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The American warhawks are seeking to find a way out of their serious economic crisis in aggression and war and in their smear campaign against progressive countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Needless to say, the U.S. imperialists' smear campaign against the DPRK is a product of this war hysteria. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As evidenced by the Iraqi war, the U.S. smear campaign is always followed by a military action for aggression. The Iraqi war gives a lesson that there should be only a strong physical deterrent force in order to avert a war and defend the security of the country and the sovereignty of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should clearly understand who is its opponent and stop its foolish anti-DPRK smear campaign.    \r\n\r\n"

Invincible is the Korean-style socialist system in which the leader, the army and people form a harmonious whole. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has not only the great single-hearted unity but the national defence capacity strong enough to repel the U.S. aggression at one swoop. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no need for the DPRK to have its system recognized by the other as it represents the will of its people and is supported by the Songun political mode. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should know this before anything else. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The American hawks are well-advised to ponder over the grave consequences to be entailed by its confrontation with the DPRK before making any analysis.    \r\n\r\n"

Meanwhile, an anti-DPRK campaign has become undisguised in South Korea, he noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, he said, under the present situation there is no more urgent task than to reject the unilateral strong-arm action of foreign forces, defend the dignity and sovereignty of the nation and prevent the danger of war and protect peace of the country by the united efforts of all the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historic June 15 joint declaration is a landmark for reunification common to the nation which was provided by the top leaders of the north and the south of Korea and has been confirmed in practice, he said, and stressed: the joint declaration based on the idea \"by our nation itself\" should be carried forward and implemented to the letter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then, he set forth the north side's proposal with a view to taking practical measures. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The proposal called for reaffirming the basic spirit of the June 15 joint declaration and confirming again before the whole nation their will to implement the declaration. It also called for discontinuing TV broadcasting against each other and radio propaganda in the areas along the demarcation line. The north side suggested the authorities of both sides to push ahead with the June 15 Grand Festival for National Reunification this year, which has already been agreed upon and is now being prepared at a non-governmental level and regularize it as a bigger festival attended by the authorities as well as non-governmental organizations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was also proposed that both sides should significantly hold ground-breaking ceremonies for connecting rail and road links in the east and west coastal areas and for the construction of the Kaesong Industrial Zone before the third anniversary of the joint declaration. The proposal called on the authorities of the north and the south to push ahead in a responsible manner with a ground-breaking ceremony for the construction of a reunion centre for separated families and relatives in Mt. Kumgang, which the red cross organizations of both sides had agreed to push, so that the ceremony may take place at an early date. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He also proposed to decide as soon as possible on the passage of each side's civilian ships through each side's territorial waters which both sides had agreed to push forward and on the south side fishermen's use of part of the north side's fishing ground in the east sea, and consult and settle the measures to press forward tour of Mt. Kumgang and other ongoing economic cooperation between non-governmental organizations of both sides. It was proposed that the south side should take a responsible step to ensure smooth progress of a series of projects the north side's Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee had agreed with the south side's Hyundai Asan to carry out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the talks, Jong Se Hyon made an address clarifying the south side's stand on the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The talks continue.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It dispatched many warships to the Indian Ocean and other parts of the world in a bid to realize its ambitions for the revival of militarism and overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is staging the in-flight refuelling exercise with the U.S., the first of its kind in the history of the SDF, in a bid to increase its air SDF's capability for a long-distance operation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This goes to prove that Japan has also chosen the sky as theatre for an overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This also proves that Japan is going to use its air SDF as main attack means for its overseas expansion following the example of the U.S. which considers an aerial attack operation as a main strategy in fighting the war of aggression in Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan, which has advocated an \"exclusive defence\" for its peace and security since its defeat in world war ii, is stretching out its tentacles of overseas invasion not only on the sea but in the sky after throwing off that spurious signboard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTherefore, it is not hard to guess what a dangerous phase Japan's reckless moves for its military domination over Asia have reached. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is by no means fortuitous that the Japan Defence Agency is in the process of fundamentally reexamining its basic \"plan for defence capability\" for a dramatic switchover from the \"exclusive defence\" and political figures let loose one after another war outcries \"it is essential for Japan to leave the nuclear deterrence to the united states and let the SDF to cope with other forms of attack than nuclear assault.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has no option but to boost its self-defence capability and its physical deterrent force in the light of the facts that the chief aim the Japanese reactionaries are seeking in its overseas expansion and its moves to turn Japan into a military power under the pretext of Japan-U.S. \"cooperation\" and \"anti-terrorism war\" is to stage a comeback to Korea and they are becoming evermore undisguised in their very disturbing military moves presupposing an \"emergency\" on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reckless attempt of the Japanese reactionaries to realize their ambition for overseas expansion at all costs, backed by the U.S., is bound to go awry as they are fated to face a stern judgment by history.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
