The GNP gentries unhesitatingly sacrificed their fellow countrymen for the sake of maintaining their fascist dictatorship and staying in power, a despicable political ambition, generation after generation. This group of criminals can hardly be found in any other parts of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP is an ill-famed stronghold of fascist dictatorship as it has recorded decades-long history with fascism and dictatorship and hideous human rights abuses.\r\n In fact, the above-said crimes are just a tip of iceberg of indelible crimes the GNP gentries have committed against history and the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These human rights abuses are still going on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP gentries are playing all sorts of tricks in a bid to realize their wild ambition to return to power, talking about \"public welfare\" and \"policy for the people\". But with no high-sounding words can they whitewash their hands and feet stained with the blood of the people or cover up their dirty true colors as thrice-cursed criminals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There can be no statute of limitations for the GNP which has such crime-woven history behind it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people from all walks of life should force the GNP to pay a thousand-fold price for the blood shed by them and bring it to the court of history.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
