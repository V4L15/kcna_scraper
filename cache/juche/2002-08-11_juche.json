Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 11 (KCNA) -- The Catholic Measure Committee For the Correct Solution Of the Case Of Killing of Schoolgirls By the U.S. Armored Car reportedly issued a 1,000-member declaration on Wednesday demanding the just settlement of the case.\r\n The declaration charged that the U.S. Forces' side took an arrogant attitude towards the demand for the transfer of jurisdiction, asserting that the accident occurred while GIs were on duty and there was no precedent of giving up jurisdiction. It accused the Defense Ministry and the prosecution authorities of south Korea of supporting the stand of the U.S. Forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that this behaviour clearly indicates the growing inequality and master-servant relations between the U.S. and South Korea, the declaration demanded the U.S. and the south Korean authorities totally revise the shackling status of forces agreement.     \r\n\r\n"

Korea assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, August 11 (KCNA) -- The headquarters of the people's movement for the withdrawal of U.S. troops reportedly said that those calling for the U.S. troops' continued presence in south Korea should be condemned as an enemy of the Korean nation.\r\n The organization in a special statement Wednesday questioned why politicians including Ri Hoe Chang are siding with the U.S. Forces who refuse to transfer criminal jurisdiction though GIs deliberately drove an armoured car over schoolgirls to death and for what Chosun Ilbo is. The statement equated the quasi-peace activists calling for the continued presence of the U.S. troops in south Korea with the same criminals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should clearly show the U.S. Forces and their followers what will happen when we get angry, statement warned, noting that the headquarters declared a war against the U.S. Forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the evening at least 300 students affiliated to the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils staged a surprise demonstration at an intersection in front of the Lotte department store in Seoul, denouncing the U.S. troops for their murder case.     \r\n\r\n"
