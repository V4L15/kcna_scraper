He repeatedly praised commanding officers of the unit for providing ample conditions for the diet of its servicemen by paying deep attention to the supply service. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then he went round the Unjong Health Complex built by the unit itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While he was inspecting welfare service and catering facilities, no details escaped him, ranging from the quantity and quality of bread and noodle to the temperature of the bath. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was greatly satisfied to learn that the unit has built an excellent service complex for the soldiers by fully displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the unit has done really good for the soldiers, he said this is a proud and beautiful trait which can be displayed only by the Korean People's Army that has carried forward the brilliant traditions of the anti-Japanese guerrilla army whose commanding officers looked after its soldiers with loving care as they would do their real brothers and sisters and which always emerged victorious thanks to the noble sense of comradely obligation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He highly praised its success, urging the whole army to earnestly follow the example set by them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He enjoyed a performance given by an art squad of the unit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Greatly satisfied with the performance with a high ideological and artistic value, he highly appreciated their success made in the presentation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He had a photograph taken with servicepersons of the unit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by Kim Yong Chun, chief of the general staff of the KPA.     \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. new plan for nuclear attack under fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 14 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK Wednesday issued a statement denouncing the U.S. for its new plan for nuclear attack.\r\n He said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the recent U.S. press reports, the Bush administration singled out at least seven nations: Russia, China, the DPRK, Syria, Libya, Iran and Iraq as the targets of its nuclear attack and decided to develop smaller tactical nuclear weapons for \"limited nuclear attack.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is said to have worked up the plan in a bid to attack underground targets that cannot be destroyed with conventional weapons and carry out retaliatory attacks against biological or chemical weapons and cope with surprising military developments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration has stunned the world with its wild ambition and reckless attempt to dominate the world since its emergence. If this plan turns out to be true, this will indicate that it has backpedalled its commitment to the nonuse of nukes, which was honored by its preceding administrations, as a pair of old shoes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already known, at the 1978 UN special session on disarmament at which nuclear weapons states committed themselves not to use nukes against nonnuclear states, the U.S. issued a policy statement that \"It would not use nuclear weapons against nonnuclear states unless they were allied with nuclear powers to assault the U.S. and its allies\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This has been a fundamental basis on which all international agreements on nuclear disarmament including the nonproliferation treaty have been implemented and preserved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In case of the DPRK, in particular, the U.S. gave specific assurances in the 1993 DPRK-U.S. joint statement and the 1994 DPRK-U.S. agreed framework that \"it would not use nuclear weapons against and threaten the DPRK with them.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Based on these assurances, the DPRK has sincerely fulfilled over the last eight years its commitments under the agreed framework aimed at the improved DPRK-U.S. relations, its keynote being the U.S. provision of lwrs to the DPRK in return for the freeze of its nuclear facilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the Bush administration's recently disclosed plan for nuclear attack indicates that it is seeking to dominate the world only by force of arms in violation of any international agreement and keen to mount nuclear attacks on any country it considers as a hindrance to it, even overturning bilateral agreements. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite natural that the world is greatly shocked and concerned about the fact that the Bush-ruled U.S. is lording it over as a rogue nuclear state with which the peace-loving people cannot co-exist. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush group's plan for a nuclear attack is a daydream of the reckless persons who do not hesitate to stifle the DPRK even by using nuclear weapons and, to this end, eliminate the whole Korean nation from the earth by inflicting a nuclear disaster upon it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that nuclear lunatics are in office in the white house, we are compelled to examine all the agreements with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In case the U.S. plan for a nuclear attack on the DPRK turns out to be true, the DPRK will have no option but to take a substantial countermeasure against it, not bound to any DPRK-U.S. agreement.     \r\n\r\n"
