He made sure that the preparatory committee for the congress undertook this work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   When the first badge was made,  Kim Jong Il had it on his chest before any others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At that time  he said that  one should have the badge on his heart, not on the right side of his chest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Badges thus produced were awarded to the delegates to the congress before its opening. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people have since worn the badges on their chests, regarding it as their greatest pride and happiness to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   President Kim Il Sung  always lives in the hearts of the Korean people as he represents their idea, faith, destiny and future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   That is why people unhesitatingly dedicate even their lives to protecting  the badge from any danger. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There are many examples showing how people protected badges bearing the President's Portrait from fire and water. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn March last year 17 soldiers of the Korean People's Army died heroic deaths while protecting slogan bearing trees from an unexpected forest fire in a revolutionary site. They became heroes of the republic. In November of the same year 3 fishermen  and 12 soldiers who had been adrift in the stormy sea because of an engine trouble  kept the badges safe before meeting deaths. The title of the hero of the republic was posthumously awarded to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This shows the unshakable will of the Korean people to devotedly General Secretary Kim Jong Il, who is just like President Kim Il Sung.\r\n\r\n"
