On the contrary, they are getting overheated in the moves to distort history and stage a comeback to Korea in a bid to realize their old dream of the \"Greater East Asia co-prosperity sphere\" at any cost, the statement said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is an outrageous challenge to the whole Korean nation, the victim, and the international community, and it is an intolerable encroachment upon the Korean nation's dignity and sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the conservative ruling quarters of south Korea, including Lee Myung Bak, are zealously following the Japanese reactionaries' policy for reinvasion, letting loose a spate of such reckless remarks as \"restoration of south Korea-Japan relations\" and \"forward-looking ties.\" This is a heinous treachery intended to trample down the national dignity and interests and impose upon the Korean nation again the disgrace and disaster it suffered a century ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement urged Japan to immediately make an apology and reparation for the crimes committed against the Korean nation and stop at once the reinvasion moves. It also demanded that the south Korean conservative ruling quarters clearly see the desire of the nation and the trend of the times and stop their rash acts.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
