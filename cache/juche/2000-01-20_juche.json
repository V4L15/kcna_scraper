            "content": "Work of preserving Juche character and national character \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, January 20 (KCNA) -- Korea will render greater depth to the work of preserving the Juche character and national character of the revolution and construction this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Maintaining the Juche character means that the popular masses shape the destiny of their country and nation independently and creatively as the masters of their destiny. Sustaining the national character means preserving and developing the good qualities of the nation and embodying them in all spheres of social life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the consistent position of the Worker's Party of Korea to establish Juche and sustain the national character in the revolution and construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The joint New Year editorial of the newspapers of the party, army and youth calls for living our own way and pushing ahead with socialist construction in the Korean-nation-first spirit that our leader, our party and our nation are best and our socialist system is best whatever others may say. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In response to the editorial, the Korean people and army are now firmly defending the political system and economic structure of Korean style and Korean way of life, smashing the imperialists' moves for \"globalization\" with a stiff attitude toward their policy of strength and with the revolutionary principle to react to their carrot strategy.   It is the President Kim Il Sung's mode of making revolution to work out and embody lines and policies in keeping with the requirements and specific conditions of the Korean revolution, rejecting flunkeyism and dogmatism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He set forth  the line of the anti-Japanese armed struggle, the line of the party building, the line of building armed forces, the line of building people's government, the line of socialist construction, the line of building self-supporting national economy and other Juche-based lines and policies in all fields and led the Korean revolution along the road of victory. The \"10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the country\" advanced by him is based on love for the country and the spirit of national independence to achieve national reunification with the united strength of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The great leader Kim Jong Il in his works, including \"Socialism Is A Science\" and \"On Preserving the Juche Character and National Character of the Revolution and Construction\", clarified that the Juche character and the national character are the life and soul of the Korean revolution and he is defending the sovereignty of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people are now waging a dynamic drive to bring about a new turning point in all political, economic, military, educational, public health, literary and art and sports fields, so as to preserve the Juche character and the national character in all sectors of the revolution and construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They are also giving full play to the good national character in spoken and written language, morality and cultural life and entertainment. \r\n\r\n"

They were crimes against humanity, a most wanton  violation of the publicly recognized international treaty and wartime regulations which ban targeting non-combatants. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Progressive humankind who truly love peace and respect human rights and the world conscience should brand GIs' unheard-of massacres during the Korean war as crimes against humanity and bitterly denounce them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Moreover, the united nations should make a thoroughgoing investigation into massacres committed by GIs in Korea in the name of the \"UN forces\" by abusing its flag, punish those responsible for them under the international law, take a step to immediately dismantle the South Korea-based \"UN command\" having disgraceful records of massacres and thus remove the inglorious mark left in its history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Nazi war criminals who gave inhuman treatment to Europeans and Jews and killed them during World War II have been chased and punished till now. If the massacres committed by the United States during the Korean war are to be overlooked for being a \"superpower\", this will be a negation of the \"universality of human rights\" and most unacceptable double standards. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Now the United States which tops the list of human rights abuses styles itself a \"judge of human rights,\" talking about \"defence of human rights\" more noisily than any others. Worse still, it is encroaching upon even the sovereignty of independent states as it wishes, insisting that human rights are above state sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   No one can predict what massacres will be committed in the future if the United States is allowed to continue such atrocities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Not only the United Nations and all other international organizations but also governmental and non-governmental human rights and judicial organizations and groups should render positive cooperation in the efforts to fully probe the truth behind the mass killings of civilians committed by the United States and its followers the South Korean authorities during the Korean war so that such genocide in the 20th century may not be repeated in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We will always remember the shocking massacres committed by the U.S. against innocent Koreans during the last Korean war and before and after it and make it pay dearly for such atrocities.\r\n\r\n"
