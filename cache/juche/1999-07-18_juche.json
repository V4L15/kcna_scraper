            "content": "\"Gossip on war outbreak in July\" in S. Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 18 (KCNA) -- A rumour is now going round towns in South Korea that \"gossip on war outbreak in July is not a false one but an established theory,\" Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation reported.\r\n   A high-ranking official at the \"Defense Ministry\" of South Korea said that think-tanks of the \"ROK-U.S. combined forces command\" recently worked out a detailed plan for putting into practice \"operation plan 5027-98\", a scenario of second Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp \r\n   In the detailed plan, July is fixed as time of war outbreak because of the following conditions: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp \r\n   Firstly, armed forces involved in the Yugoslav war which was ended, have been moved to South Korea and its surrounding areas and South Korea-U.S.-Japan military integration has been perfected in view of law and action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp \r\n   Secondly, a situation that may lead to a powerful struggle reminiscent of the strong strikes of workers in July-September 1987 may be repeated in July due to massive layoff and the case of \"inducement to strike at the mint company,\" while collisions between ruling and opposition camps are going from bad to worse after scandals including \"suspected bribe of high-quality clothes\" were disclosed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp \r\n   In the long run, a way out of such worst crisis is urgently needed for the Kim Dae Jung regime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp \r\n   Thirdly, the north is expected to testfire \"multi-stage ballistic missile\" in July, which might be used as a good excuse to justify the war against the north.\r\n   According to the plan, anti-north military provocations will be made on the demarcation line at sea and in the vicinity of the truce line to let the north take self-defensive actions, and then allout attacks will be launched under such pretext.   Involved in the attacks all at once will be one million-strong \"ROK Army,\" of three services 40,000 U.S. troops in South Korea and hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops based in Guam island, Japan and other Asian areas as well as units from the U.S. mainland. And use of tactical nuclear and chemical weapons will not be ruled out if the attacks fail in face of the north's strong counteractions and they are counterattacked. Japan's \"Self-Defense Forces,\" too, will be put to active use in case of \"emergency,\" it says. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp \r\n   As this secret is leaked out, the authorities of South Korea, the U.S. and Japan are trying to find out the source of its leakage, busying themselves in building up public opinion that \"gossip on war outbreak in July is a false report.\"    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japanese reactionaries' infantile behaviour under fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 18 (KCNA) -- The Japanese reactionaries, who are accustomed to doing harm to others whenever an opportunity presents itself, are covetous of the leading position of the united nations with a little money. Indeed, they are most infantile and shameless in the world, says Minju Joson in a commentary today.\r\n   Some days ago, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official, when meeting with the U.N. Secretary General, reeled off complaints that Japan's wish has been ignored in defiance of its donation of large amounts of money to the U.N., which  only put him to shame, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp \r\n   Japan is under fire everywhere  because it is making a lot of baloney bereft of reason. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp \r\n   Japan is a criminal state that committed all sorts of crimes in the second world war. It is a pressing task for Japan to clear herself of the \"enemy state\" at an earlier date and, to this end, make full compensations for the past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp \r\n   But, Japan has been turning blind eyes to the unanimous demands of the international community that Japan frankly admit its past crimes and apologize for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp \r\n   The international community can not do honour to Japan which makes a boast of money while taking the road of militarism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp \r\n   The Japanese reactionaries are well advised to do what they should before reproaching others.     \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Warmonger's reckless utterances\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 18 (KCNA) -- Jo Song Thae, South Korean \"Minister of National Defence,\"  recently called for \"rounding off the posture to immediately react to reinvasion and provocation in the northern limit line,\" saying at the \"National Assembly\" that South Korea is establishing close \"cooperation system\" with the united states and Japan to prevent the \"relaunch of missile\" by someone and it is necessary to \"further strengthen the security posture\" although \"the relations between the north and the south are promoted\" by the \"engagement policy toward the north.\"\r\n   Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun today says his bellicose utterances are part of premiditated provocation moves to drive  the situation to the brink of war and a revelation of an intention to unleash a war against the north in league with outsiders in defiance of the nation's desire for peaceful reunification. \r\n   The news analyst says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp \r\n   The remarks of Jo Song Thae is a replica of the anti-north confrontation and war fever of the South Korean chief executive who during his tour to the United States  entreated it \"to allow South Korea's development of missile\" over the \"DPRK missile issue\" and asked for \"support\" to the \"engagement policy toward the north\".\r\n   Worse still, this is synchronizing with the introduction of aircraft carriers and huge armed forces into South Korea and its surroundings by the U.S. imperialists.\r\n   As long as the most heinous warmongers like Jo Song Thae is left intact, improvement of the relations between the north and the south and solution of the reunification issue can not be expected. Nor can nuclear holocaust upon the Korean nation by outsiders be prevented. Such warmonger should be removed immediately for the peace of the country and the security of the nation and for national reconciliation, unity and reunification.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"
