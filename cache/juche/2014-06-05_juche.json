They have gone the lengths of perpetrating such thrice-cursed crime as linking even bereaved families to \"north wind.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The provocative racket kicked up by the Park Geun Hye group against the DPRK with military gangsters and conservative forces involved are nothing but the last-ditch efforts made by those driven into a pretty fix. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Forsaken by the people due to its unpopular policy, the Park group is now finding itself in a bottomless quagmire due to the ferry disaster. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean people from all walks of life are now becoming evermore vocal demanding the \"resignation of Park Geun Hye.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group in the grip of the daily worsening ruling crisis is now seeking a way out of it in intensifying anti-DPRK conspiratorial and confrontation racket. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"North wind\" much touted by the group is a trite method it employs whenever its ruling crisis gets serious. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its \"north wind\" ruckus is as foolish an act as precipitating its self-destruction. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is too late for the Park group to save its miserable fate already sealed."
