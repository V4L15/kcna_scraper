            "content": "Bellicose remarks of U.S. war hawks\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, April 3 (KCNA) -- Some time ago, the U.S. conservatives, vociferating about intensified \"emergency measures\" to cope with \"contingencies on the Korean peninsula,\" replaced U.S. warships based in Sasebo, Japan, with up-to-dated ones, worked out a U.S.-South Korea \"plan for joint counteraction\" and staged a \"drill\" for evacuating American civilians from South Korea to Japan.   Commenting on this, a news analyst of Rodong Sinmun today says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that the United States has made it a fait accompli to start a war of aggression on the DPRK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What is all the more serious is the fact that a second Korean war of aggression planned by the U.S. will be a nuclear war.   The U.S. conservatives intend to stifle the DPRK through a nuclear war.   When the U.S. will unleash a nuclear war against the DPRK is a matter of time.   The DPRK and the United States are technically at war.   The belligerent relations between the DPRK and the U.S. cannot be avoided because the U.S. is getting frantic in their moves to stifle the DPRK through a nuclear war.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the will and faith of the Korean People's Army and people that they will win in any war with aggressors even if they attack the DPRK with nuclear and other modern lethal weapons.   If the U.S. conservatives defiantly choose a nuclear war, the DPRK will have no alternative but to take a countermeasure against it. In that case, the United States will be held wholly responsible for all consequences. \r\n\r\n"

On March 31, the present South Korean chief executive  spanned out such provocative remarks before brashest as talking about \"military adventurism\" and \"infiltration into sea\"  from the north and imprudently calling on navy \"to be fully prepared for sea defence, carrying forward admiral ri sun sin's  exploit in the defense of the country.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   On the following day, the \"Minister of National Defence\" and the newly-appointed \"naval chief of general staff\" at an inaugural ceremony for the \"naval chief of general staff\" echoed the agitation for confrontation made by the chief executive, while crying for \"national security\" and \"prosperity of the nation\".  It is imprudent and shameless, indeed,  for the South Korean war hawks to talk about \"defence of the country\" and \"prosperity of the nation\" and even  mention the name of a famous patriotic admiral of Korea in a bid to agitate for confrontation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Can the South Korean authorities have the face to talk about the \"country\" and the \"nation\" at a time when they are not in a position to properly exercise their political sovereignty and military prerogative after leaving South Korea to the tender mercy of the United States and other outside forces?    The famous patriotic admiral defended the sea of the country from the invasion of the Japanese aggressors at the risk of his life. These traitors, however, signed the submissive \"fishery accord\" whereby they sold off the very sea to the sworn enemy.  Do they have even an iota of national conscience and  any justification to dare pronounce the name of the  admiral?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their tongue-wagging inciting north-south confrontation by imprudently abusing the fighting exploits of the patriotic ancestors and the name of the nation is an insult to the Korean nation's history  of the struggle against outside forces and aggressions as well as a mockery and challenge to the entire nation in the north, south and abroad desirous of achieving national reunification through great national unity.   If the South Korean authorities truly have national conscience, they should demand the pullout of the outside aggression forces who have been stationed in South Korea for more than half a century and decisively drop the anti-national policy for north-south confrontation. \r\n  \r\n"

            "content": "Falsity of S. Korea's rigmarole about \"economic recovery\"\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, April 3 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today comes out with its commentator's article laying bare the falsity of the South Korean rulers' advertisement about \"recovery of economy.\"   The commentator says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their  advertisement about \"economic recovery\" is a 3rd-rate sophism to cover up their treacherous crimes in having plunged South Korea into an unprecedented politico-economic crisis and disorder.   Such a shameless rigmarole cannot go down with anyone at present.   Their advertisement is very fantastic and deceptive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the last one year, more than 53,000 companies have gone bankrupt, with the result that the production activities and circulation process of the economy have shrunk and the rate of economic growth has dropped down.   The prospect for the economy is gloomy.   Although South Korea desperately enforced a \"sacrifice exports policy,\" the volume of goods export in February showed a decrease of 16% over the same period of last year. This is the lowest-ever reduction rate in 14 years.   The mounting unemployment goes to eloquently show that the South Korean economy is on the verge of total bankruptcy.   Over 10,000 workers are losing their jobs on a daily average owing to the \"layoff\" and \"restructuring\" being forcibly enforced to meet the brigandish demands of the international monetary fund. As of March, the number of jobless people  reached 2.5 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Nevertheless, the South Korean authorities are impudently crying that \"the danger of financial crisis\" has been \"removed\" in South Korea with the increase of its  foreign exchange holdings and with \"its surplus in trade.\"   By and large, its foreign currency safes keep only money borrowed from other countries. To be concrete,  there are 28 billion dollars borrowed from the International Monetary Fund, the world bank and the Asian development bank, 4 billion dollars given by the United States  as security money for the right of the permanent presence of its aggression forces in South Korea and 3 billion dollars it received from Japan in reward for selling Tok Islet to the Japanese masters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"trade surplus\" did not come from regular goods export.   Goods export has dwindled with the total crisis of the comprador economy. As a result, import of raw and other materials and equipment showed a drastic decline, recording the \"trade surplus.\"   As of the end of January this year, South Korea's foreign debts ran into  176.7 billion dollars or an increase of 25 billion dollars as against the end of last year.   Even western mass media described the South Korean economy as \"a bubble economy,\" \"an earthworm wriggling in mud\" and \"an ailing cat being injected with the ringer's solution.\"    Nevertheless, the South Korean authorities are crying that such a colonial dependent economy has begun to make \"recovery.\"   Their advertisement is the height of shamelessness.   A rose cannot bloom in a ditch.   The catastrophic economic crisis of South Korea is unavoidable because it is a colonial economy which depends upon others for raw and other materials, fund and technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  As long as South Korea remains a colonial military base of the U.S. and the rulers persist in the flunkeyist and treacherous economic policies of dependence upon outside forces, its economy will never extricate itself from the catastrophic crisis.   The South Korean authorities are hurriedly floating the fiction of \"economic recovery\", motivated by a criminal intention to cover up the total bankruptcy of the economy, the offspring of their thrice-cursed crimes, calm down the anger of the people and thus maintain their power. \r\n\r\n"
