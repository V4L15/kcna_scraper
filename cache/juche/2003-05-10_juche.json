The imperialists are committing an armed invasion of sovereign states without hesitation under the pretext of anti-terrorism and dismantlement of mass destruction weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present situation requires the world people to have a powerful military deterrent force in order to prevent war and defend the security of a country. The Russian government and people are giving importance to military affair and strengthening military forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK-Russia friendship is daily consolidating in the new century after Kim Jong Il's visits to Russia and the far eastern region of Russia and meetings and talks between the top leaders of the two countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson stresses that the Korean people extend support and solidarity to the Russian government and people in their efforts to defend world peace and security and establish a just new world structure.    \r\n\r\n"

This way everyone should make a tangible contribution to advancing the movement for independent reunification. This will help tap the potentials of the nation and achieve at an early date the independent reunification by the concerted efforts of the nation. \r\n\r\n"
