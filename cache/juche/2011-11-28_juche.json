They have diverse war tactics and strategies capable of fighting any battles and aggression wars and their soldiers are physically well prepared.

This is the military and technological characteristics of the KPA.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the wise guidance of Kim Jong Il the Juche-based national defence industry has been bolstered, equipping the KPA with modern military hardware for making annihilating attacks on enemies and helping it lay a solid material and technological foundation for fighting modern and protracted wars.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If anyone dares provoke the DPRK, the KPA will obliterate the aggressors wherever they might be.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. would be well advised to understand its rival and drop the anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK.
