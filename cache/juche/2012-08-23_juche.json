He called for supplying food to them as prescribed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Seeing crabs among varieties of food under preparation at the kitchen, Kim Jong Un asked where they were caught, how they were cooked and what soldiers liked best. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un visited a salt farm operated by the company itself.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He looked round the fire position of the company to acquaint himself with the performance of its combat duty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He watched the fire position, combat and technical equipment and defence fortification associated with the footprints of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, giving precious instructions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He warmly encouraged the company's service personnel, telling them that they should join hands with their supreme commander, reunify the country without fail and eternally glorify the exploits performed by the generalissimos. He added he believed in the service personnel on the eastern front and reposed deep trust in the women revolutionaries defending a post on the front.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He walked the road leading to the post and asked how many persimmons the company gathered last year. Saying persimmons still look unripe, he said he would come again in a season when persimmons get ripe.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He spared time to watch a performance given by the company's art group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Put on the stage were such colorful numbers as chorus \"March of the Korean Youth\", narration and song \"General and Our Kamnamu  Company\", solo and pangchang \"Boundless Is Our Yearning\", sextet \"Our Leader Loved by People\" and group poem recital and chorus \"Let's Protect General Kim Jong Un with Our Lives\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He gave his big hands to congratulate them on their successful performance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un had a talk with the company's soldiers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He told them to set an example to be followed by the whole army by successfully making preparations for combat and conducting good art group activities. He called on them to keep themselves highly alerted in view of enemies' reckless maneuvers for a war of aggression and watch with high vigilance the enemies' moves. He ordered them to send the enemies to the bottom of the sea even if one of them intrudes into the territorial waters of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Reading the minds of the soldiers reluctant to part from him, he told them to stand by him one by one and had a photo taken with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the end of the photo session, he promised them to visit the company again and have a photo taken with its commander and political commissar who were absent in the photo session."

            "content": "CPRK Spokesman Seriously Warns S. Korean Puppet Group of Its Anti-DPRK Vituperations\r\n Pyongyang, August 23 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea gave the following answer to the question raised by KCNA on Thursday as regards a spate of vituperations let loose recently by the south Korean puppet group, taken aback by Supreme Commander Marshal Kim Jong Un's field  inspection of island defence detachments on the foremost front:\n\t\t\t\t\t Supreme Commander Kim Jong Un made a sudden field inspection of island defence detachments stationed in the biggest hotspot in the southernmost part of the southwest front at a grim time when a touch-and-go situation is prevailing owing to the U.S. imperialists and the puppet group of traitors' reckless moves for a war of aggression. This news is creating great sensation in south Korea and the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching enemy positions within hailing distance, he issued the following order: \"Should the enemy recklessly dare start firing, you should promptly deal deadly counter-blows at him, not confining the clash to a local war, and lead it to a great war for the country's reunification.\" This is a declaration of sure victory demonstrating the spirit, pluck and bravery of the brilliant commander born of Heaven and a great thunderbolt bringing heavy sledge hammers down on the heads of the sworn enemy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His inspection of the island defence detachments was the most transparent crystal of love for soldiers and people linked with the same intention and feelings, love for the younger generation and a striking demonstration of the harmonious whole in which all service personnel and people are single-mindedly united with him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The service personnel and the people of the DPRK, immensely moved and excited to hear the news of his inspection of the island defence detachments, are filled with the firm determination to annihilate the sworn enemy and achieve the historic victory in the great war for the country's reunification in hearty response to the combat order issued by the brilliant commander of Mt. Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists and the puppet warmongers are seized with extreme fear after pushing the situation on the Korean Peninsula to the danger of all-out war through their joint military drills for aggression. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat should not be overlooked is that the puppet confrontation maniacs, military warmongers and conservatives dared vociferate about \"provocation\", \"creation of tension\", \"propaganda and agitation\" and the like.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is no more than a reckless racket of those who are much upset by the sky-high spirit of the great brilliant commander of Mt. Paektu and the strong determination of all the service personnel and people of the DPRK to annihilate the enemy and the last-ditch efforts of those affected by persecution mania.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of traitors finally kicked off the large-scale war exercises for invading the DPRK in league with the U.S. despite the positive efforts of the DPRK and the strong opposition of the public at home and abroad for peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, bringing the dark clouds of a nuclear disaster to hang over it. Such being a hard fact, the group dared talk about someone's \"provocation\" and \"creation of tension\". It is, preposterous, indeed, and an unpardonable mockery of the whole Korean nation and public opinion at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such outbursts as \"remarks for closing ranks,\" \"ones for demonstration\" and \"propaganda and agitation\" let loose by the puppet group are nothing but base utterances defiling the unbreakable single-minded unity of the DPRK and a high degree of ideological and moral world of its army and people and revealing their ignorance of them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group let loose a spate of malignant invectives which can convince no one. This is aimed to play down even a bit sensation and shock sparked off by the field inspection of the island defence detachments and bring the confusion within it under control. It is, at the same time, no more than a ridiculous artifice to justify its reckless moves for confrontation and war and escape the ever- deepening internal and external isolation. But the puppet group is seriously mistaken if it thinks it can cover up its true colors as hideous confrontation maniac and warmongers, mislead public opinion and get rid of an abyss of ruin through such a dirty farce.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The service personnel and people of the DPRK are fully ready to launch decisive battles of justice for national reunification in hearty response to the combat order issued by the brilliant commander of Mt. Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ceaseless spate of invectives let loose by the group of traitors would only harden the will of the army and people of the DPRK to wipe out the confrontation maniacs to the last man.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As solemnly declared internally and externally, the DPRK will neither tolerate the reckless war maneuvers and provocations of the U.S. imperialists and the group of traitors nor miss the golden opportunity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The aggressors and provocateurs should clearly understand that the order to wage a war for national reunification has already been issued."

She called for putting an end to the group, asserting that all issues such as security, socio-economic development and eradication of poverty are linked with the group and the police, army and government should pool their efforts to rout it. She added if Nigeria makes efforts to eliminate the group, the U.S. will become a strong \"patron\" of it. Then the U.S. designated Boko Haram as an international terrorist organization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Boko Haram is an extreme Islamic group calling for enforcing the Islamic law in the whole areas of Nigeria while inciting hostility toward the Christians which account for 40 percent of its population.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Nigerian government has made ceaseless efforts to root out antagonism among tribes, a leftover of the colonial rule of the imperialists, achieve concord and protect the security of the state and its people's life and property from the crimes of extremist elements of the group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group is reported to have weakened due to the positive military actions of the government since 2009.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the stand of the present government that it can surely defuse the threat posed by the Boko Haram by itself.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the U.S. is working hard to internationalize the Boko Haram issue, an internal affair of Nigeria. This is another clear proof of the U.S. arrogant habit of meddling in other's affairs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nigerian President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan said the U.S. measure only helps elevate the group's status as extremists and embolden them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Nigerian ambassador to the U.S. noted that by putting the group on the list of international terrorist organizations the U.S. may attempt to use drone strikes at Nigeria under the pretext of striking Boko Haram's bases and members. He said \"We know from the experience of Afghanistan and Pakistan, such drones could lead to destruction of villages and people who are not directly involved in the activities of Boko Haram.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After all, the U.S. commitment to give \"support\" to Nigeria is one that the U.S. will not hesitate to commit indiscriminate air raids on Nigeria, a sovereign state under the signboard of \"anti-terrorist war\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Analysts are concerned that Nigeria, a major oil producer of the world which the U.S. has long eyed, may fall victim to the \"anti-terror war\", making the situation in Africa more complicated."
