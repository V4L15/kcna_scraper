Capitalism was restored in the former Soviet Union and a number of east European countries which had been building socialism, leading to the collapse of the socialist market. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This created difficulties in various sectors of the Korean economy such as bottlenecks in the purchase of raw and other materials and equipment and marketing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The imperialists lost no chance to impose every conceivable pressure and sanction upon the DPRK in a bid to isolate and stifle it.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   To make matters worse, the country has been hit hard by several years of natural disasters such as the worst flood and tidal wave in a hundred years. This adversely affected various sectors of the economy, rendering its conditions more difficult. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The year 1994 was the most painful year for the Korean people as they suffered the nation's greatest loss in the demise in July 1994 of the President Kim Il Sung acclaimed by them for the first time in the nation's history spanning thousands of years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Not only all the fellow countrymen but all the progressive people of the world were overcome with profound grief over his demise. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The world was concerned over the future of Korea standing at the crossroads of life and death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But Korea rose to the occasion as it was guided by the great leader Kim Jong Il possessed of iron will and matchless courage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK took such tough measures as declaring a semi-war state and withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency, thus repulsing the enemy's military pressure and \"nuclear inspection row\" and defending the dignity of the nation and socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It caught the world's admiration by accomplishing the cause of perpetuating the memory of President Kim Il Sung on the highest level in history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At a time when several countries were torn asunder because of antipathy and turmoil caused by ethnic conflicts and conflicting political views and religious belief, the DPRK achieved the single-hearted unity of the leader, the party and the people and launched a satellite relying on its strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This tremendous strength that demonstrated the majestic appearance of Kim Il Sung's Korea, originated from the faith and will of the Korean nation united close around the leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The situation in the DPRK in recent years was worse than that in the postwar period after the three-year war reduced everything to ashes in the 1950s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The production could not be kept going in every field of the economy due to the shortage of power, raw and other materials and equipment, making it impossible to meet even the needs for consumer goods. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The grain production in major granaries shrank by half or more over that in the average year due to severe natural calamities. This resulted in suspending regular food supply and increasing the number of the families depending on food substitute. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Thanks to the positive steps of the Worker's Party of Korea and the state, not a few successes have been made in the work to put the economy on a normal track and stabilize the people's living, but the economic situation and the people's living still remain difficult. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people, however, do not yield to these ceaseless difficulties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK has laid a foundation of eternal value guaranteeing the rosy future of the country and the nation despite the ordeals in the 1990s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is thanks to this foundation that the Korean people are putting spurs to the second grand Chollima march to build a prosperous powerful nation in the near future. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "S. Korean chief executive's hypocrisy \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 24 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary denounces the present South Korean chief executive for playing all sorts of tricks in a bid to placate the angry public. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Recently he talked the rubbish at a meeting that he would strive to \"improve the people's living\" and would \"not work for reunification,\" but make \"utmost efforts\" for an \"end to the Cold War\" and \"detente\" through reconciliation, cooperation and exchange in the remaining years of his office. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The commentary dismisses this as treacherous jargon of a fascist and anti-reunification element. It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is none other than the South Korean chief executive who brought about economic bankruptcy and put the people into the mire of the worst destitution with his treacherous policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   For all his talk about the \"improvement of living\" he can not cover up his crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His anti-reunification remarks proved to the world that he is a sworn enemy of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   No one will be taken in by his hypocritical talk meant to cover up his criminal nature. On the contrary, it convinced the South Korean people once again that the present chief executive is the traitor with whom they cannot live under the same sky. \r\n\r\n"
