As a result, there appeared a huge dam of eternal value on the upper reaches of the Jangja River flowing between high mountains. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They wound up the project to build a temporary drainageway in July, three months after the ground-breaking, which would have taken two years at an ordinary pace, in the wake of their successful completion of the project to build a cofferdam.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The dam ground digging and the ground concrete tamping were pushed forward simultaneously, making it possible to finish in a matter of just five months the amount of work to be done for several years and bringing the construction of the temporary drainageway and the dam ground digging to completion. This was a miraculous success unprecedented in the history of hydropower station construction.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGeneral Secretary Kim Jong Il visited the construction site in September, 2009 and called this high speed a new Chollima Speed, the Huichon Speed as it brought about a steady leap forward and innovations and a world-startling miracle.
