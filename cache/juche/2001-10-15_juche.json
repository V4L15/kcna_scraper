The damage is severer than what was done by previous natural disasters.\r\n The torrential rain that pounded Wonsan registered 411 mm, 15 times the average precipitation in the first ten days of October over the last 60 years of meteorological observation. It was struck by 114 mm of torrential rain between 03:00 and 05:00 on Oct. 10 and by 1.5 metre-high tidal wave between 05:00 and 06:00.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, strong wind of 18-20 m/s blew and 3 metre-high sea waves swept over breakwaters, flooding the land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This put Wonsan under 1-1.5 meter deep water and 30-50 cm deep silt in a moment.\r\n The tidal wave and torrential rain claimed hundreds of casualties and a huge loss of properties in Wonsan alone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to a preliminary estimate made as of Oct. 11, hundreds of industrial buildings were left submerged to make thousands of machines hardly operational. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Machines and other equipment, raw and other materials, finished goods, vehicles, etc. of industrial establishments in Wonsan including machine, chemical, garment and furniture factories were inundated or washed away. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the goods kept in the commercial and service sectors including wholesale houses and shops were either washed away or made useless by mud, rendering the people's living very difficult. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The damage done to the industrial sector is yet to be estimated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Wharf facilities were destroyed, scores of ships were either sunken or damaged and a lot of cargo was washed away. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Landslide and torrential rain pulled down or submerged houses for tens of thousands of families. Thousands of houses were totally destroyed to cause a big loss of family properties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Schools, hospitals, halls and other public buildings were also left inundated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The agricultural sector was also hard hit by this natural calamity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Sheaves of rice were washed away from thousands of hectares of paddy fields. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The sudden landslide and flood destroyed roads and bridges, totally suspending transportation and cutting off electricity supply and post and telecommunications.    \r\n\r\n"
