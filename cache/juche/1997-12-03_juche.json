If this principle is not kept, the rising generation cannot be brought up to be the pillars of the future and they will not distinguish between justice and injustice. \r\n   This is good both in view of the mission of educationist and in view of national reconciliation and unity.\r\n   As seen in the puppets' brutal suppression of educationists, the Kim Young Sam group are making desperate efforts to take the initiative in the forthcoming puppet Presidential election.  But it is a foolish act.    \r\n\r\n"

And, with the mobilization of riot police, they cracked down on a rally and demonstration of the university's students demanding their release.\r\n   The suppression is part of the puppets' efforts for arresting all of those who still remain in Hanchongryon and totally stamping out the students' activities for independence, democracy and reunification, said the bulletin.\r\n   It reveals Kim Young Sam's sinister intention to pull his regime from the worst ever crisis and ensure his safety in the future, it noted.\r\n   The bulletin urged the South Korean puppets to immediately release all the students arrested on unreasonable charges, the three leading members of the Student Council of Seoul National University included, and stop the fascist suppression of patriotic-minded students. \r\n  \r\n"
