They are committing monstrous excesses and extraterritorial arbitrariness in other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As long as imperialist aggressor forces are stationed in their country, the people can never live in peace but sustain misfortune and disasters.

            "content": "U.S. urged to renounce anti-DPRK policy \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 24 (KCNA) -- The United States should immediately give up the anti-reunification policy going against the desire of the Korean nation. Opposing Korean reunification is a brigandish act trampling down the rights of the Korean nation.\r\n Rodong Sinmun says this in a signed article on Tuesday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The daily goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since the June 15 joint declaration was adopted, the process of reconciliation and reunification has been invigorated on the Korean Peninsula, hailed at home and abroad. But the U.S., ignoring the good developments, has persistently pursued the policy of keeping the peninsula divided and fostering confrontation between the two halves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. policy of aggression on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has reached a dangerous stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., which already chilled the Korean nation's desire for reunification early this year by calling the DPRK a part of the \"axis of evil\", has challenged the Korean people, resorting to military strength against them. This year it staged the largest ever joint military manoeuvres, the combination of Rsoi and military drill dubbed Foal Eagle, and military exercises Ulji Focus Lens. It also worked out a plan for a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK. Some time ago, Bolton, undersecretary of state, made bellicose remarks against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In actuality, the U.S. threat of aggression and war moves have continued. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. conservatives' advertisement about \"threat from North Korea\" is non-existent and nonsense. The military tension on the Korean Peninsula has been caused by the U.S. therefore, disarmament on the peninsula is a matter to be solved smoothly along with the acceleration of the Korean reunification process after the termination of the U.S. anti-DPRK policy and the withdrawal of its troops from South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's arms reduction is neither a matter which needs the U.S. interference nor an issue which can be solved by its coercion. Such practice will only result in aggravating the situation.    \r\n\r\n"

That is why modern capitalism is facing a serious political and economic crisis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Imperialism cannot escape from a downfall because of the serious contradictions among imperialist powers. The aggravation of these contradictions is a natural product of the capitalist development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The contradictions among the imperialist countries also remain very serious. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A decadent material life, a poor mental and cultural life and a reactionary political life -- these are the main characteristic of modern capitalist society. A material life is one of the main spheres of human life. But this does not fully mean human life. A mental and cultural life and a political life are major aspects of human life like a material life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Capitalist system due to its class nature can neither eliminate inequality in the material life nor remove the imbalance between the increasing demand for a material life and the deteriorating mental and cultural life and between the popular masses' growing desire for independence and the worsening political life. This is the contradiction that cannot be settled under capitalism and it is, therefore, bound to go to ruin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The inevitable doom of imperialism finds a more striking manifestation in the bankrupt U.S. policy of strength.     \r\n\r\n"
