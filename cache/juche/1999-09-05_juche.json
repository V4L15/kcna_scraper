It is more important as the north suffering from difficulties won the marathon race which deserves inexhaustible strength and strongest will power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Jong Song Ok could win this victory by fighting with the same courage and grit as was displayed by General Secretary  Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is under the guidance of the Marshal that an unknown sportswoman has become a world-famous \"queen of marathon\" and Juche Korea and the Korean nation are shining all over the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Jong's spirit is the stamina of the indomitable DPRK, and her will is the temper of the courageous people in the north and her running speed is that of Juche Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Her victory clearly showed the world what great potentials the monolithic unity of the people in the north armed with the spirit of devotedly defending their leader has, he stressed. \r\n\r\n"

This was just patriotic deed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   However, the South Korean authorities raised a hue and cry over the \"secret visit to the north\" as soon as they arrived in Pyongyang, and issued the warrant of arrest for them in advance, charging them with \"enemy-benefiting\" and \"inspiration and praisal.\" They threatened to take \"legal actions\" against the visitors on the strength of the \"security law.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This clearly proves that with the notorious \" security law \" left intact neither pro-reunification patriotic activities nor independent non-governmental movement can be ensured in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   For the divided Korean nation the pro-reunification patriotic activities are an inalienable duty and right. The commentary calls for immediate release of the innocent pro-reunification patriots. \r\n\r\n"

They waged positive patriotic activities to strengthen the three-party solidarity among north, south and overseas  Koreans during their stay in the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The delegates of the south headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification and the \"National Alliance for Democracy and Reunification\" and the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils deserve praisal by all the fellow countrymen.  Their deed can not be incriminated in any case. It is the highest crime to suppress them,  describing their action as \"illegal.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean rulers are intensifying the suppression of pro-reunification patriots. They seek in this to foil the South Korean people's patriotic movement for reunification at any cost, keep the permanent division of the nation, gain the \"support\" from \"anti-communist\" conservatives and thus bridge over the present serious politico-economic crisis and finish \"term of office\" without difficulties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean rulers will turn to repentance of their crimes on behalf of the nation, though belatedly. They should stop the suppression of pro-reunification patriotic movement of the South Korean people and unconditionally release all illegally arrested pro-reunification patriots, including the delegates who visited Pyongyang and totally abrogate the \"security law.\"  \r\n\r\n"
