This despicable deed of the \"pro-reform conservative party\" makes the south Koreans shake with anger.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was none other than bosses of the non-Park faction who ran wild to help Park win \"presidency.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the outbreak of the \"Park Geun Hye-Choe Sun Sil scandal\" they were locked in dirty dog's fight to shift the blame to each other. At the end of it, they created so-called Parun Party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This act little short of painting crow white only reveals their intention to deceive the people as much as they please in the future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such guys are heaping praises on Ban who is censured as the second Park Geun Hye in a bid to ensure the conservative forces' stay in power. They are shouting \"victory\" and bluffing, expecting he would come to their fold for sure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be tolerated is that the group of \"pro-reform conservative party\" is insulting the people with such honey-coated words that \"there is expectation of the people for clean politics.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how often betes noires keen on grabbing power may change their party name through hypocritical farces, the Saenuri Party etched in the minds of the people as the pronoun of crimes can never be written off.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural that the south Korean public is deriding the party as a collection of those seeking their own ambitions and a group of remnants pursuing outdated policies, calling it bean paste-stained party, spit-stained party, cunning party, chameleon party and tricky party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the unanimous demand of the south Koreans that the worst shame and misfortune should not be allowed to repeat themselves due to the failure to eliminate the descendents of \"yusin\" and its remnants\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The breakaways from the Saenuri Party had better face justice themselves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The renaming of the above-said party is a tragicomedy showing the end of the conservative party."
