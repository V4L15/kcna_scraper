It is supported all around by two rows of 40 columns with a corridor in between. The inner-row columns are linked by screens, the partitions that could be moved up to a height for a larger space. The corridor is flanked by a backed railing. The columns are very thick for their height and carved with lotus patterns, and those at the four corners have tops shaped like a dragon's head in an imposing yet beautiful scene. The east house was built in 1663 but later burnt down, and rebuilt in 1888. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The inner house, the residence of the deputy magistrate, is 20.05 metres long and 4.6 wide and has columns with a double bracketing system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The hexagonal arbor was an archery ground for the soldiers defending the northwestern areas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This unit was severely damaged during the Korean War (1950-1953) but has since been restored to state. \r\n\r\n"

This cause of reunification will face ordeals and difficulties if their interference is connived at and allowed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Saying that it is the only way for national reunification to believe in the efforts of the nation and rely on them, the article continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean nation is fully capable of discussing and solving the issue of reunification with its own energy and wisdom. No matter how difficult and complicated the cause of national reunification may be, it can be accomplished if the 70 million fellow countrymen display all their patriotic enthusiasm and pool their wisdom and energies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Korea is sure to be reunified independently and peacefully when the north and the south sit face to face and discuss and solve all the problems related to the reunification true to the will and requirements of the nation on the basis of patriotism and in the spirit of national sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Reality goes to prove that the Korean nation is capable of solving any difficult problem when it pools its efforts for the nation from the nation-first stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is an invariable supreme principle to solve the issue of national reunification by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation responsible for it. Any attempt of the outside forces  to interfere in the internal affairs of the Korean nation should be categorically rejected in order to adhere to this principle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Any Korean aspiring after patriotism and reunification should swim with the strong trend towards independent reunification which has made a good start with the publication of the historic north-south joint declaration as a momentum. \r\n\r\n"
