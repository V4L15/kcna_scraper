This is a blatant challenge to the south Koreans in their struggle for independence against the U.S. and an unbearable insult to all Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The youth and students in south Korea should never pardon those forces who work with bloodshot eyes to stem the trend of the south Korean society towards independence, democracy and reunification while going mad with pro-U.S. and fascist acts, but mete out a stern judgment to them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

Leader  Kim Jong Il is a rare statesman who has strengthened the Korean women's movement and developed it to a higher stage to meet the requirements of the Songun era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under his care the Korean women have grown to be true woman revolutionaries and patriots steadfast in their faith in the Workers' Party of Korea, the leader and socialism and unfailingly loyal to the Songun cause of the Party. \r\nThey are powerfully rolling one of the two wheels of the revolution in the present general march of the Songun revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the women should cherish the immutable resolution always to defend the authority of Kim Jong Il in every way and share destiny with him to the last and the revolutionary view on life that joy, sorrow and ordeals are honor in following him by carrying forward the proud tradition of the Korean women in firmly defending and absolutely upholding the idea and line of President Kim Il Sung in the grim annals of the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean women should fully display their revolutionary stamina in upholding the Songun revolutionary leadership of the headquarters of the revolution with loyalty.

In this regard the Foreign Ministry of Russia issued a statement clarifying Russia's stand of opposing the interference of the third party in the issue of the territorial dispute between Russia and Japan.\r\n Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says: \r\n The \"joint statement\" clearly reflects Japan's crafty intention to meet its own interests by counting on the U.S., the third party, and putting pressure upon Russia over the issue. It is very improper for Japan to plug the third party into the issue of the bilateral relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is gravely mistaken to think that it can handle the territorial dispute with Russia in its favor by employing such a mean trick. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is unreasonable for the U.S., styling itself an \"international judge,\" to unilaterally side with Japan from a prejudiced stand while poking its nose into the Russia-Japan bilateral issue at the request of Tokyo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is in pursuance of its ulterior aim that the U.S. is impertinently interfering in the territorial dispute between Russia and Japan and unilaterally taking side with Tokyo, its junior ally, in a bid to internationalize it, hamstring the efforts for a fair solution to the bilateral issue and displease Moscow. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such act of the U.S. has something in common with its deliberate fabrication of the DPRK-U.S. nuclear issue with an aim to internationalize the issue and exploit it for toppling the system in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unreasonable interference in the Russia-Japan bilateral relations by the third party would only complicate the solution of the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and Japan had better handle the issue cool-headedly and stop rendering the Russia-Japan bilateral issue complicated.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
