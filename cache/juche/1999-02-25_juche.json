According to the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework, the U.S. is supposed to offer the DPRK Light Water Reactors with a total generating capacity of 2 million km by the year 2003 through the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Some media have recently said that the construction of LWR would be completed far beyond the year 2003.   Earlier, at the high-level expert's negotiation with the DPRK, the KEDO had unveiled an immediate timetable for the LWR project in which it promised to sign a basic contract with the major contractor toward the end of June and launch a full-scale project within 19 months since then, that is, in the year 2001 when the on-going readjustment of the site is completed.   Linking the announcement of the KEDO with the rumor,  it is becoming clearer that the construction of LWR would be completed later than originally scheduled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If that is true, it means the U.S. side's violation of the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework and items of the agreement on the supply of LWR. Accordingly, it cannot give but rise to serious matters.   In this connection, we consider it necessary to the U.S. side directly responsible for the supply of LWR to clarify its stand.   We will make relevant decisions according to it. \r\n \r\n"

Branding his dialogue as a jugglery of words and rhetoric aimed at covering up his crimes in having plunged the economy into total bankruptcy by enforcing policies dependent upon outsiders, the news analyst of the paper says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ridiculous is his rigmarole that South Korea \"has created a foundation to overcome financial crisis and make another economic leap forward.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean economy has been driven into a hopeless corner of total bankruptcy since the self-styled \"people's government\" came into existence: foreign debts have reached the astronomical figure, the economy recorded a double-digit \"minus growth rate,\" tens of thousands of enterprises closed down and the number of jobless people increased 4 times as compared with the days before the present regime came to power.\r\n   It is the South Korean economy that cannot exist even a moment without \"foreign relief funds.\"   Therefore, his utterances about \"another leap forward\" are utterly unreasonable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What are all the more preposterous are his remarks that \"introduction of foreign capital\" is the way for \"building an advanced economy.\"\r\n   The South Korean economy has been ruined owing to the \"introduction of foreign capital.\" The rulers borrowed a colossal amount of money from the International Monetary Fund to save the sagging economy. However, this introduction has resulted in multiplying foreign debts of South Korea.   The present condition of South Korean economy is so deplorable that the rulers cannot deceive people with any word juggling.   National independence is the only way to save the devastated South Korean economy.   If the South Korean authorities truly want \"economic recovery,\" they should rescind the policy of dependence upon outside forces and make a switchover to national independence. \r\n\r\n"

Any power politics and appeasement employed by the imperialists are impotent before his political faith.   Such statesmen as Kim Jong Il, who is confident in his political philosophy and strong in his political faith, are rare to be found in the present-day world political arena.   It is charm of Kim Jong Il as a great man that he is administering politics on the basis of single-hearted unity. The single-hearted unity is a peculiar weapon available only in Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   With the might of the single-hearted unity, Kim Jong Il has wrought miracles in socialist construction and firmly defended socialism from imperialist's aggression.
