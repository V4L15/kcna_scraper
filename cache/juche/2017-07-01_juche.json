Since then, it U.S. has sought a wild ambition for carrying out its policy for occupying the whole Korean peninsula and its strategy for securing hegemony throughout the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is resorting to the moves for intensifying the \"UN Command.\" This is definitely aimed to ignite the second Korean war and stifle the DPRK by force of arms under the signboard of the UN.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hypocrisy, fraud and deception are methods of existence peculiar to the imperialist hooligans.

It is just a blatant challenge to all Koreans aspiring after independence and setting store by peace and an unpardonable insult to the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is no justification for the \"UN Command\" to exist any longer. It should be dismantled in order to preserve peace and security on the Korean peninsula and in other parts of the Asia-Pacific and for the UN to save its face as an international body.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should immediately dissolve the worn-out and illegal \"UN Command\" and withdraw all its aggression forces and lethal hardware from south Korea, as unanimously demanded by the Korean nation and the international community."
