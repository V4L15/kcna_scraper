Korean Puppet Minister of Defence Blasted\r\n Pyongyang, October 27 (KCNA) -- As already reported, some days ago, the United States and the south Korean puppets held the 40th south Korea-U.S. \"annual security consultative meeting\" in Washington at which they made public a \"17-point joint statement,\" foolishly crying out for making \"preparations to cope with an emergency situation\" of somebody.\n\t\t\t\t\t This comes under fire by a signed commentary of Rodong Sinmun Monday. The above-said meeting openly brought to light the wild ambition of the U.S. and the Lee Myung Bak group to invade the north while daringly contemplating an operation against it under the pretext of \"emergency situation.\" This reminds one of a confab discussing the operation on the eve of a provocative war both in the light of the reckless remarks made by the warmongers there and the nature of the issues discussed there, the commentary observes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The one more dangerous war confab staged by them in pursuance of the reckless and foolish scenario glaringly betrays an adventurous attempt to disturb peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and ignite a new war at any cost. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat merits more serious attention is that Ri Sang Hui, puppet minister of Defence, again let loose unpardonable outbursts groundlessly slandering the north at the joint press conference held at the end of the meeting.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This traitor without an equal in the world flew into the U.S. to meet his American master and let loose such unspeakable vituperation in the eyes of the world community, not content with vociferating about \"emergency situation\" at home.

Rodong Sinmun Monday observes this in a signed commentary.\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The United States, an assailant posing missile threat, is pulling up the DPRK which has fallen victim to it. This reminds one of a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is reeling off a string of unreasonable and unilateral vituperation not understandable by the DPRK.  It is getting evermore frantic in its moves to increase military expenditure and step up arms buildup including the modernization of nuclear weapons and the space militarization with an aim to put the world under its domination.  However, it is finding fault with other countries in their efforts to increase their national defence capacity to cope with those moves.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. warmongers force the DPRK to stop the missile development, claiming that it poses \"threat\" to the U.S. This is really a robber-like logic little short of urging the DPRK to remain bare-handed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By raising a hue and cry over the \"missile threat\" from the DPRK the U.S. seeks a sinister intention. It seeks to overwhelm other powers by holding a military edge through the establishment of the missile defense system (MD). The U.S. moves to build a missile shield is touching off great concern and denunciation of the international community as it is a revelation of its criminal intention to destroy the strategic stability of the world and spark off a new arms race and a nuclear war. It is precisely for this reason that the warlike forces of the U.S. are hell-bent on publicizing the fictitious story about the \"missile threat\" from the DPRK in a bid to justify their moves to establish the MD and push forward with it in real earnest.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that the U.S. is clinging to the military strong-arm policy towards the DPRK while running amuck in its moves to establish the MD under the pretext of the non-existent \"missile threat\" from someone, the DPRK will build stronger war deterrent for self-defence, not caring what others say."

Korea Disclosed\r\n Pyongyang, October 27 (KCNA) -- The People for Achieving Peace and Reunification in south Korea called a press conference in Seoul on Oct. 22 at which it disclosed the brigandish aim sought by the U.S. in the transfer of its military bases in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t Speeches were made at the conference to be followed by the reading out of a press release.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The press release recalled the fact that the U.S. has recently pressurized the south Korean authorities to cut back its share of funds for the transfer of the bases by half as compared with the original share, extending the expiry of the term for the transfer of its military bases in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lurking behind this is an ulterior motive to divert the funds for the upkeep of the U.S. forces covered by the south Korean authorities to the purpose of transferring the bases and minimize the U.S. share of funds needed for realizing the \"strategic flexibility\" of its forces in south Korea, the press release said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A stupendous amount of funds are expected to be used for the transfer of the bases but the U.S., not content with this, pressurizes the south Korean authorities to channel even the funds for the upkeep of its forces to the transfer of the bases.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is the robber-like demand for the U.S. to cut back its share of the funds for the transfer of its bases, while putting pressure upon south Korea to drastically increase the funds for the upkeep of its forces and trying hard to use them illegally. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"National Assembly\" should resolutely check the U.S. robber-like demeanor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The press release urged the authorities to strongly call to task those who met the above-said U.S. demand and recover all the funds and profits illegally amassed by the U.S. forces in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It also demanded stop to the expansion of the U.S. military base in Phyongthaek for realizing the \"strategic flexibility\" and the repeal of the special agreement on the share of funds for the upkeep of the U.S. forces."
