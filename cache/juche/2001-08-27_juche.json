            "content": "KCNA on groundless rumors in U.S. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 27 (KCNA) -- A U.S. religious journal recently carried a frivolous article alleging that the DPRK is putting the \"taboo on religion\" and it is reported that protest actions demanding a \"stop to persecution\" of Christians are taking place among individuals in different regions of the U.S.\r\n The anti-DPRK diatribe is, in a word, a product of the U.S. hostile policy toward Korea and a sophism to tarnish the image of the DPRK by abusing religion as a lever of political intervention. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It, designed to achieve a sinister political purpose, is an unfounded rigmarole fabricated to slander the socialist system in the DPRK. It does not deserve even a passing note. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As known to all, ours is the superior socialist system under which religious liberty and activity of citizens are ensured by law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the objective reality recognized by all the U.S. prominent clergymen who visited the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the journal keen on building up anti-DPRK public opinion said that hundreds of thousands of Christians, more than tens of times the number of members of the Korean Christian Federation, are subject to suppression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This shows well what a clumsy political farce the anti-DPRK diatribe is. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The base fabrication indicates that the U.S. religious circle plays into the hands of politicians in power and betrayed the basic spirit of religion and went astrayed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This proves that the U.S. religious circles fell victim to the U.S. administration's hostile policy toward Korea and that religion is being suppressed in the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is to be regretted that some U.S. religious circles are reduced to a political plaything and a means of interference in other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. religious circles should feel ashamed of the recent anti-DPRK diatribe and no longer play the role of a political puppet.    \r\n\r\n"

Lurking behind this is a sinister intention. It seeks to use Japan as a shock brigade for its adventurous military action to stifle the DPRK in a bid to put under its control the Korean peninsula, a key front for realising its strategy for world domination, and attain its aim with ease. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK can not but warn Japan against currying favour with the U.S. to sidestep the issue of redressing its past. If Japan launches reinvasion bereft of the sense of being guilty of its past, it will face irretrievable destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and Japan should face up to the trend of the new century and refrain from doing such mean act.    \r\n\r\n"

He asked the president when he got mastery of farming method. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The president thanked him for describing him as such. He said that a statesman can pursue correct politics only when he becomes a good smelter at an iron works, a fisherman at sea and a veteran farmer on a farm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is another anecdote about a lot of cement saved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In May Juche 59 (1970) there arose an issue of paving with concrete tens of kilometers-long waterway as the construction of a power station entered its final stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Informed of this, the president said the tunnel is not fit for working inside it and, therefore, smoothing its surface even without paving as required by the established technology would suffice if the quality of rock permits and it meets the technological need. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Afterwards, officials found that the introduction of the new construction method saved 140,000 tons of cement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It happened during the president's field guidance to Kyongsong county, North Hamgyong Province, in May, Juche 46 (1957). On a farm he was told that pigs were bred with grass found in abundance there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The president asked its name. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A farmer told him that the plant was called \"eveing-primrose\" as it bloomed only at night. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On hearing this, the president wrote down the name of the plant on his handbook, saying that the people are his teacher and so he always mixes with them.    \r\n\r\n"
