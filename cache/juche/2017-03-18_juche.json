            "content": "Rodong Sinmun condena al fracaso la politica hostil de EE.UU. contra la RPDC\r\nPyongyang, 18 de marzo (ACNC) -- Dicen que en estos dias, la nueva administracion norteamericana esta revisando globalmente los proyectos de la politica sobre la RPDC. Es decir, estan buscando el remedio eficiente para lograr el cese del desarrollo de armas nucleares y misiles de la RPDC al examinar los proyectos en todas las esferas, incluyendo la politica, los asuntos militares, la diplomacia y la economia.\n\t\t\t\t\t El problema es que en esos proyectos estan incluidas las opciones muy aventureras y peligrosas como el uso de fuerzas armadas que incluye el ataque preventivo, el recrudecimiento de la presion multilateral en el plano militar y el diplomatico, la sancion economica intensa, el derrocamiento del regimen, la reubicacion de armas nucleares tacticas en el Sur de Corea, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El hecho de que la administracion estadounidense vuelve a examinar todos los proyectos de la politica sobre la RPDC, que habian sido echados al basurero, comprueba la angustia de EE.UU., que sufrio repetidamente la verguenza y la derrota en el enfrentamiento con la RPDC, y anuncia la destruccion final del imperio americano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Asi senala el diario Rodong Sinmun en un comentario individual difundido este sabado y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La nueva administracion norteamericana debe aprender la verdad de que la Corea del Songun siempre gana en el enfrentamiento con EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A cualquier opcion que tome EE.UU., la RPDC le respondera con la contramedida adecuada. Si sucede esto, EE.UU. se arrepentiria tarde de su error.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La administracion estadounidense debe tener presente este proverbio: \"A las malas jugadas, malas paradas\"."

            "content": "Fuerzas hostiles estan al alcance de ataque de potencia nuclear: comentario de ACNC\r\nPyongyang, 18 de marzo (ACNC) -- A medida que se tornan intensos en la Peninsula Coreana los ejercicios militares conjuntos Key Resolve y Foal Eagle, se hace cada dia mas evidente el intento agresivo y criminal de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el marco de los simulacros, EE.UU. ejercito la operacion militar de gran dimension para la \"infiltracion en Pyongyang\", el \"descabezamiento\" y la paralizacion del aparato de mando militar de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe incorporaron en ella hasta las tropas especiales norteamericanas como Seals, Boinas Verdes y Deltas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAparte de Key Resolve y Foal Eagle, tuvo lugar, bajo el pretexto de enfrentarse a la \"provocacion\" de alguien, el entrenamiento naval conjunto de la flotilla compuesta por los barcos escolta de las \"Fuerzas Maritimas de Autodefensa\" de Japon y el portaaviones nuclear Carl Vinson, los destructores, buques de abastecimiento de EE.UU., etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTales movimientos dejan conocer el intento agresivo y hostil de atropellar a toda costa a la RPDC que avanza a pasos firmes por la senda de independencia antiimperialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta vez, EE.UU. esta confirmando la posibilidad real de la \"operacion de descabezamiento\" contra la Direccion de la Revolucion Coreana y la otra de ataque preventivo contra los medios de ataque nuclear de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTras poner en practica el \"OPLAN 5015\" que persigue el objetivo principal de dar ataque preventivo a las importantes instalaciones nucleares de la RPDC, el imperio libra desde el 10 de marzo el ejercicio de asalto contra la RPDC con el portaaviones nuclear Carl Vinson, el crucero con proyectiles teledirigidos Lake Champlain y los destructores Aegis como Michael Murphy y Wayne E. Meyer, trasladados sigilosamente al Mar Este de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl dia 15, introdujo en secreto en el Sur de Corea una escuadra de B-1B proveniente de la base aerea Anderson en la isla Guam que realizo casi una hora en el cielo sobre el campo de tiro de Sangdong el ejercicio de lanzamiento de bombas nucleares contra los objetivos principales de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. es el culpable de agravacion de la situacion que destruye la paz y estabilidad de la Peninsula Coreana y el resto del Nordeste Asiatico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs una ilusion vana y opcion suicida el intento del imperio de aplastar a la RPDC que ha ocupado la posicion de digna potencia nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. no debe olvidar ni un momento que el modo de reaccion militar del Ejercito Popular de Corea paso al de ataque preventivo frente a la campana norteamericana de guerra nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora, el portaaviones nuclear y otras propiedades estrategicas de las fuerzas hostiles se encuentran en la mira de los medios de ataque superprecisos del EPC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi los enemigos envian un solo obus hacia la tierra, el mar y el aire jurisdiccionales de la RPDC, las armas del Juche de esta devastaran todos los bastiones de agresion y provocacion. Esto no es una advertencia huera.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo deben esperar la piedad los que intenten ofender, aunque en lo minimo, nuestra soberania y dignidad."
