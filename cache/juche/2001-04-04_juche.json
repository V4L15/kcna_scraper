            "content": "U.S. hostile policy toward DPRK denounced abroad \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- Statements denouncing the hostile policy of the U.S. administration toward the DPRK were released in Guyana and Uganda.\r\n The Amerindian action movement of Guyana in a statement on March 28 denounced the U.S. for escalating its anti-DPRK campaign after the emergence of the Bush administration. The administration pulled up the DPRK over the non-existent \"threat\" from it and \"human rights issue\" and labelled it as a \"terrorism-sponsoring country\", chiming in with Japan's row over the \"kidnapping\" issue, the statement noted, and went on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The hostile policy of the bush administration toward the DPRK is a grave challenge to the aspiration and desire of the Korean people and the international community for the improved relations between the DPRK and the U.S., the termination of the Korean division and durable peace on the Korean peninsula in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We strongly urge the U.S. to discard the anachronistic daydream and opt to improve the relations with the DPRK at an early date and immediately halt all its moves against the Korean people in their drive to achieve the reunification by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation according to the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Ugandan railway workers' union in a statement on march 26 expressed deep concern about the situation on the Korean peninsula getting worse due to the U.S. moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement noted that the U.S. deliberate moves to strain the situation on the Korean peninsula are intended to invent a pretext for the establishment of the \"theatre missile defence\" system now being rejected by its allies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement called on all countries and the peoples of the world to pay due attention to the U.S. behaviour and strive to prevent the history of the 20th century recorded with war and destruction from being repeated in the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should compensate for the enormous material losses the DPRK's independent nuclear power industry has suffered owing to the delayed light water reactor project and take an approach and stand suited to the trend of the times, the statement said.    \r\n\r\n"
