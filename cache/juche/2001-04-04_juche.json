            "content": "U.S. hostile policy toward DPRK denounced abroad \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- Statements denouncing the hostile policy of the U.S. administration toward the DPRK were released in Guyana and Uganda.\r\n The Amerindian action movement of Guyana in a statement on March 28 denounced the U.S. for escalating its anti-DPRK campaign after the emergence of the Bush administration. The administration pulled up the DPRK over the non-existent \"threat\" from it and \"human rights issue\" and labelled it as a \"terrorism-sponsoring country\", chiming in with Japan's row over the \"kidnapping\" issue, the statement noted, and went on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The hostile policy of the bush administration toward the DPRK is a grave challenge to the aspiration and desire of the Korean people and the international community for the improved relations between the DPRK and the U.S., the termination of the Korean division and durable peace on the Korean peninsula in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We strongly urge the U.S. to discard the anachronistic daydream and opt to improve the relations with the DPRK at an early date and immediately halt all its moves against the Korean people in their drive to achieve the reunification by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation according to the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Ugandan railway workers' union in a statement on march 26 expressed deep concern about the situation on the Korean peninsula getting worse due to the U.S. moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement noted that the U.S. deliberate moves to strain the situation on the Korean peninsula are intended to invent a pretext for the establishment of the \"theatre missile defence\" system now being rejected by its allies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement called on all countries and the peoples of the world to pay due attention to the U.S. behaviour and strive to prevent the history of the 20th century recorded with war and destruction from being repeated in the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should compensate for the enormous material losses the DPRK's independent nuclear power industry has suffered owing to the delayed light water reactor project and take an approach and stand suited to the trend of the times, the statement said.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. anti-DPRK war agitation under fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- U.S. imperialist warhawks are becoming more vociferous about the second Korean war after defining the DPRK as its \"No. 1 Enemy.\"\r\n In this regard rodong sinmun today in a signed commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Blair, commander-in-chief of the U.S. forces in the Pacific, during his recent junket to South Korea, let loose provocative outbursts that North Korea is the \"No. 1 Enemy of the U.S.\" and it is capable of striking South Korea and the whole of Japan with missiles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not strange that war outcries are heard from among conservative hardliners of the present U.S. administration advocating a hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Blair made such remarks  at a time when the bush administration has become more zealous in its pursuance of the hard-line policy to stifle the DPRK and louder in its call for \"cooperation\" with Japan and South Korea for a war of aggression. This is a manifestation of the U.S. intention to turn to confrontation and war against the DPRK at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the U.S. seeks is to incite enmity towards the DPRK among Japanese and South Koreans in a bid to strengthen the triangular military alliance and use it as a springboard from which to provoke a new war of aggression and use U.S. allies as a shock brigade. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is keen to convince the Japanese reactionaries of the DPRK's \"threat of missile strike at Japan\" so that they may make the DPRK the principal target of overseas aggression and deeply involve themselves in the aggressive triangular military alliance system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is a problem to be tackled by the U.S. in strengthening the alliance. That is South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present U.S. ruling quarters are becoming increasingly assertive before South Korean officials that top priority should be given to \"cooperation system\" and \"the alliance\" between the U.S. and South Korea in a bid to stem the trend towards improved inter-Korean relations. Blair's South Korean tour was apparently aimed to serve that purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is clearly evidenced by the fact that he advocated the fiction of the DPRK's \"missile strike at South Korea\" before South Koreans. By this method the U.S. imperialists are fostering an atmosphere of confrontation with the DPRK in South Korea and working hard to bring the process of inter-Korean reconciliation back to the state of confrontation in order to attain their aggressive aim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is fully prepared to strongly react to the U.S. hard-line policy to stifle it. If the U.S. warhawks turn to confrontation and war at any cost, the DPRK will make a thousand-fold retaliation against them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
