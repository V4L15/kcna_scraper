It is the invariable ambition of the U.S. imperialists for aggression to conquer the DPRK by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The intensified \"military alliance\" of the U.S. and South Korea will only result in escalating the threat of a new war, a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula. The U.S. imperialists' moves to intensify the \"military alliance\" with South Korea will disturb peace in Asia and the rest of the world and inflict nuclear disasters on humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such moves of the U.S. war hawks are an unpardonable crime that will cause very dangerous consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists seek to invade the DPRK by driving out the South Korean army as bullet shields, but it is a pipedream. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they dare to mount a preemptive attack on the DPRK, they will drink a bitter cup before its self-reliant defense capacities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe U.S. is well advised to drop its infeasible policy to stifle the DPRK and honestly come out to the DPRK-U.S. dialogue. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The Tokyo metropolitan governor let loose a spate of vituperations against the DPRK that Japan should take a revenge on North Korea for the \"issue of kidnapping,\" North Korea should collapse and Japan may stage a war against North Korea.\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun runs a signed commentary today, which says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has persistently pursued the hostile policy toward the DPRK for scores of years after the war, but it has never resorted to it so frantically as now. This is an unjust behavior that does not conform with the desire and interests of the peoples of Korea and Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is driving the DPRK-Japan relations to an extreme pitch of tension, which is aimed to avoid its past liquidation. \r\n The Japanese reactionaries' persistent raising of the \"issue of kidnapping\" is, in essence, an attitude that they will ditch the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration and evade the liquidation of the past wrongdoings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind the moves of Japan to bedevil the DPRK-Japan relations is its real intention to attain its wild ambition for reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By nature, what the Japanese reactionaries want is to stage a comeback, not to normalize the DPRK-Japan relations. It is the ambition of the Japanese reactionaries to follow in the wake of samurais who tried to swallow up the whole of Asia after invading and occupying Korea in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan can never avoid the past redress. The Japanese reactionaries' ambition for reinvasion will not be realized. They have nothing to get from worsening DPRK-Japan relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They would be well advised to take a correct option at the crossroads of history whether to improve or worsen the DPRK-Japan relations.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is a historic task to be fulfilled through a very difficult and hard struggle to wipe out imperialist and dominationist forces and accomplish the cause of global independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the progressive forces of the world should closely unite as the imperialists are not willing to quit the international arena of their own accord. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is most important for achieving the unity of the anti-imperialist independent forces is to maintain independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe unity of the forces in the true sense of the word is unthinkable without adhering to the principle of independence. \r\n The U.S. imperialists are the major target of the united struggle of the anti-imperialist independent forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary for the world progressive forces to build up their own military strength to closely unite and successfully wage the struggle against the imperialist and dominationist forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One can not maintain independence and behave on one's own principle in the international arena if one lacks strong military power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the consistent policy of the Workers' Party of Korea and the government of the DPRK to strengthen unity with the world progressives.

            "content": "U.S. unreasonable stand under fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 12 (KCNA) -- U.S. State Secretary Powell at a recent interview with a TV reporter blustered that the U.S. would not reward someone's bad behavior, creating impression that the U.S. call for North Korea's \"scrapping of its nuclear program before dialogue\" and its \"multilateral talks\" are commanding broad-based support from the international community.\r\n His remarks come under fire by a signed commentary of Minju Joson today. His recent remarks only go to clearly prove that the Bush administration, in fact, does not want a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, the commentary observes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is only repeating its call for North Korea's \"dismantlement of its nuclear program before dialogue\", while keeping mum about its hostile policy toward the DPRK. This can not but be an extremely unilateral and brigandish logic intended to attain its sinister aim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The same holds true for the issue of multilateral talks. The DPRK is not opposed to that format of talks. The DPRK's stand to hold the DPRK-U.S. talks before the multilateral talks is quite just as it is prompted by its deep study of the essence and the nature of the issue and its analysis of them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. must know this, of course. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The assertion that bad behavior would not be rewarded made by the U.S. in reference to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula only discloses its foolish attempt to shift its responsibility onto the DPRK and seek a plausible pretext for stifling the DPRK with nukes. This diatribe, however, will get it nowhere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the DPRK government has clarified more than once, its building up of a nuclear deterrent force is not aimed to get any quid pro quo from the U.S. but is a just self-defensive measure to defend the sovereignty and the dignity of the country to cope with the U.S. ever-more undisguised policy to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should face up to the reality, roll back its unreasonable assertions and immediately buckle down into solving the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula in a peaceful way. This will do the U.S. good, too.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
