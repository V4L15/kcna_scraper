It conducted smear propaganda, claiming that \"Koreans commit arsons\" and \"Koreans put poison into wells,\" etc. in a bid to divert its people's anti-government sentiment to Koreans and tide over its serious socio-political crisis, the statement said, and continued:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n More than 23,000 Koreans met tragic deaths due to the Japanese imperialists' monstrous man-killings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The massacre of Koreans committed by the Japanese imperialists during the Kanto quake was just part of the mass-killings committed by them against the Korean people. The massacre of Koreans committed by the Japanese imperialists in an organized and premeditated manner deserves stern punishment by the Korean nation and human conscience as they were hideous state-sponsored crimes that can never be justified. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n More than six decades have passed since the defeat of Japan but it has worked hard to distort its history of aggression, seize Tok Islet and incite hostility toward the DPRK while evading its responsibility to make apology and reparation for the crimes it committed during its occupation of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is obliged to make honest apology, repentance and reparation for its past crimes and immediately stop distorting its history of aggression and give up its wild ambition for reinvasion, the statement urged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lee Myung Bak group is the clique of sycophants and traitors without a parallel who deserve all Koreans' censure and curse as it is zealously supporting Japan, the sworn enemy of the Korean nation, in hatching plots against the fellow countrymen and its moves to stifle the DPRK, subservient to it. Stern punishment should be meted out to the group seeking to bring the holocaust of war to the fellow countrymen through its moves against reunification and peace. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

He also let loose a string of jargons that the Ulji Freedom Guardian joint war exercises staged in south Korea recently proved that they are ready to lead a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Tuesday in a signed commentary carried in this regard terms these provocative outbursts revealing the U.S. imperialists' criminal intention to perpetuate their forces' presence in south Korea and escalate military confrontation on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits more serious attention is that even the commander of the U.S. forces in south Korea trumpeted about \"unification by prevailing over communism,\" a bankrupt slogan, raising a hue and cry over the non-existent \"threat\" from someone and vociferating about \"defeat\" and \"unification.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is nonsensical for the U.S. to talk about someone's \"threat\" though it is far away from the Korean Peninsula geographically. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world public is becoming increasingly vocal demanding the withdrawal of the U.S. forces from south Korea and a stop to war exercises to invade the DPRK. The commander of the U.S. 8th Army, however, openly disclosed the U.S. intention to beef up its forces, instead of manifesting its will to withdraw them from south Korea and advertised what he called \"achievement\", instead of expressing its intention to stop the war exercises. Such rigmarole can be let loose only by a warmonger. This proves that he is a war hawk keen to ignite a war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is that the U.S. is getting desperate in its moves to massively sell its ultra-modern weapons to south Korea in a bid to \"boost its combat capability.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. war-thirsty forces' reckless moves to beef up combat forces and moves to invade the DPRK have turned south Korea into a hotbed for a new war, a nuclear war and rendered the situation on the Korean Peninsula extremely tense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The increased frenzy of the U.S. to mount a preemptive attack on the DPRK would only reinforce the DPRK's will to bolster up its war deterrent in every way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Should the U.S. warmongers launch another war, oblivious of the lesson taught by the past Korean war in which they suffered a disgraceful defeat after coming in reckless attack, they will perish in the flames kindled by themselves. �@\r\n\r\n\r\n"
