            "content": "Japon debe indemnizar crimenes del pasado, subraya Minju Joson\r\nPyongyang, 15 de diciembre (ATCC) -- Japon debe tener presente que su futuro depende de la liquidacion del pasado criminal, liquidar deshonroso pasado conforme a la demanda y la corriente de la epoca e indemnizar merecidamente por el respecto.\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi senala el periodico Minju Joson en un comentario individual difundido este martes y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAlgunos paises, que perpetraron el crimen de guerra en el pasado o danaron a otros, muestran el movimiento sincero para liquidar su pasado erroneo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, es tan diferente la actitud de Japon, pais criminal de guerra a la luz de la corriente actual de la sociedad internacional a la liquidacion del pasado criminal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo se dieron a conocer a todo el mundo, Japon impuso la gran desgracia y penalidad a la humanidad durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial como Alemania e Italia. En particular, este pais isleno es un Estado criminal que dio innumerables perdidas humanas, materiales y morales al pueblo coreano ocupando a Corea durante mas de 40 anos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, los reaccionarios japoneses no  reconocen sus crimenes del pasado lejos de pedir disculpa por el respecto sino actuan perversamente para ocultar su historia criminal del pasado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa liquidacion del pasado no solo es el problema que Japon debe hacer sino tambien es el deber juridico internacional y el moral asumidos a este pais isleno.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuanto mas demora tal liquidacion del pasado, tanto mas se aumentaran sus crimenes, aislamiento y rechazo por parte de la sociedad internacional."
