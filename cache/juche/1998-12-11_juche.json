Korea\r\n   Pyongyang, December 11 (KCNA) -- A few days ago, an artillery unit of the South Korean army launched a ground-to-air \"Nike\" missile aiming at the north that exploded in mid-air.\r\n   Commenting on this provocative incident, a news analyst of Rodong Sinmun today says:\r\n   This eloquently shows part of the premeditated and adventurous moves of the South Korean warmongers to kindle the train of a war against the north by zealously joining in the U.S. plan for a second Korean war of aggression.\r\n   The Korean peninsula is now placed under a touch-and-go situation.\r\n   At this very juncture, a fully-armed missile exploded in mid-air while flying toward the north. This is a provocative act such as igniting a war against the north.\r\n   The South Korean rulers say that the missile launch is a \"misfire.\" however, their advertisement is nothing but a sophism to calm down public opinion, flee from the responsibility for the incident and conceal their zeal for northward invasion.\r\n   It is only too clear that the \"Nike\" missile which is 8.2 metres long and weighs 4.5 tons cannot be \"misfired\" by an \"error\" because it can be launched, controlled and guided by such modern technical means as radar and electronic computers.\r\n   If the South Korean rulers persistently try to evade apology for their anti-national misbehaviour, the DPRK government will make them pay for their crimes thousand-fold.    \r\n\r\n"
