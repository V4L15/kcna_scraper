The opera has been staged 1 600 times. \n\t\t\t\t\t The opera was adapted from a revolutionary drama \"The Sea of Blood\", an immortal classic masterpiece created by President Kim Il Sung during the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle in the 1930s. The drama deals with the indiscriminate massacre of the Korean people by the Japanese imperialists. Its heroine gets gradually awakened and comes out to the road of the revolutionary struggle. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Leader Kim Jong Il unfolded a far-reaching plan to bring about a turn in the field of opera through the adaptation of the drama to opera and energetically led the work. Therefore, Korean-style revolutionary opera \"The Sea of Blood\" was created in 1971 with the introduction of verse-songs, pangchang, dance, stage arts, orchestral music and others.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On its basis, the \"The Sea of Blood\"-style revolutionary operas \"The Flower Girl\", \"A True Daughter of the Party\" and \"Tell O Forest\" were created in a short span of time and became known to the world."

Especially, in recent years the Korean people had to go through very arduous road of struggle unknown in history. However, they made steady progress, recording the great history of succession and victory. Lurking behind this advance was the immovable idea and faith to go along the road of revolution to the last under the guidance of the great Party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean army and people are firmly determined to lead the road of Juche paved by the President invariably to the road of victory in building socialism under the Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il. This strong will has been fully displayed in the course of fresh dynamic advance in the 21st century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Last year the historic WPK Conference reelected leader Kim Jong Il to be its general secretary. It was a striking demonstration of the pure and immovable idea and faith of the Korean army and people determined to reliably ensure the centre of unity and leadership of the Korean revolution in the new century, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now the Korean army and people, who are inching close to the gate of a thriving nation, keenly realize that the road of the Juche revolution, the Songun revolution is the straight one for justice and victory."
