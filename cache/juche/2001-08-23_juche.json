            "content": "Japan urged to redress its past \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 23 (KCNA) -- The Japanese authorities are further budging from their commitment to redress Japan's past as evidenced by their recent refusal to allow the entry into Japan of the delegation of the DPRK Measure Committee for Demanding Compensation To \"Comfort Women for the Army\" and the Victims of the Pacific War.\r\n This attitude comes under fire by a signed commentary of Rodong Sinmun today. \r\n The commentary says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan can never get confidence of the international community unless it settles its past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was a vivid  expression of its hostile policy towards the DPRK that Japan refused to allow the entry into Japan of the DPRK delegation only. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is a highly dignified independent sovereign state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will strive to improve relations with even those countries which had once been hostile to the DPRK if they respect sovereignty and give up their hostile policy towards it. But the DPRK will certainly make those forces, which persistently pursue an unfriendly and hostile policy towards it, pay for their wrongs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's expression of enmity towards the DPRK before the international community was as foolish an act as lifting the axe to cut its own foot. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The hostile policy persistently pursued by the Japanese authorities towards the DPRK compels the DPRK to take a corresponding measure.    \r\n\r\n"

The world people demand the U.S. withdraw its troops and military equipment from South Korea, he added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to ensure peace in Asia, it is necessary for Japan not to side with the U.S. imperialists' policy of aggression, he stressed.     \r\n\r\n"

Such military policy of the U.S. makes the situation in the region unpredictable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That is why the DPRK, China and Russia, together with southeast Asian countries, are strongly opposed to the U.S. plans to establish national missile defense system and theatre Missile Defense system that may harass world and regional stability.    \r\n\r\n"

It is rich in national style and perfect in formative artistic depiction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The monument with a tower body and platforms clearly reflects all the fellow countrymen's desire for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Upper part of the tower body depicts a mark of three charters engraved with letters reading \"three charters,\" a Korean map and magnolia designs. On both sides of each platform stand group sculptures which are on the themes of the three principles of national reunification, the proposal for founding the democratic federal republic of Koryo, the ten-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation and the slogan \"Long Live Reunified Korea.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The monument depicts two women, their arms stretched out as if to embrace each other and shout \"Long Live Reunification\" this clearly proves that reunification is the greatest desire and supreme task of the nation whose implementation brooks no further delay. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The same posture of the two women in Korean national costumes intuitively tells that the north and the south are one and the same nation who lives in the same territory with the same mind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are rooms which have displays of more than 700 commemorative stones dedicated by party and state heads and progressive figures of scores of countries and overseas compatriots wishing the reunification of the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Standing in the education ground is the monument to President Kim Il Sung's proposition on national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is a garden covering 8 hectares around the monument.    \r\n\r\n"

The absolute prestige of Kim Jong Il, a rare statesman and the great man of general type, represents the dignity and honour of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that Kim Jong Il's politics has a history of nearly 40 years, the article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il's absolute prestige as a world veteran statesman who leads the times is unthinkable without his decades-long political history and his exploits performed in this period. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He has pursued army-first politics, the most perfect political mode in the history of world politics, thus protecting the destiny of the country and socialism and hewing the road to be followed by humankind's common cause of independence. It is an immortal exploit performed by Kim Jong Il as a peerlessly great statesman. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists have resorted to ceaseless military blackmail and aggression moves in recent years to stifle the DPRK which was undergoing rigorous trails. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Holding in high esteem the great commander endowed with iron will and grit and superb strategy, the Korean people have been able to decisively shatter all the moves of the imperialists for aggression and honorably defend sovereignty and dignity of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Russian people accorded cordial hospitality to Kim Jong Il with high respect, warm friendship and deep trust in him and hundreds of millions of people around the world expressed boundless reverence and respect for him during his Russia visit. It clearly shows what high international prestige he enjoys.    \r\n\r\n"
