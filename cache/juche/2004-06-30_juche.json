Korean Additional Troop Dispatch to Iraq \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 29 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland (CPRF) Monday released information bulletin No. 874 with regard to the evermore open pressure put by the United States on the south Korean authorities to force them to additionally dispatch troops to Iraq after the murder of a south Korean civilian abducted by an Iraqi resistant force.\r\n U.S. President Bush at a \"joint press conference\" on June 22 openly demanded that the south Korean authorities send additional troops to Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAnd the deputy secretary of State and deputy secretary of Defense at the Senate Arms Services Committee on June 25 made threatening remarks demanding the south Korean authorities dispatch additional troop to Iraq as planned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  This is an intolerable challenge to the south Koreans and the entire Korean nation resolutely opposing the U.S. war of aggression in Iraq and its pressure for additional troop dispatch to Iraq, says the information bulletin, adding: This throws a more revealing light on its criminal scheme to drive out south Korean young people to the Iraqi battlefield at any cost as bullet-shields for the U.S. troops. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  To dispatch troops to Iraq in obedience to the U.S., the bulletin goes on, is a very unreasonable act going against the aspiration and desire of the entire Korean nation and the peace-loving people of the world and an unpardonable treachery against the nation which would force misfortunes and sacrifices upon the fellow countrymen and invite a war to the Korean peninsula in cooperation with the U.S. in its unilateral policy of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The south Korean people from all walks of life should decisively frustrate the criminal troop dispatch to Iraq, well aware that if the additional troop dispatch to Iraq were carried into practice by force by the U.S. and its followers, it would bring a more miserable result than the case of Kim Son Il, and should turn out more bravely in the righteous anti-U.S. struggle to put an end to the U.S. military occupation and colonial rule over south Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Paektu which has been strengthened into a powerful defending force of the revolutionary cause of Juche, the speakers said, sternly warning that if the U.S. imperialists provoked another war of aggression, tens of millions of avengers in this land would sweep them, the chieftain of crimes, off the earth to the last man. \r\n At the mass rallies held in North Phyongan, South Hwanghae and South Hamgyong provinces on June 27, the speakers stated that if the U.S. imperialists dared ignite the second Korean war in defiance of warnings, the heroic Korean People's Army soldiers and people led by the illustrious commander of Mt. Paektu would rise up like a giant and wipe them out, wreaking the vengeance ranking deeply in their hearts.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This mean mud-slinging can be done only by the U.S. imperialists ill-famed for plot-breeding and steeped in bitterness towards the DPRK to the marrow of their bones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With nothing can the United States ever realize its ambition to isolate and stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to address the serious issue of human traffic at home, instead of making a nonsensical talk about the DPRK's \"human traffic.\"    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In order to achieve sovereignty, the life and soul of the nation, and put strong impetus to the reunification movement the Korean nation should advance along the road of independence against the U.S. without fail. Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nothing is more foolish than calculating that the U.S. which split the Korean nation will make a present of reunification to it. To struggle for independence against the U.S. leads to patriotism and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the past century when struggles were waged to liberate Korea anti-Japanese actions meant patriotism but at present the anti-U.S. struggle to reunify the country represents patriotism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a bitter lesson taught by the history of the national reunification movement that the Koreans' movement for national reconciliation, unity and the reunification of the country can not but undergo pain and twists and turns as long as the U.S. imperialists stay in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The key to the victory in the struggle for independence against the U.S. lies in the unity of the whole nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There exists on the Korean peninsula only the structure of the Korean nation's confrontation with U.S. now that all Koreans are working hard to achieve national reconciliation, unity and the reunification of the country by their concerted efforts under the banner of the Korean nation-first. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The policy of the Bush administration to isolate and stifle the DPRK remains unchanged and it is becoming more undisguised in its moves to bring the DPRK to its knees by force and dominate it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans in the north and the south and overseas are the driving force in the struggle for independence against the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even U.S. dangerous nuclear weapons will be useless when all Koreans join efforts and conduct a vigorous joint struggle to frustrate the U.S. moves for confrontation and war against the reunification of Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Dismisses Japanese Right-wing Conservatives' Anti-DPRK Moves as Anachronistic\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 29, (KCNA) -- The Japanese right-wing conservative forces are contemplating the use of the \"law banning the portcall of specified foreign ships\" as a means to threaten the DPRK in the wake of its adoption at the Diet.\r\n Abe, secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, said recently that he expected the government to \"make an effective use of the law as a diplomatic card for the settlement of the abduction issue\" in an attempt to put pressure upon the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is an anachronistic act to reduce the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration to a dead document and block the implementation of the declaration come what may. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The third paragraph of the declaration says both sides affirm that they will abide by international law and will not do any act threatening each other's security. According to the paragraph, Japan is committed to refrain not only from putting any economic pressure upon the DPRK and enforcing any measure for blockade against it but deliberately posing any threat to the DPRK's economic life and throwing any hurdle in its way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From this point of view the \"law banning the portcall of specified foreign ships\" targeted at the DPRK's ship Mangyongbong-92 totally runs counter to the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration which calls on the DPRK and Japan to observe international law and refrain from threatening each other's security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a more serious attention is that the Japanese right-wing conservative forces not only spearheaded the drive to adopt such anti-DPRK law but are openly calling for the use of the law as a leverage to put pressure upon the DPRK, raising a hue and cry over the \"abduction issue\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the \"abduction issue\" is concerned, the DPRK has already sent the families of the five abductees to Japan. It is making every sincere effort to help Soga and her husband Jenkins and their daughters reunite, taking their intentions into consideration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese right-wing conservative forces, however, are invoking such anti-DPRK law, in disregard of its sincere efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis can not be construed otherwise than a move to isolate and suffocate the DPRK at any cost under the pretext of the \"abduction issue\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These indiscreet moves of those forces indicate that they are still toeing the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK, displeased with the atmosphere of improving the relations between the two countries created in the wake of the recent DPRK-Japan summit. The reckless hostile anti-DPRK moves of those who are steeped in the spirit of kowtowing to the U.S. to the marrow of their bones are bound to go bust as they are unjustifiable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They had better behave themselves, pondering over the grave consequences to be entailed by their acts.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
