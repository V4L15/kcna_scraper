To cite an example, an anti-aircraft artillery encampment covering 20,600 phyong was built in the area of the Changdok Palace, which has been recorded as a world's cultural monument by UNESCO.\r\n In this regard, a spokesman for the Bureau for Direction of Cultural Preservation of the DPRK issued a statement on Feb. 7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an intolerable insult to the Korean nation that even graves of forefathers are trampled underfoot as military bases as if it were not enough that precious historical cultural relics have been looted by foreign aggression forces in south Korea for over 100 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.

Japan is still considering economic sanctions against the DPRK as an option for a solution to the abduction issue, he added.\r\n In this regard, Minju Joson today says in a signed commentary: Though the abduction issue had already been settled between the DPRK and Japan, the right-wing conservatives of Japan are still raising a hue and cry over it, kicking up a frantic racket of confrontation with the DPRK. Lurking behind this row is a sinister aim to paint an assailant as a victim in a bid to evade their responsibility for the past crimes at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the whole period of their colonial rule over Korea, the Japanese imperialists forcibly drafted 8.4 million Koreans and hurled them into war shambles and slave labor sites. They left over one million of them dead and forced 200,000 women into sexual slavery for the imperial Japanese army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists against the Korean people for over 40 years of their colonial rule were the most hideous human rights abuses in history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In case the abduction issue no longer remains a problem in the relations between the DPRK and Japan, for the latter to redeem its past crimes will be the only outstanding issue between them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Aware of this, the Japanese reactionaries are kicking up such a madcap anti-DPRK racket in a bid to attain two aims: one is to evade the responsibility for the settlement of the past by insisting that the abduction issue has not yet been solved and the other is to build up a revanchist public opinion under the pretext of \"people's sentiment\" so as to create a social atmosphere favorable for their comeback to Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are persistently raising a hue and cry over the abduction issue hardly comparable with the monstrous crimes committed by Japan against the Korean nation in the past. This frantic ruckus of confrontation with the DPRK only triggers off bitterer hatred of its army and people toward Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan had better behave itself, properly understanding their steadfast will to force it to pay for all the crimes perpetrated by the Japanese imperialists in the past.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

However, they have gone back on their promise and chosen to revoke it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have now made full preparations for economic sanctions against the DPRK. Nevertheless, Abe branded the DPRK as an \"offender\". This is a cunning and malicious act. We cannot help regarding him as a coldhearted fellow and a political epileptic. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In Japan there are not a small number of political charlatans and philistines seeing eye to eye with Abe. They are ultra-right conservatives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nUrged by nasty political ambitions, they have tenaciously clung to the abduction issue which had already been fully solved and, as if it were not enough, are now kicking up quite a row over the \"issue of false remains,\" their own brainchild. Banking on \"people's sentiments\", they are kicking and screaming to attain their heinous political purpose, labeling the DPRK as the \"assailant\" and Japan as the \"victim\" by reversing black and white. They are even intending to codify their hostile policy toward the DPRK by faking\r\nup a \"north Korean human rights act\" and launch into an offensive operation for the \"collapse\" and \"overthrow\" of the system of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWith disgust and hatred for the frenzy of the Japanese ultra-right conservative forces against it, the DPRK will strictly keep tabs on their criminal acts.

            "content": "U.S. Urged to Compensate to Maehyang-ri Inhabitants\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 8 (KCNA) -- The Seoul Central District Court of south Korea recently ruled that the south Korean authorities shall pay compensation to the victims in Maehyang-ri upon handling a lawsuit filed by its inhabitants who suffered from bombing exercises of U.S. forces planes.\r\n Papers here Tuesday say in signed commentaries in this regard: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is an inevitable product of the master-servant relationship between the U.S. and south Korea. The U.S. forces' act of evading compensation for their crimes is a totally unwarranted brigandish act as it is the most despicable and shameless arbitrary practice of the occupation forces who disregard and look down upon the south Koreans.\r\n Rodong Sinmun observes: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is clear to everybody that it is none other than the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops who have inflicted huge damage upon the Maehyang-ri inhabitants for the past scores of years. However, the U.S. forces insisted that they are not to blame for the crimes, a sheer far-fetched assertion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. forces have staged war exercises in Maehyang-ri for scores of years to attain its purpose of invading the north, bringing all sorts of disasters and sufferings to its population. Yet, they refuse to pay compensation, instead of making apologies, absurdly asserting that they are not responsible for the crimes.  Such shameless acts can be perpetrated only by the American gangsters who consider it as their means of existence to invade, dominate and plunder other nations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Minju Joson demands the U.S. opt to own responsibility for the damage done to the inhabitants in Maehyang-ri, though belatedly, and make apology and compensation to the Korean nation for all the crimes it committed in Korea for the past 60 years and withdraw from south Korea at the earliest possible date.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
