Tambien, el helicoptero surcoreano volo a 15~20 metros sobre la superficie del agua produciendo fuertes oleadas marinas y disparando cientos balas de ametrallador en 20 ocasiones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor ultimo, movilizaron hasta el tercer buque de guerra para cercar nuestros barcos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando nuestros pesqueros gritaron que \"ya hemos informado a la patria vuestros crimenes bandidescos y ahora viene aqui nuestro ejercito para salvarnos\", los gangsteres militares surcoreanos huyeron apresuradamente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTales actos criminales causaron las indignaciones de todos los coreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEntonces, los titeres surcoreanos estan divulgando cinicamente la mentira, segun la cual en el mar frente a Kojin de Kosong de la provincia de Kangwon, un barco norcoreano traspaso la linea de demacracion militar maritima por equivocacion de ruta y una vez que fue confirmada su voluntad de no sumision, \"permitieron regresar a la parte nortena a eso de las 7:10 cumpliendo su obligacion humanitaria\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAntes los titeres surcoreanos secuestraron en pleno dia a nuestras ciudadanas en el pais extranjero y hoy dia intentan llevar a fuerza a nuestros pesqueros que estaban en pesca. Esto es la actitud gangsteril de la banda traidora de Park Geun-hye.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo recibiran nunca la disculpa los actos criminales de los titeres surcoreanos que insatisfechos con la intensificacion escalonada de sus provocaciones militares en las inmediaciones de la linea de demacracion militar y en la tierra, mar y cielo de las aguas candentes del Mar Sudoeste de Corea, esta vez se dedicaron a la confrontacion fratricida en las aguas del Mar Este de Corea."
