As a result, they are able to conduct military operations in any area of the world under the pretext of \"aid\" to the U.S. forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's war preparations have been rounded off economically and militarily and in terms of laws. The dispatch of the \"SDF\" overseas is the last phase for the realisation of Japan's wild ambition for reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration that emerged in January worked out a new military strategy to provoke the second Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Availing themselves of this opportunity, the Japanese reactionaries the U.S. and the Japanese reactionaries' plan to convene the are watching for a chance to invade the DPRK. \"Security consultative committee\" meeting and make public a war plan is to attain this purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their dangerous war moves compel the DPRK to strengthen its countermeasure with high vigilance against them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they ignite the second Korean war, the DPRK will mercilessly destroy the aggressors with the mobilization of all its efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are well advised to bear in mind that the Korean war of aggression will lead them to self-destruction.    \r\n\r\n"

They can be achieved only through struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the NAM is to attain its idea and purpose and creditably discharge the mission it assumed on behalf of the times, it should strengthen its position and role in every way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The UN reforms, disarmament, termination of foreign military occupation and dismantling of foreign military bases and compensation by suzerain states, pressing issues in the international arena, call for concerted efforts on the part of the non-aligned countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unity among the NAM member nations leads to the enhanced position and role of the NAM. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The NAM should work hard to set up international relations based on independence and equality and democratize the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The NAM is faced with an important task to boost south-south cooperation in face of the \"globalisation\" advertised by the imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson says that the DPRK government will as ever fulfil its responsibility and play the role as a member nation of the NAM.    \r\n\r\n"
