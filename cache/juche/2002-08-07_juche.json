To hit this target, they braved difficulties in the revolutionary spirit of soldiers and finished the project equivalent to the construction of a big power station in a few years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling the facts, the message said that the completion of the power station has turned the River Kumjin, which had often brought disasters in the past, into a river of happiness, helping protect people's lives and properties and thousands of hectares of farmlands in Sinsang area from drought and flood damage. It has also made it possible to put the production of local industrial factories in the county on a normal basis and improve the people's living, it added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the message Kim Jong Il highly praised the builders and helpers for having successfully built the dam and power station as monumental edifices in the era of the Workers' Party and expressed the firm belief that they would achieve greater success in carrying out their revolutionary duty to live up to the party's expectation and trust.     \r\n\r\n"

He climbed Mt. Tonghung together with officials and proposed to build a zoo there.\r\n As regards officials' earlier recommendation to build a zoo in Kwijusa valley, the president said that if the zoo is built far from the city, it is inconvenient for people to visit the zoo. As Mt. Tonghung is towering in the city of Hamhung, why should the zoo be built in a place far away from the city? He asked. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying to them it was very good to build the zoo here in many aspects by taking those favorable conditions into account, he taught concrete orientation and ways of construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Later he sent many animals including rare leatherback to the zoo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Hamhung zoo is a pleasure ground for the people built in the site chosen by him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He visited a village in Kangdong county, South Phyongan Province (at that time) in a summer day of a year when the Fatherland Liberation War was at its height. There he learned that pupils were studying in a classroom in a remote mountain village as there was no school there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Instructing officials to build a school by taking into good account labor force, building materials and transport means, he proposed to choose its site in a sunny and safe place and build floor-heated rooms so that pupils might not feel cold in winter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At a time when even a combatant was badly needed on the front where hard-fought battles were going on, many soldiers of the people's army were engaged in the construction of the school and military trucks transported building materials instead of running to the front. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was under this deep care of the president that the school appeared at the foot of the mountain overgrown with chestnut trees and schoolchildren in the village could study in the sunny classrooms.     \r\n\r\n"

Only when the Koreans advance under the uplifted banner of the June 15 joint declaration can they join hands with each other and usher in an era of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only by holding aloft the banner of national independence, can the Koreans defend the peace of the country and the security of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialist hawkish forces are busy with preparations for a war against the DPRK after declaring a \"nuclear preemptive attack\" as a policy and singling the DPRK out as its target. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is clear what consequences will be entailed when the U.S. imperialists' moves to invade the DPRK are left unchecked. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is possible to prevent a new war and create a peaceful environment for national reunification only when the whole nation unites in the spirit of the June 15 joint declaration to decisively shatter the U.S. imperialists' moves for a war and vigorously carry on the anti-U.S. and anti-war struggle.     \r\n\r\n"
