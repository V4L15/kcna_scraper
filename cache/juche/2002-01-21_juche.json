The secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland said this in its information bulletin no. 814.\r\n He, bluffing as if he would be \"president\" from the beginning of the New Year, disparaged the present authorities' stand towards inter-Korean relations and clamoured for keeping the \"three principles\" such as \"strategic reciprocity, national agreement and the verification of transparency\" in inter-Korean relations, the bulletin said, and went on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Never should it go unnoticed that he dared pull up the DPRK, talking about \"terrorism\" and \"the settlement of the issue concerning weapons of mass destruction,\" which gets on the nerve of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He betrayed the true colours of his human scum fawning on the U.S. master. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is clear that if such an anti-reunification element as Ri Hoe Chang who does not care for the improvement of the inter-Korean relations and the peaceful reunification of the country comes into power, the June 15 joint declaration would not be implemented in conformity with the desire of the entire nation and the military tensions in the Korean peninsula be aggravated to bring about war holocaust. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He should apologize to the nation for his anti-national crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean people should sternly judge and ostracize such anti-north, anti-reunification forces as Ri Hoe Chang for the implementation of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration.    \r\n\r\n"

He instructed the officials to make a radical switchover in the city construction plan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One day Kim Il Sung saw a rare hen in his garden. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It looked like an ornamental hen with the lower part of its leg covered with long different colored feathers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Seeing it with keen interest, he asked an official how many eggs the hen lays a year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On hearing from him that it lays about 80 eggs a year, the president said that he had no interest in that hen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said he would come everyday to see any hen which lays many eggs even though it looked ugly. He earnestly told that there should be a hen capable of laying hundreds of eggs a year in order to supply more eggs to the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While visiting a factory one hot summer day he stopped before a worker at welding. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hearing someone standing before him, the welder stopped working and rose to his feet, quite at a loss. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the president offered a handshake to him without reserve, appreciating what he has done, he stepped back hesitating to respond to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the president warmly shook the welder's hand, saying that there was no need for him to care as his hands were also stained with oil.    \r\n\r\n"
