Korea's Attempted Terrorism against DPRK Denounced Abroad \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, August 1 (KCNA) -- Marwan Sudah, chairman of the Arab Committee for Solidarity with Korean People and Supporting the Reunification of Korea, contributed an article to the Jordanian newspaper Al-Diyar on July 23 in which he condemned the U.S. imperialists and south Korean puppet regime for attempting heinous terrorism against the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t The article accused the U.S. and its allies of hatching world-shocking plots against the DPRK, conveying accounts of a recent press conference held with a terrorist who was arrested while attempting to destroy statues in the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The press conference accused the U.S. and its stooges of openly interfering in internal affairs of the DPRK, throwing them into a tight corner, and dealt a heavy blow at the U.S. and its followers, the article noted, and continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. Administration and intelligence agencies provide the anti- DPRK plot-breeding organizations with a huge amount of fund every year. This is clearly proved by the fact that the \"special envoy for the human rights issue in north Korea\" of the U.S. State Department said during his south Korea trip in June that the U.S. would provide 10 million U.S. dollars to those organizations active for destabilizing the DPRK this year. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hideous subversive and sabotage activities against the DPRK are war actions little short of direct invasion of it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and south Korea are wholly to blame for having strained the situation on the Korean Peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite impossible for the DPRK to dismantle its nukes under the present situation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will comprehensively reexamine the nuclear issue and steadily bolster up nuclear deterrence to frustrate the moves of all those meddlers and their stooges and defend the dignity and sovereignty of the country."
