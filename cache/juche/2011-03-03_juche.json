So the settlement of it through reconciliation has been recognized as the most common and reasonable solution. Hence, the Tokyo High Court recommended the above-said corporation to solve the issue of Chongryon-related facilities including the Hall of its Central Standing Committee through reconciliation. This notwithstanding, the Japanese authorities instructed the corporation to unilaterally scrap the reconciliation proposal. This is a politically motivated grave suppression disregarding the commonly accepted practice concerning the bond issue and an outrageous national discrimination. Provisional seizure is a measure taken by a creditor to preserve the property of a debtor until the court's ruling is confirmed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The Japanese authorities kicked up much fuss after raising this issue again a few months before the High Court's decision though the action taken to provisionally seize the above-said facilities in June, 2007 was an unjust attitude. This brought to light their sinister political intention to grab Chongryon-related facilities at any cost.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries persistently conducted an anti-Chongryon campaign, regarding its activities as a thorn in their flesh in the past, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is that in 2006, 24 cities of Japan announced that they would repeal or reduce the measures to exempt the taxes for Chongryon-related facilities against the backdrop of the whirlwind of anti-DPRK and anti-Chongryon sanctions and the Tokyo District Court ruled that the land and buildings of the Central Standing Committee of Chongryon should be sold by auction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These facts go to prove that the Japanese reactionaries' campaigns to destroy Chongryon including their moves to grab its facilities have never ceased as they are steeped in bitterness towards Chongryon and Koreans in Japan to the marrow of their bones. This awful terrorism has been ceaselessly perpetrated in various parts of Japan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Chongryon is a legitimate organization of overseas citizens of the DPRK formed to protect the democratic national rights of the Koreans in Japan, the directive victims of the forcible drafting of Koreans committed by the Japanese imperialists in the past, and their descendants. The issue of Chongryon is a sensitive political issue directly related to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan should prudently handle the issue of Chongryon-related facilities as a political matter, bearing in mind that any action to destroy Chongryon precisely means the one against the DPRK."

It was followed by the Yonphyong Island shelling incident, another dangerous military provocation against the DPRK, in November.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With these two incidents as a momentum, the south Korean warmongers went to the extremes in their moves to do harm to the DPRK and ignite a new war against it and the situation in Korea was so tense that a war might break out at any moment.
