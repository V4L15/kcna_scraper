Worse still, a third country poked its nose into  this issue, alleging that the DPRK should allow the \"inspection.\"\r\n   Commenting on this, a news analyst of rodong sinmun today says:\r\n   We make it clear that we have no underground nuclear facility. If any, it is only for civilian purposes.\r\n   Quinones, who had long served as an official in charge of the DPRK issue at the U.S. Department of State, visited Nyongbyon and Unsan of the DPRK, during which he saw at first hand the site of the \"underground nuclear facility\" which they say was picked up by a U.S. intelligence satellite, and concluded that the site is one of underground structures which can be seen in all parts of North Korea.\r\n   Nevertheless, U.S. conservative hardliners are continuously spreading rumours about \"underground nuclear facility.\" \r\n   What they seek in this is to disarm the DPRK. \r\n   Accordingly, we will never tolerate its scheme.\r\n   If the United States is allowed to \"inspect\" one of our underground facilities for the present, it will urge us to allow \"inspections\" of ten or twenty facilities, taking it as a precedent. After all, its demand for \"inspection\" means to search all our inside in this way.\r\n   Their shameless and wicked demand is an open infringement upon our sovereignty and wanton interference in our internal affairs.\r\n   If the United States persists in \"inspecting\" our underground facility, it will bring irretrievable consequences to the U.S. itself.\r\n   We are not in the least fearful of the U.S. threats that if the \"inspection\" of the \"underground nuclear facility\" is not allowed,  the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework will face a crisis.\r\n   If the U.S. breaks the framework, we will have the next option. \r\n\r\n"

Those excesses give rise to indignation from the Korean people.\r\n   The afore-said violation of human rights is inconceivable for men of normal brains on the threshold of the 21st century. To Japan, however, the shocking crime is nothing new. It is an inevitable product of the hostile policy pursued by the Japanese reactionaries against the Korean people. It is part of the anti-DPRK, anti-Chongryon campaign which is getting all the more pronounced in the wake of the DPRK's launch of artificial satellite. The Japanese authorities are conniving at the campaign.\r\n   That is why the developments deserve bitterer condemnation from the Korean people as well as the international community.\r\n   Japan was criticised for its criminal violation of human rights, including the wanton violation of human rights of Koreans in Japan, at the UN and other international meetings in October.\r\n   Japan, far from repenting of its past crimes, still remains hell-bent on criminal violation of human rights.\r\n   It still refuses to atone for its past of indelible crimes against the Korean people. If it continues frantic anti-DPRK, anti-Chongryon campaign, its authorities will wholly be held responsible for all the consequences therefrom.\r\n   The Japanese authorities should be aware of this. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

So there is no reason and excuse to slander the paper.\r\n   The slander is based on the sinister anti-north confrontation stand, which fully reveals that Chosun Ilbo is a cancer lying in the way of great national unity.\r\n   It is very natural that the \"National Council of Professors for Democratization\" and other press, academic and public circles in South Korea branded Chosun Ilbo's behaviour as an unreasonable act encroaching upon the idea and freedom of learning.\r\n   Chosun Ilbo, which is trying to revive the ghost of fascism, must be removed from the South Korean press for the sake of making South Korean society independent and democratic and for achieving national reunification. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Underlying the insistence is an insidious attempt of the Japanese reactionaries.\r\n   They scheme to turn Japan into a military power and, on this basis, invade the DPRK and other Asian nations and, furthermore, jump into the scramble for domination over the whole world.\r\n   They are employing every possible means to justify their moves for turning Japan into a military power and for overseas expansion and carry them into practice at whatever cost.\r\n   But, their dream can not be realized.\r\n   The Korean people and People's Army are keenly keeping their eyes on the crafty moves of the Japanese reactionaries.\r\n   If they persist in slandering the DPRK for the purpose of realizing their insidious design,  the Korean people and People's Army will revenge upon them a thousandfold with powerful military counteraction. \r\n\r\n"

Among them are anecdotes on his promises.\r\n   On October 20, he gave on-the-spot guidance to the Huichon General Machine Tool Plant again.\r\n   The officials and employees of the plant were pleased with the fact that he visited it, as he promised ordinary workers.\r\n   Visiting the plant on June 1, he expressed the expectation that the workers of the plant would display a heroic spirit once again in the forced march for the final victory. And he set a goal of producing machine tools, saying if this task was carried out, he would visit the plant again. \r\n   Encouraged by his deep love and trust, the workers carried out the task with credit before the 50th anniversary of the DPRK.\r\n   Informed of this he expressed great satisfaction and revisited the plant.\r\n   One day in April a few years ago, he gave on-site guidance to the Kangdong Precision Machine Factory. Informed that the workers of the factory were going to build more dwelling houses without financial help from the state, he indicated the orientation and took necessary steps for its materialisation. And he said if a new village was built, he would certainly call at it.\r\n   After this,  the workers of the factory built more than 130 flats of some 60 apartments in 100 days, and sent him a letter carrying a photograph of the flats.  Keeping his promise with them, he visited the newly-built flats, congratulated the workers upon moving to new houses and showed deep solicitude for them.\r\n   He also called on women coastal artillery company soldiers, the children of the Mangyongdae Revolutionary School and the people in Taehongdan county as he promised. \r\nThese are patent proof of the bonds of kinship between the leader and people.\r\n   The anecdotes created during ceaseless on-site guidance show the noble loving care of Kim Jong Il, who believes in the people as in heaven and puts them forward, and the unbounded loyalty of the Korean people to him. \r\n\r\n"
