            "content": "Lee Myung Bak Group's Anti-DPRK Human Rights Racket Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 29 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland on Sept. 28 issued a statement blasting the puppet State Human Rights Committee of south Korea for officially announcing its decision to set up the \"Special Committee on Human Rights of North\" on Sept. 24 while finding fault with the \"human rights performance\" in the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  No sooner had the \"bill on re-approving the North Korean Human Rights Act\" calling for extending the \"act\" till 2012 passed through the U.S. Senate, a typical manifestation of the hostile policy toward the DPRK, than the Lee Myung Bak group instructed the \"State Human Rights Committee\" to announce its decision to form the special committee and operate it. This once again laid bare the true colors of the group as sycophants toward the U.S. and maniacs inciting confrontation with the DPRK as they have been hell-bent on the smear campaign against it since the very day of their seizure of power, pursuant to the U.S. anti-DPRK human rights racket. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Particularly, we cannot but take a more serious note of the fact that the above-said rash decision was made as a measure taken after traitor Lee blustered \"he would push for the solution of the human rights issue in the north\" while echoing the anti-DPRK human rights rhetoric let loose by his master Bush during his junket to south Korea in August. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There can be no \"human rights issue\" under the popular masses-centered Korean-style socialist system and it has never existed in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If there be any in Korea, this issue exists in south Korea only where a dark fascist rule is in force under the U.S. military occupation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A particular mention should be made of the fact that after the Lee group came to power a fascist repressive system was revived in south Korea and even the people's elementary democratic rights and freedom have since been ruthlessly trampled upon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The traitorous group's racket over \"human rights issue in the north\" was prompted by their sinister intention to divert elsewhere the people's resentment against them touched off by sycophancy and treachery, fascist suppression and economic bankruptcy and thus get rid of the political chaos and crisis and dampen the desire for reunification in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will never tolerate those who seek to push the north-south relations to acute confrontation while slandering and defaming the socialist political system which represents its dignity and life and soul, but sternly punish them. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S. imperialists' Asian strategy for aggression is, in essence, a strategy for military intervention and war aimed at invading the DPRK and containing big powers in Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday observes this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is beyond any doubt that the U.S. imperialists seek to hurl their aggressor forces in their mainland into the Korean front in \"case of emergency\" and achieve their goal of invading the DPRK with ease while keeping them in the Asia-Pacific region near the Korean Peninsula on a permanent basis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose forces' above-said scenario clearly indicates in what premeditated manner they are working to round off the preparations for provoking the second Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. attempt to make a preemptive attack upon the DPRK is a perfidious act of reneging on the provisions of the agreement adopted at the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. stepped-up moves to mount a preemptive attack upon the DPRK would only reinforce the will of the DPRK to bolster the war deterrent in every way. Its people will never tolerate any move to infringe upon the sovereignty of the country. The DPRK will further boost its self-reliant defence capability as the U.S. imperialists' criminal scenario for making a preemptive strike at the DPRK has become clear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose forces would be well advised to properly understand who their rival is and roll back the above-said scenario. \r\n\r\n"

It is beyond doubt that only when all the Koreans firmly maintain the principle of independence in the movement for national reunification in the idea of \"By our nation itself\", the basic spirit of the joint declaration, can they bring about a decisive phase of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Holding higher the banner of the joint declaration is also a realistic requirement for waging the movement for national reunification nationwide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The foreign aggressors who divided Korea cannot bring reunification to the Korean nation and it is absolutely impossible to settle the issue of national reunification as long as they are allowed to interfere in the issues of the nation. National reunification can be achieved only through a nationwide struggle of the Koreans who ardently desire national reunification and have enough strength and wisdom to attain it. This is the very lesson and truth taught by the history of the tragedy of national division to the Koreans. That is why all the Koreans in the north and the south and abroad should turn out as one in the struggle for national reunification under the banner of the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter how the situation and circumstances may change in the future, the movement for national reunification will make dynamic progress thanks to the strong mental power of the Korean nation advancing under the uplifted banner of the joint declaration.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
