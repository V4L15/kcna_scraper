Monday for adorning the 50th anniversary of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\r\n   In the calls, they say the founding of the DPRK by President Kim Il Sung on September 9, Juche 37 (1948) was a historic event that opened a new epoch of building a socialist state centred on the masses of people.\r\n   They express firm belief that the party members, people's army soldiers and all other people of korea will join in the great forced march for the prosperity of the socialist motherland with indomitable revolutionary spirit and warm patriotism and adorn the national day this year with a

people and in reliance on them, as wished by President Kim Il Sung.\r\n   Referring to the WPK's motto \"the people are god\", they call for turning the whole society into a united and karmonious large family of socialism under the benevolent, magnanimous politics of the WPK.\r\n   They call for intensifying ideological education so that the party members and all other working people can be intensely loyal and dutiful to the party and the leader.\r\n   Especially, they call for imbuing the whole society with the red flag spirit of the party, living in the Korean way and giving full play to the Korean-nation-first spirit.\r\n   They also call for enhancing the class awakening among the party members and other working people and invigorating the class struggle against all sorts of enemy's activities in the rigorous situation today.\r\n   They refer to the party's idea of attaching importance to military affairs.\r\n   The revolutionary bayonet is a guarantee for the security of the country and the people and the destiny of socialism, they say, putting forward concrete tasks to consolidate the military foothold of Korean socialism as an impregnable fortress.\r\n   They call

human bombs and suicide squads in the battle to defend our respected supreme commander General Kim Jong Il with our lives  \"You must answer the appeasement strategy of imperialism with revolutionary

infiltration of the yellow wind of capitalism into the minds of the people.\r\n   They call upon working people's organisations to uphold the leadership of the party.\r\n   They call upon the young people unfailingly loyal to the revolutionary cause of the party to  firmly grasp the relay baton of revolution and carry forward the revolutionary cause of Juche generation after generation.\r\n

march for the final victory.\r\n   They say:\r\n   \"Let us become honorable victors in the forced march in hearty response to the call of the party, upholding the slogan 'When the party is determined, we can do anything '    \"Let us ride Chollima again to vie with time    \"Let us follow the example of the Songjin Steel Complex to effect a new great Chollima upswing in socialist construction    \"Let us stand true to our party's basic line of socialist economic construction and fully demonstrate the potentials of the independent national economy with heavy industries at the core \"\r\n   In the calls, the WPK Central Committee and the WPK Central Military Commission ask the whole party, the whole country and all the people to concentrate on agriculture, coal industry, electric power industry, railway transport and metal industry, the main fronts of socialist economic construction.\r\n   They say the agricultrual front is as important in socialist economic construction as height 1211 was during the last Korean War, and call for pooling nationwide efforts to do farming and directing all the efforts to carrying through the agriculture-first policy of their party.\r\n   They call upon working people in the industrial domain to demonstrate their heroic spirit again in the ongoing forced march for the final victory as they did when building socialism on the war ruins in the 1950s.\r\n   They call for building up Pyongyang into a  more grandiose and wonderful capital city and for turning the country into a land as beautiful as a golden tapestry good to live in through successful land development and management.\r\n   They call upon scientists and technicians to firmly defend and add lustre to Korean socialism with science and technology.\r\n   They say for the victory in the forced march to defend the socialist fortress firmly it is necessary to give full play to the revolutionary spirit of servicemen, and call for imbuing all the people with this  spirit to create something from nothing and bring about miracles and innovations.\r\n   In the calls, they say:\r\n   \"Self-reliance is the only way out. To live through self-reliance on this land under this sky is our party's fixed stand and its invariable way of making revolution.\"\r\n   The Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and the WPK Central Military Commission call for strictly rejecting an iota of capitalism in economic management, standing true to the Juche-based principle of socialist economic management and fully displaying the advantages of the planned economy.\r\n   They call on all officials to change their habit of work so that the spirit of the forced march may sweep the whole country.\r\n   They call for pushing ahead with cultural development, bringing socialist national culture of Juche into full bloom, radically improving the quality of education and creating more works and music as masterpieces of the era.\r\n   They call for carrying out the instructions of President Kim Il Sung for national reunification.\r\n   They call for holding fast to the three major charters of national reunification and joining in the nationwide struggle for the reunification of the country.\r\n   They urge the South Korean authorities to make a bold decision to replace the anti-north confrontation policy with a pro-north reconciliation policy.\r\n   They call on the 70 million Koreans to uphold  leader of the nation General Kim Jong Il as the lodestar of national reunification, join in the patriotic cause of reunification and hand a unified country to posterity. \r\n   They refer to the tasks to develop international relations, saying:\r\n   \"Let us unite firmly with all people of the world who advocate independence.\"\r\n   \"Let us strengthen solidarity with all the revolutionary parties and progressive peoples  of the world and defend and Push ahead with the socialist cause under the banner of the Pyongyang Declaration.\"\r\n   \"Let us strengthen the nonaligned movement under the banner of anti-imperialism and independence.\"  \"Let us check the arbitrariness of imperialism in international relations, democratize international politics and establish a fair international order and new economic order \"\r\n   The Korean people are determined to complete the Juche revolution under the eternal banner of the DPRK, they say, adding: \"Let us see who laughs last.

In March it reorganized the U.S. 8th Army in South Korea into a field army system and decided on an additional supply to the South Korean puppets of 168 long-distance multiple rocket launchers, 112 new-type launchers and other sophisticated combat equipment.\r\n   The facts show that a war may break out on the Korean peninsula any moment due to the U.S. warmaniacs' arms buildup.\r\n   Though the united states is paying lip-service to peace on the Korean peninsula, its invariable aggressive design  and military policy against the DPRK remain unchanged.\r\n   If the United States is truly interested in peace on the peninsula, it should withdraw its aggression forces from South Korea and its vicinity. Only then, can the danger of war be removed and an atmosphere of peace created on the peninsula.\r\n   We do not want war. But we never tolerate anyone who tries to hurt the dignity of our nation and the sovereignty of our country.\r\n   If the United States persistently seeks war and confrontation, ignoring our efforts for peace, our people and army will answer its aggression with a thousandfold retalitation.    \r\n        \r\n\r\n"

This more urgently requires that the principle of national independence be observed.\r\n   South Korean politicians who truly want to take the road of patriotism for the country and the nation must not follow their predecessors' political mode of depending on outsiders but make a  resolute decision to solve the reunification issue, the internal affair of the nation, in concert with the fellow countrymen.\r\n   The United States should give up their aggressive ambition to stifle the DPRK by force of arms, withdraw its troops from South Korea and refrain from doing things obstructive to the peace and reunification of the Korean peninsula and national unity.\r\n   If the South Korean authorities make no policy switchover and give lip service to dialogue, they cannot bring a good result to the nation.\r\n   If the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
