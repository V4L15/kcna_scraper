            "content": "Kim Jong Il Provides Field Guidance to Salmon Breeding Institute\r\nPyongyang, October 19 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il gave on-site guidance to the Salmon Breeding Institute.\n\t\t\t\t\t He made the rounds of an artificial insemination room, a room for spawn growth, a laboratory, a feed processing room and other places of the institute to acquaint himself in detail with its construction and researches there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After going round the interior and exterior of the neatly-built institute, he noted that the institute stands in a good place and has been well built as required by the new century. And he highly estimated the laudable feats performed by soldier-builders, expressing his great satisfaction over the fact that they have successfully built the modern fish breeding institute in a matter of one year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Seeing the research processes equipped with ultra-modern facilities and shoals of young salmons in each breeding pond at the institute, he was very pleased to learn that its employees opened up a bright prospect of breeding salmon in a big way. He praised them for having done a lot of work. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The party members and other working people of the institute are front rankers in the drive for self-reliance and ardent patriots as they have created everything from nothing and devoted themselves to the development and prosperity of the country, he said, urging all other units to earnestly learn from their revolutionary and go-ahead work style. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He advanced highly important tasks to be carried out by the institute.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that to actively conserve and propagate marine resources is a noble patriotic work for developing the national economy and improving the people's standard of living by increasing the production of marine products.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that salmon is a species suitable for fish breeding which makes it possible to mass-produce high quality fish with less feed as it is not only tasty but grows itself in sea waters after the release of fries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our country has favorable conditions for salmon breeding as it has many rivers and lakes and is surrounded by seas, he said, underscoring the need to bring about a fresh turn in the salmon breeding by conducting it in a big way under an ambitious plan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that in order to increase the production of salmons it is necessary to find out all places good for the ecological environment of salmon for the purpose of building more salmon breeding farms and, at the same time, put its breeding on an industrial, scientific and organized basis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underlined the need to pay deep attention to arranging river-beds so that salmons may move freely.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that it is necessary to take in advance measures for processing salmons in keeping with the expected increase in the salmon production, he underscored the need for the breeding farms to have in place equipment enough to produce a variety of processed salmon such as canned salmon and canned salmon roe.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He earnestly called on all sectors and units to continue pushing ahead with the fish breeding in an effort to rapidly boost the production of freshwater fish and provide people with greater quantities of tasty and nutritious salmon in the era of the Workers' Party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Secretaries Choe Thae Bok and Kim Ki Nam, Department Director Jang Song Thaek and First Vice Department Director Ri Je Gang of the WPK Central Committee and Generals of the Korean People's Army Hyon Chol Hae and Ri Myong Su."

If the situation is allowed to go on, the tension will escalate and invite even a national disaster in the end. Without eradicating the conception of confrontation is it impossible to improve the inter-Korean relations nor is it possible to achieve peace and the reunification of the country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the deep-rooted conception of confrontation is to be done away with in south Korea it is necessary to have an attitude of respecting and accepting \"By our nation itself,\" an idea of independence and unity, as an idea of reunification common to the nation. One should not pay lip-service to improved north-south relations but accept the idea of \"By our nation itself\" as a genuine patriotic idea and work in the direction of national reconciliation and unity, guided by it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The north and the south have valuable experience of having achieved concord and unity, guided by the idea of \"By our nation itself\" in line with the spirit of the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration and improved the inter-Korean relations and advanced the cause of national reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When Koreans handle all the problems in the spirit of \"By our nation itself,\" bravely doing away with the old idea of confrontation, there will be an epochal turn in the work for improving the north-south relations and accomplishing the cause of national reunification."
