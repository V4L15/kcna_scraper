And the trait of assisting the army is being brought into full play. Many units across the country are daily assisting the army after the publication of the statement of the spokesman for the KPA general staff.\r\n   There is no change in the slogan of the Workers' Party of Korea calling for struggling with a rifle in one hand and with a hammer and sickle in the other as long as the imperialists remain.\r\n   The army and people are waiting for the order of the Supreme Commander, with full readiness for battle.\r\n   Five years ago when the order on proclaiming the semi-war state across the country was issued, the servicemen held their trenches all at once and more than 1.5 million young people volunteered for service in the army and all the people reliably defended their trenches. This showed that Korea does not make empty words. \r\n \r\n"

Now, over 10 million regular and irregular armed forces of South Korea are waiting for an order, fully ready for action against the north.\r\n   His utterances that a peace system can be established only when the north is overpowered with military strength are provocative remarks which can be made only by a warmonger.\r\n   The Korean peninsula is now under the touch-and-go situation because the U.S. imperialists and their stooges have placed huge aggression forces in readiness to unleash a war against the DPRK under the pretext of \"preventing threats of southward invasion.\"\r\n   At this very juncture, Kim Jong Pil alleged that a \"peace system\" could be established only when the north is \"overpowered.\"\r\n   This illogical allegation means that peace can be ensured only through an anti-north war.\r\n   We will make Kim Jong Pil pay dearly for his venomous and provocative words. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
