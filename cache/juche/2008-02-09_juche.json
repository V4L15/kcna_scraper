            "content": "Projected U.S.-S. Korea Joint Military Exercises under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 8 (KCNA) -- The United States and the south Korean bellicose forces are planning to stage \"Key Resolve\" and \"Foal Eagle\" joint military exercises throughout south Korea from March 2 to 7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard a spokesman for the Korean National Peace Committee made public a statement on Feb. 6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement branded this plan as a grave military provocation against the DPRK and an extremely dangerous criminal move as it is driving to confrontation and brink of war the situation of the Korean Peninsula going toward independent reunification, peace and prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and the south Korean military are claiming that the exercises are intended mainly for \"defence\" and they are not of provocative nature. But, such argument is no more than unreasonable sophism designed to cover up their aggressive nature and mislead public opinion at home and abroad, the statement said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"Key Resolve\" joint military exercises to be carried out in keeping pace with \"Foal Eagle\", ill-famed saber-rattling to invade the DPRK, are little different from the precedent joint exercises \"Team Spirit\" or \"RSOI\" in terms of scale and aggressive nature, though they differ in name. On the contrary they are more dangerous exercises for war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their provocative and dangerous nature is redoubling as they are to be staged under the situation that the U.S. military brass-hats are letting loose one after another bellicose remarks threatening and blackmailing the DPRK and efforts are being made to modernize arms and equipment of the U.S. forces in south Korea and beef up the latest armed forces in and around south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should stop at once its reckless war moves against the DPRK, drop its anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK and immediately withdraw its imperialist aggression forces, the very source of tense situation and danger of war on the Korean Peninsula, from south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean war-like forces would be held fully accountable for the consequences to be entailed by their joining in the U.S. scheme for military pressure upon the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This highest order would be conferred only on extraordinary military activists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A ceremony of awarding the order took place at the DPRK embassy in Moscow on Feb. 5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The order and its certificate and belt were conveyed to the DPRK ambassador by the president of the academy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Written on the certificate are the following letters: \"'Dmitri Donskoi' Order is awarded to Comrade Kim Jong Il, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, in recognition of his distinguished contribution to the strengthening of cooperation between the DPRK and the Russian Federation and great personal devotion to ensuring the global peace. President V. Shevchenko. The February 5, 2008, decision of the Presidium of the National Committee for Social Commendation. Order No. 008. Moscow .\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Speeches were made at the ceremony. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The president of the academy said that it is due appraisal of Kim Jong Il's immortal exploits for the development of the Russia-DPRK relations and global peace and an expression of deep respect for him to award the order to him in the wake of the conferment of the \"Petr the Great\" Order Class 1 and the titles of academician and professor of the academy in Pyongyang in 2003. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these orders and honorary titles were awarded by the academy under the direct concern of President Putin, he said, adding that figure 8 in the number of the order certificate means infinity and it represents the fact that Kim Jong Il would always remain the great leader of the Korean people and the outstanding statesman of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dmitri Yazov, former defence minister of the Soviet Union, said that there is no such supreme commander in the world as Kim Jong Il who always takes deep care of the servicepersons' living and visits the units on the forefront during his ceaseless inspection of the front.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. One-sided Hardline Policy Denounced \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 8 (KCNA) -- The U.S. hardline conservative forces are nowadays making outcries that the U.S. should show its \"will\" through the one-sided hardline policy and put the \"human rights\" issue on the table of negotiations for the settlement of the nuclear issue to intensify pressure upon the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the meantime they call for providing dialogues at all levels to establish the missile defence system involving the U.S., Japan and Australia and closely cooperate with one another. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary terms their ill-minded remarks an act of going against dialogue and peace aimed to strengthen the pressure upon the DPRK through the high-handed policy and destroy the process of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and thus drive the situation back to that before the six-party talks, instead of seeking a negotiated solution to the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The attitude of the U.S. hardline conservative forces against dialogue and negotiation is a manifestation of their way of thinking in the Cold War era, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. hardline conservative forces are playing a tacit trick, turning aside from the reality with the wrong viewpoint. Lurking behind such actions is a sinister purpose to extremely sharpen the DPRK-U.S. relations and create an international environment favorable for the realization of their hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It can be typically evidenced by the fact that they are scheming to expand the sphere of MD by enlisting not only Japan but Australia in it. The high-handed attitude of the U.S. hardline conservatives, who attach more importance to the military tough policy than to dialogue, is an expression of their unilateralism and supremacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they continue to persist in one-sided hardline policy, the DPRK will be compelled to take due countermeasures. The DPRK has no debt to the U.S. The one-for-one principle is the DPRK's way of counteraction and it is its stand that if one do a thing for the other, latter would do the same. The DPRK never allows anything of defaming its self-confidence and dignity to be done. The U.S. hardline conservative forces should give up their one-sided tough policy, well aware of the DPRK's unshakable principle and will. The one-sided hardline policy will bring no good but only harm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. hardline conservative forces drive the situation of the Korean Peninsula and the DPRK-U.S. relations to the worst phase, persistently refusing to find a negotiated solution to the issue, the efforts made so far will come to naught and the U.S. would be chiefly to blame for the results.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Paektu Association for Independent Development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The work \"Let Us Carry Out the Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung's Instructions for National Reunification\", published on August 4, Juche 86 (1997), deals with the undying feats performed by President Kim Il Sung in the cause of national reunification. It formulates the three principles of national reunification, the ten-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation and the proposal for founding the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo as the three charters for national reunification and clarifies the tasks and ways for accomplishing the cause of national reunification based on the charters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The work \"Giving Priority to Ideological Work Is Essential for Accomplishing Socialism\", published on June 19, Juche 84 (1995), elucidates the idea that priority should be given to the ideological work to successfully accomplish the cause of socialism. Also clarified in it is the idea that the basic mission of the ideological work is to model the whole society on the socialist ideology and the ideological work should be conducted in the principle and way suited to the intrinsic demand of socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A congratulatory message to Kim Jong Il was adopted at the work- releasing ceremony held in Moscow on Feb. 1.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
