            "content": "CPRK Secretariat Slams S. Korean DM's Anti-DPRK Remarks\r\n Pyongyang, September 19 (KCNA) -- Traitor Kim Kwan Jin, Defense minister of south Korea at a \"defense policy briefing\" in Inchon on September 15 said the \"north plans the fourth generation war envisaging disrupting society through cyber warfare, media warfare and terrorism in collusion with the forces following the north\", alleging that the plotted rebellion of the Unified Progressive Party can be viewed as preparations for it.\n\t\t\t\t\t He also termed the measure taken by the DPRK on its own initiative to improve the north-south ties a \"tactical dialogue offensive to get rid of difficult situation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the plenary meeting of the national defense committee of the puppet National Assembly, the meeting of army commanders and the \"Seoul international military symposium\" that were held earlier the traitor made such coarse invectives that the \"north's nukes can never be tolerated\", \"there is precedence of the north making provocations when the dialogue was under way\" and the \"north will get nothing from nuke, missile and provocation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) in the information bulletin No. 1041 on Wednesday termed this an anachronistic act going against the trend of the times toward improvement of the north-south ties and detente, and an unpardonable mockery and challenge to the DPRK making sincere efforts for national reconciliation and reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The bulletin branded the traitor as a die-hard pro-U.S. flunkey and trigger-happy hooligan who inflamed war frenzy against the north, plunged the north-south ties into deadlock and created the worst danger of war on the Korean Peninsula while acting as a henchman executing the U.S. strategy to dominate Asia and a shock brigade in carrying out the puppet regime's anti-DPRK policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The traitor is repeating provocative remarks against the DPRK. This is aimed to convert the detente being created on the Korean Peninsula to tensions and confrontation, being displeased with the new dialogue phase opening up in the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation proves that as long as such die-hard confrontational maniacs as Kim Kwan Jin lord it over in south Korea, the north-south ties can not improve as expected by the nation but the situation will get strained on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the present south Korean authorities are slandering the good faith, magnanimity and will for dialogue and peace shown by the fellow countrymen and blatantly challenging them. They are speaking loudly of \"trust-building process on the Korean Peninsula\" while shielding Kim Kwan Jin and other traitors. This can not but be viewed as hypocrisy and deception to mislead the public opinion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK already warned that the Korean nation will suffer in case the south Korean regime allows the traitor to stay in office as defense minister.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to make fresh progress in the north-south relations and bring peace and stability to the peninsula, it is essential to remove such leftovers of the era like Kim Kwan Jin who is inviting disaster.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will make all possible efforts for the improvement of the north-south ties and the national reconciliation and peace. But it will never pardon the group of traitors who are making provocations while making a mockery of the dignity of the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those who go reckless against the trend of the times will never be able to evade stern punishment by the nation."
