            "content": "Head of DPRK Delegation on Tasks before NAM \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- The Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) is required to intensify its activities to actively meet fresh challenges and cope with new changes.\r\n Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Choe Su Hon who is heading the DPRK delegation said this, clarifying the DPRK's stand on the matter at the ministerial meeting of the Coordinating Bureau of the NAM on May 30.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK government has consistently maintained the unshakable stand to remain true to the fundamental principle and idea of the NAM, he noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK delegation is of the view that the current meeting should pay particular attention to the following issues that should be solved to define the orientation of the movement for meeting new challenges and boost its capability for actions: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n First, the movement should further strengthen unity and solidarity in the struggle to protect the sovereignty of its member states. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To strengthen the unity and solidarity among the member states of the movement presents itself as a more urgent issue today when some forces are posing a grave threat to the sovereignty of member states by perpetrating invasion and interference in their internal affairs and enforcing a unilateral high-handed policy towards them in contravention of the principles of the movement and international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The member states of the NAM should intensify the joint actions to ensure that the principle of respect for sovereignty in handling major pending international issues such as disarmament, human rights, anti-terrorism and UN reform is fully observed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Second, the NAM is required to pay a deep attention to categorically rejecting the double standards in the international relations at present and ensuring that the principle of equality and impartiality is observed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is openly pursuing a double-dealing discriminative policy, while shunning the fulfillment of its commitment to nuclear disarmament under international law and working hard to deter other countries from conducting nuclear activities for a peaceful purpose. It has gone the lengths of openly threatening them with preemptive nuclear strikes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These high-handed practices of the U.S. are rendering the international nuclear non-proliferation regime including the NPT useless and encouraging the non-nuclear states to have access to nuclear deterrent for self-defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The NAM is called upon to heighten caution against the adverse consequences of the use of these dangerous double standards in the international relations and take united actions against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Third, efforts should be exerted to strengthen the NAM and reenergize its activities in the direction of remaining true to its objective and idea and reinforcing the unity and solidarity among its member states. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter how complicated the situation may get they should seek better ways of advancing the movement in the direction of upholding the fundamental idea and principle and boosting the unity and solidarity among them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this context we deem it important to adhere to the principle of carrying forward and developing the traditional work method whereby the NAM has displayed its vitality and united might over the last several decades thanks to the efforts of the member states to improve the method.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Paektu President Kim Il Sung staged while making a long journey of anti-Japanese bloody battles for twenty years. And it was a historic journey in which he created fresh styles and methods of the party's ideological work to bring up the younger generation into reliable heirs to the Juche cause by thoroughly arming them with the glorious revolutionary traditions of the WPK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They called upon the officials and researchers in the field of social sciences to further deepen the researches into the greatness of the three generals of Mt.

This idea is very just and realistic as it is based on the essence of the issue of reunification and reflects the unanimous desire and intention of all Koreans.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a by-lined article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when the dignity and interests of the nation are placed above anything else and firmly defended can the members of the nation have the true pride and honor of independent humankind, the article says, calling for retaking the dignity and interests of the whole nation by putting an end to the domination and interference of the outsiders in south Korea and reunifying the country as early as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea of the joint editorial is the just and patriotic idea that calls forth sympathy from the whole nation, the article points out, and says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Defending the idea of \"By our nation itself\" is essential to implementing the idea of the joint editorial. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All members of the nation should make it an iron rule to resolve all the problems arising in the inter-Korean relations and the reunification of the country in the idea of \"By our nation itself\".

It also described this as another base and vicious political terrorism intended to ostracize the main players who contributed to the landmark event of signing the historic north-south joint declaration in a bid to serve the purposes of the U.S. and the Grand National Party of south Korea to divide and weaken the forces supporting the June 15 joint declaration   and forces for progressive reforms and set up a pro-American conservative \"regime\" in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement continued: The south Korean judicial authorities should behave with discretion, well aware that it is the era of the June 15 era of independent reunification, not the time when the U.S. and the ultra-right conservative forces brandished the swords of fascist dictatorship against the people, lording it over them, and unconditionally release the illegally detained figure related to the above-said event.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
