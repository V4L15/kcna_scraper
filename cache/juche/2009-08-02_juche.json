            "content": "Rodong Sinmun Calls for Frustrating Imperialists' Reactionary Offensive\r\nPyongyang, August 2 (KCNA) -- Every country can protect its revolutionary gains and its sovereignty and the dignity of the nation only when it stands up against the imperialists' desperate counter-revolutionary offensive in a steadfast anti-imperialist spirit and with a revolutionary offensive based on the strong driving force. Rodong Sinmun Sunday says this in an article. \n\t\t\t\t\tIt goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe present reality calls for intensifying the struggle to shatter the reactionary offensive of the imperialists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe basic barometer distinguishing the strong from the weak in the standoff with imperialists lies not in the superiority of arms and equipment but in the ideological and moral readiness of the army and people of a revolutionary country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEven though a country is backward in arms and equipment when compared with the enemy's, it can emerge strong when it is transparent in the anti-imperialist spirit. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAny country having resolute anti-imperialist spirit, it will never harbor any illusion and fear of imperialists. It can, at the same time, decisively shatter the imperialists' high-handed practices and moves for aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOnly when a country remains strong can it bar the imperialists from daring provoke it and firmly defend its sovereignty and that of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf a country fails to build a self-supporting national economy, it can hardly stand the imperialists' sanctions and blockade. Begging imperialists for something leads to subordination and self-destruction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Workers' Party of Korea and the Korean people are firmly defending the revolutionary gains and the sovereignty of the country and the nation, frustrating the imperialists' high-handed practices and moves for aggression because they have steadfast anti-imperialist spirit and a strong driving force."

Thanks to this will the DPRK is sure to turn into a thriving country in the near future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll the leading officials of the party help the popular masses solve problems arising in their living as a true mother would do and actively arouse their voluntary enthusiasm to forcefully advance the revolution and construction, strictly pursuant to the revolutionary mass line. It is the genuine work style prevailing throughout the party. Thanks to this the masses' trust in the party is getting deeper and the single-minded unity of the party and the revolutionary ranks is growing stronger as the days go by."
