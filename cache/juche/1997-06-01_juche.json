They fought tear gas firing police with sticks and flame bottles. Meanwhile, a group of 4,000 students forced their way up to university street in downtown Seoul, warmly welcomed by workers who were holding a rally of public sector labor unions there. The students held a joint rally with workers, criticising the Kim Young Sam \"civilian\" regime's anti-social politics and repression.\r\n   Another group of 2,000 students held protests around the east gate, clashing with police.\r\n   Some 1,000 students who had already stayed in Hanyang University hurled rocks at police to enable fellow students to enter the campus.\r\n   Prior to their departure for the venue of the inaugural ceremony, students held rallies to carry out the ceremony. \r\nThey decided to hold the ceremony in the form of a national rally in front of the puppet Seoul city hall on Sunday in case they fail to enter Hanyang University.\r\n   The Kim Young Sam regime mobilized more than 20,000 police of 180 companies to crack down on student protests.\r\n   On Friday, some 1,000 students under the Kwangju-South Jolla Provincial Federation of University Student Councils clashed with mobile police in Raju and Muan of south Jolla Province on their way to Seoul to participate in the inaugural ceremony of \"Hanchongryon\". \r\n \r\n"

He let his son Kim Hyon Chol conceal 12 billion won which had not been used.\r\n   The analyst of Rodong Sinmun says:\r\n   Kim Young Sam talked as if he had not received a penny as campaign funds, mindful that if he opened to the public the colossal amount of the funds, he would not go scotfree.\r\n   In the \"statement,\" he said he would promote \"political reform\" during the rest of his term and put \"heart and soul\" into terminating \"high-cost politics,\" consolidating \"security\" and \"reviving the economy.\" This was a desperate effort to escape from the Hanbo financial scandal and the campaign fund scandal.\r\n   He shamelessly slandered and threatened pro-democracy forces and the opposition parties. He meant that in case the opposition parties continue to oppose him, he would not rule out \"joint suicide\" with them.\r\n   He had better open to the public the campaign funds and step down at once as demanded by the people.\r\n   The analyst of Minju Joson brands his \"statement\" as something to shift the blame for the \"Presidential Election\" funds, win public favor and threaten the opposition parties. Kim Young Sam, the \"Election\" offender, must step down, the paper demands. \r\n\r\n"
