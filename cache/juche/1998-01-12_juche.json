And it called upon the whole party, all the army and people to unite around General Kim Jong Il and become vanguard fighters who think and act in his idea anytime and anywhere.\r\n   General Kim Jong Il is the destiny and future of socialist Korea as well as the symbol of victory. It is the mind of Korea that led by him, it is not afraid of any formidable enemy's attack and any \"arduous march\".\r\n   The whole party, all the army and all the people are now filled with a rockfirm determination to become human bombs and bullets in devotedly defending General Kim Jong Il and demonstrate socialism, a strong ideological fortress and bulwark of faith, without the slightest vacillation no matter how the situation may change.\r\n   Very strong is the might of the Workers' Party of Korea whose eternal and unshakable foundation has been further cemented after it acclaimed General Kim Jong Il as its General Secretary.   \r\n   Great changes and miracles have been wrought in realizing the independence of the popular masses under the leadership of the party that organizes and guides all victories of the Korean people.\r\n   Servicemen, who have hardened their mental pillar with a history of General Kim Jong Il's leadership over the People's Army, are reliably defending the socialist fortress with arms of class, with the high honor of being the first bodyguards for him. The Korean revolution is emerging victorious, reliably ensured by such invincible strong army which defend the headquarters of the revolution with their lives.\r\n   The Korean people, covering the road of victory and glory under the leadership of the party, have cherished the rockfirm faith that they can enjoy happiness and honor only under the leader of the revolution. With the faith they are hardening their strong will to defend General Kim Jong Il, at the cost of their lives.\r\n   The party, army and people regard it as their conscience, obligation and life to devotedly defend the leader.\r\n   The dignity of Juche Korea in which the party, army and people have been cemented firmly as three pillars for devotedly safeguarding the leader, will be further demonstrated in the forthcoming 21st century as in the present century.    \r\n\r\n"

Korea's financial crisis and its catastrophic consequences\r\n Pyongyang, January 12 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today comes out with a signed article on the catastrophic financial crisis driving South Korea into a turmoil.\r\n   The author of the article says:\r\n   In November last year, a financial crisis exploded in the South Korean financial market which had suffered from the chronic foreign currency shortage caused by colossal amounts of foreign debts.\r\n   Its consequences are very catastrophic.\r\n   The crisis hit production, circulation, consumption and other economic sectors of South Korea. Feeling uneasy at the crisis and the scarcity of foreign currencies,  many people including investors withdrew their capital or bought foreign currencies en masse. The price of the dollar has skyrocketed and the stock price drastically dropped. As a result, all money transactions were suspended at the financial market, and all sectors, units  and factors of the South Korean economy were paralyzed.\r\n   Experts foresee that 1.5 to 2 million people are likely to lose their jobs in South Korea this year.\r\n   Last year's waves of bankruptcies of big businesses equal to or larger than the Hanbo group in scale have turned banks related to them into deficit-ridden ones.\r\n   The point at issue is that south korea is unlikely to get out of the present financial crisis in spite of the rescue funds and \"trusteeship\" by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). No sign of recovery was seen at the foreign exchange and stock markets in December last year when  bailout funds valued at billions of dollars were supplied by the IMF.\r\n   The South Korean won has continued to depreciate to more than 2,000 against one dollar. A daily average of 45 enterprises have gone bankrupt, unable to repay their debts. \r\n\r\n"
