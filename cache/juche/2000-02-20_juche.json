This has touched off indignation of the Korean people and human conscience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The investigation committee of the democratic front for the reunification of the fatherland, which was organized at the outset of the Fatherland Liberation War to investigate and record GIs' criminal atrocities, issued indictment no. 1 on February 19 to inform the world of part of those crimes investigated and confirmed over the last 50 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The indictment deals with the massacres committed by the U.S. from June 25 to early August, 1950.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The indictment cites dates and places, etc, to accuse the U.S. aggressors of killing many peaceable civilians, destroying or reducing to ashes houses and properties and leveling to the ground great many schools, hospitals and theatres and other cultural establishments and peaceful industrial facilities in the northern half of the DPRK by indiscriminate bombing and bombardment from the first day of the Korean War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The indictment says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the period from June 25, 1950 when the Korean War broke out to early August of the same year the U.S. aggressors killed over 10,730 peaceable civilians, destroyed or reduced to ashes 14,119 houses and razed to the ground more than 100 cultural establishments and peaceful industrial factories in the North Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All these facts go to clearly prove that the brutal massacres and indiscriminate destruction committed by the U.S. in the past Korean War are the indelible crimes against humanity and they are ogres in human skin and chieftains of aggression, plunder and destruction and the sworn enemy of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We will surely make the U.S. aggressors pay for the criminal atrocities committed during the Korean War in order to protect the dignity of the nation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
