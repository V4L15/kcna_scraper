A spokesman for the DPRK Ministry of Foreign Affairs said this in an answer given to a question put by KCNA Tuesday as regards the recent ministerial meeting of the ARF.\r\nHe said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The meeting discussed disarmament in the Asia-Pacific region, security in the region, anti-terrorism struggle, the situation on the Korean peninsula and other issues and adopted the 11th ARF chairman's statement as a final document. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK positively took note of the fact that at the meeting the majority of the member nations of the forum asserted a negotiated peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and the paragraph of the statement dealing with the issue of the Korean peninsula underlined the importance of the way of settling the nuclear issue on the principle of \"words for words\" and \"action for action\" proposed by the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to seek a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue under the present situation where elementary confidence does not exist between the DPRK and the U.S. it is essential to give priority to the issue of wiping out the bilateral distrust. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The outcome of the meeting constitutes an expression of support to the DPRK's stand that the principle of a package solution based on simultaneous actions and the proposal for \"reward for freeze,\" the first phase measure to implement the principle, are the only way of building confidence between the DPRK and the U.S.    \r\n    \r\n\r\n"

Not content with this, this time it used \"testimonies\" allegedly made by such wicked renegades and defectors in its smear campaign. This clearly indicates how desperate it has become in its moves to do harm to the inviolable political system in the DPRK. As far as those renegades and defectors are concerned, they are nothing but human trash who are so wretched as to prolong their remaining days by hurling mud at the DPRK as they had committed unpardonable crimes against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Sankei Shimbun finds itself in such a miserable position as to depend on such poor fellows for misinformation in a bid to slander the DPRK's just policy towards south Korea and its foreign policy and impair its prestige and dignity. This is an intolerable hostile act and a revelation of its despicable intention to maintain its dirty existence with journalistic hackwork. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The validity and vitality of the DPRK's policy towards south Korea and its foreign policy have been proven in practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A signal turn has been effected in the development of the inter-Korean relations and dialogue, contact, exchange and cooperation are brisk in different fields according to the plan for national reunification laid down by the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is evidenced by the fact that propaganda which has been conducted against each other for scores of years in areas along the Military Demarcation Line has been totally stopped and solidarity and unity among the organizations for the reunification movement have become more brisk. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for the nuclear deterrent force of the DPRK, it is aimed at coping with the U.S. nuclear threat. It is the stand of the DPRK to seek a negotiated peaceful solution to the nuclear issue between them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the newspaper talked about the DPRK's \"terrorism\" and \"drug traffic\" is nothing but nonsense that revealed its ignorance of the intrinsic nature of the guiding idea, political system and social life of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What this paper claimed does not deserve even a passing note as it is ill-famed for spreading lies and making groundless accusations at others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBut what matters is that it is acting a shock force to serve the purpose of the right-wing conservative forces to hamstring any new move to improve the DPRK-Japan relations.\r\n As already known, a series of practical and positive moves have been taken to implement the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration and restore the mutual confidence since the recent DPRK-Japan summit meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that the newspaper released such false stories in a bid to block any process to improve the DPRK-Japan relations, displeased with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Piteous is the plight of the newspaper maintaining its existence by supporting the right-wing forces of Japan in its anti-DPRK smear campaign in violation of even the elementary principle of press ethic.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

But it is quite regretful that a decisive breakthrough was not made towards the final settlement of the nuclear issue. Minju Joson Tuesday says this in a signed commentary.\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is insisting on its unrealistic and unilateral assertion that it will discuss corresponding measures only when the DPRK has completed the freeze of its nuclear activity and dismantled its nuclear facilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the talks the DPRK side set forth a broad-minded and flexible proposal based on a great political decision, prompted by the desire to break the present deadlock over the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. and yield substantial results at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The participants in the talks except the U.S. positively supported and sympathized with the proposal and expressed their intention to join in the work to implement the reward for freeze proposal as it reflects the concerns of both the DPRK and the U.S. and admits of no argument in view of impartiality and feasibility. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. came out with what it called \"landmark proposal\" at the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Frankly speaking, the U.S. \"proposal\" was chiefly aimed to create the impression among the international community that it was making certain efforts for the progress of the talks. So it only made participants in the talks skeptical about the U.S. seeking an ulterior aim in it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That was why they dismissed the U.S. \"landmark proposal\" as complicated, unclear and unfair as it lacked any commitment to observe the principle of \"words for words,\" \"action for action.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. truly stands for settling the nuclear issue, it should cool-headedly analyze and judge which one is in the interests of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The solution depends on the U.S. political decision.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
