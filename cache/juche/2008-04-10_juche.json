            "content": "Kim Jong Il Inspects KPA Navy Unit \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 9 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il inspected the command of Navy Unit 152 of the KPA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Being guided by the commander of the unit, he went round a room devoted to the education in revolutionary history, a room devoted to the unit's history and a room devoted to preservation and education in slogan-bearing trees. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Seeing the relics and data associated with revolutionary history, he recalled with deep emotion the days of President Kim Il Sung's leadership over the building of navy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Navy of the KPA could grow to be invincible forces under the wise leadership and deep care of the President who devoted all his energies to building and strengthening the naval forces until the last moments of his life, he said, adding: His immortal revolutionary exploits for the building of the Juche-oriented navy will remain long in the history of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that those trees bearing slogans written during the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle are a precious asset of the Korean revolution, he stressed the need to intensify the education of servicepersons through the slogans and thus arm them more firmly with the revolutionary idea of the WPK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHe dropped in at an operation command room to learn about the unit's performance of duty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He set forth tasks to be fulfilled by the unit to increase its combat capability in every way, satisfied to learn that the servicepersons of the unit are carrying out their guard duties in a responsible manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He made the rounds of the servicepersons' hall, a library and other entertainment and cultural and educational facilities to learn about how the political work is being conducted among seamen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All units have successfully built libraries and minutely organized their service, thus markedly boosting the soldiers' zeal for reading, he noted, adding that the habit of reading books established in the whole army is another praiseworthy trait created by the KPA in the era of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After visiting the Hero Ri Kwang Su Company, he said it is good for the servicepersons of the unit to make their youth worthwhile with arms. He urged all servicepersons to become heroes in the new century by carrying forward the soul of the revolutionary forerunners. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then he went round a mess hall, a kitchen, a non-staple food store, a mushroom cultivation room and other supply service facilities of the unit modernly built to suit the characteristic features of the seamen. He appreciated the efforts made by the commanding officers of the unit, expressing satisfaction over the fact that they have provided the soldiers with good living conditions, bearing deep in mind the teaching of the President that supply service is at once a political work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He looked round the exterior and interior of the soldiers' health complex newly built by the unit and indicated tasks to be fulfilled by it to manage and operate it and ways to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Underscoring the need to show special care for the living of the seamen as they live in the rough sea all the year round, he called on all commanding officers to show warm love for the soldiers and look after them with paternal care so that they may not feel even the slightest inconvenience in their living.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il had a photo session with the servicepersons of the unit.\r\n\r\n"

The gross industrial output swelled, the foundation of the self-supporting national economy gained in scope and strength and the major projects of the five-year plan for the development of national science and technology ending in 2007 were carried out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The educational field witnessed progress in modernizing the educational institutions at all levels and improving the quality of education and signal successes in the fields of public health, culture and arts and sports. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK set a grandiose target to open up without fail the gate of a great prosperous powerful nation in 2012, the centenary of birth of the President, by staging a general offensive from this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The main tasks before the economic field this year is to bolster the pilot sectors, basic industries of the national economy, giving top priority to the work for ensuring the increase of the country's defence capability true to the Party's line of economic construction in the era of Songun, and thus ensure the advance in the building of an economic power. It is also the main thrust of the field to continue vigorously pushing forward the technological updating of the national economy and, at the same time, decisively solve the problems of food and consumer goods on the people's living-first principle in order to substantially improve the people's living standard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will make a fresh leap forward and progress in all fields under the uplifted militant slogan of the Party \"Glorify This Year of the 60th Anniversary of the Founding of the DPRK as a Year of Historical Turn Which Will Go Down in the History of the Country!\", thus significantly boosting the gross industrial output value. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year the Cabinet will channel all human and material resources of the country into bolstering the fields of power, coal and metal industries and railway transportation, taking a firm hold on the pilot sectors, basic industrial fields of the national economy, as the lifeline of the socialist economic construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Cabinet will rejuvenate the geological prospecting and the production at key industries including mining, machine-building, chemical and building materials industries and forestry and accelerate the technological updating on the basis of the existing foundation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an important task before the Cabinet this year, the 60th anniversary of the DPRK, to abide by the people's living-first principle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  We will comprehensively introduce high-yielding rice and maize seeds on the principle of the right crop on the right soil and the proper crop in the right season, widely disseminate and generalize the advanced agro-technique and farming methods and intensify the self-farming movement, true to the Party's policy of agricultural revolution to make great progress in solving the people's problem of food at any cost this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will vigorously push forward the waterway projects and land development and let all the fields of national economy produce and ensure farming materials in a responsible manner and encourage the whole country to render labor and material assistance to rural areas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will boost the production of meat, eggs and aquatic products and substantially operate the existing fish breeding centers to enable the people to fully benefit from them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will mass-produce quality consumer goods by operating the light industrial factories in full capacity and continue pushing forward the work to build new production bases. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will spruce up the hospitals at different levels as required by the new century, improve the production and supply of medicines and medical apparatus and make sure that all the popular policies including the system of social insurance, the system of accommodating working people at sanatoria and rest homes and the system of preferential treatment of disabled soldiers are properly enforced. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will speed up the construction of monumental edifices of the times, organize and undertake the construction of Pyongyang City in a bold and big way and build more houses in urban and rural areas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From this year we will start implementing the new five-year plan for the development of national science and technology ending in 2012. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will systematically increase the state investment in this field and let the scientists and technicians increase their responsibility and role to successfully carry out the assignments under the plan and thus put the country's science and technology on an advanced level in the shortest possible period. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the present, we will make sure that all the fields of national economy carry out the first-year tasks of the plan without fail this year, establish the production system based on science and technology at the factories and enterprises and, at the same time, exert state efforts for the development of the IT industry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will thoroughly establish Juche in external economic relations with other countries, energetically expand the export of goods of the second- and third-stage processing by use of the locally available resources and on the basis of indigenous technology and conduct diversified and multilateral trade. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an important task facing the Cabinet to steadily improve the guidance and administration of the socialist economic management and round off it our own way. It is also an issue of key importance as it awaits an urgent solution in building an economic power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to concentrate the economic work on the Cabinet and develop the nation's economy under a long-term plan on the basis of a scientific strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will continue directing big efforts to building socialist culture to train a large number of able intellectuals capable of doing their shares in building a great prosperous powerful nation this year, too. We will, at the same time, see to it that more literary and art works reflecting the stirring reality in the era of Songun are created and efforts are focused on the preparations for exalting the honor of the country by winning gold medals in the 29th Olympics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter called upon all officials to stand in the van of the drive for building an economic power and give the fullest play to the mental and creative power of the producer masses and thus work fresh miracles and innovations in production and construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He underscored the need for all the people to work hard to greet the 60th anniversary of the DPRK with shining victories and bring earlier the day when a great prosperous powerful socialist nation will appear on this land that remains highly dignified thanks to Songun.\r\n\r\n"

This enabled the people to receive ample state benefits such as free medical care, free education, social insurance and social security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Last year 15.7 per cent of the total state budgetary expenditure was disbursed as military spending. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The state budgetary revenue and expenditure for this year have been shaped on the principle of increasing the budgetary revenue to the maximum and reducing the expenditure for non-productive fields as much as possible by tapping all reserves and potentials in all fields and units of the national economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year's plan for state budgetary revenue is expected to grow 4 per cent over last year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revenue from the profits of state enterprises is expected to go up 4.7 per cent over last year, that from the profits of cooperative organizations 0.4 per cent, that from the fixed asset depreciation 2.6 per cent, that from rent of real estate 3.1 per cent and that from social insurance 1.1 per cent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year's state budgetary expenditure is expected to show a 2.5 per cent increase over last year and its plan has been shaped in such a way as to decisively bolster the pilot sectors, basic industrial sectors of national economy and bring about a landmark turn in improving the people's living standard, while making sustained efforts to increase the defence capability of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n 15.8 per cent of the total state budgetary expenditure for this year will be allocated for national defence.  49.8 per cent more than last year will go to the fields of power, coal and metal industries and railway transportation and the expenditure for agriculture is expected to go up 5.5 per cent and that for science and technology 6.1 per cent  over last year. A huge financial disbursement will also be made for the light industry, capital construction and land administration and city management. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The state budgetary expenditure for enforcing the popular policies will swell 1.7 per cent over last year.  4.2 per cent more fund than last year will be disbursed for education and financial allocation for public health will increase 5.9 per cent to steadily enforce social policies such as the system of universal compulsory free education, the system of free medical care, the system of social insurance, the system of accommodating working people at sanatoria and rest homes and the system of preferential treatment of disabled soldiers. The DPRK will thus give full play to the popular nature and advantages of its socialist state budget. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It is expected that the government will send a large amount of educational aid fund and stipends to the children of Koreans in Japan this year, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter said that it is the most important way for successfully implementing the state budget for this year to improve the economic and financial management in such a way as to gain the greatest possible profits, while strictly adhering to the socialist principle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter called for successfully carrying out the state budget to glorify this year of the 60th anniversary of the founding of the DPRK as a year of a historical turn which will go down in the history of the country.\r\n\r\n"

Korea \"Military Alliance\" under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 9 (KCNA) -- The U.S. defense secretary and the south Korean \"minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade\" were reported to have exchanged their views on the orientation of developing the U.S.-south Korea \"military alliance\" and the pending issues related to the \"alliance relations\" at their talks. What merits attention here is that the U.S. reiterated its support to the proposal for elevating the position of south Korea to the same level as the NATO's in purchasing U.S.-made weapons, crying out for the \"tightened alliance\" with south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun today observes that this is a revelation of the U.S. sinister intention to sharply expand the scope of its delivery of weapons to south Korea and further tighten the U.S.-south Korea military nexus. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe U.S. is keen to build a missile shield in south Korea, while contemplating giving south Korea the same status as the NATO's in the purchase of U.S.-made weapons. Lurking behind this scenario is a criminal intention to knock into shape a NATO-type new military bloc for aggression in Northeast Asia and realize its wild ambition for domination at any cost through that mechanism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is set to further tighten the \"military alliance\" with south Korea and put into practice its plan for creating a new military bloc by using the fictitious \"threat\" from the DPRK as a playing card. To this end, the U.S. is becoming vociferous about \"threat\" from the DPRK and pushing forward the moves to bolster the combat capability of its forces in south Korea and modernize the south Korean forces under the watchword of \"security\" in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. military moves to knock a new military bloc into shape in Northeast Asia including its plan to plug south Korea into the moves to build a missile shield are anti-peace actions contrary to the trend of the times. They only escalate the military tension and further increase the danger of war on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. truly wants peace and security in Northeast Asia including the peninsula, it should immediately give up the above-mentioned moves.\r\n\r\n"

The Lee group's talk about \"human rights issue\" is a revelation of their ignorance of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is ridiculous and disgusting, indeed, for the group of traitors to say anything about someone's \"human rights issue\" as it is beset with the worst human rights issues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThere are differing ideologies and systems in the north and the south. Proceeding from the viewpoint of national reconciliation, unity and reunification, the DPRK has maintained the stand to develop the inter-Korean relations on the basis of leaving those ideologies and systems in the north and the south as they are and tolerating them. The three principles -- independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity --agreed upon and published by the north and the south serve as inviolable basic principles for developing the inter-Korean relations under any circumstances. Fully embodied in the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration, a programme for implementing it, the principles serve as a powerful engine for steering the era of independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the ulterior aim sought by the Lee group through its \"human rights\" ruckus to defile the dignified system of the DPRK, bring the inter-Korean relations back to those in the era of confrontation and do harm to the DPRK in collusion with foreign forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-mentioned campaign kicked off by the Lee group in league with outside forces has made it difficult to expect any progress in the inter-Korean relations or any advance in the movement for independent reunification.\r\n\r\n"

And he concentrated all efforts on training the People's Army, the backbone and pillar of the self-reliant national defence power, to be a matchlessly invincible revolutionary army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He has prepared the whole of the People's Army as units of human bullets and bombs ready to lay down their lives in protecting the leader and a-match-for-a hundred fighters through the vigorous movement to win the title of O Jung Hup-led Seventh Regiment. He has led wisely the work to rapidly renovate the military and technical hardware of the army to effect a great turn in strengthening the revolutionary armed forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He showed love for and trust in servicepersons and provided all conditions for perfecting the combat preparation while making a continued inspection to army units. His patriotic long journey for Songun was the greatest motive power which reared the People's Army as the strong revolutionary army of Mt. Paektu, the first death-defying corps for protecting socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He set forth the revolutionary line of giving precedence to the national defence industry and led its thorough implementation so as to develop the national defence industry into powerful one based on the latest achievements of science and technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Leader Kim Jong Il has consolidated the military position of the Korean revolution as an impregnable fortress that any formidable enemy can not break and arranged a strong and self-reliant war deterrent power and thus turned the DPRK into an invincible military power. His Songun revolutionary exploits will shine long down through history.\r\n\r\n"

Tambien, hubo grandes exitos en los dominios de salud publica, cultura, arte y deporte. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n El PTC trazo la gran meta de lanzar a partir de este ano una ofensiva general para abrir a toda costa la puerta de la gran potencia prospera en 2012 cuando se acogera el centenario del Presidente Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n La tarea mas importante de este ano del dominio economico es abrir la brecha en la construccion de una potencia economica al revitalizar los dominios prioritarios y las industrias basicas de la economia nacional dando preferencia al abastecimiento para elevar la capacidad defensiva del pais en pleno acato a la linea de construccion economica del partido en la epoca del Songun. Tambien, consiste en seguir impulsando la reestructuracion tecnica de la economia nacional y producir un mejoramiento sustancial en la vida del pueblo al solucionar decididamente los problemas de alimentos, viveres y articulos de consumo popular en el principio de dar prioridad a la vida del pueblo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bajo la consigna combativa del partido \"!Hagamos brillar este ano del 60�� aniversario de la fundacion de la Republica como un ano de cambios historicos que se registre indeleble en los anales de la Patria!\", produciremos un nuevo salto y avance en todos los dominios con el proposito de aumentar considerablemente el valor de produccion industrial bruta. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Este ano, el Consejo de Ministros concentrara todos los recursos humanos y materiales del pais en los trabajos para revitalizar las industrias electrica, carbonifera y metalurgica y el transporte ferroviario tomando como lo vital de la construccion de la economia socialista los dominios prioritarios y las industrias basicas de la economia nacional. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Apoyandose en las bases ya preparadas dinamizara la prospeccion geologica y la produccion en las industrias claves como la extractiva, la maquinaria, la quimica, la de materiales de construccion y la silvicultura y acelerara la reconstruccion tecnica. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Mantener firmemente el principio de dar prioridad a la vida del pueblo es la tarea importante del Consejo de Ministros para este ano en que se celebrara el 60o aniversario de la fundacion de la RPDC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n En pleno acato a la orientacion del partido sobre la revolucion agricola, debemos introducir generalmente las variedades de alto rendimiento de arroz y maiz en el principio del cultivo adecuado en el terreno apropiado y en el tiempo, divulgar y generalizar ampliamente las tecnicas y metodos avanzados de cultivo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIgualmente, es preciso desplegar energicamente el movimiento por labrar la tierra sin la mano de obra de apoyo y lograr un gran avance en la solucion del problema de alimentos y viveres del pueblo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hace falta impulsar con dinamismo la construccion de canales y el arreglo de la tierra. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTodos los dominios de la economia nacional deben producir y abastecer con responsabilidad los materiales para la produccion agricola y todo el pais tiene que apoyar activamente al campo en lo laboral y material. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hay que incrementar la produccion de carne, huevos y productos maritimos y administrar con eficacia las ya preparadas bases de piscicultura para aportar beneficios reales al pueblo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Es necesario poner en pleno funcionamiento las fabricas de industria ligera para producir en gran medida los articulos de consumo popular de buena calidad y seguir impulsando energicamente la construccion de nuevas bases productivas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Es importante acondicionar bien los hospitales a todos los niveles a la altura del nuevo siglo, mejorar la produccion y suministro de los medicamentos y aparatos medicos y ejecutar correctamente todas las medidas populares como el sistema de seguro social, el de descanso y el de atender con preferencia a los ex militares heridos. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Es necesario acelerar la construccion de las creaciones monumentales de la epoca, impulsar con magnanimidad la construccion de la ciudad de Pyongyang y edificar muchas viviendas en las zonas urbanas y rurales. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Desde este ano, entramos en el cumplimiento del nuevo plan quinquenal estatal hasta 2012 para el desarrollo de ciencias y tecnicas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Cumpliremos con exito las tareas de este plan incrementando de manera sistematica la inversion estatal en este dominio y elevando la responsabilidad y papel de los cientificos y tecnicos para llevar a un nivel desarrollado en un corto plazo las  ciencias y tecnicas del pais. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Por inmediato, cumpliremos sin falta este ano en todos los sectores de la economia nacional las tareas para el primer ano del citado plan quinquenal e implantaremos en las fabricas y empresas el sistema productivo basado en las ciencias y tecnologias. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ademas, enfocaremos la atencion estatal al desarrollo de la industria de informatica. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Mantendremos estrictamente el Juche en las relaciones economicas con otros paises, ampliaremos activamente la exportacion de los productos de  segunda y tercera elaboracion basada en los recursos y tecnicas domesticos y realizaremos la diversificacion del comercio exterior. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Mejorar constantemente y perfeccionar a nuestra manera la direccion y la administracion de la economia socialista es una tarea importante del Consejo de Ministros y un problema clave que debe ser solucionado con urgencia en la construccion de una potencia economica. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hay que concentrar las labores economicas al Consejo de Ministros y desarrollar con perspectivas la economia del pais segun una estrategia cientifica. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Al seguir prestando este ano tambien una profunda atencion a la creacion de la cultura socialista, debemos formar muchos talentosos capaces de desempenar un buen papel en la construccion de una gran potencia prospera. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIgualmente, es preciso crear mucho mas obras literarias y artisticas que reflejen la realidad conmovedora de la epoca del Songun y concentrar las fuerzas a los preparativos para exaltar con medallas de oro el honor de la patria en la 29a olimpiada. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Todos los funcionarios deben ponerse al frente de la construccion de una potencia economica y utilizar  al maximo la capacidad espiritual y creativa de las masas productoras a fin de crear un nuevo prodigio e innovacion en la produccion y la construccion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTodos nosotros debemos luchar con dinamismo por coronar con relevantes victorias el 60o aniversario de la fundacion de la RPDC y adelantar el dia del cumplimiento de la causa de construir una gran potencia prospera socialista en la patria altamente dignificada por el Songun.\r\n\r\n"
