Korea under fire \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, November 21 (KCNA) -- Minju Joson today in a signed commentary describes the long-range missile development in secret of the South Korean authorities as an intolerable, open challenge to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Recently the New York Times reported that last year the U.S. intelligence analysts detected through the intelligence satellite new evidence of South Korea's moves for extending the missile range, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This proves that the South Korean authorities' scheme for extending the missile range has already been put into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The gravity of the issue is that this missile development has been promoted under the United States' connivance and patronage. The U.S. took an uncertain attitude to the South Korean chief executive's begging for the development, the ambiguous stand that South Korea can develop long-range missiles but cannot test-fire them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The approval of such missile development is nothing but an approval of its test-fire. This clearly shows that it is none other than the U.S. who has encouraged the missile development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. and the South Korean authorities will be blamed entirely for the dangerous effects of their moves. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Infantile word-juggling of fascist \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 21 (KCNA) -- The South Korean chief executive remarked that \"freedom of the press\" was not provided before as much as under the present \"government\". It is a sheer lie to cover up and justify its fascist suppression of the press, Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The present ruling quarters can never cover up their fascist suppression of the press with such infantile word-juggling because South Korea is now in critical situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   For example, they made a search into the newspaper Hangyore on the strength of the \"security law\" on charge that it carried a platform of the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils calling for national reunification based on withdrawal of the U.S. forces and confederacy formula. They also held a court against the \"Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation\" for disclosing irregularities of prosecutors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They banned distribution of the gazette of the Sungkyunkwan University for carrying an editorial denouncing the venal paper \"Chosun Ilbo.\" The facts show that their word-juggling about \"freedom of the press\" is a shameless deception of the reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean rulers are establishing a \"group of the press\" at \"Intelligence Service,\" a fascist organ for killings and tricks, so as to gag the press. In the long run the mediamen of South Korea are banned from hearing, seeing and telling the truth. This is what they have advertised as \"reform of the press.\"  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean chief executive cried that they would demand \"rectification\" and raise \"refutation\" against the \"unfair press\". This is a kind of threat hinting that he would mercilessly suppress the progressive pressmen refusing to yield to the \"government\". \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
