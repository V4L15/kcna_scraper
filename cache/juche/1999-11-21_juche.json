Korea under fire \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, November 21 (KCNA) -- Minju Joson today in a signed commentary describes the long-range missile development in secret of the South Korean authorities as an intolerable, open challenge to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Recently the New York Times reported that last year the U.S. intelligence analysts detected through the intelligence satellite new evidence of South Korea's moves for extending the missile range, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This proves that the South Korean authorities' scheme for extending the missile range has already been put into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The gravity of the issue is that this missile development has been promoted under the United States' connivance and patronage. The U.S. took an uncertain attitude to the South Korean chief executive's begging for the development, the ambiguous stand that South Korea can develop long-range missiles but cannot test-fire them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The approval of such missile development is nothing but an approval of its test-fire. This clearly shows that it is none other than the U.S. who has encouraged the missile development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. and the South Korean authorities will be blamed entirely for the dangerous effects of their moves. \r\n\r\n"
