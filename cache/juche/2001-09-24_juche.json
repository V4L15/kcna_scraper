And it may be a right option taken in line with the policy of each country opposed to all forms of terrorism to make a due contribution to the efforts of the international community to eliminate the root cause of this terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the neighboring countries of Japan are becoming extremely watchful against its hectic moves because what Japan chiefly seeks is not to \"prevent terrorism and eliminate its root cause.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan asserts that it should make a substantial contribution through practical military actions this time, arguing that its huge financial contribution failed to get an international appreciation during the gulf war. This is not its true intention. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What Japan truly seeks is to unlimitedly expand the sphere of actions of the \"SDF,\" its main aggressor forces, and provide a judicial and institutional mechanism for re-invasion of Asia with the terrorist attacks on the U.S. as a momentum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the proposal is adopted as a law at the diet and put into practice, the overseas dispatch of the \"SDF\" not only to the Asia-Pacific region but to other parts of the world will be completely institutionalized in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is by no means, a simple issue that can be interpreted in the context of preventing terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no need to recall that many Asian countries suffered horrible disasters due to the overseas troop dispatch by militarist Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is an abnormal country that took every opportunity to legalize its aggression and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a well-known fact that Japan has pushed ahead with the independent development of reconnaissance satellites and inter-continental ballistic missiles, adamantly insisting that the DPRK's launch of a satellite for a peaceful purpose was a \"missile launch.\" Japan has gone the length of calling for the development of a \"missile defense\" system, independent of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is misusing misfortune of the U.S. to pave the way for re-invasion of Asia, in other words, to legalize its moves to become a military power and realize the unlimited overseas dispatch of the \"SDF\" as early as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the real intention of Japan which has evaded the settlement of its past, the most urgent issue, for more than 50 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japanese authorities are well advised to think twice of the disastrous consequences to be entailed by its overseas troop dispatch under the pretext of \"supporting the efforts to prevent terrorism.\"    \r\n\r\n"

This is required by the reality to check and frustrate the moves of the anti-reunification forces in and outside Korea to hamper the implementation of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and block the road of independent national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is important for independently settling the issue of national reunification by the concerted efforts of the north and south is for them to firmly maintain the stand of national independence and strengthen the national unity through practical struggles to implement the north-south joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a senseless act to read outside forces' faces and yield to their interference now that the north and south agreed to independently settle the issue of reunification by the concerted efforts of the Koreans and jointly declared this will. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans can certainly pull through whatever obstacles and accomplish their national task for reunification, if the north and south pool efforts, no matter how many and arduous hurdles lying in its way may be, the article concludes.    \r\n   \r\n"

Vessels and workers were supplied to it and the breeding of shellfish was established on a scientific basis. Every year shellfish are tinned out and scattered several times, and the mud flats are ploughed to make feeding easier. the flood-released mud is instantly removed and steps are taken to protect the young shellfish from species of prey. in the spawning season, people are barred from approaching the area, and special attention is paid to preventing pollution from spills by vessels in the area. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to artificial propagation, the farm and the surrounding waters have a proportioned share of the shellfish population. Stocking a hectare of the farm with three tons of young shellfish, each one to two grammes in weight, will yield a haul of 30 to 40 tons in a year and a half. This figure is 10 to 20 times as high as under natural conditions. by this method, production has shown a steady increase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This low-input, high-return management contributed to increasing aquatic resources and state revenue. The farm's target for the year was reached in July. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The station is now set on research and expansion for the full-scale breeding of various shellfish, including short neck clams.    \r\n\r\n"

He dropped in at the Pukchang Farm to learn in detail about the fruit production this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that in order to radically increase the fruit production it is necessary to bring about a signal turn in the seed selection, widely introduce advanced technology and raise the fertility of soil, he underscored the need to provide a sufficient amount of fertilizers and agricultural chemicals and other farming materials while firmly building up research groups to intensify scientific researches. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He also noted that in order to put orchards on a scientific and modern basis to meet the need of the new century it is necessary to realign orchards to put them in good shape so that all farm work may be done by machines. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He then moved on to the Phungchon Fruit Processing Factory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Seeing different production processes, he familiarized himself with the processing in detail, even tasting dried fruit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He called for further updating production processes and adequately supplying packing and all other necessary materials to boost the production of high quality processed fruits.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
