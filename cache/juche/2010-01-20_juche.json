He highly appreciated their laudable feats.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The smeltery has satisfactorily solved a lot of scientific and technological problems and waged a dynamic drive for modernizing and scientizing the production processes by paying primary attention to the technical revolution as required by the WPK's idea of attaching importance to science and technology, thus bringing about a signal turn in the production of nonferrous metals, he noted, adding that this eye-opening great change once again clearly proves that the master key to boosting the production lies in the technological progress.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He set forth important tasks to be fulfilled by the enterprise, noting that the smeltery has an important role to play in the nation's economic development.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that the most important task facing the smeltery is to keep the production going at a high rate and, at the same time, continue focusing efforts on the technological updating to put all the production processes on a higher scientific and technological basis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The next leg of his guidance was the Hungnam Taehung Fishery Enterprise.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round the blister plastic shop and other production processes and varieties of processed fish for hours to learn in detail about the technical equipment and production there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed great satisfaction over the fact that the officials, workers and technicians of the enterprise have not only systematically increased the fish production by modernizing and scientizing fishing equipment including fishing boats by themselves but successfully built the Unjong Health Complex and a sanatorium and other cultural and welfare establishments, radically changing its appearance. He highly appreciated their feats.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the enterprise has an important role to play in improving people's diet, he set forth the tasks to be carried out by the enterprise.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to increase the haul of fish and the production of processed fish it is necessary to make fishing boats all-purpose ones for the purpose of catching more fish by various methods and improve the technical control over the processing equipment and the management of other equipment with a view to boosting the rate of their operation, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed the need to more thoroughly establish a scientific fishing system and conduct the work for exploring new fishing grounds under a long-term plan in order to conduct fishing operations as required by the changed fishing conditions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After setting the goal of aquatic products to be attained by the enterprise in a few years to come, he called for hitting the target without fail to increase the supply of fish to people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As our country sea-bound on its three sides has favorable natural and geographical conditions for developing the fishing industry, it is necessary to pay deep attention to this work, he said, indicating an orientation and ways to do so.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The last leg of his guidance was the Sojung Fishery Station.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Making the rounds of fish-breeding tanks, wharf and various places of the station to learn in detail about production and fish keeping.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the fish production is increased and, at the same time, some of the caught fish is let grow in the fish-breeding tanks before its supply just as done at this fishery station, it is possible to supply fresh fish to people at all times, he said, setting forth tasks to be fulfilled to spruce up the fish-breeding facilities and put their management on a scientific basis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the powerful heavy industry of the DPRK including the metal industry has begun to display its potential, making a definite breakthrough towards bringing about leaping progress in light industry, agriculture and fishery industry, he earnestly called on all sectors of the national economy to effect great changes in order to make this historic year a year of a decisive turn in improving the people's standard of living.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Thae Jong Su, chief secretary of the South Hamgyong Provincial Committee of the WPK, and Kim Kyong Hui, department director of the C.C., the WPK."

All the service personnel and people will, at the same time, record with high pride the heroic epics of creation and changes glorifying the history of the DPRK in this year's general offensive, too, with the might of their single-minded unity and indomitable spiritual strength, firmly rallied around the headquarters of the revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Today the national power of the DPRK has reached its peak in all aspects. As the economic power of the DPRK has grown remarkably stronger thanks to the high-pitched drive for a great surge, it is now demonstrating its might as a political, ideological and military power and has in place a springboard from which it can proudly leap towards a high eminence of an economic power. There is nothing to fear and nothing impossible for the DPRK. The Korean people can work world-startling miracles once again and open the gate to a thriving nation earlier than scheduled when they tap all the economic and technical potentials and possibilities and make redoubled efforts."
