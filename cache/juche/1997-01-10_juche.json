            "content": "Precursor to suppression of labour movement\r\n\r\n   Pyongyang, January 10 (KCNA) -- The \"Ministers of home \r\naffairs, justice and labour\" of South Korea released a \r\n\"Joint statement to people\" with regard to the revised \r\n\"labour laws\" on January 8, according to a radio report from \r\nSeoul.\r\n   In the statement, they justified their revision of \r\n\"Labour laws\" and blared that the strike of South Korean \r\nworkers and people from other walks of life for the \r\nabrogation of the laws could not be \"legitimized under any \r\ncircumstances\" and that they would \"Take a determined \r\nmeasure to curb the illegal strikes\".\r\n   This is a precursor indicating that the Kim Young Sam \r\nfascist clique, extremely upset by the daring struggle of \r\nSouth Korean workers which is daily growing in scope, will \r\nbring the whirlwind of frantic suppression. Accordingly, it \r\ncannot be tolerated under any circumstances.\r\n   South Korean people are waging a powerful massive \r\nstruggle for the abrogation of the evil laws in all parts of \r\nSouth Korea. Their struggle is very just and cannot be \r\nbranded as \"Illegal\" in any case.\r\n   The freedom and vital rights of people are what should \r\nnot be violated by anyone. Moreover, the controversial \r\n\"labour laws\" secretly passed by the puppets some time ago \r\nare evil ones aimed at depriving workers of all their \r\nelementary democratic freedom and rights including the three \r\nrights to labour. So, they are now targets of bitter \r\nprotests from the world public.\r\n   This is why the South Korean workers are stubbornly \r\nopposing the illegal and outrageous scheme of the Kim Young \r\nSam group to ruthlessly deprive them of their elementary \r\nrights to existence and the opposition parties join in their \r\nstruggle.\r\n   Since the revision of the \"labour laws\" was very illegal \r\nand outrageous, the international confederation of free \r\ntrade unions lodged a lawsuit with the secretariat of the \r\ninternational labour organisation against the laws and the \r\nworld press highlights articles criticising the outrageous \r\nact of the South Korean puppets.\r\n   The fascist suppression will only lead to a more massive \r\nstruggle.\r\n   If the Kim Young Sam group crack down upon the just \r\nstruggle of South Korean people at the point of the bayonet, \r\nit will result in precipitating the collapse of the \r\n\"civilian government\" of south Korea. \r\n\r\n"

Howerver, no \r\none will believe him.\r\n   Despite his advertisement about \"economic recovery\" and \r\n\"Liquidation of irregularities and corruption\", the South \r\nKorean economy will go to bankruptcy and irregularities and \r\ncorruption will be prevalent in South Korea.\r\n   We cannot but take a serious view of the fact that at the \r\npress conference, Kim Young Sam incited confrontation with \r\nthe DPRK, maliciously hurling slanders at it.\r\n   This proves that the traitor intends to escape from the \r\ncrisis of rule and unleash a fratricidal war with the help \r\nof outsiders after bringing the situation to the brink of \r\nwar by extremely aggravating the inter-Korean relations and \r\ncoiling up the tension.\r\n   It is only too natural that South Korean people brand the \r\n\"New year press conference\" of the traitor Kim Young Sam as \r\na dirge of the master of \"Chongwadae\" on the verge of ruin.\r\n   A signed commentary of Minju Joson says that the \"New \r\nYear press conference\" clearly showed that with the traitor \r\nkim Young Sam left in power, inter-Korean relations will not \r\nbe improved nor can the sufferings and misfortunes of the \r\nSouth Korean people be dispelled. \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n"

The statement says:\r\n   Liquidation of the abnormal past and improvement of ties \r\nbetween the DPRK and Japan are what the peoples of the two \r\ncountries wish and, at the same time, what the DPRK \r\ngovernment has consistently called for.\r\n   We have so far made sincere efforts to improve bilateral \r\nties.\r\n   Last year, the Japanese authorities did not sincerely \r\napproach the issue of improving bilateral ties by raising \r\nsome \"Preconditions.\"\r\n   We have made it clear that we do not mind whether our \r\nrelations with Japan are normalised or not.\r\n   Our position remains unchanged.\r\n   The point at issue, however, is that although it is more \r\nthan 50 years since the end of the war, Japan has yet to \r\natone for its military occupation of Korea and colonial \r\nenslavement it imposed on the Korean people during the first \r\nhalf of the century.\r\n   For the offender to honestly apologize to the victim and \r\natone for his wrongdoing is a matter of fulfilling the \r\ninternationally recognised political and legal \r\nresponsibility and moral obligation. It is by no means a \r\nmatter of choice.\r\n   With Japan failing to atone for its past, the protest of \r\nthe fair world opinion and the anti-Japanese sentiment of \r\nthe Korean people are on a steady increase and the hostile \r\nrelations between the two countries go from bad to worse. \r\nThis will, in the long run, leave indelible scars.\r\n   While whitewashing and defending its past, Japan is \r\ntrying to avoid atonement. This indicates that Japan is \r\npolitically and morally vulgar and is willing to repeat the \r\ncrime if time comes.\r\n   With the desire to revive militarism becoming undisguised \r\nin Japan, the Japanese ruling party recently adopted a \r\ndecision calling on Japan visitors to call at the Yasukuni \r\nShrine. It is indicative of why Japan has avoided the \r\nsettlement of the past.\r\n It is only too clear that such a country is not eligible to \r\nbecome a permanent member of the united nations security \r\ncouncil. \r\n   Japan should fully discharge its legal and moral \r\nobligation, mindful that it cannot delay to the 21st century \r\nthe atonement of the crimes it committed in the first half \r\nof the 20th century.\r\n   It is also necessary for the improvement of relations \r\nwith the DPRK. \r\n   We make it clear that the normalization of bilateral \r\nrelations is impossible without Japan's settlement of the \r\npast.\r\n   The Japanese authorities would be well advised to stop \r\nacting impudently, thinking that the establishment of \r\ndiplomatic ties between the two countries is one side's \r\n\"Offering\" to the other.\r\n   They must renounce the foolish thought that the passage \r\nof time will bury its past crimes into oblivion and come out \r\nto negotiations for the settlement of the past without \r\ndelay, deeply aware that if they continue avoiding it, their \r\nresponsibility will be heavier. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
