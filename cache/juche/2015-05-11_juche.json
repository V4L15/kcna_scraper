            "content": "KCNA Commentary Accuses U.S. of Posing Nuclear Threat and Sparking Arms Race\r\n Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- The U.S. is persistently spreading the story about \"nuclear threat\" from the DPRK, asserting it has \"violated the NPT and harassed global peace and security.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t U.S. Secretary of State Kerry at the recent \"2015 NPT Review Conference\" held in New York, pulled up the DPRK over its non-existent \"nuclear threat, \" blustering that it should take an action without fail to dispel the concern of the international community over its nuclear program.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What Kerry uttered is nothing but a cynical ploy of the U.S., the world's biggest nuclear weapons state chiefly responsible for nuclear proliferation, to divert the world public opinion critical of it to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should be more responsible than other countries for the issue of nuclear disarmament as it is just the war criminal state which inflicted a nuclear disaster upon mankind for the first time in history. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, it has persisted in pursuing its aggressive nuclear policy in disregard of the NPT and its obligation required by international law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is going to spend a trillion US dollars for modernizing its nukes for the 30 odd years to come.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is stepping up the development and updating of its nuclear weapons while putting up the signboard of denuclearization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has allotted for research, development, test and manufacture of nuclear weapons the hugest funds ever since the 1950s. It is going to spend 355 billion US dollars for modernizing its nuclear warheads for a nearly decade to come.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has built bases for producing new type weapon grade plutonium and nuclear test bases in New Mexico State and started enriching uranium in a new facility in Tennessee State. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of State recently asserted that it is in line with the NPT for the U.S. to deploy nuclear weapons in NATO member states and get familiar with the technology of using them together with its non-nuclear member states.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After deploying nukes in member states of NATO in the Cold War era, the U.S. has kept them there since its demise and staged joint nuclear war drills with non-nuclear states in Europe.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No NPT provisions allow a nuclear weapons state to share nuclear weaponry and stage drills with non-nuclear states.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This not withstanding, the U.S. has insisted that the nuclear weapons deployed in NATO member states in Europe are under its permanent control and they will never be transferred to other countries, staging joint military drills with non-nuclear states of NATO for decades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Washington's nuclear policy sparked a race for nuclear development and manufacture in the international arena.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The director of the Department for Non-proliferation and Arms Control of the Russian Foreign Ministry said at the above-said New York conference claimed that the U.S. has laid a stumbling block in the way of nuclear disarmament. He accused Washington of refusing to sign the CTBT while pushing forward the establishment of global MD system and working hard to translate its \"conception of prompt global strike\" into a reality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This clearly shows what the U.S. seeks in actuality through its call for building \"a world without nuclear weapons.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This being a hard reality, it is claiming that the DPRK's self-defensive nuclear deterrent to cope with its high-handed practices to stifle the DPRK by nukes is \"posing a nuclear threat\" to the world. This is the height of hypocrisy to mislead the world public opinion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With no sleight of hand can the U.S. evade the responsibility as the very one which has posed a nuclear threat to the world and sparked off worldwide arms race."
