As a result, the first phase construction was successfully wound up and the breeding of domestic animals of good stock started, bringing about a dramatic change in the remote mountain village.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After being briefed on the layout of the station and its long-term plan, he went round the breeding research center, management building, cultural hall, breeding pens and dwelling houses to learn about the construction in detail.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He praised the soldier-builders for successfully carrying out the order of the supreme commander to complete the first phase construction of the station by the anniversary of the WPK in a matter of a little over 4 months.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was very pleased that a good prospect was opened for supplying more meat to service personnel thanks to the labor drive of the soldier-builders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Domestic animals of good stock bred by the station are very high in economic effectiveness, he said, adding that the People's Army is taking the lead in carrying out the behests of President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il on obtaining meat from grass.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that it is important to settle the matter of fodder in order to massively breed grass-eating domestic animals, he gave instructions to the station to exert a lot of efforts not only for effectively using existing pasture but creating new grass land and planting a lot of trees.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the station performs the function and role as an advanced base in carrying out the WPK's policy which calls for considering supply service as a struggle for defending socialism, he instructed the station to work out bold and big operations for building the station and push ahead with the project under a carefully worked out plan on the basis of the successes and experience gained and thus turn this area into a modern breeding station.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He set the goal of the 2nd phase construction of the station and indicated orientation and ways for attaining it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by KPA Vice-Marshal Choe Ryong Hae, director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, KPA General Jang Jong Nam, minister of the People's Armed Forces, and Hwang Pyong So and Hong Yong Chil, vice department directors of the C.C., the WPK."

It participated in the DPRK-targeted joint naval maneuvers which had been under way secretly in the East Sea of Korea since September 30.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This strike group is made up of the U.S. super-large nuclear-powered carrier George Washington with at least 100 nuclear bombs aboard, many guided-missile destroyers, cruisers, submarines and escort warships, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is reported that the strike group will get involved in the DPRK-targeted large-scale joint naval strike maneuvers in the South Sea of Korea from Tuesday together with warship groups of the Japanese aggression forces and south Korean puppet navy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now the U.S. imperialists are openly advertising that the drills to be staged with the aircraft carrier task force as an axis are a planned military offensive to pressurize the DPRK in a bid to deter its possible \"provocations\" including nuclear test and missile launch and lead it to \"changes\" desired by them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This clearly proves that the remarks of such high-ranking officials of the U.S. Obama administration as the secretary of State that the U.S. neither pursues a hostile policy towards the DPRK nor has the will to attack it are sheer lies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The gravity of the situation is that all these military moves are timed to coincide with the adoption of the \"tailored deterrence strategy\" presupposing a preemptive strike at the DPRK between the master and its servant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this connection, the units of all services and army corps level of the KPA received an emergency order from its supreme command to reexamine the operation plans already ratified by it and keep themselves fully ready to promptly launch operations any time, watching with high vigilance every move of the U.S. and Japanese aggressors and the puppet forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should bear in mind that the more frequently and the deeper its imperialist aggression forces' nuclear strike means including the nuclear carrier enter the air above the vicinity of the Korean Peninsula and waters off it, the more unpredictable disasters their actions will cause.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. will be wholly accountable for the unexpected horrible disaster to be met by its imperialist aggression forces' nuclear strike means as it is deploying them regardless of the time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this regard the DPRK invariably holds that if the U.S. administration stands for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and is interested in the peace and security in the region, the U.S., not the DPRK, should make a decision to move first.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Because it is none other than the U.S. which adopted an extremely hostile policy toward the DPRK, spawned the nuclear issue on the peninsula and has posed a constant nuclear threat to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should bear in mind that the Korean people and army are highly alerted to promptly and confidently cope and foil blatant provocations of any hostile forces in the world with its own powerful military muscle."
