It is, therefore, working with bloodshot eyes to suppress them and step up its moves to escalate the confrontation with the DPRK in a bid to ensure \"stable power\" in the latter half of its office and the \"Grand National Party's\" stay in power. Those concerned of progressive pro-reunification movement organizations had legitimate working contacts with the DPRK after getting the approval of the authorities of the preceding regime. But the Lee Myung Bak group is treating them as criminals after the lapse of several years under false charges that they engaged in \"secret maneuvers\" at the \"instructions\" of someone.

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun Hails Completion of Taegyedo Tideland\r\n Pyongyang, July 19 (KCNA) -- The reclaimed Taegyedo Tideland made its imposing appearance across rough waters of the West Sea of Korea under a far-reaching plan of President Kim Il Sung and the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il. This is a great structure which clearly demonstrated that the DPRK can do anything, if it is determined. \n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Monday observes this in an editorial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The completion of the Taegyedo Tideland reclamation project changing the map of the country helps bring about big progress in the development of the nation's agriculture and improvement of the standard of people's living and build a socialist fairyland in the vast expanse of Taegyedo area.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The completion of the project represents a miracle of Songun Korea which could be worked only by patriots and heroes boundlessly loyal to the party and the revolution. It is an exciting miracle of the 21st century which powerfully demonstrated before the whole world that there is no limit to the wisdom and talents, intellectual potential and creativity of the Korean people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGeneral Secretary Kim Jong Il's aphorism that he who says something is impossible is not speaking Korean was the steadfast faith of the builders of the Taegyedo Tideland.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The course in which the project was carried out once again proves that it is possible to work a miracle of the 21st century which others can hardly imagine and fling open the gate to a thriving nation if the Korean nation-first spirit is blended with bravery and extraordinary ideological and moral power with scientific creativity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the deep-rooted faith of all the servicepersons and people of the DPRK that it is possible to work undying miracles of Songun Korea and open the gate to a thriving nation when they remain loyal to the idea and leadership of Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is nothing impossible for them and no fortress unconquerable when they live and work in the same spirit and traits as displayed by the builders of the tideland in building a structure of eternal value by damming off the rough waters of the West Sea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The editorial calls on all the servicepersons and people to make redoubled efforts as required by the stirring era of great surge when world-startling events are taking place one after another, increase the speed of the general offensive to the maximum and thus glorify the conference of the Workers' Party of Korea and its 65th founding anniversary as great festivals of victors and fly the banner of victory on the eminence of a thriving nation at an early date."
