The Korean nation is living with desire for reunification as well as a hope that reunification will be achieved without fail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A reunified Korea will be a powerful country with 70 million population, a strong army, industry that is able to conquer space and is equipped with latest computer technology, and great commercial and military strategic potentials and will have enormous natural resources.    \r\n\r\n"
