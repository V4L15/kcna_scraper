Of late the U.S. has become evermore frantic in its moves to stifle the DPRK over its satellite launch for peaceful purposes and nuclear test for self-defence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the present stage where the army and people of the DPRK are standing in all-out confrontation with the U.S. they will counter \"sanctions\" with retaliation and all-out war with all-out war in order to protect the dignity of the nation and the sovereignty of the country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They will sternly punish the Japanese militarists and the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors for perpetrating rash acts, pursuant to U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The speaker called upon everybody to wage a staunch struggle to protect the ideology, the system and cause of the DPRK and win a final victory in the confrontation with the U.S., true to the Songun revolutionary leadership of Kim Jong Il.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The floor was also taken by representatives of workers, agricultural workers, youth and students. The speakers condemned the U.S. imperialists, the provoker of the war of aggression, for perpetrating the most barbarous atrocities of genocide and destruction in the world history of wars. They evinced their resolution to turn out as one in the just sacred war in case of emergency and wipe out the aggressors and finally conclude the confrontation with U.S. imperialism with the victory of Songun Korea."

            "content": "Traitor Lee Myung Bak's U.S. Junket Blasted\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, June 25 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Thursday in an article of its commentator assails traitor Lee Myung Bak's recent junket to the United States.\n\t\t\t\t\t The article says:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee Myung Bak on June 15, the anniversary of the publication of the historic north-south joint declaration, left south Korea to meet his American master. This tour brought into bolder relief his true colors as a wicked sycophant and traitor and anti-DPRK confrontational maniac.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Referring to the \"summit talks\" held between the master and his servant on June 16 and a joint press conference concerning it, the article goes on to say:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If one makes a scrutiny into those events, one cannot construe them otherwise than a disgusting kiss between the master and his servant in the efforts to tighten the nexus between the U.S. and south Korea for aggression and hatch more nuclear plots against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee together with his master announced what they called a \"joint vision\" on developing  the south Korea-U.S. relations into the \"strategic relations in the 21st century\" in which they vociferated about reaffirming the \"alliance\" and building an \"extended comprehensive strategic alliance\" based on \"common value\" and \"confidence.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is little short of a declaration that Lee would make south Korea totally dependent on the U.S., tighten the nexus for aggression against the DPRK and pursue with increased frenzy the moves for a war of aggression worldwide.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As far as the duet trumpeting made by the master and his servant that they cannot \"recognize\" the DPRK's nuclear deterrent is concerned, the DPRK has never requested anyone to recognize the DPRK's status of a nuclear weapons state nor has it entertained any idea of getting it recognized.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's nuclear deterrent has nothing to do with somebody's \"recognition\" and its only purpose is to prevent any aggressor from deliberately provoking it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee, together with his master, talked nonsense that there is no reward for the \"wrong deed,\" clamoring about \"sanctions\" and the like. Everybody knows well that such balderdash can never cut ice with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a mockery and insult to the DPRK to raise a hue and cry over the small \"reward\". The DPRK neither wishes to receive such despicable \"reward\" nor requires it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee together with his master touted \"extended deterrence,\" not content with taking issue with the DPRK's nuclear deterrent, and staged the farce of getting it stipulated in the joint document of the \"summit talks.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This official announcement of the \"extended deterrence\" means south Korea's playing an active role in carrying out the U.S. global nuclear war strategy and the integration of south Korea and the U.S. in the nuclear armed forces and their start to enter a joint operational system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee and his master talked about \"five-party talks minus north Korea\" to put pressure upon the DPRK, harping about \"six-party talks\" and somebody's \"dismantlement of nukes\". But one must know that the six-party talks are like crying over spilt milk and their pressure for \"dismantlement of nukes\" went bust long ago. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and its puppet are sadly mistaken if they calculate their foolish trumpeting would help pressurize the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the American master and his servant Lee, both political greenhorns, would like to say something about the DPRK, it is better for them to study more about it."

            "content": "KCNA Blasts Reckless Remarks of Traitor Lee Myung Bak\r\n Pyongyang, June 25 (KCNA) -- Traitor Lee Myung Bak in a talkfest on June 22 let loose rubbish that the U.S. forces' presence in south Korea is designed to \"deter\" and \"prevent\" a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t This is nothing but a sheer jargon which can be let loose only by such unparalleled traitor Lee who stakes his fate on sycophancy towards the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t How can he claim the U.S. forces' presence in south Korea serves the above-said purpose?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. forces' presence in south Korea is the root cause of the division of the Korean nation and the war disaster it suffered in the past. It is due to their presence that the Korean Peninsula has been in an unstable situation little different from the state of a war for more than half a century and the peace and reunification of the country have not been achieved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. hurled its aggressor forces into south Korea under the groundless pretext of \"disarming\" the Japanese imperialists on Sept. 8, 1945 when Japan declared its unconditional surrender and completely laid down arms and abandoned its combat posture. The U.S. forces' occupation of south Korea was totally brigandish and illegal from its very beginning as it was in contravention of the will of the Korean nation and the requirements of international law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has staged ceaseless war exercises to invade the DPRK in south Korea and in its vicinity, steadily bolstering up its aggressor armed forces including nuclear war means, instead of withdrawing its forces from south Korea as required by the changed international environment after the demise of the Cold War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is now busy putting the U.S. forces in south Korea on a modern and mobile basis under the signboard of \"strategic flexibility\" in a bid to realize its ambition to invade the DPRK at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. forces' presence in south Korea is the very root cause of a war and a stumbling block lying in the way of preserving stability and peace and achieving the reunification of the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said claim made by Lee ignoring this hard reality is aimed at calming down the domestic and foreign criticism of his role as a nuclear war servant of the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some time ago Lee Myung Bak flew to the U.S. to meet his American master and committed such an act of treachery as making the outbreak of a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula an established fact under the pretext of sort of \"deterrence.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This testifies to the fact that \"deterrence\" and \"prevention\" touted by the group of traitors are nothing but a nuclear war and the U.S. forces in south Korea are the armed forces to fight the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-mentioned outbursts let loose by the traitor brought to light once again his despicable true colors as a reckless confrontation maniac and the worst stooge of the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sycophancy towards the U.S. would only lead to self-destruction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The desperate efforts of the group of traitors to prolong its remaining days through sycophancy towards the U.S., heedless to the repeated warnings of the DPRK, would only precipitate its self-destruction."

It envisages an increase of \"defense spending\" and beefing up of the strength of \"the Self-Defense Forces (SDF),\" examination of the issue of \"acquiring the capability to attack enemy bases\" and increase of \"defense capability,\" etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Liberal Democratic Party in its \"final proposal\" released earlier called for retracting the policy on cutting down the \"defense spending\" and \"defense forces,\" the setting up of a foreign information body directly under the authority of the Cabinet and the \"National Security Council,\" allowing the \"exercise of the right to collective self-defense\" and reexamination of the \"three principles of arms export.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This indicates that the moves of the Japanese militarists to round off the preparations for reinvasion have reached a graver phase. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the ulterior intention and strategic aim of the Japanese reactionaries to embark upon the road for reinvasion after securing a military edge on land and seas and in space.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To this end, they worked out and announced in 1976 the \"National Defense Program Guidelines\" clarifying the military strategic and tactical issues arising in realizing reinvasion and modified it several times later.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They have become evermore undisguised in their moves to replace the \"pacifist constitution\" by a war constitution and attain the \"status\" of a military power in the course of implementing the above-said guidelines.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sphere of the \"SDF's\" military operation extended to the Indian Ocean, going far beyond the boundary of Japan's vicinity. The Japanese reactionaries' moves to acquire offensive armed forces have made brisk headway, as exemplified by the building of aircraft-carriers, the introduction of a mid-air refueling tanker and purchase of a large cargo craft. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After making public the \"basic plan on space\" they are working in real earnest to militarize space, while launching military spy satellites.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are also zealously pushing forward the work to imbue the \"SDF\" with the militarist idea so that it may directly carry out the reinvasion scenario of the Japanese authorities, while going mad with distorting history and stirring up the enthusiasm to visit \"Yasukuni Shrine.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan has, in fact, emerged an aggression force and a war state having two essential elements for carrying out a war, after going beyond the conception of \"exclusive defense.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What merits attention is the fact that the above-said guidelines again call for massive buildup of the \"SDF\" and \"increase of defense capability.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This goes to prove that the \"National Defense Program Guidelines\" are nothing but a document of aggression for more powerfully pushing forward the Japanese militarists' scenario for reinvasion under the signboard of \"defense.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries have become evermore undisguised in their  moves to round off the \"National Defense Program Guidelines\" under the pretext of \"coping with the threat\" from someone and \"situation in the surrounding countries.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The examination of the issue of \"acquiring the capability to attack enemy bases\" under the simulated conditions of the \"preemptive attack\" on the DPRK is, therefore, considered as a top agenda item. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a foolish daydream for the Japanese militarists to stage a military comeback to Korea and realize their old dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\" through Asian aggression. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan would be well advised to halt its preparations for reinvasion, bearing deep in mind that its whole territory is within the striking range of the DPRK."

Ademas tomaron parte los representantes diplomaticos y los miembros de varios paises, acreditados en Corea, y los huespedes extranjeros.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Al hacer uso de la palabra, Pak Pyong Jong, primer vicepresidente del Comite Popular de la Ciudad de Pyongyang, recordo que bajo la sabia direccion del Presidente Kim Il Sung, el ejercito y el pueblo de Corea vencieron a las tropas agresoras norteamericanas, que se jactaban de la \"supremacia\" mundial, y defendieron honrosamente la soberania de la nacion y las conquistas de la revolucion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t De esta manera, -prosiguio- manifestaron sin reservas el poderio invencible del heroico pueblo coreano y dio inicio a la decadencia de los yanquis haciendo trizas el \"mito\" de la \"invencibilidad\" de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Pero, EE.UU., lejos de sacar las lecciones debidas de su vergonzosa derrota sufrida en la pasada guerra coreana, impide la reunificacion de la nacion coreana y destruye la paz de la Peninsula Coreana ocupando por varios decenios el Sur de Corea y practicando obstinadamente la politica hostil a Corea, destaco el orador y continuo:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ultimamente, se tornan mas freneticas las maniobras de EE.UU. para aplastar a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea bajo el pretexto del lanzamiento de satelite artificial con fines pacificos y el ensayo nuclear para la autodefensa realizados por ella.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En la etapa actual en que se inicio la confrontacion total con EE.UU., el ejercito y el pueblo de Corea responderan con la represalia a la \"sancion\" y con la guerra total a la guerra total para defender la dignidad nacional y la soberania del pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Castigaremos duro tambien a los militaristas japoneses y la banda del traidor Lee Myung Bak que actuan imprudentemente adhiriendose a las maniobras anti-RPDC del imperio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En pleno acato a la guia del Dirigente Kim Jong Il sobre la revolucion mediante el Songun (priorizacion militar), todos nosotros debemos luchar tenazmente por defender nuestra idea, nuestro regimen y nuestra causa y alcanzar la victoria final en la confrontacion con EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Le siguieron en intervenir los delegados de la clase obrera, los trabajadores agricolas, los jovenes y estudiantes quienes denunciaron la barbara matanza y la macabra destruccion, sin precedentes en la historia mundial de guerras, que escenificaron los imperialistas norteamericanos, provocadores de la guerra de agresion a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En el tiempo de emergencia, nos levantaremos unanimemente en la sagrada batalla de justicia para exterminar a los agresores y terminar la confrontacion antiyanqui con la victoria de la Corea del Songun (priorizacion militar)."

No la deseamos ni necesitamos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lo poco que hemos recibido mientras tanto, no fue la \"recompensa\" sino el trofeo de la confrontacion nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Al cabo de cuestionar nuestro disuasivo nuclear junto con su amo, el traidor Lee planteo el supuesto \"disuasivo ampliado\" y lo estipulo en el documento conjunto de la \"cumbre\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La declaracion oficial del \"disuasivo ampliado\" significa que el Sur de Corea sera el colaborador activo en el cumplimiento de la estrategia norteamericana de la guerra nuclear mundial y que ambas partes unificaran las fuerzas nucleares y entraran en el sistema de accion conjunta en las operaciones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Durante su visita a EE.UU., el traidor Lee abogo por dar impactos al Norte de Corea mediante las \"conversaciones a 5 bandas sin este\" mientras formaba con su amo la griteria de las supuestas \"conversaciones a 6 bandas\" y la \"renuncia nuclear\" de alguien. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lo que ellos deben saber es que la cita a 6 bandas ya es un plato roto y la \"renuncia nuclear\" es una teoria pasada de moda.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Estarian muy equivocados EE.UU. y los titeres surcoreanos si piensan que podrian cohibir a nuestro pais con esos chismes que pronuncian en duo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Esos politicos incipientes (Lee y su amo gringo) deberan estudiar mas de nuestro pais si quieren decir algo de este."
