This has been possible thanks to the President's immortal exploits, he added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The general secretary went on: Kim Il Sung made immortal contributions to the Korean revolution and the human cause of independence under the banner of independence. He defeated U.S. and Japanese imperialism in one generation and turned the DPRK into an independent, developed socialist powerful country in a short span of time. Dismissing great-power chauvinism, flunkeyism, dogmatism and factionalism, he fully supported the world revolutionary people in their struggle for independence. \r\n Leader Kim Jong Il is successfully carrying the revolutionary cause of Kim Il Sung to completion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people and other progressives pay highest tribute to Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Demanded \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 21 (KCNA) -- If the DPRK-U.S. stand-off is to be terminated, the U.S. should drop its hostile policy toward the DPRK and what is essential for this is to pull its forces out of south Korea. Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says this in a signed article. It goes on:\r\n The U.S. partial \"reduction\" of its forces in south Korea is nothing but an attempt to take to other places some forces it feels unnecessary as a result of their modernization with ultra modern military hardware and the introduction of the mode of long-range naval and air strike. This is a revelation of a dangerous plot to round off their preparations for a war in Korea and bring the Korean people another war disaster. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is 59 years since the U.S. occupied south Korea. The U.S. protracted presence in south Korea and its ceaseless moves for a war against the DPRK drove the DPRK-U.S. confrontation to an extreme pitch of tension and sparked the present serious nuclear crisis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK-U.S. military confrontation can never be terminated and peace on the Korean peninsula is unthinkable as long as the U.S. troops whose main mission is to invade the north remain in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the Cold War era the U.S. justified its policy of military occupation of south Korea with the assertion that it is necessary to cope with the \"threat from the Soviet Union\", but this is no longer workable now. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. has no intention to invade the DPRK, it will feel no need to keep its forces in south Korea any longer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush regime once expressed its will to pull its troops out of south Korea any time the south Koreans oppose the U.S. forces' presence in south Korea. If this is true, the U.S. should opt for the total withdrawal of its forces from south Korea, not their partial \"reduction.\" Even in the light of the six-party talks this would be very helpful to the progress of the talks as it would be a practical measure for the renouncement of the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The total pullback of the U.S. troops from south Korea would create an environment favorable for turning the region with the greatest danger of war in the world into a peace zone and guaranteeing the peace and security of Asia and, furthermore, the rest of the world. This would be in line with the U.S. interests, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the United States, ignoring this, unleashes a war of aggression against the DPRK, it will bring catastrophic consequences to the U.S., too.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean Authorities' Inhumane Action under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 21 (KCNA) -- The south Korean authorities disallowed the proposed visit of a non-governmental delegation to Pyongyang to take part in the memorial functions on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the demise of President Kim Il Sung. Rodong Sinmun Wednesday in a signed commentary terms such action of the south Korean authorities a despicable behavior devoid of any national conscience and will for reunification and an anti-national unethical rash action swimming against the times as it denies the June 15 declaration, the charter for reunification common to the nation, and challenges the fellow countrymen in the north and the present inter-Korean relations.\r\n The action taken by the present regime of south Korea styling itself a \"government for the people\" is, in essence, little short of the unethical crime committed by the \"civilian government\" in the past, the commentary notes, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present government talked about \"cooperation and exchange\" with smile and good words at talks with the north. But, when the issue of a non-governmental delegation's visit to Pyongyang for such a purpose was raised, the government turned down its request under an unreasonable pretext. Good faith is proved by actions rather than words. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Chongwadae\" disallowed the above-said visit, talking about the unreasonable principle that \"the south should not give up its law and principle under the pretext of satisfying the north.\" This laid bare the south Korean authorities' wrong view on fellow countrymen and ulterior design veiled with glossy words \"reconciliation and cooperation.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The former president, high-ranking officials and many people of south Korea have already visited Pyongyang. It is, therefore, self-contradictory to talk about \"law and principle\" under this situation. There are other matters that merit attention. Their assertion means putting their \"law and principle\" above anything else without any consideration of the nation, denying both the Pyongyang meeting and the June 15 joint declaration. This cannot but be a challenge and provocation to the north as their behavior reveals their intention to apply their \"law and principle\" to the north-south relations and fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the south Korean authorities have even the slightest intention to deal with the June 15 joint declaration with good faith and get reconciled with compatriots, they should answer to the nation as regards the open questionnaire issued by the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland and the National Reunification Institute. The time is running out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should make an apology in any form for their wrong behavior before it is too late.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

In the paper Japan painted a distorted picture of the state of affairs, alleging that the situation in the Asia-Pacific region was rendered unstable by the DPRK, pulling it up again.\r\n Minju Joson Wednesday in a commentary says that as for the military capabilities of the DPRK with which Japan took issue, they are means of legitimate self-defense designed to protect the sovereignty of the country and security of the nation from the U.S. imperialists' hostile policy toward the DPRK and their moves to strangle it. Every sovereign state has the right to possess this means and there is no cause for Japan to talk this or that about the matter, it adds. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary cites facts exposing the aim pursued by Japan in trying to find fault with the DPRK in the paper. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the petty trick of Japan to attain everything needed for  turning itself into a military power and implementing its policy of overseas expansion under the pretext of coping with \"threat from the DPRK\", it notes, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a mistake if Japan thought its imprudent scheming would work all the time. Japan would be well advised to refrain from the frivolous act of absurdly slandering others.

He said they herded children into the powder storage and did not give them even a drop of water before spraying gasoline over them to burn them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThen they threw hand-grenades into the storage, killing all of them, he added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Choe Kyong Nyo, section chief of the Sinchon County People's Committee, testified to the mass killings of innocent civilians including children and old people committed by GIs and asked the marchers to fully expose and condemn these hideous crimes before the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Michel Watts, a participant in the march and chief of the U.S. branch of the Association for Friendship with the Korean people, said in his speech that everyone should clearly know about the bloodbath in Sinchon and the blood-stained history of the United States and that he, an American, would like to apologize for GIs' crimes in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He vowed to fight to prevent the repetition of the crimes the U.S. committed against other nations and other countries and the atrocities it perpetrated in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A letter to the U.S. president was adopted at the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The letter said the destruction and killing of civilians committed by Gis during the last Korean war are the inhumane and monstrous crimes unprecedented in the world history of war in their scale and targets and in their ferocious and brutal nature. The U.S. government should be held fully responsible for the above-said crimes and make an honest apology and compensation to the Korean people, the letter demanded, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has stood in the Korean nation's way of independent reunification and seriously threatened peace and security on the Korean peninsula over the last 51 years. It must stop running wild, pondering over the grave consequences to be entailed by its hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. is truly concerned for the peace and reunification of the Korean peninsula, it should immediately accept the fair and aboveboard proposal of the DPRK to seek a peaceful and negotiated solution to the nuclear issue on the principle of simultaneous actions. And it should withdraw its troops from south Korea and stop at once its military threat and blackmail which may lead the situation on the peninsula to catastrophe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Prior to the meeting the marchers visited the Sinchon Museum.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
