            "content": "U.S. New Military Strategy for Expansion of \"Anti-terrorist War\" under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 5 (KCNA) -- The \"report on four-year defense strategy\" called \"1421\" which was approved by U.S. Defense Secretary Rumsfeld is an extremely dangerous war scenario aimed at making effective use of the experience gained by the United States in its aggressive military actions after the end of the Cold War to launch a more active and offensive \"anti-terrorist war\" in different areas of the world.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a special attention in the \"report\" is that the U.S. is seeking its military intervention in various areas of the world and win-win strategy and \"complete occupation\" of a \"hostile state\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As shown in its content, the U.S. new military strategy is a very dangerous war strategy to realize its world supremacy by the method of further intensifying its military intervention and war of aggression in the future under the pretext of \"anti-terrorist war\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In realizing its military strategy the Bush administration designated the DPRK and other countries as the main targets of \"anti-terrorist war\". The main targets of the U.S attack at present are the DPRK, Iran, Cuba, etc. which it singled out as \"part of an axis of evil\" and \"outposts of tyranny\". The U.S. belligerent forces are planning to contain these countries by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Particularly, the U.S. imperialists are considering the DPRK as the main target of their attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. neo-conservatives are letting loose a string of balderdash that a war may break out in the Korean Peninsula if the six-party talks are futile. Such open outbursts were prompted by their real intention to swallow up the DPRK by force of arms, not to peacefully settle the nuclear issue. The U.S. strategic attempt is to pursue its new military strategy first in the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The prevailing situation requires the DPRK to more firmly build up its military deterrent to prepare itself to beat back any aggression by the U.S. imperialists. We will continue to strengthen physical deterrent to cope with the U.S. ever mounting moves to stifle the DPRK by force of arms.\r\n The U.S. should give up its dangerous war strategy seeking to plunge humankind into a sanguinary disaster.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They have served as precious guidelines as they clearly indicated the way of effecting a great upswing in the revolution and construction holding high the banner of socialism without the slightest vacillation even under any rigorous conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The publication of the work helped consolidate the DPRK's single-minded unity in every way, thoroughly establish Juche in the revolution and construction and bring about a turn in the spiritual world of all the people and their work style. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The work has also served as precious guidelines for turning the ranks of the Korean revolution into those devotedly defending the leader. \r\n The last 15 years since its publication have witnessed a good example showing how the servicepersons and people of the DPRK have held their leader in high esteem. They have shared their idea, intention and destiny with the headquarters of the revolution with the unshakable faith that they are sure to emerge victorious when they trust their leader only and struggle as taught by him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Prevailing throughout the society is the spirit of devotedly defending the headquarters of the revolution, the spirit that one should live even a moment for the sake of Kim Jong Il and devote one's life to him. This reality clearly proves the vitality of the idea set out in the work.\r\n The work has thus served as important guidelines for thoroughly establishing Juche in all fields of revolution and construction and a militant banner for bringing about an uninterrupted upswing in socialist economic construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It provides highly important guidelines the army and people of the DPRK should always hold fast to in their efforts to build a great prosperous powerful socialist nation, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And they are turning out more vigorously in the struggle to make a new leap forward in the building of a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Upon receiving the call of the Workers' Party of Korea for putting forward agriculture as the main front of the economic construction this year, too, and mobilizing and concentrating all the forces on farming once again, the officials and working people in the field of agriculture are now in high spirit.\r\n From the New Year's Day, the workers of the Pukchang Thermal-power Complex are turning out large quantities of electricity and those at the Musan Mining Complex successfully conducted the 120,000-cubic-meter blasting with a firm resolution to fulfill the yearly concentrated iron ore production plan that is set 30 percent higher than that of last year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such confidence and resolution can be read on the faces of all the working people of the Pyongyang Steel Plant, Hungnam Fertilizer Complex and other parts of the country.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
