            "content": "Lee Myung Bak's Junkets to U.S. and Japan Flayed in South Africa\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- The Mfumalanga Provincial Committee of the South African Communist Party and the South African Association of Friendship and Solidarity with Korean People jointly released a bulletin protesting traitor Lee Myung Bak's junkets to the U.S. and Japan on May 6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The bulletin in an article said that the visits to the U.S. and Japan paid by the present south Korean chief executive pursuing the policy of confrontation between the north and the south were evidently a sycophantic and treacherous, war junket as he totally sold off the interests of the Korean nation to the foreign forces. They were also part of the shameful anti-reunification campaign for intensifying the inter-Korean confrontation, it added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now the world people regard the division of Korea, which has lasted for over 60 years due to the foreign forces, as the only leftover of the Cold War remaining on earth at present and ardently hope that its reunification will be realized by the united efforts of the Korean nation free from outsiders' interference. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the present south Korean chief executive persistently incites the confrontation between the north and the south with the backing of the U.S., the chieftain of aggression and war, turning aside from the trend of the present times, he will be severely punished by the world's peace-loving peoples without fail as his action is a heinous crime of perpetuating the division of Korea and wrecking peace in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article strongly urged the ruling forces of south Korea to behave themselves clearly seeing the present trend toward peace, immediately drop the policy of confrontation between the north and the south and take the road of finding the way to realize the national reunification as early as possible by the united efforts of the Koreans.\r\n\r\n"
