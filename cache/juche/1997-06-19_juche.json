In this regard the Institute for National Reunification published a white paper on public sentiments in south Korea on June 15.\r\n   The document dealing with the public sentiments seen through public opinion, irony and struggle says that the destruction of Kim Young Sam is a matter of time, and warns that in case the traitor refuses to step down immediately, he will be overthrown in the flames of all-people resistance.\r\n   It goes on:\r\n   According to a poll, 50.7 percent of the pollees voiced protest against Kim Young Sam in 1994, 67.3 percent in 1995, 87.4 percent in 1996 and more than 90 percent in 1997, while only 3 percent of the pollees \"backed\" him. (the Japanese paper Akahata March 1, 1997 and the Japanese paper Sankei Shimbun January 24, 1997)  the south Korean Kyunghyang daily news January 16, 1997, said that 88 percent of those who had voted for him felt regret over what they had done.\r\n   The south Koreans' discontent with Kim Young Sam is illustrated in a lot of satiric stories and cartoons.\r\n   Kim Young Sam is called judas for his treacheries or a turkey for his incalculable moods.\r\n   The February 1997 issue of the south Korean magazine MAL in an article titled \"people turning their back on Kim Young Sam\" says that Chun Doo Hwan, Roh Tae Woo and Kim Young Sam are meeting a miserable end.\r\n   South Korean publications carried pictures and drawings of Kim Young Sam and his son Kim Hyon Chol in the nude, causing a big stir among the people (south Korean magazine Shin Dong-A October 1995).\r\n   There were many struggles of the people from all walks of life against the puppet government after his assumption of office.\r\n   The struggles staged up to date from 1993 totaled more than 18,000, which involved upwards of 15 million people.\r\n   The struggles staged last year totaled 9,300, involving some 3.13 million people.\r\n   The struggles were participated in by broad segments of the people, including students, workers, peasants, intellectuals, pressmen, religionists, citizens, women, minor entrepreneurs, low-class civil servants and hundreds of organisations of students, workers and citizens.\r\n    Hundreds of mock trials for Kim Young Sam and rallies to burn him in effigy took place in south Korea.\r\n   The south Korean magazine Hangyore 21 on April 3, 1997, says that as a matter of fact, Kim Young Sam has been detained in \"Chongwadae\" which is called the most luxurious prison on the globe.\r\n   All this represents voices of the south Koreans against Kim Young Sam. Kim Young Sam should have a correct understanding of the public sentiments and step down immediately, stresses the white paper. \r\n\r\n"

With the approach of the day, the Korean people are looking back on the war with bitter hatred for the U.S. imperialists.\r\n   It was the U.S. imperialists' long-dreamt ambition for world supremacy to stifle the young Democratic People's Republic of Korea in its cradle and turn Korea into a forward base for their Asia strategy.\r\n   After framing up a puppet regime in south Korea, they entrusted U.S. Ambassador to Seoul Muccio and head of the U.S. military advisors' group Robert with the task of working out a plan for the war of aggression on Korea. By these war servitors the socalled \"action plan for northward advance\" was mapped out and the order was issued to start an armed invasion from the areas along the 38th parallel.\r\n   Under the command of Robert, the south Korean puppet army units of the worst type occupied Mts. Songak and Unpha and other major heights and made desperate efforts to expand it into a total war as scheduled. In 1949 they committed armed invasion on more than 2,600 occasions. \r\n   Entering 1950, their war provocation moves reached the climax.\r\n   The United States signed the \"south Korea-U.S. mutual defence assistance pact\" with the south Korean puppets and put the puppet army under their control. \r\nThe enemy declared an \"emergency martial law\" throughout south Korea and amassed the puppet army along the 38th parallel and kept them fully ready for \"northward advance\". Large-scale armed invasions on the DPRK were committed more frequently. The dangerous situation in which war might break out any moment was created in Korea.\r\n   On June 17, 1950, dulles, a notorious war servitor, flew into south Korea as a special envoy of truman. He \"inspected\" areas along the 38th parallel and finally ratified the operational plan for \"northward advance\".\r\n   The U.S. imperialists and the Syngman Rhee puppet clique made preparations for the war of aggression against the DPRK for a long time and started a total armed invasion on the northern half of Korea at 05:00 on June 25, 1950, refusing to accept realistic and reasonable proposals of the DPRK Government for reunifying the country in a peaceful way.\r\n   The U.S. imperialists were mistaken. They thought they could win in the war against the DPRK which was extricated from the colonial slavery just a few years before.\r\n   The Korean people turned out as one man in the just fatherland liberation war for the freedom and liberation of the country. In the three-year-long hard-fought war, they won a great victory and started the U.S. imperialists on the decline. \r\n\r\n"
