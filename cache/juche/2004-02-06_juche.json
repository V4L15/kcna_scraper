            "content": "KCNA Assails Japanese Ruling Party Heavyweight's Anti-DPRK Outburst \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 5 (KCNA) -- Secretary General of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan Abe was reported to have expressed his view at the talks with Armitage, deputy secretary of the U.S. State Department, who visited Tokyo on Feb. 3 that pressure on north Korea is valid.\r\n Such outcry was made in Japan again in the wake of the passage of the \"amendment to the law on foreign exchange\" through the Diet some days ago which is aimed to impose economic sanctions and blockade upon the DPRK. This is triggering off the DPRK's increased bitterness toward Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK knows well the conservative rightist political view and anti-DPRK sentiment of Abe as he cried out for even a \"preemptive attack\" on the DPRK last year. The malignant vituperation mouthed by the No. 2 man of the ruling party of Japan against the DPRK is arousing its vigilance as it does not merely represent his personal view but reflects the Japanese government's hostile policy toward the DPRK which has become all the more undisguised this year. This clearly indicates Japan is working hard to put its strategy of pressure and confrontation with the DPRK in real earnest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pressure means economic sanctions and, in the long-run, war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Judging from this, Japan's talk about \"the solution to nuclear and abduction issues\" and \"validity of pressure\" indicates that Japan is persisting in \"sanctions and blockade\" against the DPRK, not seeking to peacefully settle pending issues between the DPRK and Japan through dialogue. This is a wanton violation of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration in which both promised each other to abide by international law and refrain from doing any acts of threatening each other's security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is intolerable that Japan persists in encroaching upon the sovereignty of the DPRK and pressurizing it instead of redeeming its past crimes in the new century although it inflicted tremendous misfortune and sufferings upon the Korean people in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has always regarded its sovereignty as its life and soul and has never abandoned its principle, yielding to the pressure of anyone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will certainly take necessary counter-measures against Japan's act of gravely infringing upon the sovereignty of the DPRK through economic sanctions, blockade and pressure and its moves to put into practice its hostile policy toward the DPRK while talking about its participation in the six-way talks.    \r\n\r\n"

It goes on:\r\n The three principles of national reunification are a banner of struggle to be held aloft by the nation till the day when reunification has been achieved. They clearly indicate the fundamental stand and way to solve the issue of reunification by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle of independence is a basic principle to be adhered to in the movement for reunification. Only when the principle of independence is maintained for achieving the cause of reunification is it possible to solve the issue of reunification by the concerted efforts of the nation in conformity with the demand of the Korean nation for independence and its interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation should consistently adhere to the principle of national independence which has displayed its great vitality in the movement for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle of peaceful reunification indicates a fundamental way of solving the issue of Korea's reunification to meet the aspiration of all the Koreans and the world peace-loving people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The adherence to the principle of peaceful reunification stands out as the most important issue related to the destiny and prospect of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It is necessary to concentrate the struggle to implement the principle on the United States, the root cause of division and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle of great national unity serves as guidelines in paving the way for independent and peaceful reunification. The issue of achieving reunification to meet the common interests of the nation is not achievable without the great national unity.    \r\n\r\n"

It serves as guidelines for the Korean revolution to be maintained\r\ninvariably till the day a great prosperous powerful nation has been built on this land and the revolutionary cause of Juche started by President Kim Il Sung accomplished, not a tactical proposal to tide over difficulties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il set out the great idea guiding the era and has proved its validity in practice in a less than a decade. This is a clear proof of his brilliant ideological and theoretical wisdom and matchless political ability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The People's Army is the strongest and fully prepared political force on which the Workers' Party of Korea has depended in imbuing the whole society with the Songun idea. It is now successfully fulfilling its honorable mission and duty as the hardcore contingent and the main force of the revolution defending the lifeline of the socialist cause under the Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il.    \r\n\r\n"

The Public Health Ministry has formed a permanent group mainly with officials of the State Hygienic Inspection Centre and the Preventive and the Curative Department as it did when working to prevent SARS last year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The hygienic and anti-epidemic officials and house-calling doctors are all out in a hygienic propaganda campaign to bring the population to the knowledge of the danger of this flu and the course of its spread and measures for preventing it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Flawless measures are being taken to conduct strict veterinary and hygienic quarantine at ports, on borderlines, at airports and especially in the areas along the Demarcation Line for the prevention of the infiltration of its virus. Veterinary inspectors unconditionally intercept problematic items from areas of the outbreak of the flu. Notably, processed poultry is subjected to strict inspection. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The examination of foreign travelers is fairly on a high level.

Not content with this, it is spreading a lie about the \"test of chemical weapons on prisoners\".\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis shows what a base anti-DPRK smear campaign the Bush group is engaged in. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seems to have no more material for conducting such a campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a trite method of the present U.S. administration to use those defectors for inventing lies and justifying a war of aggression under that pretext. This was clearly evidenced by the U.S. war of aggression against Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We do not feel any need to argue about this cheap U.S.  propaganda, but we can hardly overlook an  ulterior aim sought by it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Now the Bush administration finds itself in a tight corner as it provoked a war against Iraq after deceiving Americans and the world. The Bush group, dismayed at the election campaign turning unfavorable for it, is working hard to get rid of the difficult situation by leading the situation on the Korean peninsula to an extreme pitch of tension under the pretext of the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIts   dirty smear campaign is aimed to invent plausible pretexts for starting another Korean war, raising a hue and cry over the \"human rights issue\" in addition to the \"issue of weapons of mass destruction,\" and thus not to repeat its setbacks in Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We are watching every movement of the Bush administration with vigilance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Some media acting tools for the U.S. smear campaign for cheap publicity are well advised to come to themselves, though belatedly.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
