            "content": "Mammoth Pyongyang Rally Denounces UNSC \"Resolution\"\r\nPyongyang, June 15 (KCNA) -- A Pyongyang city rally was held at Kim Il Sung Square Monday to denounce the United Nations Security Council's \"resolution on sanctions\" cooked up at the instigation of the U.S. imperialists.\n\t\t\t\t\tAttending the rally were senior party, army and state officials, the chairman of a friendly party, leading officials of the party, armed forces and power organs, working people's organizations, ministries and national institutions, servicepersons, youth and students and people from all walks of life, more than 100,000 in all.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Ki Nam, secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, in a speech said that the UNSC finally adopted an anti-DPRK \"resolution on sanctions\" at the instigation of the U.S. over the DPRK's second nuclear test, another grave provocation. This is, in essence, a wicked pressure offensive launched by the U.S. imperialists to disarm the DPRK, strangle its economy and undermine its ideology and system, he held, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The UNSC's \"resolution on sanctions\" is an intolerable mockery of the dignity of the Korean people and an arrogant criminal act of wantonly violating its sovereignty. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has so far done what it should do despite the ceaseless \"sanctions\" on the part of the imperialist allied forces. These \"sanctions\" prompted it to augment its national power, far from \"weakening\" it. This clearly proves that no enemy's anti-DPRK \"sanctions\" racket is workable and it is ridiculous and foolish for the U.S. to try to bring down the DPRK through \"sanctions.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hostile forces will sustain a bitterer setback and defeat if they persist in the moves for putting sanctions upon the DPRK and stifling it, misjudging the tough stand taken by the army and the people of the DPRK as \"brinkmanship.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how desperately the U.S. imperialists and other hostile forces may work to isolate and blockade the DPRK, a full-fledged nuclear weapons state, it will remain unfazed. In case the enemies foolishly attempt to blockade the DPRK it will respond to it with resolute and deadly blows, considering it as a war action.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will steadily advance along the path of independence chosen by itself and will win a final victory in the confrontation with the U.S. whether it has flanks or not and whether it receives international aid or not.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pak Jae Gyong, vice-minister of the People's Armed Forces who spoke on behalf of the Korean People's Army, vehemently denounced the UNSC \"resolution\" as a serious provocation, a wanton violation of the sovereignty and dignity of the DPRK and its people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He warned that the KPA will mercilessly frustrate any attempt to check, inspect, examine and blockade any ship and object for which the sovereignty of the DPRK is exercised with powerful military retaliatory blows.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the present situation where the KPA is technically at war with the U.S. imperialists as the Armistice Agreement has lost its legal binding force the KPA will promptly exercise the right to preemptive strike to beat back the enemies' slightest provocation. It will deal telling blows at the vital parts of the U.S. and wipe out all its imperialist aggressor troops no matter where they are in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese militarists and the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors and other lackeys of the U.S. imperialists should stop running wild, well aware that they will never be able to escape a stern punishment by the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK if they keep going reckless.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then the floor was taken by representatives of workers, agricultural workers, intellectuals and youth and students."

This gives the lie to the story floated by the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. administration hastily picked up again the fiction of \"counterfeiting money,\" much upset by the DPRK's successful launch of a satellite for peaceful purposes and the toughest measures taken by it against the U.S. arrogant hostile acts.

It even misinterpreted the DPRK's satellite launch as a missile launch although it was well aware that it was a satellite.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. lacks any logic or coherence in its claims as it is keen to stifle the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The diplomacy conducted by the U.S. on the basis of the worn-out fiction of \"counterfeiting money\" was prompted by the frustration of its anti-DPRK hostile policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The people of the DPRK are hardly repressing their towering indignation at the present U.S. administration as the hostile policy desperately pursued by it toward the DPRK provided another irrefutable evidence that it is little different from the preceding administration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. administration would be well advised to draw a lesson from its preceding administration which imposed sanctions upon the DPRK under the pretext of \"counterfeiting\" only to suffer a bitter setback."

            "content": "Japanese Reactionaries Accused of Agitating Reinvasion of Korea\r\n Pyongyang, June 15 (KCNA) -- The chief of staff of the Air \"Self-Defence Force\" of Japan on June 5 blustered that Japan is getting \"prepared for intercepting missiles,\" raising a hue and cry over the \"missile threat\" from the DPRK. He said that the \"Self-Defence Forces (SDF)\" \"continues gathering information about the moves of the DPRK to launch missiles\" and it is capable of winding up the deployment of a missile shield in 3 hours, once an order is given by the minister of Defence.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Monday observes in a signed commentary carried in this regard;\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His utterances are a revelation of Japan's anti-DPRK hysteria which has gone into extremes since the DPRK's satellite launch for peaceful purposes and second nuclear test and agitation of reinvasion of Korea.     It is the height of folly for the Japanese reactionaries to vociferate about the \"threat of missiles\" from the DPRK, making a ridiculous speculation that someone would reduce the Japanese archipelago to a sea of fire right now. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their loud-mouthed \"threat of missiles\" from the DPRK is nothing but sheer sophism intended to justify and push forward their ambitious building of missile shields and secure a pretext for launching a military invasion against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What merits a more serious attention is that \"preparations for intercepting missiles\" to cope with the \"threat of missiles\" from the DPRK are timed to coincide with the noisy outbursts calling for \"the preemptive attack on the enemy bases\" heard from among the Japanese reactionaries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their much touted \"preemptive attack on enemy bases\" is nothing but a declaration of a war and invasion as they had the DPRK in mind when letting loose such outbursts. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Having emerged a dangerous war state and aggressor force, Japan reached an extreme phase in its moves to stage a comeback to Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By kicking off its invasion of the DPRK the Japanese reactionaries seek to embark upon the road of aggression overseas and realize its old dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\" it failed to do so in the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan is, however, miscalculating.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If Japan persistently perpetrates an attack on the DPRK over the latter's fictitious \"threat\", its armed forces will deal merciless and deadly retaliatory blows at Japan."

Al aprobarse en esta ocasion la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre, programa para la implementacion de la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio, se abrio un nuevo horizonte para la reunificacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El movimiento por la reunificacion independiente, que avanzaba con vigor bajo la bandera \"Entre nosotros, los connacionales\", tropezo con serios obstaculos debido a la aparicion del \"poder\" de Lee Myung Bak en el Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La grave situacion creada hoy en la Peninsula Coreana demuestra claramente que la paz y la reunificacion del pais las pueden conquistar solo cuando libren la resistencia a costa de la vida contra las maniobras de confrontacion y guerra de las fuerzas internas y externas oponentes a la reunificacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Exhortamos ardientemente a todos los coreanos en el interior y el exterior del pais a hacer que unidos firmemente bajo la bandera \"Entre nosotros, los connacionales\", defiendan e implementen exhaustivamente las historicas declaraciones N-S y den la coyuntura decisiva para la reunificacion de la patria."

            "content": "ATCC revela el caracter enganoso del rumor de \"billetes falsificados\"\r\nPyongyang, 15 de junio (ATCC) -- Estados Unidos vuelve a circular el supuesto rumor de \"billetes falsificados\" por la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t  En los ultimos dias, los altos funcionarios de la administracion norteamericana se esfuerzan mucho por dar cierta credulidad a ese rumor intercambiando con sus satelites las informaciones y brindando explicaciones al respecto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esto no pasa de ser un ridiculo intento de mellar la imagen de la RPDC y alcanzar su meta hostil a ella mediante el recrudecimiento de la sancion y presion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El protagonista de esa actividad ilicita es precisamente EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ya no es un secreto que en las oficinas traseras de la CIA y los antros de criminales en todas partes de EE.UU., incluyendo el estado de California, se producen en gran cantidad esos billetes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Por esta razon, la Norteamerica es considerada como cuartel general de la falsificacion de billetes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  De otro lado, son pueriles y carentes de credulidad todas las \"pruebas\" presentadas por EE.UU. para vincular a nuestro pais con ese tema.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Citando las palabras de un ex diplomatico norteamericano, la revista \"News Week\" escribio el 8 de junio que durante el mandato de la administracion Bush, EE.UU. \"no pudo encontrar ni una pizca de la prueba convincente sobre la falsificacion de billetes por el Norte de Corea\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Estas lineas son una muestra directa de las circunstancias del suceso.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Tan pronto como la RPDC lanzo exitosamente el satelite artificial con fines pacificos y adopto la posicion de sobredureza a los arrogantes actos hostiles de EE.UU., la administracion norteamericana se apresuro a sacar el polemico rumor en su intento de insultarnos y doblegarnos mediante la presion y enganar cinicamente al mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  \"Washington Times\" aclaro en su edicion del dia 4 que el \"problema de billetes falsificados\" presentado por la actual administracion norteamericana es una carta para presionar a Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Todo esto demuestra que el problema en cuestion es un asunto de EE.UU. que no tiene nada que ver con nuestro pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Como mostro el rumor de la \"posesion de armas de exterminio masivo por Irak\", cuya falsedad fue reconocida por el mundo, EE.UU. recurre al metodo rutinario de convertir lo blanco en lo negro para realizar su siniestro complot contra otros Estados soberanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t EE.UU., habituado a rehusar la idea, el regimen y la causa de nuestro pais, insiste en que tenemos armas nucleares cuando le decimos que no y no quiere reconocer la posesion de los mismos artefactos aunque la confirmamos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ademas, se obstina en que es un misil a sabiendas de que se trata de un satelite artificial lo que acabamos de lanzar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Carecen asi de logica y coherencia tales criterios de EE.UU. que esta obsesionado solo por atropellar a nuestro pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Por lo tanto, la recirculacion de ese destenido rumor muestra que el imperio se siente frustrado por su inefectiva politica hostil a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nuestro pueblo esta muy indignado ahora tomando ese caso como otra irrefutable prueba de que la actual administracion norteamericana es identica a su antecesora en practicar brutalmente la politica hostil a Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Es aconsejable que la administracion norteamericana tenga presente de las lecciones aprendidas por su antecesora que tuvo que beber el trago amargo a pesar de sus empecinados esfuerzos por imponer sus leyes mediante la \"sancion\" anti-RPDC."
