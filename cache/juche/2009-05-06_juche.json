Speakers at the conference accused the police of arresting at least 240 participants in the actions from April 30 to May 2.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The police went the lengths of blocking even the press conference by force, they stated, adding this suppression means that the Lee Myung Bak \"government\" would not lend an ear to the popular criticism of the unpopular rule. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A press release read out at the conference noted that the police's brutal suppression which had been committed during the candlelight rallies held last year is now repeating itself, strongly demanding that those who ordered the violence be punished at once."
