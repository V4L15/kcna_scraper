Korean Warmongers' Arms Buildup against North under Fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 9 (KCNA) -- The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland and the Korean National Peace Committee issued a joint statement on Friday blasting the anti-DPRK arms buildup of the U.S. and south Korean war maniacs which has reached an extremely grave phase.\r\n Aegis destroyers belonging to the U.S. 7th Fleet equipped with an ultra-modern missile system were deployed in the waters off the east coast of the DPRK and started performing their operational duty on October 1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the middle of September the U.S. deployed in south Korea a squadron of F-15E fighter-bombers of its Air Force which had been based in Alaska and officially announced that it would deploy \"PAC-3\" in its airforce base in Kwangju in November. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Keeping pace with the U.S. moves for a war of aggression against the north, the south Korean bellicose forces decided to increase its defense budget for next year 9.9 percent over this year. They are planning to purchase 40 fighter planes in addition to the same number of F-15K fighter planes of the next generation to be done by 2008 and ship 48 PAC-3s into south Korea over 10 years from this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement brands such reckless arms buildup of the U.S. and south Korean warmongers as an open military provocation to the DPRK and a blatant challenge to the desire and will of all the Koreans and the peace-loving people of the world aspiring after the peace and stability of the Korean peninsula and the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that they are escalating their moves to stifle the DPRK, it is the legitimate right of the DPRK to bolster its deterrent force for self-defense both in quality and quantity, the statement noted, stressing that the army and people of the DPRK will resolutely meet the challenge of the enemy with a thousand-fold retaliation and counter his aggression with merciless crushing blows. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and the south Korean bellicose forces should ponder over the grave consequences to be entailed by their reckless military confrontation with the DPRK and halt at once their dangerous arms buildup, it urged.    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
