            "content": "KCNA blasts IAEA's irresponsible decision \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 14 (KCNA) -- On Feb. 12 the board of governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency was reported to have discussed the \"nuclear issue\" of the DPRK and decided to refer it to the United Nations Security Council.\r\n The IAEA interfered in the \"nuclear issue\" of the DPRK, ignorant of its status in which it withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, only to provoke derision of the public. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK in its Government statement dated Jan. 10, 2003 declared its decision to lift a moratorium on the effectuation of its withdrawal from the NPT. So, it took an immediate effect according to a legal procedure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the DPRK quit the NPT, there is no legal relation between the DPRK and the IAEA and they have no longer any right and obligation under the treaty including the safeguards agreement that existed between the two sides. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Accordingly, it is an interference in the affair of the DPRK for the IAEA to discuss its \"nuclear issue\" as it is unreasonable from a legal point of view and in the light of usage of international relations. This only proves once again that the IAEA is no more than a cat's paw of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are sufficient examples to prove this. When the U.S. brought up the \"nuclear issue\" on the Korean Peninsula again, Baradei, general director of the IAEA, met the U.S. Secretary of State before any others. And no sooner had the U.S. said it would put off the discussion about the \"nuclear issue\" of the DPRK at the UNSC than he announced the postponement of a meeting of its board of governors. As the U.S. held again that the issue should be brought to the UNSC, he, making a  turn on his attitude, convened a meeting of the board of governors on Feb. 12 to adopt a resolution on referring it to the UNSC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not accidental that not a few media paint some members of the IAEA as \"shaggy dogs of the U.S.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is needless to say that for the DPRK to remain a member of the NPT any longer under such circumstances would only bring it greater sufferings and its withdrawal from the NPT was an entirely correct self-defensive step. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By nature, the IAEA is committed to provide for and implement its obligations under the NPT from an impartial stand as it is an organization of the UN. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is, therefore, irony that such international organization acts at the beck and call of the U.S. as its cat's paw. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a universally known fact that it is none other than the U.S. that authored the \"nuclear issue\" of the DPRK and created the worst situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the IAEA truly wants to fulfil its mission as an organization of the UN, it should refer the United States to the UN for violating the basic spirit of the NPT and all the agreements reached between the DPRK and the U.S. and sparking the present nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula, instead of the DPRK's exercise of its legitimate right and step taken to pull out of the NPT in order to protect its sovereignty and vital rights from the U.S. moves to isolate and stifle it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the way for the IAEA to restore the confidence as an international organization, though belatedly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The very existence of the IAEA will be meaningless if it abandons such international obligation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is well advised to stop serving the U.S. any longer and interfering in the \"nuclear issue\" of the DPRK, though belatedly. \r\n\r\n"

Crewmen of the DPRK trading cargo ship Sosan said this at a press conference held in Nampho port on Feb. 13 upon their return home.\r\n Captain of the ship Kang Chol Ryong said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the ship reached the waters in latitude 10 degrees 51.3 minutes north and longitude 60 degrees 22.4 minutes east after sailing almost past the Indian ocean at around 8 in the morning of Dec. 9 a Spanish-flagged destroyer and rescue boat appeared all of a sudden and a fighter was flying over it at the instigation of the U.S. imperialists. They demanded the ship unconditionally stop. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the ship continued its voyage, dismissing their demand as unacceptable, they indiscriminately fired at facilities on the deck of the ship, destroying them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When its crewmen tried to set fire to the ship and sink it in a death-defying spirit, two helicopters airlifted 22 commandos on the ship and another group of at least 40 commandos rushed there by two clippers to occupy its steering and engine cabins. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the afternoon of Dec. 11 U.S. destroyer no. 46, cruiser no.53, PCE no.59, an aircraft carrier, etc. whose force is enough to fight a war put the trading cargo ship under siege and search. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThey arrested our crewmen and transferred them to their cruiser. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nKeeping them in custody in a prison-like place, they searched their bodies and did not allow them even to speak. When the crewmen were suspicious of doing anything not to be desired by them, Americans beat them, trampling down even their elementary human rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This was part of the premeditated and brigandish moves of the U.S. imperialists to isolate and stifle the DPRK and dominate the world with their policy of strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States should be fully responsible for this piratical act and make a formal apology and due compensation to the DPRK Government for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Crewmen answered the questions raised by reporters.    \r\n\r\n"

This is aimed not to miss the golden chance to take the road of war. In other words, such call was prompted by a sinister political intention not to miss this opportunity to adopt the legislation aimed to let Japan emerge a war state at a time when the general situation in the world is strained due to the U.S. daily increasing threat of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such act on the part of Japan is little short of self-destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is well advised to bear in mind that if Japan hurries hither and thither to meddle in other's affair, it will only stir up unnecessary trouble.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
