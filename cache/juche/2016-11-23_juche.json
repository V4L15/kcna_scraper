It is a criminal act to embellish sycophancy and treachery, fascist dictatorship and policy of escalating confrontation with the compatriots in the north pursued by the successive puppet rulers including her father in a bid to benumb the younger generation's consciousness of independence and render the south Korean society conservative and falsify the truth of history. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group is justifying the \"state-compiled history textbooks\", claiming that \"this is an issue different from the Choe Sun Sil scandal\", but this is no more than a cynical play to cover up the criminal acts of monopolizing even the education in history at the prodding of such quasi religious leader and ghost witch as Choe Sun Sil. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the people from all walks of life in south Korea asserted, the \"state-compiled history textbooks\" are an inevitable product of the witch politics which has become a laughing stock of the world people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since the disclosure of the \"Park Geun Hye, Choe Sun Sil scandal\" facts about the above-said green shaman's and fortuneteller's deep interference in the issue of history were brought to light in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Media are recalling that Park talked nonsense while ordering to introduce the above-said system that people cannot but have abnormal soul if they fail to properly learn history, adding that she talked such rubbish under Choe's religious influence. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was also disclosed that Kim Sang Ryul, former chief for education and culture of Chongwadae who took the lead in the retrogressive revision of history textbooks, is maternal uncle of Cha Un Thaek, ad inspector, who is the closest confidant of Choe, and Cha intervened in his personnel affairs. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Choe Sun Sil put Park Geun Hye's all thinking and actions under her control and pulled string behind the scene. She is the \"witch who governs the soul of Park\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is truth about Park's witch politics that she administered all affairs ranging from the appointment of officials to shaping major policies as dictated by Choe. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes without saying that everything including frequent meetings and formation of writing staff as regards \"state-compiled history textbooks\" was done according to the scenario finally examined by Choe. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That is why people of all social standings are staging actions in various parts of south Korea in protest against the puppet regime. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The participants in one million people candlelight action cited the introduction of \"state-compiled history textbooks\" as one of reasons for impeaching Park Geun Hye.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Academic circles and civic organizations are strongly holding that \"they can not distribute the state-compiled history textbooks embellishing pro-Japanese acts and Park Chung-Hee to students\" and even conservative teachers' organizations are joining in the struggle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Opposition parties submitted a resolution calling for stopping and abrogating the introduction of \"state-compiled history textbooks\" to the NA.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group is hordes of traitors who deserve a stern judgment by the nation and should be buried at an early date.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Time will clearly show what miserable end awaits those who have run against the public mindset."

Y deviene la declaracion resuelta de que nuestro justo golpe de represalia no sabe la piedad a los enemigos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tParticiparon en el acto el jefe del 4o cuerpo del EPC, Ri Song Guk, el presidente del Comite del Partido del Trabajo de Corea en la Provincia de Hwanghae del Sur, Pak Yong Ho, los oficiales y soldados del EPC inclusive los uniformados participantes en el combate y los funcionarios y trabajadores del distrito de Kangryong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon anterioridad, los trabajadores del distrito felicitaron con collares y ramos de flores a los uniformados que realizaron meritos en la batalla.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIntervino primero el jefe del 4o cuerpo Ri Song Guk.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl orador dijo que la victoria fulminante en el combate de fuego artillero fue un gran acontecimiento que demostro a todo el mundo el impetu invencible del heroico EPC, bajo la guia de los Generales Insignes del Songun, y escribio otra pagina de triunfo en la historia de la Corea del Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl presidente del Comite del PTC en el distrito de Kangryong, Kim Pong Hyon, pronuncio el discurso de felicitacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLe siguieron en usar la palabra el oficial del EPC Ri Hyon Myong y el suboficial Kim Ryong Jin, participantes en el combate, y el primer secretario del Comite de la Union de la Juventud en el distrito de Kangryong, Jong Song Guk.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tActo seguido, se ofrecio la funcion de felicitacion de los miembros del grupo de propaganda artistica de la unidad militar y del grupo de agitacion artistica movil del distrito."
