On the basis of it, it has maliciously blocked the Korean nation's struggle for peace of the country and its reunification while intensifying the moves for aggression on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. policy of occupying south Korea is chiefly aimed at invading the DPRK and realizing its ambition for military domination over the whole of the Korean Peninsula which is situated in a strategically important position. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists ignited the Korean war in 1950, fully revealing before the world the aggressive nature of their occupation of south Korea and their true colors as a criminal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even after the end of the Cold War the U.S. has not discarded its anachronistic Korea policy but continued resorting to arms buildup and anti-DPRK war exercises in south Korea, thus rendering the situation on the Korean Peninsula to the extreme pitch of tension and increasing the danger of outbreak of a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. advertises that its military presence in south Korea is to \"deter someone's provocation\" and \"keep peace\" in and around the Korean Peninsula. But it is sheer sophism confusing the right and wrong and a crafty deception to justify and perpetuate the U.S. imperialist aggression forces' occupation of south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their occupation of south Korea can never be justified. With nothing can the U.S. conceal the crime-woven history of 62 years during which it has wantonly violated the dignity and sovereignty of the Korean nation, gravely wrecked peace of the Korean Peninsula and sought the confrontation between the north and the south and their permanent division after occupying south Korea by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no justification and pretext for the U.S. to keep its aggression forces in south Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
