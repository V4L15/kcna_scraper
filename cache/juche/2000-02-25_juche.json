He repeatedly invited the Japanese \"emperor\" to visit South Korea, opened its door to Japanese pop culture and abolished the \"system of diversified import channel.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In two years of their office the South Korean rulers have increased such social evils as the ever-widening gap between the rich and the poor, dampened the nation's desire for reunification and escalated the danger of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There are 8 million jobless people in South Korea and the number of beggars is treble that in the period of the \"civilian\" rule. Two-thirds of the middle classes in the past have been reduced to the poor classes, bringing the number of the absolute poor to over 13 million. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The South Korean rulers  have turned down our sincere reunification-oriented offer in which we proposed a wide-ranging dialogue including  high-level talks between the north and the south and set out even ways of implementing priorities to be fulfilled for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They are staging war exercises targeted against the north almost every day after branding it as their \"principal enemy.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean rulers have sold off independence vital to the nation to the foreign forces, plunged the South Korean people into distress through their cunning and vicious anti-social rule, blocked the reunification through anti-reunification confrontation moves and increased the danger of war. These crimes are intolerable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As long as these rulers are allowed to stay in power, the nation can neither recover its dignity and sovereignty from the foreign forces nor achieve national reunification, nor can the South Korean people live as human beings and avoid a scourge of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is the lesson drawn from what they have done in the last two years of their office. \r\n\r\n"
