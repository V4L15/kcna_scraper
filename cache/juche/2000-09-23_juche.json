In fact Korea was divided by the outside forces and its reunification has not yet been realized due to their obstructions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The past history of national reunification movement proves that if their interference in the reunification issue is tolerated it will only lay a more stumbling obstacle to its settlement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   That is why the north-south joint declaration calling for an independent solution of the reunification issue by the united efforts of its master, the Korean nation, has become a milestone for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The reunification issue can be easily settled when the Koreans join their national resourcefulness, wisdom and efforts and display them in the struggle for national reunification. It is illustrated by the affirmative developments after the publication of the historic joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The only way to reunification is to adhere to the principle of solving this issue in an independent way by the Korean nation itself. \r\n\r\n"

The agreed framework clearly stipulates measures of simultaneous actions related to the project, not such article that the U.S. provides the DPRK with light water reactors instead of the latter's acceptance of the IAEA's inspection. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is entirely due to the obstructive moves of the U.S. administration, its conservative forces in particular, that the lwr construction is at risk. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In May last the U.S. Lower House passed a bill made by the Republican Party conservatives, which defines that the U.S. administration is not bound for construction or operation of LWRs in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It also approved a bill on ban to any \"aid fund\" made by a republican conservative congressman arguing that \"this fund can be used to commit the U.S. to the construction and operation of atomic reactors in North Korea.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. senate is now examining a bill which demands any provision of LWR technology to the DPRK be finally approved at the U.S. congress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such being the case, the IAEA is keeping mum about the U.S. wrong attitude but groundlessly taking issue with the innocent DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The facts revealed once again that the agency serves as a puppet of the U.S., bereft of impartiality and international justice which is vital to its existence. \r\n\r\n"

As a result, a decision of the cabinet was adopted to enforce the universal free medical care at state expense in November Juche 41 (1952) and the system of free medical treatment was introduced in the North Korea as a whole from January next year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As the foundations of the independent national economy and firm material and technological foundations for health services were laid after the war, the seventh session of the second Supreme People's Assembly of the DPRK adopted a decision on developing the already enforced universal free medical care into a complete and universal free medical care in February Juche 49 (1960). The Korean people have since then enjoyed medical services of higher level. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In those days clinics sprang up in all rural areas and obstetrical and gynecological department and children's wards in cities and counties and section doctor system was in force all over the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Diagnosis fees, drug fees, hospital charges, recuperation fees, medical examination and consultations and other medical service fees for prevention are borne by the state. It also gives medical benefits equally and free of charge to all the people regardless of sex, age, vocation, residential district and quality of work done. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Under the leadership of the WPK the universal free medical care was also enforced in the 90s, that witnessed the \"arduous march\" and the forced march. \r\n\r\n"

Korean warhawks flailed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 23 (KCNA) -- Papers here today denounce the U.S. and the South Korean warhawks for going against the aspiration after reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They had \"commemorations of half centenary\" of a battle fought during the June 25 war at the \"battle memorial\" near Taegu on Sept. 13 and \"commemorations of half centenary of Inchon landing operation\" for two days from Sept. 14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. was closeted with South Korea in Seoul on Sept. 18 over the issue of lengthening missile range. The  22nd \"U.S.-South Korea military committee\" opened on Sept. 20 called for \"increased joint defence posture\" and \"strengthened military alliance relations.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Rodong Sinmun in a signed commentary termed all this as an undisguised challenge to the historic north-south joint declaration and an intolerable criminal act of chilling the nation's ardent desire for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK can not but take a serious view of the U.S. and the South Korean warhawks for embellishing those responsible for the outbreak of the Korean war of aggression and war criminals, calling back the departed soul of war and getting frantic in arms buildup against the north, deadset against the requirements of the times and the nation's desire for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. \"welcomed\" the progress in the north-south relations, \"expects\" \"detente\" and \"confidence-building\" between the north and south through sustained negotiations and will \"actively support\" them, but, in actuality, it still pursues the policy of confrontation and war against the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   War and confrontation are incompatible with peace and reconciliation. The U.S. and the South Korean warhawks' provocative outbursts to justify the past Korean War of aggression and get on the nerves of the DPRK are clear indication that they seek war, division and confrontation not peace, reunification and reconciliation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A signed commentary of Minju Joson says that the people and the people's army of the DPRK will increase the self-reliant national defence capabilities, more tightly holding the arms of revolution to cope with the reckless moves of the U.S. and the South Korean warhawks. They will wipe out the aggressors if they provoke a war of aggression against the north, \r\n\r\n"
