It is equally foolish of the United States, the assailant, to say that it will provide an \"opportunity\" to the DPRK, the victim, and the latter should reciprocate it by taking a step for peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This arrogant behaviour of the U.S. Will be counter-productive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If peace and stability on the Korean peninsula are to be ensured, the United States must do what it should do. It should discard its policy of stifling the DPRK, withdraw its troops from South Korea and root out the threat to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Minju Joson says if the United States properly behaves and shows good faith, we will reciprocate it. \r\n\r\n"

Korea in grip of worst destitution \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 18 (KCNA) -- The National Reunification Institute on Friday released a white paper on the conversion of South Korea into an area in the grip of the worst destitution in history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The paper disclosed a record high unemployment rate in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The number of its jobless people has reached eight million, far surpassing the danger level of two million. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis means that after the appearance of the present \"government\" it has increased several times that under the previous regime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   According to the recent official statistics on unemployment, of a total of 12,350,000 wage workers in South Korea as of late April this year, full-time workers are 5,952,000 or 48.2 percent and part-time workers 6,399,000. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAfter all, two-third of the South Korean workers are jobless, including those who stay at home to help family members without any job. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As of March, the number of those who sleep in the open the figure at the end of 1997. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Those who are hardly maintaining their jobs, too, suffer untold hardship in their daily life due to the spiraling tax and price, the paper noted, and said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   According to the low estimate made by the \"Ministry of Labour\" of South Korea, workers' average monthly wage in the third quarter of last year decreased 8.1 percent and real wage 14.2 percent as against those in the corresponding period of the previous year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At the end of last year income of a farmer's family dwindled 12.7 percent while its debt increased 30.7 percent as against in the previous year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   With income of workers and farmers decreasing, the number of the absolutely poor last year increased nearly three times that in the previous year, or 30 percent of them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This means that over 13 million of the South Korean population are below the poverty line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Last year the wholesale price jumped up 7.5 percent as against the previous year. Prices of daily necessities including foodstuff shot up 11.1 percent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Divided families are on the increase and such all kinds of social evils as murder, bribery and suicide caused by hard living are gripping South Korea due to the IMF trusteeship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   According to data released by the \"statistical office\", families that lost either fathers or mothers numbered more than 941,900 as of October last year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Wanderers and cripples who were deserted by families number more than 84,000 in Seoul alone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Such utter destitution resulted in 1.59 million cases of crimes in South Korea last year, up 6.3 percent over the previous year, with 4,356 cases on a daily average. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the first quarter of last year alone, the number of deaths by family suicide, group suicide, self-immolation and suicide by jumping from tall building was more than 2,300, an increase of 3.6 percent over that in the previous year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The worst destitution in South Korea is not a temporary phenomena caused by natural disaster or economic depression but is an inevitable outcome of the U.S.'s colonial rule and the South Korean authorities' flunkeyist and treacherous anti-national policy. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
