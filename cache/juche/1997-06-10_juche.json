Therefore, there can be no question concerning who wins in it or not today when the Cold War is over.\r\n   Over the end of the Cold War, the imperialists claim that socialism is defeated by capitalism. Their allegation does not sound reasonable.\r\n   From the viewpoint of impartiality and historic development, the end of the Cold War means the failture of superpowers in their policy of strength. In other words, with the end of the Cold War the showdown of the two superpowers--the United States and the Soviet Union--came to a close.\r\n   After the end of the Cold War the United States advertised that it was the only superpower in the world and tried to maintain and expand the old order of domination and subjugation, persistently pursuing the policy of strength, but failed to justify itself in many issues.\r\n   The contradictions and antagonism among imperialist powers, which were concealed in the period of the Cold War, have come up again to the surface and their strife for domination over wider areas deepened, precipitating the crisis and decline of the imperialists as a whole.\r\n   The end of the Cold War is an important prerequisite to the realisation of independence.\r\n   Great efforts have been made to revive socialism, though the imperialist's raised cheers over its \"end\".\r\n   All the facts vividly prove that the end of the Cold War does not mean the \"victory\" of the imperialists and that the situation is not in favor of the imperialists who are seeking world supremacy.\r\n   With any sophism the imperialists cannot distort the stark historical facts. \r\n\r\n"

It was a patriotic mass struggle for national sovereignty and independence against the Japanese imperialists' atrocious colonial rule over Korea.\r\n   Through this struggle, the Korean people fully revealed the Japanese imperialists' aggressive nature and deceptiveness of their \"cultural rule\" and dealt a telling blow at their colonial rule.\r\n   In a report at the meeting, Paek Nam Jun, Director of the Secretariat of the C.C., the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland, said:\r\n   It is 71 years since the June 10 independence movement and more than half a century since Korea was liberated from the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule. However, the national sovereignty is still violated ruthlessly in one half of the country.\r\n   The United States, which occupied south Korea in place of Japanese imperialism, has maintained its outrageous colonial rule there for 50 odd years and is inspiring the south Korean bellicose elements to a war against the north.\r\n   If the U.S. truly wants peace and security in the Korean Peninsula, it should immediately respond to the DPRK's positive proposal for a peace-keeping mechanism. And it must renounce its policy of hostility towards the DPRK, one of the leftovers of the cold war era, and stop sheltering Kim Young Sam, who is trying to put the brakes on the improvement of DPRK-U.S. relations.\r\n   The Japanese authorities must give up their policy of hostility toward the DPRK at once. They must awake from the daydream of gratifying the ambition for reinvasion of Korea, make an official apology and governmental compensation for all the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists against the Korean people in the past, including the crime related to the \"Comfort Women for the Army\" issue.\r\n   For the reconciliation and unity of the Korean nation and reunification of the country it is imperative to remove Kim Young Sam, an obstacle to their achievement.     \r\n The entire fellow countrymen in the north, the south and overseas should turn out in the efforts to make 1997 a historic year in opening a new chapter of national reconciliation and unity, and a meaningful year of solidarity for national independence and peace. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
