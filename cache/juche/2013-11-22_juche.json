            "content": "KPA Warns S. Korean Forces Not to Forget Lesson of Yonphyong Island Shelling\r\n Pyongyang, November 22 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Command of the Korean People's Army in the southwestern sector of the front released the following statement Friday:\n\t\t\t\t\t Thunderous shelling rocked the earth, pounding the enemies who mounted preemptive attacks with just showering of shells in the hotspot area in the southwestern sector of the front on November 23 three years ago.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prompt counterattack made by the service personnel in the southwestern sector of the front turned Yonphyong Island into the sea of fire. This praiseworthy event proved that the DPRK will never tolerate anyone who provokes it and that the provokers will be made to pay a very dear price.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Yonphyong island shelling was a result of the puppet forces' reckless provocation against the DPRK in all aspects.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet forces were staging Hoguk war drill against the DPRK at that time. On November 23 they declared that they would hold adventurous artillery shelling drill, threatening the security of the territorial waters of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean People's Army immediately sent an advance notice, denouncing the puppet forces for their sinister plot to maintain the brigandish \"northern limit line\" and warning them to behave with discretion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the puppet forces, buoyed with extreme provocative hysteria, opened fire at the sacred territorial waters of the DPRK, defying its repeated advance warnings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is limit to patience.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The heroic service personnel in the southwestern sector of the front launched strong counterattack all at once.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They shelled Yonphyong Island, the headquarters of the provokers, engulfing the island in the sea of fire.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This left puppet soldiers dead and wounded, and others went into hiding into shelters and dugout to find a way out.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Puppet army barracks, commanding posts, police stations and other army and police buildings turned into ashes and K-9 howitzers, radars and firepower strike means with various missions turned into scrap iron.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Much embarrassed by the powerful retaliatory blows of the KPA, the puppet military sent a notice to the KPA, begging it to stop shelling.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This was tantamount to a surrender document unprecedented in the history of the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No sooner had he received a report about the Yonphyong Island shelling than traitor Lee Myung Bak rushed into the underground cellar of Chongwadae where he cried out to stop it from \"developing into a war\". Later puppet Defense Minister Kim Kwan Jin made an official appearance at which he said that the shelling was an \"indelible and painful wound\" and a \"case that gave great disappointment\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Yonphyong island shelling was a just strike of the army and people of the DPRK who do not tolerate even a bit those who infringe upon the inviolable sovereignty and the dignity of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural that the service personnel in the southwestern sector of the front mercilessly countered the provokers who dared opened fire into the territorial waters of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The shelling was a retaliatory war waged by the defenders of sovereignty. It taught the puppet military warmongers how much price they would have to pay for their reckless provocation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This was also an eruption of the pent-up grudge of the army and people of the DPRK in the face of the reckless provocation of the maniacs keen on escalating confrontation with fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The deep-running hatred toward the enemies resulted in the shower of shells and the mounting resentment turned the island into the heap of ashes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The KPA side did not suffer a single casualty or the loss of single piece of weapons from the shelling. It was a proud and victorious battle that demonstrated the might of the powerful Paektusan revolutionary army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Throughout the shelling the service personnel in the southwestern sector of the front and the people fought in the same trench and after the battle they climbed to nearby hills and even on rooftops of dwelling houses, shouting hurrah and sharing strength and courage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The scene on the Island, on the other hand, was quite spectacular.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not only inhabitants but service personnel of the puppet army tried to escape from the island to get rid of horror. The sea route leading to Inchon was blocked as they fled in disarray.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But far from drawing a due lesson from the shelling the puppet forces tried to convince the public that the shelling incident was a result of \"provocation\" by the DPRK. They even described their defeat as \"victory\" and held the farce of anti-communist \"commemorative event\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  There are countries and nations which commemorate and celebrate war victories but it is only the south Korean puppet forces who describe defeat as \"victory\". How pitiful they are.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Last year traitor Lee Myung Bak with just \"2MB\" of IQ held the farce. This year Park Geun Hye and her group is behaving just as same as Lee.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park and her group should draw a bitter lesson from the shameful defeat they sustained from the Yonphyong island shelling.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the fixed will and determination of the army and people of the DPRK including the service personnel in the southwestern sector of the front not to miss an opportunity should the puppet forces make provocation again.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Three years ago the retaliatory blow was confined to the Yonphyong island only but this time Chongwadae and other bases of the puppet forces will be put within the striking range.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet forces are blustering that they reinforced MLRS, Cobra choppers and Spike missiles and other strike means in their bid to retrieve their defeat. They are even spreading the news that they finished the first-phase \"fortification\" project on the five islands in the West Sea of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is as foolish an act as trying to evade the shower of shelling with an ordinary umbrella.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should clearly bear in mind that everything will turn into stick of taffy by the unprecedentedly powerful military strike of the KPA.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should never forget that the recurrence of the reckless provocation will reduce Chongwadae into the sea of fire leading it to the reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If they run reckless, oblivious of the bitter lesson of the defeat, they will never be able to escape miserable fate.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Victory is always in store for the powerful Paektusan revolutionary army, defenders of justice."

Korea's Abduction of DPRK Inhabitants Rapped and Countries Concerned Urged to Repatriate Them\r\n Pyongyang, November 22 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea, gave the following answer to the question put by KCNA in connection with the fact that agents and human traffic dealers of the south Korean Intelligence Service (IS) were arrested by Chinese security personnel while abducting inhabitants of the DPRK to forcibly take them to south Korea:\n\t\t\t\t\t As already reported, agents and human traffic traders of the IS were arrested by security personnel of China while abducting several inhabitants of the DPRK to forcibly take them to south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean regime is now impudently making much fuss, putting a \"diplomatic pressure\" on a country concerned and urging it to \"provide the status of refugees\"  to them. This is just like a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even the U.S. State Department made such ridiculous remarks as claiming that those inhabitants should not be sent back to the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is sheer sophism of a brazen-faced gangster.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This case is an unpardonable and unethical criminal act as it is another organized and deliberate abduction of inhabitants of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is well known to the world that such official institutions as the IS, a center for hatching plots against the DPRK, lured and abducted inhabitants of the DPRK to take them to south Korea for using them for anti-DPRK smear campaigns by infiltrating plot-breeding organizations under the guise of \"religion\", \"human rights\", etc. and brokers blinded with money-making into a third country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Dozens of inhabitants of the DPRK succeeded in returning home, cursing the hell-like south Korea to where  they had been forcibly taken after being abducted by puppet forces. Truth about their abduction operations and the south Korean regime's detention of those inhabitants from the north wishing to go back there have been brought to daylight.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It had already been disclosed that south Korean agents' attempt to take away nine youngsters to south Korea via a Southeastern Asian country after abducting them in a northern border area of the DPRK broke down.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This indicates that the south Korean regime is indiscriminately luring and abducting inhabitants of the DPRK whether they are adults or children.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ceaseless complaints are made by citizens of the DPRK overseas and their children that some of them were lured and abducted by south Korean agents and that they received threatening phone calls from unidentified persons who hold them in hostage. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent case is part of the above-said operations, clear evidence proving the hideous luring and abducting operations of the puppet regime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After their agents were caught red-handed, the puppet regime is busy describing those inhabitants as \"defectors from the north\" or \"refugees\" in a bid to cover up their unethical acts. But this only brings into bolder relief its despicable true colors as man-hunters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world knows no such villains who, blinded with confrontation with fellow countrymen, are conducting luring and abducting operations in broad daylight in wanton infringement upon the sovereignty of the other country and international law as the south Korean regime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said crimes of the south Korean regime deserve bitter condemnation and such gangsterism should not be allowed under any circumstances.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK calls upon the countries concerned to firmly reject and censure  the hostile acts of the U.S. and the south Korean regime against the DPRK and urges them to send back its inhabitants as early as possible  as required by international law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the present grave situation where the IS and those in league with it carry on their operations to lure and abduct inhabitants of the DPRK and their children and make threatening phone  calls taking them as hostages the DPRK will severely punish all those involved in such operations by employing every means and method as already declared."

Korea's \"Theory of Adhering to Principle\"\r\n Pyongyang, November 22 (KCNA) -- \"Theory of adhering to principle\" which the south Korean authorities advocate as \"policy toward the north\" is being denounced by the public at home and abroad less than one year after its appearance.\n\t\t\t\t\t They described the positive signs that were seen in the north-south relations as a \"result of their adherence to the principle\" while the stalemate as an \"unavoidable pain\" in the course of \"adhering to the principle\". They also excused their anti-DPRK provocative moves as an act for showing \"principle\". But no one will be taken in by such a poor excuse.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The public is unanimous in assessing it as sophism for maintaining confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t One can clearly understand it from the contents of the \"principle\" which the puppet forces call for adhering to.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The core of the principle envisages turning the \"abnormal relations\" in the period of the June 15 era into \"normal state-to-state relations consistent with international norms\" and leading the \"north into change\" through international cooperation for pressure and thus realizing \"reunification under the liberal democratic system\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was, in a word, meant to establish \"new framework of south-north relations\" in which the south is neither being led by the north nor making a concession. This was raised by traitor Lee Myung Bak only to be thrown into the dustbin.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The principle further traces back to the \"policy toward the north\" pursued by \"yusin\" dictator who earned an ill fame in the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Traitor Park Chung-hee was a die-hard confrontational maniac who was buoyed with the ambition for \"unification by prevailing over communism\" while trumpeting about \"confrontation accompanying dialogue\" and \"contest of social systems\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That's why he put up the theory of \"two Koreas\" proposed by the U.S. and worked hard to keep the nation divided for an indefinite period soon after he signed the July 4 north-south joint statement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He insisted on state-to-state relations on the Korean Peninsula and pushed forward his plan to fix the division of the nation while denying the homogeneity of the nation whose history spans 5 000 years.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not satisfied with the territorial and national division at the hands of outsiders, he committed the traitorous crime of building a concrete wall, physically bisecting the peninsula into two parts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The same is the case with the \"north policy\" pursued by Park Geun Hye.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She openly claims that she entered the political arena to \"restore the honor of her father as a politician\". After taking office she has left no means untried to call back the departed soul of \"yusin\". This speaks volumes for her true colors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The chief executive openly spoke ill of the social system and policy of the fellow countrymen in the north and solicited for cooperation for escalating confrontation with them. In the future \"north policy\" orientation document that was crafted shortly ago she even denied part of the October 4 declaration and added such provocative provisions as the \"north's nuclear issue\" and institution of \"north human rights act\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Given the development of the situation for the less than a year, no one can vouch that she would not commit traitorous acts more hideous than what her father committed and can go impudent calling for \"adhering to principle\" in a bid to attain her sinister intention.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park's \"theory of adhering to principle\" is, in the final analysis, a theory of escalating confrontation in the period of \"yusin\", a replica of the theory of fixing division and the extension of the theory of inciting a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The principle to be held fast to by the north and the south is the three principles of national reunification-independence, peaceful reunification and the great national unity-and the idea of \"By our nation itself\" clarified in the historic north-south joint declarations.  There can never be any other principle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet regime will meet a miserable end earlier should it keep escalating confrontation with fellow countrymen while opposing the truth of the times and history."

sudoeste.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos proyectiles cayeron como lluvias en la isla Yonphyong, antro de los provocadores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn un abrir y cerrar de ojos, la isla se convirtio en un mar de fuego.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe produjeron bajas y lesionados entre los efectivos del ejercito titere surcoreano y los sobrevivientes huyeron en busca de refugios.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos cuarteles y puestos de mando del ejercito titere, la estacion policiaca y los demas establecimientos militares y policiales se redujeron a cenizas mientras diversos medios de artilleria, inclusive los canones de tiro parabolico K-9 y los radares, se hacian chatarras.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEspantado por el golpe de represalia, el circulo militar surcoreano remitio al EPC un aviso suplicando el paro de fuego.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto significo el acta de capitulacion sin precedente en la historia de relaciones intercoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe conocio despues que tan pronto como recibiera el informe del incidente, el traidor Lee Myung Bak se refugio apresuradamente en el sotano de Chongwadae (Casa Azul) instruyendo frenar la \"ampliacion de batalla\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn tanto, Kim Kwan Jin, ministro titere de Defensa Nacional, reconocio en un lugar publico que el incidente fue una \"herida muy dolorosa que no se puede olvidar\" y \"antecedente que dio una decepcion demasiado grande\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn esa batalla de justicia, el ejercito y el pueblo de la RPDC demostraron que no perdonan ni un apice a los que se atreven a atentar contra nuestra soberania y dignidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFue justo que los oficiales y soldados del frente sudoeste hayan asestado un golpe demoledor a los provocadores que lanzaron primero los proyectiles hacia las aguas jurisdiccionales de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl incidente fue una batalla de venganza de los defensores de la soberania que ensenaron claramente a los belicistas de la capa militar titere cuan les cuesta la absurda provocacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDevino tambien la explosion de ira acumulada del ejercito y pueblo coreanos por la imprudente provocacion de los maniacos de confrontacion fratricida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn aquel entonces, tal furia se reflejo en las rafagas de venganza que redujeron a cenizas la isla Yonphyong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara la RPDC, el intercambio de fuego artillero en la isla Yonphyong fue un triunfo orgulloso que hizo alarde a todo el mundo del poderio del ejercito heroico y revolucionario del monte Paektu que no sufrio entonces ni una sola baja ni la perdida de ninguna arma.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante la batalla, los oficiales y soldados del frente sudoeste combatieron junto con los habitantes locales y despues del paro de fuego, compartieron la victoria aplastante coreando vivas en las cimas de montes y hasta sobre los tejados del poblado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn contraste, se ha dado una escena de ruina en la isla Yonphyong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos islenos y hasta los oficiales y soldados del ejercito titere surcoreano intentaban la fuga para liberarse del panico y pesadilla, de tal modo que fuera bloqueada hasta la ancha ruta maritima hacia Inchon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn vez de aprender la leccion, desde el ano pasado, los titeres enganan la opinion publica como si el incidente fuera estallado por el \"acto provocador\" de la RPDC y realizan hasta el \"acto conmemorativo\" anti-RPDC describiendo su derrota como \"victoria\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los paises y naciones de este mundo celebran y festejan las victorias, pero, los titeres surcoreanos son los unicos que \"conmemoran\" su derrota pintandola como \"triunfo\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t!Que miserables son ellos!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark Geun-hye y sus compinches son identicos al traidor Lee Myung Bak con un indice de intelectualidad de 2MB.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark y su horda deben aprender la leccion de su derrota vergonzosa sufrida en la isla Yonphyong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito y pueblo coreanos, en particular los oficiales y soldados del frente suroeste mantienen la invariable voluntad y determinacion de no perder nunca la oportunidad si los titeres vuelven a cometer tal provocacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHace 3 anos, el fuego de venganza se limito a la isla Yonphyong, pero esta vez sus blancos seran todos los bastiones de los titeres surcoreanos, inclusive Chongwadae.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara tomar desquite de su derrota, ellos anuncian ahora que reforzaron los medios de ataque de la isla Yonphyong con el despliegue adicional de los lanzacohetes reactivos, el radar sofisticado anti-artilleria, el helicoptero de ataque Cobra y los misiles Spike. Ademas, para dar la impresion de que se puede protegerse del ataque de la RPDC, dicen que fue concluida la obra de \"fortificacion\" de primera etapa en las 5 islas del Mar Oeste de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, este anuncio es una tonteria de quien trata de defenderse de la avalancha de obuses con un simple paraguas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEllos deben darse clara cuenta de que todos esos medios seran liquidados en un instante ante el ataque militar sin precedente del EPC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo deben olvidar ni un momento que si se repite la provocacion imprudente, el conflicto armado de la isla Yonphyong se extendera a la batalla para arruinar Chongwadae y a la guerra de reunificacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi los titeres se abalanzan imprudentemente contra la RPDC olvidando la leccion amarga de la isla Yonphyong, no evitaran un fin tragico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa victoria sera siempre del potente ejercito revolucionario del monte Paektu, defensor de la justicia."
