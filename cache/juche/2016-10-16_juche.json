            "content": "U.S.-Japan Alliance Is One for Aggression and War: Rodong Sinmun\r\n Pyongyang, October 16 (KCNA) -- Harris, commander-in-chief of the U.S. Armed Forces in the Pacific, at the recent talks with Japanese Defense Minister Inada said that the U.S.-Japanese relations are a basis of peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region. Echoing Harris' remarks, Inada parroted that Japan-U.S. relations of trust are strong and Japan wishes to build close relations with the U.S. forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun Sunday terms it a gangster-like logic making profound confusing of right and wrong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The intensified U.S.-Japan alliance is a basic factor rendering the situation in the Asia-Pacific region more unstable, the commentary notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Though the U.S. has to decrease the military spending due to its serious economic crisis, it is working hard to fan Japan's militarization in a bid to use it as a shock brigade and hold a military edge in Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is also seeking a sinister intention by calling for intensifying the U.S.-Japan alliance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The structure of confrontation in the region has taken more concrete shape and a dark cloud of a new arms race and military conflict is hanging heavily owing to the U.S. policy of aggression and war and Japan's policy of kowtowing to the U.S. The Korean peninsula and the rest of the Asia-Pacific region and, furthermore, the world are on the threshold of a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In a conclusion, the U.S.-Japan alliance being tightened, emitting powder smell under the deceptive pretext of \"security\" is one for aggression and war bringing disaster only.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and Japan are describing the U.S.-Japan alliance, the dangerous hotbed of war in the region, as \"basis of peace and prosperity\" and trumpeting about its justification in a bid to divert elsewhere the attention of the international public focused on them and justify their moves for aggression and war which envisages using the world as a theatre."
