National independence is the basic principle that should be adhered to in any circumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The principle of peaceful reunification is an important principle that mirrors the requirements of the times and vital interests of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There is no reason whatsoever for the Korean people to suffer war disaster in the peace-loving world even after the end of the Cold War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   National reunification is an issue of national reconciliation and unity and a great undertaking for the prosperity of the nation and eternal happiness of posterity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSo, the principle of peaceful reunification that guarantees this should be held fast to. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The principle of great national unity provides a sure guarantee for the independent, peaceful reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   No one can work for the reunification in our stead. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Whoever concerned about the fate of the country and nation should give top precedence to the ideal of the nation and the shared interests of the nation from a patriotic stand and get united on this basis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Firm unity of all the compatriots in the north and south of Korea and abroad means the reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   An adherence to the three principles of national reunification is the top priority of the Korean people in the efforts for reunification and they are the fixed principles of national reunification. \r\n\r\n"

This very urgently calls  on the world people advocating independence to struggle in unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The might of the anti-imperialist forces for independence lies in unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What is of utmost importance in achieving the unity of the world people is to strengthen the unity of the world socialist movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is also important to strengthen the unity of the non-aligned movement, a mainstream of the anti-imperialist forces for independence at present. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The world people advocating independence can surely destroy imperialism and build an independent new world only when they unite as one. \r\n\r\n"

The strategic objective of their moves for nuclear weaponization and the conversion of Japan into a military power is to realize their design for overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan keen on embarking upon overseas expansion backed by the U.S. is chiefly responsible for destabilizing the situation and vitiating peace and security, the commentary notes, and urges Japan to drop such wicked attitude intended to justify its wrongs and achieve their sinister aim. \r\n\r\n"
