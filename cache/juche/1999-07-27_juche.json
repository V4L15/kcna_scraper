The government and people of Syria will always stand firm on the side of the Korean people. \r\n\r\n"

The U.S. armed spy ship \"Pueblo\" was captured while conducting espionage in the territorial waters of the DPRK on January 23, 1968.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The then President of the United States, Johnson, decided to take \"a sort of military retaliatory measure\" at the \"National Security Council\" and amassed large armed forces including aircraft carriers in the East Sea of Korea.   The world was apprehensively watching the situation of the Korean peninsula.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But the Democratic People's Republic of Korea resolutely declared that it would return retaliation for the \"retaliation\" of the U.S. and all-out war for all-out war.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   On December 23 that year the United States signed a document which apologizes for its aggressive act and guarantees that it will not repeat such a criminal act. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAt that time the U.S. weekly  time, commenting on this incident, said  that the U.S. should draw  lessons from the stark fact that it was beaten to a pulp by North Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States, failing to draw lessons, repeated such a tragic comedy in the incident of large spy plane EC-121 in April 1969.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. Korea policy aroused more serious concern  in the 90s.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   After capitalism revived in the former soviet union and east European countries which were building socialism, the U.S. has put pressure upon socialist Korea with military strength and economic sanctions, spreading the rumour about \"nuclear suspicion\" in a bid to isolate and suffocate it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe western world joined in the anti-DPRK campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The world could not but express concern over the situation prevailing in the DPRK, which was standing face to face with the imperialist allied forces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK put the enemies on the defensive with a firm stand placing the country at \"the semi-war footing\" and the \"declaring of withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   An agreement was reached at the DPRK-U.S. marathon negotiations and the U.S. President bill Clinton sent a guarantee message. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The anachronistic U.S. Korea policy still remains unchanged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States will suffer a bitterer defeat if it acts rashly, oblivious of the past lessons.  \r\n\r\n"

They also seek to ignite a new war on the Korean peninsula together with their master and realize their ambition for aggression on the north at any cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If they persistently turn to unleash a war of aggression on the north, the Korean People's Army and people will wipe out all the aggressors, provocateurs, and certainly accomplish the historic cause of national reunification. \r\n\r\n"

It came when the Japanese reactionaries were examining a plan for air raids on the DPRK's \"missile launching base.\"  So this deserves serious attention.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If F-2 support fighter plane is refueled in the air, this will enable Japan to conduct an aerial operation against the Korean peninsula in any area. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese military is attempting to have a large-scale F-2 combat group in a few years to come. This attempt is very dangerous when it is viewed with the examination of the projected air raids through F-2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their moves to introduce midair refueling tankers focussed on the Korean peninsula constitute a green light for reinvasion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But the war hysterics of the arrogant Japanese reactionaries overheated with the fever of reinvasion reminds the DPRK of a puppy that knows no fear of the tiger. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The Japanese reactionaries  are well advised to ponder over what that means and stop digging out their own grave. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
