            "content": "Notice Sent to Chief Delegate of South Side to Inter-Korean General-Level Military Talks \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, April 3 (KCNA) -- The head of the delegation of our side to the north-south general-level military talks sent a notice to the military authorities of the south side on March 29 in which he clarified the principled stand of the Korean People's Army concerning the outbursts let loose by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the south Korean forces calling for a \"preemptive attack\" on the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our side sent the notice because the above-said outbursts were the gravest and the most undisguised challenge to the DPRK in the history of the north-south relations and little short of a declaration of a war in the true sense of the word. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a particularly serious attention is that they were dangerous reckless remarks which could not be construed otherwise than a vivid manifestation of the treacherous anti-DPRK policy of confrontation of the newly emerged south Korean authorities opposed to reunification and peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK denounce the outbursts let loose by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the south Korean forces as a revelation of his political immaturity and ignorance of military knowledge as he does not know what is the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula.  He is also condemned by them for his flunkeyism and servile attitude towards his master as the guy took the lead in executing his policy, blindly echoing his assertion that the \"north should dismantle its nukes first.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even political and public circles of south Korea are critical of him, asserting they can hardly understand \"why he made such remarks, enraging fellow countrymen and pushing the north-south relations to the phase of confrontation.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis being a hard reality, the south Korean military authorities were reported to have held secret confabs with those chiefs in charge of security of \"Chongwadae,\" \"the ministry of Unification\" and \"the ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade\" for several days at which they consulted a counter-proposal calling for \"squarely dealing with the situation strictly from a principled and pragmatic stand\" instead of owning responsibility for their crimes and the prevailing situation and honestly apologizing for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already expected, the south Korean military authorities sent a reply notice to the KPA side on April 2 in which they revealed their unreasonable stand taken according to the above-said counter-measure, three days after it notified the south side of its principled stance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the notice the south Korean military authorities let loose a spate of clumsy excuses, asserting that the principled stand taken by the KPA side as regards the outbursts calling for a \"preemptive attack\" was no more than accusations made by the north side after \"interpreting them its own way\" and the south side deemed it \"an inappropriate measure\" and \"felt regret at it.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They even revealed such an unsavory stand to shuffle off the responsibility for the prevailing situation upon the DPRK side and went the lengths of urging the DPRK side to immediately stop \"self-willed accusations and acts of escalating tension\". This reminds one of a guilty party filing a suit first. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The head of the north side's delegation to the north-south general-level military talks on April 3 sent another notice to the chief delegate of the delegation of the south side in connection with the above-said undesirable response made by the south Korean military authorities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the notice the head of the delegation of the north side charged that the south side's stand clarified in its reply notice was nothing but an excuse and declared that it would take prompt corresponding military countermeasures from the already clarified principled stand of the KPA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities had better properly understand the stand of the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK side that it would counter any slightest attempt to be made by them for \"a preemptive strike\" with more rapid and powerful preemptive strikes of its own mode and they will not be able to evade the responsibility for the situation which compelled the DPRK side to suspend all the north-south dialogues and contacts and ban the passage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The KPA never says an empty word.   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Don't make far-fetched assertions.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said warhawks went so impertinent as to insist that \"there exists no joint agreement between the north and the south.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean forces' acts of unhesitatingly infiltrating warships into the territorial waters of the north side after throwing away like a pair of old shoes the agreement which they committed themselves to honor before the nation is a brigandish act to defend the illegal \"northern limit line.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean military authorities should properly understand the gravity of the situation, make a thorough-going probe into the truth behind the incident and sternly punish the provokers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should bear in mind that should they keep infiltrating warships into the above-said waters in defiance of the warnings of the north side, straining the situation, this will compel the KPA side to take unpredictable countermeasures against them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA will closely follow the future action of the south Korean forces.   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is working hard to stifle the DPRK and provoke a war of aggression against it, thus throwing a big hurdle in the way of achieving peace, stability and reunification of the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present conservative ruling quarters of south Korea defile the uprising, calling it \"revolt\" and the like. Pursuant to the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK, they are pushing the north-south relations to those of confrontation and catastrophe, blatantly swimming against the trend of the times towards independence, reunification and peace and prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently the south Korean authorities made no scruple of letting loose a spate of outbursts that they would mount a \"preemptive attack\" on the DPRK, totally denying the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration. This brings into bolder relief the treacherous nature of the Lee Myung Bak regime opposed to reunification and peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality clearly proves that the south Koreans' desire for independence, peace and reunification can never come true as long as the U.S. military presence in south Korea and its colonial rule over it go on and the pro-U.S. conservative forces are allowed to go reckless. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement called upon the people from all walks of life in south Korea to turn out in the struggle for independent reunification and peace and prosperity under the banner of \"By our nation itself\" with the same fighting spirit as displayed by the April 3 uprisers on Jeju Island.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is impossible to achieve independence and dignity, the strong desires of the south Korean people, and national reunification vital to the nation, unless an end is put to the U.S. policy for domination and its hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whoever truly thinks of the destiny of the nation should turn out in do-or-die resistance against the U.S. to drive the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces out of south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only by doing so can south Koreans force the U.S. to pay for the bloodshed by the participants in the uprising and bring a new society and a reunified country as desired by them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson in a signed article says that the 70 million Koreans will unite close under the banner of \"By our nation itself\" and win back the usurped sovereignty of the nation and achieve national reunification and thus realize the aspiration of the participants in the uprising without fail.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Jefe de delegacion militar del Norte envia aviso a su homologo del Sur\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, 3 de abril (ATCC) -- El pasado 29 de marzo, el jefe de la delegacion de la parte Norte de Corea a las conversaciones militares a nivel de general Norte-Sur habia enviado a las autoridades militares surcoreanas un aviso exponiendo la posicion de principios del Ejercito Popular de Corea (EPC) en cuanto a la frase agresiva de \"ataque preventivo\" contra la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea (RPDC) pronunciada por el presidente de la Junta de los Jefes de Estado Mayor del ejercito surcoreano. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El envio de tal aviso se debio a que esa expresion agresiva dada a conocer por la propia parte Sur fue el mas grave y abierto desafio a la RPDC, sin precedente hasta ahora en la historia de las relaciones intercoreanas, y resulto practicamente la declaracion de guerra. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En particular, significo una locura muy peligrosa que no puede ser interpretada sino la muestra coherente de la politica de confrontacion con la RPDC del recien conformado \"poder\" surcoreano, la cual va en contra de la reunificacion, la paz y la nacion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El ejercito y el pueblo de la RPDC condenan categoricamente ese disparate del presidente de la Junta de los Jefes de Estado Mayor del ejercito surcoreano calificandolo de una muestra de inmadurez politica e ignorancia militar de el que ni siquiera sabe cual es el problema nuclear de la Peninsula Coreana y de un sucio gesto servil y sumiso para adular a su amo norteamericano apoyando a ciegas la injusta demanda de este sobre la \"renuncia nuclear del Norte, primero\" y siendo abanderado en ponerla en practica. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En los circulos politicos y sociales del Sur de Corea tambien se levanta una avalancha de criticas poniendo en entredicho el motivo de ese discurso agresivo que produce la indignacion de los connacionales y lleva a la fase de confrontacion las relaciones Norte-Sur. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Sin embargo, las autoridades militares surcoreanas sostuvieron debates varios dias con las cabecillas encargadas de asuntos de seguridad de la \"Casa Azul\", los \"ministerios de Reunificacion y de Relaciones Exteriores y Comercio\" y tomaron la variante de \"responder dignamente defendiendo consecuentemente el principio y partiendo de la posicion pragmatista\", lejos de sentirse responsables y disculparse sinceramente por sus crimenes y la situacion tan grave. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Como estaba previsto, segun esa variante, ellas enviaron el aviso de respuesta reflejando su mala posicion ayer a los 4 dias de la notificacion de la posicion de principios de la parte Norte. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En su respuesta, las autoridades militares surcoreanas plantearon una serie de pobres excusas arguyendo que en el aviso sobre la posicion de principios del EPC en cuanto al \"ataque preventivo\", la parte Norte esta cuestionando el caso porque \"interpreto a su manera\" esta frase agresiva y senalando que lo considera como \"medida impertinente y lamentable\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Para colmo, mostraron su injusta posicion de imputar a la parte Norte la responsabilidad por la situacion dada y hasta exigieron con la logica de bandido la suspension inmediata de la \"difamacion arbitraria y actos que produzcan la tension\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Al enviar el dia 3 otro aviso a su homologo surcoreano en cuanto a la mala reaccion de las autoridades militares del Sur, el jefe de la delegacion de la parte Norte a las conversaciones militares a nivel de general Norte-Sur rechazo tajantemente la posicion que expuso la parte Sur en su aviso de respuesta calificandola de una pobre excusa y anuncio que en virtud de la ya aclarada posicion de principios del EPC, se tomaran inmediatamente las correspondientes contramedidas militares.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nLas autoridades militares surcoreanas deben conocer una vez por toda la posicion de nuestras fuerzas armadas revolucionarias de responder a cualquier menor intento de \"ataque preventivo\" con el mismo al estilo coreano mas rapido, potente y avanzado. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ellas nunca podran evadir la responsabilidad por la suspension total de todos los dialogos y contactos Norte-Sur y la toma de la medida de prohibicion del paso. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El Ejercito Popular de Corea no habla por hablar.   \r\n\r\n\r\n"
