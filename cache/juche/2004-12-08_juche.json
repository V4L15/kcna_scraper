Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun Tuesday brands Japan as a dangerous force of aggression harassing peace and stability in Northeast Asia.\r\n The designation of the DPRK and countries around it as unstable and untransparent elements by the Japanese reactionaries discloses more glaringly the despicable true colors of those who are accustomed to pulling up others to attain their militarist purpose, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By misleading public opinion by the above-said allegation, the Japanese military authorities seek to justify their scheme to convert the country into a military giant and get into full stride in promoting it and thereby hold the hegemonic position in Northeast Asia. They also seek to pressurize and contain their neighboring countries and realize their ambition for military expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While equipping the SDF with modern, large-size and long-range weapons, the Japanese reactionaries are working round the clock to secure a legal foundation whereby to launch into an overseas aggression through the total mobilization of material and manpower potentials of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their maneuvers to include an article allowing Japan to take part in armed actions in the constitution to be revised prompt us to guess to what a stage they have gone in their moves for overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And they are putting fresh muscles into the \"Japan-U.S. security alliance\" under the pretext of coping with threat in Northeast Asia. What they seek in this is to realize with the U.S. backing their design for the \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\" which they failed to realize in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarists' reckless moves for military expansion under the pretext of \"coping with threat\" are escalating instability in Northeast Asia and increasing the danger of war there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries should bear in mind that their frantic acts for military expansion overseas is a suicidal act that will hasten their own destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
