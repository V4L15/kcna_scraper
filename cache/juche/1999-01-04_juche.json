Korean chief executive's \"New Year address\"  under fire\r\n   Pyongyang, January 4 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today comes out with a commentary criticising the South Korean chief executive for slandering North Korea in his \"New Year address\".\r\n   From early in the year, he clamoured about somebody's \"possible provocation\" and cried that they would \"utterly cope with\" it in \"cooperation\" with U.S. and Japanese masters, the news analyst says, stressing his remarks mirror the criminal attempt to intensify the confrontation moves against the north.\r\n  The commentary continues:\r\n   If the South Korean chief executive had an iota of national conscience and reason,  in the \"New Year address\" he should not have let loose a string of tirade about the \"year  of catastrophic crisis\"  but should  have expressed his willingness to step down,  bearing responsibility for having brought about such bankruptcy. And he should have expressed his  intention to respond to the unanimous demand of the nation for replacing the anti-north confrontation policy by a pro-north reconciliation one. \r\n   But, without a single word of it, he reeled off a string of hokum such as \"growth\" and the \"finishing of reform\" and provocative words against North Korea. This is an unpardonable mockery of the South Korean people and an undisguised challenge to the north.\r\n   The Korean people are keeping tabs on the crimes committed by the rulers of the \"government for the people\" against the country and the nation. \r\n \r\n"

Indeed, his rigmarole is the height of shamelessness.\r\n   What cannot be overlooked is the fact that although he said such nonsensical utterances, he is not in the least denounced or punished in Japan. This reality clearly proves that how widely the militaristic spirit is now spreading in Japan.\r\n   The Japanese authorities are overtly and covertly trying to instil the militaristic idea into the minds of the Japanese people.\r\n   Now, sounds of wail calling the militaristic ghost are daily ringing out aloud in Japan.\r\n   This represents Japan's ulterior ambition for reinvasion. \r\n\r\n"

This march was not merely a defensive one but a bold offensive to win a greater victory in the revolution. In those days they successfully made a breakthrough in the forced march.\r\n   It is now a decisive period  like the time when the Korean People's Revolutionary Army was advancing into the homeland after successfully concluding its arduous march in the grim period of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle.\r\n   It is the steadfast resolution and unshakable will of the WPK and the Korean people to  turn today's forced march into a cheerful advance without fail.\r\n   Our rockfirm determination is to build a world-level powerful nation in the near future by bringing about economic revival this year through a second grand march of Chollima in socialist construction.\r\n   This year, Korea is to shore up the coal, power and metal industries and railway transport and turn out better and more goods urgently necessary for the people's living. And a great change should be made in potato farming so as to decisively solve the food problem.\r\n   Mirrored in the slogan is the stamina of the invincible Korean People's Army and people to bravely fight against any formidable enemy and win a victory at any cost.\r\n   The Korean people have dynamically begun the New Year's march to brilliantly adorn this year as a great turning-point in building a powerful nation. \r\n\r\n   \r\n"
