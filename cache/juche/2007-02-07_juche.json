And they should thoroughly arm themselves with the great Juche idea, the Songun idea, and become reliable defenders and strict executors of the Songun policy and remain intensely loyal to the Songun leadership of the Party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With the shouts of hurrah over the victory of the Songun revolution ringing louder, it is all the more necessary to firmly maintain the revolutionary and class principles and heighten revolutionary vigilance whereby to resolutely foil the moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK on the part of the enemies including the U.S. imperialists and the Japanese reactionaries and their psychological campaign and capitalist ideological and cultural poisoning for disorganizing it from within and firmly defend the characteristics of Korean-style socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is not the slightest vacillation in the will of the WPK to bolster the national defence capacity, no matter how the situation may change, the appeal notes, calling on all the servicepersons and people to strengthen the arms of the revolution, not getting relaxed with the access to powerful nuclear deterrent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The main task in the present general march is to direct primary efforts to improving the standard of people's living and, at the same time, step up technological updating to put our economy on a modern footing and display its potentials to the maximum, it says, adding: All fields and units should always regard the Party's economic policy, principle of self-reliance and science and technology as the foundation for building an economic power and effect a great surge of the Songun revolution.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "National Reunification Institute Exposes Crimes of Traitors \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 6 (KCNA) -- The National Reunification Institute on Feb. 5 issued a memorandum to let the world public know about the crimes committed by the group of traitors down through history against democracy, the nation and reunification on the lapse of 11 years since the formation of the \"New Korea Party,\" the predecessor of the Grand National Party of south Korea.\r\n The memorandum cites facts to prove that the GNP is a group of traitors inheriting the \"blood\" of the most dastardly fascism and treachery and that it has committed crimes against the nation and reunification in the past decade. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history of the GNP originated from the \"Liberal Party\" under the Syngman Rhee regime which was succeeded by the \"Democratic Republican Party\" under the Park Chung Hee regime, the \"Democratic Justice Party\" at the time of the Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Thae Woo regimes and the \"Democratic Liberal Party\" and then the \"New Korea Party\" under the Kim Young Sam regime, the memorandum says, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for the \"Liberal Party,\" the ancestor of the GNP, it earned itself an ill fame by leaving south Korea to the U.S. as a colony, reducing it to a lawless land dominated by fascist dictatorship, dividing the country and bringing the holocaust of war to the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Soon after the liberation of Korea the U.S. illegally cooked up the Syngman Rhee puppet regime in south Korea, divided the land and the nation of Korea into two and raked up pro-U.S. stooges to knock into shape a traitor party called the \"Liberal Party.\" From the very day of its formation this party solicited the U.S. to destroy the fellow countrymen in the north to the last man and stubbornly opposed the signing of the Armistice Agreement, clinging to the coattails of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces. After the ceasefire it took an active part in its U.S. master's moves to provoke a new war, loudly clamoring for \"reunification by marching northward.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the atmosphere for democracy and reunification through alliance with the north grew rapidly in south Korea after the end of the Syngman Rhee dictatorship, the U.S. orchestrated the \"May 16 military coup\" to put the military dictatorial regime in power and organized the \"Democratic Republican Party\" through a whole gamut of intrigues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No sooner had it made its debut than this party signed the humiliating \"Status of Forces Agreement\" with the U.S. to grant the U.S. forces in south Korea extraterritorial privileges. As if it were not enough, it set up the so-called \"Combined Forces Command\" with the U.S., thus legalizing the U.S. forces' permanent occupation of south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Entering the 1970s, the traitors ruptured all the north-south dialogues that had been arranged with so much effort and committed such unpardonable treacherous crime as building a concrete wall along the entire length of the cursed Military Demarcation Line extending hundreds of kilometers, thereby bisecting the territory of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After declaring \"anti-communism\" as \"the state policy,\" the \"Democratic Republican Party\" staged the \"Yusin coup\" to stay in power permanently and brutally punished innocent people including democratic figures and pro-reunification patriotic personages opposed to it by invoking \"anti-communist law,\" \"state of emergency\" and \"emergency measures,\" thus converting the whole land of south Korea into a hell of murder, a prison without bars and an \"anti-communist\" tundra. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. wire-pulled \"the December 12 army purge coup\" and put down the Kwangju popular uprising in a bloodbath and, in this sea of blood, put into shape the Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Thae Woo military dictatorial regimes. It then dressed military hooligans in plain clothes and framed up the \"Democratic Justice Party.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A special mention should be made of the fact that the regime of the \"Democratic Justice Party\" reduced south Korea to the biggest nuclear arsenal in the Far East and staged anti-north nuclear war drills including the \"Team Spirit\" joint military exercises with increased frenzy, thus driving the situation on the Korean Peninsula to the critical verge of a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Finding it difficult to use the Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Thae Woo regimes of military dictatorship for the maintenance of the colonial rule any longer in face of the strong protest of the south Koreans and the whole Korean nation, the U.S. put up the \"civilian\" signboard and chose Kim Young Sam as its new stooge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the back-stage manipulation of the U.S. Kim Young Sam formed the \"Democratic Liberal Party\" in conspiracy with Kim Jong Phil, a remnant of \"Yusin,\" and put up what they called \"civilian government.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The thrice-cursed gangster-like acts of the civilian fascist clique resulted in totally breaking off the inter-Korean relations that had been maintained through turns and twists even in the days of the preceding military regimes, thus leaving years of gap in them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the south Koreans and all the Korean nation became increasingly critical of the regime's crimes against the nation the civilian fascist clique changed the name of the \"Democratic Liberal Party\" into the \"New Korea Party\" at the U.S. beck and call. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But, in less than two years after its emergence, south Korea was placed under harsher fascist dictatorship and, to cap it all, its economy went totally bankrupt under the influence of \"globalization\" which finally put it under the \"trusteeship.\" Much upset by this, they hastily knocked together the GNP, the most notorious traitor party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP totally negated the historic June 15 joint declaration that has ushered in the era of independent reunification in the new century and desperately stood against reconciliation, cooperation and reunification. This is the most serious crime among all the crimes it has committed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP stained with a thousand and one crimes and blood will face a stern punishment by the people's mindset.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
