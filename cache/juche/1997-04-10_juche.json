Korea over arms deal\r\n  Pyongyang, April 10 (KCNA) -- U.S. Defense secretary William Cohen threatened south Korea over its arms deal with Russia, according to a news report.\r\n   He warned that if south Korea purchased \"S-300\" anti-aircraft missile system from Russia, the \"military ties\" between south Korea and the United States would be endangered.\r\n   He said Russia, which badly needs money, has apparently wanted south Korea to buy its ground-to-air missiles at a very low price.\r\n   If south Korea got Russian-made weapons, it would invite antipathy from the U.S. Congress, he said. From the political point of view, it would be much more favorable for south Korea to purchase U.S.-made missiles.\r\n   It was the first time the U.S. Defense secretary made a warning and hinted antipathy from the U.S. Congress over south Korea's arms deal with Russia.\r\n   According to Itar-Tass, a member of the Russian State Duma said on April 7, \"Cohen's warning proved political pressure on Seoul\", and that the United States is resorting to such political pressure in the hope of restricting Russia's arms sale to Asia-Pacific nations.\r\n   A U.S. Defense assistant secretary already voiced strong objection to the south Korean puppets' arms deal with Russia and a recent editions of the U.S. magazine Defense News reported that the U.S. expressed profound displeasure with the scheme of south Korea and Japan to purchase Russian-made weapons including jet fighters.\r\n   The south Korean puppets, hell-bent on war preparations, are now in hot water, falling a victim to powers' post-Cold War competitions for arms sale. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

He said the Juche idea founded by President Kim Il Sung is the unshakable guiding idea of the Korean revolution and a great revolutionary banner of the era.\r\n   As Secretary Kim Jong Il said, the revolutionary world outlook of the working class had been established by Marxism for the first time, and it was developed by the Juche idea onto a new, higher plane for its perfection, the reporter said, and continued:\r\n   Unlike the preceding philosophy of the working class, the Juche philosophy was the first to raise the co-relationship between the world and man and the position and role of man in the world as the basic question of philosophy.\r\n   It clarified that man is the master of everything and decides everything and, based on this, has given an elucidation and systematisation of philosophical questions.\r\n   The Juche idea is a revolutionary and political philosophy which serves the revolutionary practice of the popular masses for independence. It was founded, developed and enriched in the practice of the Korean revolution.\r\n   With the foundation of the revolutionary philosophy of Juche the schemings of the contemporary revisionists and bourgeois venal philosophers to spread reactionary philosophies of all hues, including a super-class philosophy, a religious philosophy and a bourgeois  \r\nHuman philosophy, have been shattered to pieces. As a result, the Party, class and revolutionary spirits of the philosophy of the working class have been firmly defended and its purity guaranteed to the letter.\r\n   The Juche idea is a philosophy based on the revolutionary viewpoint and attitude toward the people. It is the political philosophy which indicates the principles and methodology in the the struggle for shaping the destinies of the popular masses.\r\n   The idea is a shining fruition of the rare ideological and theoretical wisdom and tireless ideological and theoretical activities of President Kim Il Sung, an outstanding thinker and theoretician and a genius of the revolution and construction= it is the ideological and theoretical summing-up of the enduring revolutionary feats, experiences and noble virtues of the great leader, who led the revolutionary struggle of the popular masses for independence to victory.\r\n   The vitality of the idea is more keenly felt under the guidance of Secretary Kim Jong Il with literary and military accomplishments and loyalty and filial piety.\r\n   By successfully applying the idea in the Korean revolution President Kim Il Sung, who founded the Workers' Party of Korea, a new revolutionary Party of Juche type, and Secretary Kim Jong Il strengthened and developed the party and built the man-centred socialism of Korean style as a fortress of socialism and a beacon of hope of humankind.\r\n  It is thanks to the rare and tested guidance of the two great leaders that the reunification movement has made a great progress and an epochal phase for reunification has been opened in the heat of the nationwide movement.\r\n   President Kim Il Sung with the noble sense of internationalist obligation gave a strong impetus to the development of the revolutionary movement in our era for building a new independent world on the basis of the Juche idea, the reporter added.\r\n   Many theoreticians and propagandists took the floor at the seminar. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Foreign Ministry spokesman on \"forged currency case\" \r\n   Pyongyang, April 10 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry in an interview with KCNA today refuted the false reports that link the DPRK with forgery of foreign currency. He told KCNA:\r\n   It is reported these days that some DPRK citizens had a certain amount of forged currency of a third country confiscated in an alien land.\r\n   What is obvious at present is that the DPRK has nothing to do with the above-said case.\r\n   In this connection, a competent organ of the DPRK is working to verify the truth and adopt relevant measures.\r\n   As is known to all, the DPRK respects the international law and order on currency circulation and enforces a law that never allows any violation.\r\n   Under the socialist system of Korea, there are no conditions for such illegal practices as currency forgery.\r\n   We consider, therefore, that any attempt to connect such a disgraceful case as \"currency forgery\" with our government is a product of the sinister intention to impair the international image of the DPRK. \r\n\r\n"
