All this is nothing but an artifice to get rid of their predicament. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson today observes this in a signed commentary.

And the GNP even went the lengths of blustering that it would not rule out a war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP has persistently cried out for confrontation and war though it is no more than an opposition party. It is, therefore, not hard to guess how the GNP will rampage should it come to power.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

U.S. cultural services and information centers operating in at least 100 countries are functioning as bases for ceaseless reactionary ideological and cultural offensives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has massively produced literary and art pieces beautifying the reality of capitalism. It is busy infiltrating lots of undesirable video cassettes and CDs and other e-media dealing with salacious and abnormal matters into socialist and developing countries in a bid to induce viewers to seek depraved and animal life. All this is designed to benumb people's spirit of national independence and revolutionary and working-class awareness and obliterate the Juche character and national character. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The younger generation, in particular, are apt to fall victim to the imperialists' ideological and cultural offensive as they have not undergone revolutionary training and are sensitive to things. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The spearhead of this offensive is directed to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has persistently conducted offensives for bourgeois ideological and cultural poisoning and psychological warfare through \"Radio of Free Asia\" to break the single-minded unity of the DPRK more powerful than any nuclear bomb and bring about an ideological and mental destabilization and degeneration in its society. It has become more frantic than ever before in its moves to massively infiltrate into the DPRK undesirable video cassettes, CDs and other e-media dealing with corrupt and alien matters and printed matters propagandizing superstition and others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The progressive people should intensify their actions against the imperialists' ideological and cultural poisoning in order to defend their Juche character and national character and sovereignty of their countries and thus speed up the victorious advance of the human cause of independence.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "National Meeting Commemorates 90th Anniversary of KNA\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 22 (KCNA) -- A national meeting took place at the April 25 House of Culture on Thursday to mark the 90th anniversary of the Korean National Association (KNA) organized by Kim Hyong Jik, an indomitable revolutionary fighter who was an outstanding leader of the anti-Japanese national liberation movement in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present at the meeting were leading officials of the Party, the army and the state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Hyong Jik called a historic meeting to inaugurate the KNA in Hakdanggol, Pyongyang on Mar. 23, Juche 6 (1917), while exploring the untrodden path of history in the idea of \"Aim High\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Yang Hyong Sop, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea who is vice-president of the Presidium of the DPRK Supreme People's Assembly, made a report at the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The purpose of struggle and tasks of the KNA served as a great militant programme and a guiding principle for the anti-Japanese national liberation movement in Korea as they clearly reflected the anti-imperialist independent stand that the struggle for the independence of the country and liberation of the Korean nation could emerge victorious only when it depended on the strength of the Korean people, not on the outside forces, the reporter said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KNA was a secret organization fundamentally different from the anti-Japanese organizations that existed up to the period before it emerged, transparent in its anti-imperialist independent stand and in terms of its size. It was the biggest anti-Japanese underground revolutionary organization that covered the whole of Korea and areas outside it before and after the March 1 Popular Uprising and led the anti-Japanese national liberation movement in Korea as a whole. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the energetic guidance of Kim Hyong Jik the KNA rallied broad strata of anti-Japanese patriotic forces at home and abroad and ensured a coordinated leadership over them under the uplifted banner of national independence despite the Japanese imperialists' colonial oppression. It was a precious exploit which recorded a new chapter of history in putting the anti-Japanese national liberation movement in Korea on the orbit of independent development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was one of the distinguished historic exploits performed by the KNA that it successfully played a vanguard role in putting into practice Kim Hyong Jik's plan to make a switchover in the anti-Japanese national liberation movement in Korea to the proletarian revolution from the nationalist movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to the positive activities of the KNA to implement the policy of proletarian revolution set forth by Kim Hyong Jik, the anti-Japanese national liberation movement in Korea came to make dynamic advance towards the proletarian revolution aimed at realizing the ideal of the working people by conducting armed activities in reliance upon the strength of the popular masses, guided by a progressive idea. This was a precious exploit of weighty significance in developing the anti-Japanese national liberation movement in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea of the KNA was translated into a brilliant reality by President Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the brilliant fruition of the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il, who has successfully carried forward the revolutionary cause generation after generation that the army and people of the DPRK have won one victory after another in the acute stand-off with the U.S. and the battle for defending socialism under the uplifted banner of Songun, the reporter said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He called for enshrining Kim Hyong Jik's noble idea of \"Aim High\" and the KNA's idea of independence against imperialism, the idea of national unity, as a precious ideological heritage of the Korean revolution, building a great prosperous powerful socialist nation on this land as early as possible full of revolutionary faith and optimism and thereby bringing earlier the day of accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
