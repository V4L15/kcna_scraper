Those who directly ordered and commanded them were U.S. army officers from company commanders to divisional commanders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is evidenced by the fact that the U.S. authorities have ignored them and covered up the truth about them, though they are well informed of them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   These facts go to prove that the U.S. authorities are entirely responsible for the hideous crimes against humanity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. should be sternly judged by history without fail for its biggest-ever crimes against humanity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. should stop playing a trick to flout human conscience, honestly admit its crimes and own state responsibility for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It should apologize for the crimes against humanity committed in Korea, compensate for them and face deserved punishment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Prescription is not applicable to the crimes against humanity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   No matter how hard the U.S. may try it can never escape from its responsibility for the most brutal crimes in history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   History will certainly mete out a stern judgement to the U.S. for its biggest-ever crimes against humanity. \r\n\r\n"
