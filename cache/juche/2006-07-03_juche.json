Most of south Koreans regard the U.S. as the biggest obstacle standing in the way of reunification and assert that the U.S., not the north, should be designated as the principal enemy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-U.S. struggle is now becoming a common slogan transcending class and strata, affiliation and position, progress and conservatism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-U.S. struggle of south Koreans has recently intensified and developed in broad and diverse forms in combination with the movement for reunification.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The movement for national reunification in Korea is inseparably linked with the anti-U.S. struggle. It is impossible to achieve national reunification without the anti-U.S. struggle. It is none other than the U.S, who has divided Korea into two and kept its troops stationed in south Korea, standing in the way of Korea's reunification for more than 60 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people are intensifying their struggle, converting different forms of the movement for national reunification into the anti-U.S. struggle this year, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What draws attention in their anti-U.S. struggle is that international support and solidarity with it are increasing day by day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-U.S. struggle is the requirement of the times and the unanimous desire of all the fellow countrymen. Voices demanding the withdrawal of the U.S. troops from south Korea are growing in the U.S., too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should stop its anachronistic policy of domination over south Korea, its moves to make it a military base and take a bold decision to withdraw its aggression troops from south Korea.       \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It has achieved great successes in the socialist modernization drive with Chinese characteristics and in the efforts to accomplish the cause of reunifying the whole country and remarkably increased the international position and role of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The credit for the amazing changes now taking place in China goes to the CPC which laid down a correct line and policies suited to its actual conditions and in line with the requirements of the Chinese people and powerfully aroused all of them to carry them out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The 85 year-long proud history of the CPC goes to prove that there is neither the present of new China nor its rosier future without the CPC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our party and people are rejoiced over all the successes made by the CPC and the fraternal Chinese people as over their own and extend sincere congratulations to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n I wholeheartedly hope that the collective leadership of the CPC with you as general secretary will achieve fresh and greater success in the efforts to build a comprehensively well-off and harmoniously developed socialist society and accomplish the cause of complete reunification of the country by preserving the progressive nature of the party, increasing its governing ability and leading the party and people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK-China friendship, which was provided by the revolutionary forerunners of the two countries in the course of the joint struggle and bequeathed to their peoples as a precious legacy, has made an important contribution to giving a powerful impetus to socialist construction in the two countries and ensuring peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the invariable stand of our Party to steadily develop the DPRK-China friendship which is deeply rooted in the hearts of the two peoples and which stood all tests of history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is my belief that this traditional friendship will grow stronger in all fields in the future, too, thanks to the joint efforts of the two parties and the two peoples.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 1 (KCNA) -- The U.S. has deployed latest \"U-2 S Block 20\" in south Korea, timed to coincide with its evermore undisguised military threat and blackmail against the DPRK. This is another grave military provocation against the DPRK and an extremely dangerous move for a war of aggression against it to push the situation on the Korean Peninsula to the brink of war.\r\n A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland said this in a statement on June 30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality clearly indicates that the U.S. remains unchanged in its criminal attempt to stifle the DPRK by force of arms, the statement noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is recklessly driving the situation on the peninsula to the brink of war, preoccupied with the moves for a war against the DPRK. This grave situation once again goes to prove that peace has been preserved on the peninsula so far entirely thanks to the DPRK's strong war deterrent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the U.S. is set to ignite a nuclear war for the purpose of disturbing peace and stability on the peninsula by force, the DPRK is compelled to bolster up its deterrent for self-defence under the uplifted banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK are fully prepared to counter any provocation and challenge of the U.S.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
