            "content": "S. Korea Urged to Clarify Its Ulterior Design before Whole Nation\r\n Pyongyang, February 6 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Policy Department of the National Defence Commission (NDC) of the DPRK issued a statement on Thursday in view of the very disturbing grave situation in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities have become frantic with the racket of confrontation with compatriots in the north these days contrary to the sincere efforts made by the DPRK to improve the north-south relations and achieve the reconciliation and unity of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its typical example is that they dared hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK as regards the field guidance given by it to a baby home and orphanage and the schedule of the election of the deputies to the Supreme People's Assembly, etc. while unhesitatingly perpetrating reckless acts of groundlessly hurting the social system in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the moment when the north and the south were reaching an agreement on the reunion of separated families and their relatives at Panmunjom, the south Korean authorities let formations of U.S. B-52 nuclear-capable bombers based on Guam fly into the sky above Jik islet in the West Sea of Korea for a whole day for staging drills for a nuclear strike at the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean warmongers are busy making final arrangements to go ahead with Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint war exercises as scheduled, claiming that they are irrelevant to humanitarianism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Shortly ago they, defying the repeated warnings of the DPRK,  openly staged such naval strike drill targeting it under the signboard of \"regular drills\" on Paekryong and Yonphyong islands, the hotspots in the West Sea, though it is taking a goodwill measure to halt military hostile acts first.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Policy Department of the NDC of the DPRK clarifies the following principled stand reflecting the unanimous will of its service personnel and people:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t First, the DPRK will be compelled to consider the implementation of the agreement reached as long as the dignity of its supreme leadership is malignantly hurt and the acts of groundlessly slandering and defaming its social system persist. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nothing is more foolish than the calculation that reconciliation and cooperation can be achieved while the reckless remarks hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK are floated and connived at under the pretext of \"liberal democracy\" and media's smear campaign against it is going on under the pretence of \"freedom of speech\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should bear in mind that the consequences of the smear campaign against the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and its social system will be unpredictably disastrous whether it is spearheaded by the authorities or staged by media.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Second, we will not remain a passive on-looker to their farce staged allegedly to build confidence when formations of U.S. nuclear strategic bombers are flying into the sky, threatening and blackmailing against fellowmen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than the U.S. which has instigated the south Korean authorities, claiming they should react to the DPRK's principled and crucial proposal and open letter ardently appealing to the Koreans by raising the nuclear issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is again the U.S. which is throwing all sorts of obstacles to the DPRK's patriotic and positive efforts to create an atmosphere for improving the inter-Korean relations and chilling them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Third, we would like to take this opportunity to clarify once again that war exercises and racket for confrontation are incompatible with dialogue and reconciliation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should get rid of the existing state of affairs and stance, abandon their narrow-minded prejudice and inveterate motive of confrontation and make a bold policy decision to meet the expectation of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should no longer pursue such distrust and confrontation as rejecting the warm sincerity of their compatriots with evil will and reacting to compatriots' call for reconciliation with hostile war drills and nuclear threat.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should neither misjudge nor abuse with a wrong way of thinking the goodwill, tolerance, patience and self-restraint shown by the service personnel and people of the DPRK to pave the way for improving the north-south relations in the spirit of By Our Nation Itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All Koreans in the north, south and abroad will closely follow the stand the south Korean authorities are obliged to clarify and their future attitude."

It has put strong spurs to the development of the socialist rural economy system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A turn being effected in the overall agricultural field including production of grain, livestock farming and fruit farming is a precious fruition of the outstanding leadership of Kim Jong Un who has made indefatigable efforts for the development of the nation's agriculture, the reporter said, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSocialist agriculture in the country has made shining achievements, covering the proud path of victory under the outstanding and seasoned leadership of the peerlessly great men of Mt.

Such crimes committed by Japan can never be written off.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Korean people will certainly make Japan pay a dear price for the bloodshed by their grandfathers and grandmothers."

Korean Paper Denounces Japan for Denying Past History\r\n Pyongyang, February 6 (KCNA) -- The south Korean newspaper Hangyore on February 2 carried an editorial denouncing Japan's ceaseless provocations over the issue of history. \n\t\t\t\t\t The editorial said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is getting evermore pronounced in making provocations over the issue of history. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some time ago, Japanese Prime Minister Abe was asked questions concerning the understanding of history four times at a Diet session, but he evaded expressions like \"colonial domination\" and \"aggression\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He voiced the stand to disregard the advice of the international community including the UN Anti-Torture Committee which urged Japan to make apology and reparation to the victims of the sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army. He even said he would refer the issue of \"dominium over Tok islets\" to the International Court of Justice. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present Japanese government is more undisguised in denying the history than the other governments in the past. Such provocation is more dangerous as it is related with the moves to turn Japan into a military giant including the attempt to change the interpretation of the constitution for the exercise of the right to \"collective self-defense.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His reckless remarks are sparking off anger of the international community. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan should come to its senses, though belatedly. If Japan disregards this, it will face international isolation."
