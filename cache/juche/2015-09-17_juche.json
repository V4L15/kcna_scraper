They claimed Obama and Park Geun Hye in their talks slated for October would deal with the issues of denuclearization of the north and human rights with weighty importance. They are making desperate efforts to hold a \"seminar on human rights in north Korea\" on an unprecedented scale  in the U.S. in a bid to build up public opinion critical of the DPRK and drive a wedge between the north and the south. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are egging the south Korean authorities onto resuming the psychological anti-north broadcasting, asserting that it is the \"best solution\" to changing the north's attitude. They are spreading the \"story of north's provocation in October\" and mulling hurling the special warfare forces under the 10th Mountaineering Division of the U.S. Army from the U.S. mainland into south Korea in an effort to escalate the military tension on the Korean Peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This clearly proves the hypocritical nature of the U.S. and that it is a cancer-like entity disturbing peace and reunification of the Korean Peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nothing is possible for improving the north-south relations if the U.S. is allowed to continue interfering and disturbing the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Here is the reason why the DPRK is consistently upholding the slogan \"By Our Nation Itself\" for improving the inter-Korean relations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will never allow the moves of the U.S. and its followers to scuttle the hard-won phase of detente and disturb the improvement of the north-south relations."

Korean Authorities to Take Proper Attitude\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, September 17 (KCNA) -- Serious moves conflicting with the recent atmosphere of improving the inter-Korean relations are being seen in south Korea one after another. \n\t\t\t\t\t On Sept. 15, the U.S. and the south Korean military warmongers kicked off a frantic action of reenacting the Inchon landing operation dating back to the past June 25 war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After staging the farce of \"commemorating\" the landing operation in the Command of Defending Waters off Inchon of the south Korean Navy from Sept. 12, they reenacted the operation in the waters off Wolmi Islet that day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Warships, planes, landing armored cars with various missions of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces and the south Korean army and their huge offensive armed forces including special warfare forces and commandos were involved in the naval charge amid fire support from the sea and the air.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the past war, the U.S. forces held the Inchon landing operation aimed to occupy the whole of the DPRK. The reenacting at a time when the fundamental turn of improving the inter-Korean relations was provided is no more than an act to disturb the situation that has entered the phase of stability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The north-south high-level urgent contact was held and issues to defuse the military tension and develop the north-south relations were agreed.

How can this be understood?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A few days after the joint press release, the south Korean military warmongers kicked off indiscriminate firing operation aimed at the DPRK with various kinds of artillery pieces, planes, tanks and other offensive weapons in Phochon, Kyonggi Province in collusion with the U.S. forces. And they waged bio-chemical warfare drill some days ago while talking about someone's \"biological threat\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities are even slandering the DPRK's strategic line while getting vociferous about the \"north's nuclear threat\" at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities reached an important agreement, promising the improved inter-Korean relations, but, behind the scene they held war drills against the dialogue partner in collusion with outside forces, persisting in confrontation. This is a dangerous provocation hurting the hard-won atmosphere of stability. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If they are sincerely interested in the improved inter-Korean relations, they should stop the hostile military acts against compatriots. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should value the hard-won atmosphere of reconciliation and stability and take a sincere stand on the improvement of the inter-Korean relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All Koreans are following the south Korean authorities' attitude."

Y parlotean que \"se abordara con una importancia el problema de abolicion de armas nucleares y la mejora de derechos humanos del Norte (de Corea) en las conversaciones entre Obama y Park Geun-hye a sostenerse en octubre proximo\". Por otra parte, organizaron en su propio territorio el llamado \"seminario de DDHH del Norte\" de gran dimension sin precedente para crear las opiniones negativas  sobre la RPDC y meter cuna entre ambas partes coreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, diciendo que la radioemision psicologica es el \"mejor metodo\" para cambiar la actitud del Norte incitan a las autoridades surcoreanas a la reanudacion de dicha radiodifusion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por otra parte, difunden el rumor de \"provocacion del Norte en octubre\" y pretenden agravar la tension militar de la Peninsula Coreana introduciendo en el Sur de Corea hasta las fuerzas armadas de la guerra especial pertenecientes a la 10a division de montana de las fuerzas terrestres norteamericanas estacionadas en su propio territorio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esto vuelve a demostrar la naturaleza enganosa e hipocrita de EE.UU. y el hecho de que este imperio deviene el cancer de la paz y la reunificacion de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Mientras existan la intervencion y las maniobras obstructoras de EE.UU., no sera resuelto ningun problema en las relaciones Norte-Sur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  He aqui la razon por la que la RPDC insiste invariablemente en el ideal \"Entre nosotros, los connacionales\" en los lazos intercoreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC no tolerara jamas las maniobras de EE.UU. y sus fuerzas seguidoras para destruir la situacion de la distension preparada a duras penas y poner obstaculos a la mejora de las relaciones de ambas partes coreanas."
