At the same time, it is going to transfer 15 percent of the U.S. Marines to the Asia-Pacific region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 4 strategic weapons including nuclear carrier, B-2s, F-22s and nuclear submarines are on their way to their destinations in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Notably, Washington has mapped out a plan for deploying the most elite forces in the vicinity of the Korean Peninsula and is attempting a military action against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S military deployment in the region is the largest-ever, far surpassing the one in Europe and the Mideast.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. arms buildup in the region is part of its strategic coordination to carry out its Asia-Pacific strategy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., enforcing the pivot-to-Asia-Pacific policy as its general policy for overseas aggression, deems it a key to world domination to put the region under its control. The Korean Peninsula is regarded as the primary target.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lurking behind its uninterrupted noisy advertisement of the non-existent \"threat\" from the DPRK is also its ulterior purpose to cover up the true aim of its arms buildup and slacken the vigilance among regional powers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That is why the U.S. has resorted to arms build-up, periodically staging provocative military actions in a sinister bid to keep the situation on the Korean Peninsula strained.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. schemes to seize military edge, make preemptive attacks at countries in the region in contingency and thus dominate the world, a dangerous scenario to wreck regional peace and stability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The international community should keep strict vigilance over the risky arms buildup of the U.S. which would lead to an arms race in the region."
