He participated in the anti-Japanese armed struggle, upholding the Juche-oriented revolutionary line put forward by President Kim Il Sung, making a positive contribution to the historic victory of the great anti-Japanese war. Right after the liberation of the country and in the periods of the Fatherland Liberation War and the socialist construction he was active at important posts of national and local institutions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He performed great feats in strengthening the Workers' Party of Korea and the DPRK government, promoting the reunification of the country and exalting the international prestige of the country, holding such responsible posts of the party and the state as member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the WPK Central Committee and vice-president of the DPRK. He died of prolonged illness at the age of 76 on April 27, 1988 to our sorrow. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present at the memorial service were Kim Yong Nam and other senior party, army and state officials, officials of party, armed forces and power organs, public organizations, ministries and national institutions, servicepersons of the Korean People's Army, families of revolutionary martyrs and working people in the city. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Yang Hyong Sop, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee and vice-president of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly, made a memorial address. He noted that the whole life of Rim was a brilliant life of the staunch revolutionary who devotedly struggled for the party, the leader, the country and people and his noble revolutionary traits serve all the people as a good example showing how they should uphold President Kim Il Sung and General Secretary Kim Jong Il and how faithful they should remain to the party and the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rim was a faithful revolutionary soldier of the WPK as he held in high esteem Kim Jong Il, who has successfully carried forward the revolutionary cause of Juche started in Mt. Paektu, with his pure conscience and sense of obligation and a historian and revolutionary writer as he performed distinguished feats with pen for the revolution in the work for systematizing the history of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle in an integral whole and providing a source book for the education in the revolutionary traditions of the WPK, Yang Hyong Sop said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Upon hearing the sad news of his death, Kim Il Sung said that a veteran revolutionary passed away to his regret, but he did not think Rim Chun Chu ended his life as he performed distinguished feats to be recorded in the long history of the Korean revolution with his ardent loyalty and the noble sense of obligation. He thus made sure that Rim was always remembered by the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Kim Jong Il put forward Rim as the top predecessor of the revolution who made a historic contribution to the work for preserving the revolutionary traditions of Juche. When Rim passed away, Kim Jong Il said with emotion that the people would always remember Rim who was a career revolutionary that remained loyal to the President from the dawn of the Korean revolution to the last moments of his life and a precious treasure of the WPK and the revolutionary who impressed all of them so much. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il recently made sure that the full-length novel \"Youth Vanguard\" written by Rim was reprinted and redistributed to further glorify the immortality of the veteran revolutionary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Yang Hyong Sop called upon all the party members, servicepersons and people to follow the good example of loyalty shown by the anti-Japanese revolutionary forerunners to the President and become genuine revolutionary soldiers who hold Kim Jong Il in high esteem and devotedly defend him and human beings with pure conscience who will invariably make a long journey of the Songun revolution with revolutionary comradeship and sense of obligation despite rain or snow.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's Moves to Infuse Militarism into Young Japanese under Fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, April 27 (KCNA) -- Of late the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology issued the revised guidelines for schools. They called for regarding it as one of the important contents of education to encourage the pupils of the primary schools to sing \"Kimigayo\" and teaching the middle school students the validity of the overseas activities of the \"Self-Defence Forces\" including school activities to help them understand \"security and defence of Japan\" and its \"international contribution\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Sunday observes in a signed article carried in this regard: This is a very dangerous move to force all the generations to come in Japan to widely sing \"Kimigayo\" dating back to the \"imperial\" era in a bid to equip them with the militaristic idea and hurl them into overseas aggression when an appropriate time comes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Kimigayo\" was a symbol of Japanese militarism whose intrinsic nature is aggression, plunder and man-killing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After war Japan frantically stepped up its moves for rearmament under the backing and patronage of the U.S. imperialists and, at the same time, worked hard to infuse the militaristic idea into young Japanese, in particular. As a result, dangerous militarism began to raise its head and go beyond its tolerance limit gradually. By instituting \"Kimigayo\" as the national anthem it sought to restore its image used to be in the past and boost its prestige and showed the world that it is the \"empire\" capable of launching a war again any time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Due to the persistent moves of the Japanese reactionaries, \"Hinomaru\" was instituted as the national flag and \"Kimigayo\" as the national anthem in Japan in 1999. This meant that Japan has revived the era of \"Empire\". Herein lies the dangerous and reactionary nature of the Japanese reactionaries' moves to implant \"Kimigayo\" into the minds of the rising generation. Should they make desperate efforts to infuse the militarist idea of aggression into the younger generation and bring back the past, they will get nothing but disgrace and self-destruction. The Japanese imperialists suffered a defeat while perpetrating aggression and war in the past. The \"Kimigayo\" sung by them turned out to be a funeral march. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world has changed and \"Kimigayo\" will not be heard again anywhere in Asia.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They have gone the lengths of pulling up the north in a bid to shift the responsibility for the deteriorated inter-Korean relations onto it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on this, Minju Joson Sunday observes; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The group of traitor Lee Myung Bak is echoing foreign forces' anti-DPRK ruckus, impudently crying out for somebody's \"dismantlement of nukes\" and \"opening.\" This disgusting behavior is nothing but a shameful deed which could be done only by those who do not have even an iota of sense of the times and awareness of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The news analyst goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue was spawned on the Korean Peninsula and the Koreans have been exposed to the danger of a nuclear war for the last more than half a century entirely because the U.S. has massively stockpiled nuclear weapons in south Korea, pursuant to its hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the Lee group remains utterly indifferent to the issue of making the U.S. withdraw its huge nuclear weapons from south Korea. On the contrary, it is pulling up the fellow countrymen who have protected the security of the nation from the danger of aggression by foreign forces, blatantly challenging the trend of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nation should never pardon such traitors who fail to fulfill the elementary sense of obligation as human beings but seek to do harm to the fellow countrymen in collusion with outsiders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The traitors serving foreign forces, their backs turned against the nation, are fated to meet disgrace and self-destruction only.

On this basis state laws and regulations specifically provide for the legal protection of intellectual property. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The well-regulated system for the protection of intellectual property in the DPRK serves the purpose of strictly protecting by law the intellectual gains made by all working people and helps them make a positive contribution to the building of a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The DPRK government will as ever increase its efforts to protect the intellectual property, keeping in touch with the WIPO, concludes the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Even heavyweights of the political camp accused the authorities of deliberately deteriorating the north-south relations to spark a \"security crisis\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Much upset by this, the traitor proposed the above-said issue as the last resort. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter how noisily the Lee group may tout it, it is nothing but a poor trick to escape mounting criticism at home and abroad, evade the responsibility for the strained north-south relations and mislead the public attention. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lee Myung Bak would be well advised to stop employing sleight of hand which can work on nobody and take a proper approach towards the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration to begin with.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
