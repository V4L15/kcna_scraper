He referred to the brilliant revolutionary life and undying exploits performed by Kim Jong Suk who devoted her all to the country's liberation and the victory of the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The manager of the company and others at the film shows said that the DPRK would emerge ever-victorious as a great prosperous powerful nation because its people hold Kim Jong Il in high esteem as chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, a seminar and a film show were held by the Bangladesh Institute of the Juche Idea, a meeting was held by the Central Committee of the Poland-Korea Association and a film show by the Paektusan Czech-Korea Friendship Association from Nov. 23 to 26.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

This is, however, a product of its strategy to realize a regime change in it to serve its purpose of tarnishing the image of the dignified DPRK and undermining most advantageous man-centered Korean-style socialism.\r\n If some forces of the EU are truly concerned for the settlement of human rights issues, they should take issue with the U.S., the world's worst human rights abuser, to begin with. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recently disclosed facts about the U.S. operation of secret prisons in European countries are a good example of its human rights abuses.\r\n The U.S. operation of these prisons and CIA planes' use of airports of those countries for transporting POWs are the most hideous human rights abuses which can never be justified and, at the same time, wanton violations of the sovereignty of EU member nations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One can draw a definite conclusion that the EU itself is falling victim to the U.S. high-handed and arbitrary practices and its violation of human rights and national sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some EU forces are saying this or that about the human rights performance in other countries incurring their displeasure while shelving the U.S. hideous human rights abuses.

This is a monstrous criminal act which can be perpetrated only by the barbarians bereft of elementary ethics and morality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unconverted long-term prisoners in south Korea are miserable sufferers who had been subject to brutal torture, evil deeds and all sorts of inhuman treatment beyond human imagination for decades for the mere reason that they refused to abandon their ideology and faith.\r\n Nevertheless, they committed the above-said crimes, as if it were not enough with the atrocities perpetrated against those prisoners when they were alive. This is an unpardonable violation of human rights as it is nothing but double murder of them. These facts go to prove once again that they are like a group of most ferocious brutes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those forces do not give the patriotic martyrs for reunification any space to lie in state even after their death, while opposing the removal of the statue of Macarthur, chieftain of aggression and murder who inflicted the war disaster upon the Korean nation, and even restoring it. This treachery is unpardonable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people from all walks of life should severely punish the pro-U.S. conservative forces including the GNP for adding to their crimes committed against the Korean nation by perpetrating treacherous and anti-reunification acts and crimes against humanity.     \r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"

It spent millions of dollars for the rally held in the wake of the 1st rally in July. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-DPRK \"human rights racket\" kicked up by the U.S. is part of its plot to divert elsewhere the accusing finger pointed by the international community at it and thus get rid of a crisis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has been driven into a tight corner due to the killings of peaceable civilians in Iraq and torture of prisoners in its Guantanamo base and other places of the world besides its human rights issue in the U.S. where the elementary human rights have been abused. Moreover, the U.S. is practically sitting in the dock as the international community is becoming increasingly critical of the existence of CIA-operated secret prisons in East European countries and other countries of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The U.S., the world's worst human rights abuser, is now vociferously calling for the \"improvement of human rights performance and democracy\" only to become the world's laughing stock. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The U.S. seems to feel an urgent need to stage a smear campaign aimed at tarnishing the international image of the DPRK, prompted by its inveterate rejection of the DPRK's independent foreign policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the U.S. offensive to pressurize the DPRK to abandon its nuclear program first proved futile, it is now citing the human rights issue for realizing its wild design to \"destroy the system\" in the DPRK at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts go to prove that the U.S. is wantonly violating the spirit of the September 19 joint statement adopted by the six parties and persistently pursuing its hostile policy toward the DPRK, utterly indifferent to the settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean ultra-right forces including the Grand National Party are zealously joining the U.S. in its \"human rights\" offensive.\r\n This offensive is nothing but the last resort of those doomed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Only those imbeciles who know nothing about the nature of the DPRK's social and political system and its people are obsessed by their daydream to \"bring down its system\". Such stupid guys who bark at the moon cannot know about the DPRK till their death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and its lackeys would be well advised to stop the anti-DPRK \"human rights\" offensive at once.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
