The U.S. should bear in mind that the DPRK led by the respected President Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il is an ever-victorious country. \r\n\r\n"

They denounced the police for cracking down upon the just anti-u.s. struggle while making no protest to the U.S. troops who have imposed intolerable misfortune upon South Koreans. \r\n\r\n"
