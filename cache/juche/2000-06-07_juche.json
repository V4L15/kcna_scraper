The U.S. should bear in mind that the DPRK led by the respected President Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il is an ever-victorious country. \r\n\r\n"

And Macarthur gave an order to Robert, head of the U.S. military advisory group in South Korea, brass-hats of the \"ROK Army\" and the military officers concerned of Japan to map out an operation plan with its main stress put on breaking through the 38th parallel. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. equipped the \"ROK Army\" with modern military hardware and instructed the U.S. military advisory group to  intensify its training, while massively beefing up armed forces necessary for undertaking a war in South Korea. It amassed troops, war material and equipment in areas along the 38th parallel according to its war scenario to invade the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Meanwhile, the U.S. instigated the \"ROK Army\" to commit armed provocations as a \"test war\" aimed to examine its \"combat readiness\" and increase its war capacity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   2,617 cases of armed provocations were perpetrated by the \"ROK Army\" in the year 1949 alone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   \"AL-3\" war scenario to provoke the Korean War was examined by the U.S. President and military officers  concerned and then taken up and ratified by the U.S. National Security Council in that autumn. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. drew up an operation plan for \"northern expedition\" even with the staff officers of the Japanese imperial army involved and worked out the \"NSC-68\" plan for special actions to be taken in the event of the war outbreak. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The full preparations for invasion of the north were thus rounded off in South Korea in May 1950 under the baton of the U.S.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under this scenario the U.S. made a surprise attack against the DPRK on June 25, 1950. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
