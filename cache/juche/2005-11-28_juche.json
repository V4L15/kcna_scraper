            "content": "KCNA Blasts CNN's Anti-DPRK Diatribe\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 26 (KCNA) -- CNN is now acting a shock force in conducting the U.S. psychological campaign against the DPRK.\r\n It aired a video tape which seriously misrepresented the independent and fair and aboveboard measures taken by the DPRK for enforcing laws, without confirming their truth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The video tape is full of sheer lies negating the popular and class nature and the democratic principle of the DPRK's laws and tarnishing its image from A to Z. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n CNN telecast without hesitation what other media hesitated to do so in the past. This clearly proves that the CNN has been reduced to a trumpeter and a political waiting maid for the U.S. administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. set in motion reptile media whenever its hostile policy toward the DPRK was caught in a cleft. This is its trite method.\r\n Last year, too, the U.S. instigated the Washington Post to spread the story of \"experiment of poisonous gas on human bodies\" on the basis of \"testimonies allegedly made by defectors from the north\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has left no means untried to slander the DPRK, prompted by its inveterate rejection of the political system in it. After its unsuccessful attempt to force the DPRK to \"scrap its nuclear program first\" aimed to disarm it the U.S. has become frantic with orchestrating various forms of psychological operations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The video tape the CNN broadcast at the instigation of the U.S. administration might be a product of its psychological campaign against the DPRK to realize a \"regime change\" in it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is nothing surprising that such video tape is aired in the U.S. as it is infamous for concocting the whole gamut of smear operations such as \"human rights abuse\", \"drug smuggling\", \"human traffic\" and \"counterfeit money.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We are compelled to criticize the CNN styling itself the world's most independent broadcasting body, for having behaved so mean in pursuit of profits.\r\n The CNN is losing popularity as the days go by although it had high audience rating in the world in the past. Much upset by this, the CNN staged such poor farce to improve its image. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But such farce only deprived it of objectivity, impartiality and independence in the international arena. The U.S. has lost both principle and interests.\r\n No sooner had the video tape been broadcast than those who know about the DPRK even a bit claimed that the way of speaking and dressing of those who appeared on the screen and the background against which the scenes were shot were quite different from the reality in the DPRK, a clear proof of a sheer fabrication. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whenever it visited the DPRK CNN blamed other Western media for their lack of impartiality and objectivity, asking the host to grant the right to cover events in the DPRK to it only. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n So, the DPRK side allowed its press corps to visit it several times and provided it with every possible condition for news coverage. \r\n However, recently CNN has broken faith with the DPRK, giving rise to a question as to whether it has done it, displeased with its opening the door to other media in the U.S. on the principle of ensuring broad-based nature of news coverage or because of the pressure from its authorities or prompted by its foolish calculation to improve its image with the adoption of the anti-DPRK \"human rights resolution\" at the UN as a momentum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through the recent farce the CNN dug its own grave. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n CNN's behavior of serving the administration in its hostile policy toward the DPRK only revealed its despicable ulterior motive to prolong its dirty remaining days and make profits. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is deplorable that CNN is in such a position to depart from objectivity and impartiality in its service, away from the basic press ethics. \r\n The recent farce helped the DPRK know well about the reason why the international community does not trust CNN, terming it a prejudiced and self-justified reptile broadcasting service. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the issue of enforcing state laws is concerned, the doctrine of \"freedom and democracy\" advocated by CNN may suit the specific reality in the U.S., the world's worst human rights abuser. But the DPRK has law and order and democracy of its own style which defend the ideology and system chosen by its own people and provide them with genuine human rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We do not deny the fact that the DPRK also has its own punishment system such as death penalty for those who committed felony by infringing upon its own sovereignty and system and people's life and property as is the case with many other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the DPRK does not use such barbaric execution method as the U.S. has used in different parts of the world in the present century as well as in the last century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is only the U.S. that is using such harsh torture and execution method as forcing the prisoner to sit on an electric chair, the method unanimously denounced by the world people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will not show any mercy to those who are hostile to the DPRK no matter how often the U.S. may cite its independent law enforcement measures for attaining its political purpose to bring down the inviolable and dignified political system in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the facts go to clearly prove that its words that \"it recognizes the DPRK as a sovereign state\" and it \"wants to normalize relations with it\" are nothing but hypocrisy and its ambition to realize a \"regime change\" in the DPRK remains unchanged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will consolidate the single-minded unity of its people around the supreme headquarters as firm as a rock in order to frustrate the hostile forces' ever-more undisguised moves to isolate and stifle it. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Chief Negotiator's Irresponsible Remarks under Fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 26 (KCNA) -- Christopher Hill, assistant secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs who is leading the U.S. delegation to the six-way talks reportedly made contradictory remarks about the DPRK at the round-table talks with student representatives of APEC member states on Nov. 19 after participating in the APEC summit talks held in Pusan.\r\n He was reported to have made serious accusations against the DPRK, questioning even the reason why it exists. He went the lengths of asserting that north Korea seems to have no other objective than maintaining its power and its policy priority is so and so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If it is true that the U.S. chief negotiator at the six-party talks made such remarks it is a very serious matter as they meant totally rejecting the ideology and system chosen by the people of the DPRK themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hill who claims to be clever let loose such outcries totally rejecting the system in the DPRK which its people consider as their life and soul. It is not clear whether he said so because of his lack of understanding of the DPRK or he was not aware of the world community's common understanding of the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was mean enough to make such provocative remarks revealing the U.S. aim to bring down the system in the DPRK though he talked about a negotiated peaceful settlement at the negotiating table. This helps the DPRK guess what the U.S. really aims at negotiating with it.\r\n The government of the DPRK and its system precisely mean the life and soul of the people as they were chosen by themselves.\r\n Their present and future would be unthinkable without the DPRK and its system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What Hill uttered is in contravention of the spirit of the Sept. 19 Joint Statement which calls for respecting each other's sovereignty and peaceful co-existence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If one sits at the negotiating table in pursuance of \"regime change\" on the basis of the notion that there can be no co-existence though talks are under way, there naturally arises the question as to whether it is possible to continue talks with that one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His logic meant the U.S. intention not to recognize the DPRK as a state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He seems to consider the six-party talks not as the talks among states but as a mere discussion among non-governmental institutes for policy studies.\r\n In the final analysis, Hill's utterances once again proved that the U.S. policy to stifle and overthrow the DPRK at any cost remains unchanged.\r\n Otherwise, the president of the U.S. styling itself \"super power\" would not have backtracked from its international commitment and the U.S. chief negotiator would not have made such irresponsible remarks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., however, seems to misunderstand the DPRK, intoxicated with its successes in bringing about \"regime changes\" in Iraq and Afghanistan.\r\n Is it possible to discuss the issue of dismantling nuclear deterrent with those keen only to topple the system in the DPRK, showing not an iota of confidence in their dialogue partner? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whenever the U.S. true colors are brought to light, the DPRK more keenly realizes the validity of the Songun policy and the importance of bolstering up its self-defensive deterrent for defending its system. The DPRK is very proud of its Songun policy and its military power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to properly understand the Korean people struggling to defend their dearest socialist system under the uplifted banner of Songun.    \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 26 (KCNA) -- Song Hyo Won, chairperson of the south Korean Federation of University Student Councils (Hanchongryon), issued  a statement on Tuesday denouncing the unreasonable adoption of a \"resolution on human rights performance\" in the north at the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly.\r\n The \"resolution\" misinterpreted the north's stand of opposing the U.S. offensive against it under the pretext of \"its human rights issue\" as the former's \"refusal to cooperate\" with the international community and the UN., mentioning no word about the former's efforts as its old member, the statement noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. promised to take measures for normalizing the relations with the north in the joint statement adopted at the fourth round of the six-party talks. But it has escalated its campaign against the north, focusing on the so-called \"the human rights issue in the north\" in a bid to hamstring the implementation of the joint statement, chill the atmosphere of reconciliation and cooperation on the Korean Peninsula and, furthermore, isolate and bring down the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement urged the U.S. to stop at once its anti-north campaign over its \"human rights issue\" and earnestly opt for normalizing its relations with the north and help peace settle on the Korean Peninsula and in the rest of Northeast Asia in line with the Sept. 19 joint statement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hanchongryon will strongly react against the unjust \"resolution\" adopted under the manipulation of the U.S. and the human rights offensive and plots of America and the ultra-right forces against the north, declared the statement.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Frantic War Preparations of U.S. and Japan under Fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 26 (KCNA) -- The common use of military bases of the U.S. forces in Japan is part of the frantic war preparations stepped up by those forces and the Japan \"Self-Defence Forces\" (SDF) to carry out coordinated military operation.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Saturday says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. military bases in Japan serve as forward bases for carrying out the U.S. strategy for domination over Asia.\r\n The U.S. is now going in the direction of readjusting and reinforcing all its military bases in Japan as required by its strategy for this region and the strategy for \"anti-terrorism war\", in particular. Part of these moves is to allow the \"SDF\" to use those military bases. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These moves to tighten the military nexus between the U.S. and Japan aimed at integrating military bases reveal their intention to reinforce their military alliance for aggression and wage a new war of aggression by allied force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-mentioned military tie-up between the U.S. and Japan is aimed to round off their preparations for a new war against the DPRK. What the U.S. mainly seeks through this common use of the military bases is to successfully fight the war against the DPRK. At the outset of this century the Bush regime listed the DPRK as part \"of the axis of evil\" and a target of preemptive nuclear attack and has since intensified its offensive to stifle the DPRK by force in an unprecedented dimension. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The moves for the common use of military bases by the U.S. and Japan clearly suggest that their scenario for a new war on the Korean Peninsula has entered the phase of its implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are keeping themselves fully ready to cope with this situation with a high degree of vigilance. The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries would be well advised to stop their reckless war moves straining the situation and increasing the danger of war in this region.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a proud tradition and spirit of the Koreans to ardently love the country and the nation and value its dignity more than anything else.\r\n  The Japanese imperialists committed unprecedentedly monstrous criminal acts to exterminate the Korean nation after occupying Korea.\r\n The Korean people, however, protected their national identity, not yielding to them, and defeated the brigandish Japanese imperialists through a bloody struggle, thereby saving the destiny of the country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since the U.S. imperialists occupied south Korea by force of arms under the mask of \"liberator\" after the defeat of the Japanese imperialists, they have left no stone unturned to trample down upon the Korean sovereignty and wipe out the consciousness of independence of the south Korean people by pursuing a crafty policy for colonial domination and harsh fascist dictatorship there. However, the south Korean people have waged a ceaseless struggle for achieving independence against the U.S. in protest against the outside domination and subjugation in the spirit of the Korean nation. \r\n The Koreans' common feelings and desire to put an end to the national division and achieve national reunification are fully reflected in the national sentiment and patriotic spirit of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noblest and strongest are the patriotic idea and sentiments of the Koreans who love the country and the nation and value its dignity very much formed in the history spanning 5,000 years. No force on earth can wipe out the excellence of the homogeneous Korean nation and its national identity. \r\n Underlining the need for the Koreans to cherish the precious tradition and stamina and fully display it in order to achieve the great national unity and the cause of national reunification without fail, the article concludes that it is the priority task for the Korean nation to uphold and implement the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration at present.      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
