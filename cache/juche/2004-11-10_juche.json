            "content": "Head of DPRK Delegation on Peace and Security on Korean Peninsula \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 9 (KCNA) -- Vice-Minister of the People's Armed Forces Kim Sang Ik who is heading a delegation of the DPRK clarified its view on the issue of preserving the regional peace and security centering around the Korean Peninsula in his speech made at the security policy meeting of the ASEAN Regional Forum on November 5.\r\n The basic factor of disturbing peace and stability in the Asian-Pacific region at present is a military threat based on unilateralism and high-handed acts, he said, adding that it is the Korean Peninsula where it is most strongly felt and it is, therefore, a most pressing issue in preserving the regional security to ensure peace on the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went on to say: The present U.S. administration listed the DPRK as part of an \"axis of evil\" and a target of its preemptive nuclear attack and adopted a policy for stifling it by force of arms. It has persistently resorted to the anti-DPRK hostile acts to bring down its system by mobilizing military forces and all other means. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under this tense political and military situation surrounding the peninsula the DPRK is left with no other option but to increase self-defensive capability in every way in order to firmly defend the sovereignty of the country and the nation &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is essential for completely removing the danger of war from the peninsula and ensuring the regional peace is to put an end to U.S. unilateralism and hegemony among other things, its hostile policy toward the DPRK and military threat, in particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. persistently follows its confrontational hostile policy toward the DPRK, in the future, too, from the viewpoint of escapism, this will only compel the latter to double its self-defensive military capability including nuclear deterrent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean People's Army will as ever make every possible effort to avert a war on the Korean Peninsula and in the region and ensure lasting peace in reliance upon its self-reliant defence capability, he concluded.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"
