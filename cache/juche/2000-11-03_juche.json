Lurking behind this is a sinister political aim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government seeks to play down its past crimes and drag out the settlement of its past for an indefinite period in a bid to wrest sort of concession from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the core of the issue of settling its past for Japan to make an official apology and take steps to compensate for its crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the only way for Japan to improve the peculiar DPRK-Japan relations fundamentally different from those between Japan and other countries to officially apologize and compensate for its past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's redress for its past crimes should lead to its renouncement of its hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over the last scores of years since the end of the war Japan has pursued this policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, this is crimes committed by Japan against Korea at present to add to its past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's hostile policy towards the DPRK was prompted by its intention to repeat its past history of aggression. That is why Japan is dragging out the settlement of its past crimes, negating its past aggression under this or that pretext. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that those countries, who were once hostile to the DPRK, are opting to improve relations with it, taking the positive developments on the Korean peninsula into consideration, the article notes: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has a will to improve relations with Japan, but it will never allow Japan to persistently evade the settlement of its past crimes and embark upon reinvasion. This is the steadfast and invariable stand and will of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is well advised to bear in mind that its future will depend on its sincere apology and compensation for its past crimes and halt to its hostile policy towards the DPRK. \r\n\r\n"
