Precisely for this they are becoming more desperate in their bourgeois ideological and cultural poisoning and psychological warfare in a bid to intensify aggression and intervention against other countries and nations and establish the imperialist-led order for world domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are busy massively smuggling literature, video tapes dealing with sex, debauchery and misanthropy and other undesirable propaganda materials of various kinds into socialist and progressive countries. They are, at the same time, working hard to distribute anti-government propaganda materials among disruptive elements and spread false rumors in a bid to create confusion and division. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an ideological standoff with imperialism and a war without gunfire to frustrate the imperialists' crafty and persistent ideological and cultural poisoning and psychological warfare. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is important to know well about the methods employed by the imperialists for such poisoning and warfare and react against them. \r\n While advocating \"globalization\" they are using \"cooperation\" and \"exchange\" as leverage for their ideological and cultural poisoning and psychological warfare. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They use various kinds of literature, video tapes and broadcasting services for their false propaganda and spread wild rumors and bribe people in an effort to convert them into complainants, wavering and corrupt elements and renegades and create social instability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Underscoring the need to cut off all channels to be used by the imperialists for their ideological and cultural poisoning and psychological warfare, the article stresses: The triumphant advance of the human cause of independence depends on whether the imperialists' ideological and cultural poisoning and their psychological warfare are shattered or connived at and allowed.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They are the dangerous war forces which execute on the spot the U.S. policy of aggression on Korea and a root cause of creating tension and the danger of a war on the Korean Peninsula.\r\n The history of their occupation of south Korea is recorded with barbarous war of aggression and war provocation rackets; they have killed the Korean nation and harassed and destroyed peace and security on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are now frantically stepping up their preparations for a war of aggression against the north behind the scene of the six-party talks in a bid to realize their invariable ambition to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans can not live at ease as long as the U.S. troops remain  in south Korea. The U.S. troops are the most dangerous entity which is directly threatening the existence and security of the Korean nation in this land and a root cause of a nuclear war which can never be allowed. Now that the Bush group is kicking up an anti-DPRK smear campaign to lay an artificial obstacle in the way of settling the nuclear issue and is openly working hard to provoke a nuclear war under that pretext, the danger of the U.S. imperialist aggression troops in south Korea as a root cause of escalating tension for a war is increasing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historic cause of the Korean nation to prevent a war and defend peace on the Korean Peninsula should be orientated to a nationwide patriotic struggle to drive the U.S. troops out of south Korea at an early date.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
