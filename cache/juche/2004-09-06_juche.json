Z. Umalatova said in a report that with the foundation of the DPRK the political situation of East Asia had been radically changed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the leadership of President Kim Il Sung the protracted struggle of the Korean people to liberate the country from the Japanese occupiers was concluded with victory and a genuine people's country was built in the land of Korea, so that the road of socialist development was opened in this region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has covered the road of new development under the leadership of Kim Jong Il, a great successor to the idea and cause of Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through the Russia visit of Kim Jong Il not only the Russian people but the whole world have come to know clearly that he is steering the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is now displaying its might as a powerful socialist country which has the people single-heartedly united around the leader and the invincible revolutionary armed forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Speakers praised the state building exploits of Kim Il Sung and the Songun leadership exploits of Kim Jong Il. They stressed that new victories and successes are always in store for the DPRK and the Korean people invariably holding high the socialist banner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A message of greetings to Kim Jong Il was adopted at the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, a round-table talk, a lecture and a film show were held by the Trunov County Committee of the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia of the Czech Republic, the commercial faculty of the Makerere University in Uganda and a machine company in Indonesia from August 27 to 31.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This goes to prove that the U.S. ambition for world supremacy to occupy strategic vantages in Northeast Asia and the world's main natural resource areas on the plea of \"combating terror\" is entering the full-fledged practice.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Sunday says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is working hard to form a \"rapid reaction force\" in the Asia-Pacific region to contain China and Russia and create a favorable circumstance for the realization of its strategy for world domination in the new century. Considering the Korean peninsula as its key link in carrying out its Asia-Pacific strategy the U.S. intends to make it a test ground for its \"long distance attack strategy\" and \"rapid mobile operation\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose forces have planned to move the First U.S. Army Corps Command to Japan and most of the U.S. troops in south Korea from the areas of the Military Demarcation Line to deploy them south of the River Han. This is aimed to further increase the capabilities of preemptive attack on the DPRK with its naval and air force, \"rapid reaction force,\" etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is foolish for the U.S. to realize its design for domination in the Korean peninsula and the Asia-Pacific region with the \"rapid reaction force.\" The U.S. is grossly mistaken if it thinks that it will be safe with others suffering from damage as it launches a \"rapid maneuvers\" with its \"long distance attack strategy\". Ultra-modern equipment is not monopoly of the U.S. There is no limit in the striking force of the Korean People's Army. If the U.S. dare ignite a war against the DPRK, misjudging its might, the aggressors will not evade a merciless retaliatory strike anywhere they may be.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

When it has become a trend of the times to demand the liquidation of past history, the GNP let loose sheer sophism that \"pro-north and pro-communist activities\" should be included in the objects to be probed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aim of the GNP is nothing but to groundlessly link the movement with the north in a bid to divert the probe elsewhere and cover up its crime-woven history in which its gang committed pro-Japanese acts of treachery and pro-U.S. sycophantic acts, enforced fascist dictatorship,practiced corruption, pursued confrontation with the north and did harm to fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The far-fetched assertion made by the GNP is aimed to brand the patriots of all social strata who have worked for national reconciliation, cooperation and reunification and the people desirous of national reunification in this land as \"pro-north and pro-communist elements.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people from all walks of life should turn out in an all-people struggle to liquidate the past history in order to completely eliminate the traitorous party just as they punished the GNP during the presidential election and the National Assembly election. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the people and the organizations of the anti-U.S. movement should conduct the struggle to probe the truth behind the past history in close combination with the struggle to frustrate the U.S. colonial rule over south Korea and interference in its internal affairs, the appeal concluded.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It was an extremely adventurous maneuver for a war of aggression presupposing a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are persistently insisting that the DPRK scrap its nuclear program first, backtracking on the principle \"words for words\", \"action for action\" and \"reward for freeze\" publicly recognized by the international community. They are openly heading for a provocative military option, beclouding the prospect of the peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. staged the joint military exercise in a bid to threaten and pressurize the DPRK by force of arms and, at the same time, achieve its criminal purpose of igniting a nuclear war at any cost on the Korean peninsula under the pretext of the nuclear issue between them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Herein lies the danger of the recent joint military exercise which should not be overlooked. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities staged such dangerous north-targeted saber-rattling in collusion with the outside forces in violation of the spirit of the June 15 joint declaration, thus inciting distrust and confrontation between the north and the south and laying a stumbling block in the way of improving the north-south relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and its followers should act with discretion, pondering over the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by their anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK and moves for inciting confrontation between the north and the south.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This terrorism claimed big casualties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A series of terrorist acts committed in different regions of Russia before and after the recent election of the Chechen president were targeted against innocent civilians, children in particular.
