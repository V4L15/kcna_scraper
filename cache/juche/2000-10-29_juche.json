He, who underwent imprison life twice before the war, was arrested again in 1952 to serve a term of 20 years in prison. And he had been subject to surveillance and persecution for nearly 30 years even after his release. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the note Sok said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n I hailed from Ryangsan, South Kyongsang Province, but came to the north of the country where I had never been to and there is no kinsman of mine. It is because I wanted to devote myself to the truly beloved motherland and honor the remainder of my life and Pyongyang is my native home in aspects of ideology, faith and will. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n I proudly declare that my native home of ideology, faith and will is Pyongyang where the great President Kim Il Sung lies in state for perpetuity and the great leader Kim Jong Il is administering politics of Juche, the politics based on the idea of believing in the people as in heaven, true to the intention of the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In South Korea I had always sung the \"Song of General Kim Il Sung\" in and out the prison. This song would give mental peace and strength to me in painful troubles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The greatness of Kim Jong Il was the most unshakable mainstay that encouraged us to keep our principles. I felt more deeply the conviction that guided by him, we have nothing to be afraid of in the world and the final victory of socialism is sure to be won as well as the belief that it was quite right that we had overcome sufferings and hardships. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In conclusion Sok said that under the care of the DPRK he would devote himself with sincerity to Kim Jong Il and contribute to accelerating national reunification, though he is too old and ailing. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Improved DPRK-Japan relations are unthinkable without honest reflection and apology \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 29 (KCNA) -- Even at the historic turn of the century Japan, clamoring about non-existent \"kidnapping issue\" of the DPRK, still refuses to make a proper apology for the unprecedented crimes the Japanese imperialists committed in the past. Without Japan's honest reflection and apology there can be no trust and improved relations between the DPRK and Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun stresses this in a signed article today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are movements in various countries to settle outstanding issues of the 20th century at the turn of the century and greet the new century. Some time ago the Roman Catholic Church made an apology for its wrong which dates back to 400 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The behaviour of Japan presents a sharp contrast with that of Germany that passed a bill calling denial of Nazi massacres as historic facts to account before making a state compensation for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only Japan refuses to make an apology for the past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt does not reflect on the past, but misses the bygone days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In actuality, it is stepping up preparations for reinvasion in full swing watching for a chance for revenge in order to make up for its defeat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While taking insincere attitude towards the issue of apology it is obliged to settle, it is hell-bent on taking military and legal step designed to realise its wild ambition for reconquest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Herein lies the danger of militarist aggression on the part of the Japanese reactionaries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan regards Korea as the first target of attack for overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is watching for a chance for reinvasion behind the curtain of \"improvement of relations.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It should face up to the changed times. Korea today in particular, and do what it should do with correct viewpoint. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It should make a sincere reflection on and an apology for the past wrongs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By doing so it should show to the international community the will not to repeat the crime-woven past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That will be beneficial to Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities should have a good understanding of the anti-Japanese feelings and psychology of the army and people of the DPRK, approach the talks with sincere stance and agree to the liquidation of the past, an outstanding issue of history, at an early date. \r\n\r\n"

The 11th round of DPRK-Japan intergovernmental talks will shortly be held. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's moves are categorically contrary to the purport and purpose of the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Brandishing a sword against the partner while talking about \"opening of relations\" is contrary to the diplomatic etiquette and common sense and it is just an act of creating military confrontation and danger of war, not a standpoint for improvement of relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people and the Asian people will never allow the war moves of Japanese and U.S. bellicose forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' taking the road of confrontation and reinvasion against the trend of the times will only result in their own isolation and destruction. \r\n\r\n"
