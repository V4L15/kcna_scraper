The GNP's outcry for the \"general turnout of the rightists\" is an act of calling the ghost of the era of fascist dictatorship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the ultra-right conservative forces seized power in south Korea with the GNP's scheme to return to power realized, the June 15 joint declaration would be scrapped and inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation and peace and security of the nation be endangered.

To yield to and depend upon foreign forces means abandoning one's independent rights and forgetting the position and awareness of being responsible for one's destiny. This will only lead to national ruin and enslavement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is important for getting rid of subservience and dependence on foreign forces is to see through the aggressive nature of the imperialists. Their aggressive and predatory nature can never change no matter how much water may flow under the bridge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter how frantically the imperialists may escalate their pressure and blackmail against the above-said countries, they should neither yield to them nor discard their viewpoint and faith. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Countries and nations can protect their dignity and sovereignty and achieve social progress and prosperity only when they fight imperialism to a bitter end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The spirit of independence serves as a tonic for the countries and the nations in their development whereas the idea of subservience and dependence on the foreign forces is as harmful as poison.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And during the hard-fought Fatherland Liberation War (1950.6-1953.7), he inspired peasants there with confidence and optimism, saying the plain should be reclaimed after the war so that they might be well off with nothing to envy more. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President visited the then State Singye General Farm in June Juche 46 (1957). Rejecting some people's opinion about disbanding the farm, he said that the farm should not be dissolved but further developed and made hours to discuss the issue of reclaiming the soil and the prospects of fruit-culture and stockbreeding. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In September of the same year, he came there again and took detailed measures to push ahead with the land reclamation and irrigation project in a big way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Later, he saw to it that a lot of trucks, tractors, water pumps and construction materials including cement were sent to the farm on several occasions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il paid a visit to the plain in September 2005. Then he instructed officials that the government's investment should be augmented and forces concentrated while making best use of the already-laid material and technical foundations, thus opening up a brilliant vista for effecting a fresh turn in the farming on the plain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In response to the joint New Year editorial's call for converting the Miru Plain associated with the leadership exploits of the President into a solid grain production base, the agricultural working people there are busy with farming preparations for the year while vigorously carrying on the Miru Plain Water-way project.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

All the Korean people should turn out in the struggle for peace against war in order to smash the military pressure, war exercise and military buildup that threaten the nation, and launch a dynamic campaign to drive the U.S. occupation troops, the root cause of war, out of south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To achieve unity is an urgent demand of the reunification movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unity is a way to national existence and prime mover of the cause of the country's reunification. The Koreans in the north, south and abroad should bring the atmosphere of reconciliation and unity to a crescendo under the banner of independent reunification, and further promote solidarity and alliance between different reunification movement organizations with the June 15 All-Korean Committee as an umbrella body. A heyday of the cause of independent reunification will be certain to come in this land only when all Koreans in the north, south and abroad successfully carry out the three tasks--attaching importance to the nation, defending peace and achieving unity.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
