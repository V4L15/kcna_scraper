            "content": "Syrian Political Party Leader Refers to Ties with WPK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 26 (KCNA) -- The Arab Socialists' Movement of Syria will as ever strengthen the friendship and solidarity with the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK). General Secretary of the movement Gassan Abdul Aziz Osman said this at round-table talks on the joint New Year editorial issued by the newspapers of the Workers' Party of Korea, the Korean People's Army and the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League of the DPRK held by the movement on Jan. 13.\r\n The general secretary said that the joint New Year editorial of the leading newspapers of the DPRK reviewed successes made by the Korean people in their just struggle last year and laid down major tasks to be fulfilled this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He expressed belief that the Korean people who have built strong nuclear deterrence under the banner of the Songun politics would achieve greater success in this year's efforts to build a great prosperous powerful nation and reunify the country and peacefully solve the DPRK-U.S. nuclear crisis through negotiations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Both the DPRK and Syria are now struggling against the pressure and threat posed by the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people's anti-U.S. struggle for peace and security on the Korean peninsula encourages Syria in its cause and its struggle in Mideast constitutes solidarity with the Korean people in their struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a way of defending the security of the two countries and world peace to boost solidarity and mutual support between the DPRK and Syria under the present tense situation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. to Blame for Developing Nukes \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 26 (KCNA) -- The U.S. National Nuclear Security Administration recently instructed the Los Alamos Institute and two other institutes to resume the research into smaller nukes in the wake of the Bush administration's lift of the decade-long ban on the research into smaller nukes.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article carried in this regard says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n More than a decade has passed since the Cold War came to an end and the U.S. military rival demised. Moreover, the world greeted the new century. But the U.S. has frantically stepped up arms buildup and is now working hard to modernize and conventionalize nuclear weapons. This lays bare the true colors of the U.S. as the world's biggest nuclear criminal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. reckless policy for arms buildup is sparking off the second arms race worldwide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is working hard to carry out its \"strategy to mount a preemptive nuclear attack\" after designating several countries as targets of nuclear attacks. This compelled big powers and several other countries to bolster nuclear means to cope with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world is now on the verge of being embroiled in the second global arms race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' strategy for a preemptive nuclear attack is targeted against the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is none other than the U.S. which is chiefly to blame for the new world arms race and it is again the U.S. which has brought misfortune and pain to other nations, threatening to use nuclear weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. must stand international trial for developing nuclear weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world community should never overlook the U.S. moves to launch a nuclear war going against humankind's unanimous desire and wish to live in a new stable and peaceful world free from the danger of a nuclear war and arms race.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Our nation-first spirit is a powerful ideological and moral weapon for victory in this struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an important demand of the present reality to advance the movement for the country's reunification under the banner of this spirit today when the U.S. imperialists' high-handed practices against the DPRK and their unilateralism and moves of aggression on Korea have been carried into extremes. If the U.S. imperialists' reckless nuclear rackets and moves to provoke a new war go unchecked, irreversible grave consequences may be incurred to the sovereignty and dignity of the country and the nation and the cause of independent national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when the banner of our nation-first spirit is held aloft in today's anti-U.S. struggle is it possible to realize national unity and fortify the will of the nation to achieve peace and reunification on the basis of the excellent national character of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the guarantee for shattering the aggressive moves of outside forces against Korea's reunification and spurring the process of reconciliation and reunification for the Korean nation to wage the struggle under the uplifted banner of our nation-first spirit which boosts the pride in the superiority and might of the nation and enhances the will to fight the U.S. for independent reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
