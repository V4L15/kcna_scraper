The inoculators of the preventive and curative medical service organs conduct vaccination for the people according to the yearly inoculation calendar distributed by the National Medical Authority. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Despite difficulties in the economy, the state takes positive measures to produce sufficient quantities of preventive medicines. \r\n\r\n"

The fact clearly proves that the U.S. policy of anti-Cuban economic blockade has come to a total failure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The adoption of the resolution eloquently showed how strong the world opinion against anti-Cuban blockade is. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States must clearly see the situation and draw a lesson. Embargo, blockade and other anachronistic practices no longer work in today's world. The United States must immediately stop the sanctions aimed at stifling the DPRK, Cuba and other independent countries. \r\n\r\n"

The history of most heinous crimes of Japanese imperialism will never be forgotten no matter how many generations may alter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Can the unethical crime concerning \"comfort women for the army\" without precedent in human history be erased even if the relevant term is deleted in textbooks? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If Japan wants to greet the new millennium without shame, it must begin liquidating the crime-woven past, rather than deny or whitewash it. \r\n\r\n"
