In the servicemen's hall he saw records of proud victories won by the unit and listened to a briefing on its history.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He dropped in at the unit's operation command room to acquaint himself with the performance of its duty before watching soldiers in military training. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Greatly satisfied to learn that all the servicemen have grown to be a-match-for-a hundred combatants, he advanced highly important tasks that would serve as a guideline in increasing the combat capacity of the unit in every way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then he went round an education room, bedroom, mess, bathroom, provision store and other places, deeply pleased to see all facilities built well to the servicemen's conveniences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He instructed the unit to make a more effective use of sideline plots so as to supply a variety of subsidiary food and more milk products to its soldiers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He gave the unit an automatic rifle as a gift and posed for a picture with its officers and men.    \r\n\r\n"

It is designed to tarnish the image of the Korean people who have advanced along the road of victory despite difficulties and trials. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While visiting various places, the group realized that the DPRK is the superior and peculiar state in the world as its people are carving out their destiny by themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will strive to let the world people have a correct understanding of Korea and war crimes committed by the GIs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK-U.S. relations are growing tense since the emergence of the Bush administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is aggravating the U.S.-DPRK relations because the Korean peninsula is situated in an important region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We feel the need to put strong pressure upon the U.S. to stop at once the aggression and blockade against the DPRK, a great country, and discontinue meddling in the Korean issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should withdraw its forces and nuclear weapons from South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Brian Becker, chairman of the U.S. Get Out of Korea Committee, who is a member of the group, briefed media on the issues and the collected materials to be handled by the participants in the international war crimes tribunal to be held to try GIs' mass killings of civilians during the last Korean War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rev.
