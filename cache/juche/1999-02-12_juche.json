            "content": "DPRK mission secretary abducted by S. Korean \"Intelligence Service\" in broad daylight \r\n     Pyongyang, February 12 (KCNA) -- Kim Kyong Phil, a secretary of the DPRK mission in Germany, and his wife were abducted by \"Intelligence Service\" of South Korea in broad daylight on January 13. Kim Mun Dok, a brother-in-law of Kim Kyong Phil, stated this in  an interview with KCNA on February 11, exposing the truth behind terrorism by the South Korean \"Intelligence Service\". \r\n   After introducing himself as an official of the UNICEF mission in Vietnam, he recalled that he often had contacts with his sister and brother-in-law by telephone. \r\nHe said:\r\n   They used to tell me over phone they felt uneasy due to vicious intelligence activities and a smear campaign of agents of the South Korean Intelligence Service against the DPRK mission in Germany getting all the more pronounced with each passing day.\r\n   At 2 p.m. on January 17 my elder sister made an urgent call to me when I was in my office at the mission. \r\n   She hurriedly told me, \"we fell victims to a plot hatched by gangsters of the South Korean  'Agency for National Security Planning'. Be firmly determined and beware of them.\" Her message was interrupted before she finished her call. No sooner had I heard her strained and perplexed voice than I perceived immediately that they were abducted by agents of the South Korean \"Intelligence Service.\"\r\n   On the morning of January 19 two days after my telephone contact with my elder sister a man surnamed Ri from Seoul called me. He asked me if I had any problem which required \"help\" from him. He told me to get in touch with the \"South Korean embassy,\" if any. On January 20 that man made a call of appeasement and threat to my house.\r\n   When I strongly protested against this, the villain rang off phone, and afterwards he has never done such a thing.\r\n   Judging from the foolish acts of the enemies, I was aware that they were trying to lead me astray after kidnapping my elder sister and brother-in-law.\r\n   Kim Mun Dok testified that his elder sister told him over phone that she and her husband had been abducted by gangsters of the South Korean  \"ANSP\" and that judging from the telephone message from the enemies and their plot to kidnap him, it was obvious that her elder sister and brother-in-law had been abducted by agents of the South Korean \"Intelligence Service.\"\r\n   His elder sister and brother-in-law always told him not to turn a traitor to his country, though he was not able to do admirable things for the sake of the country, he said.\r\n   The allegations that his elder sister and brother-in-law \"defected\" do not deserve even a passing note, he said, and continued:\r\n    I can hardly repress indignation and hatred for the South Korean authorities who abducted my elder sister and brother-in-law in broad daylight.\r\n    I feel deep regret at the attitude of the German authorities who remained a passive onlooker to the white terrorism against the DPRK mission secretary with diplomatic privilege.\r\n    I earnestly call upon the UN commission on human rights, world human rights bodies and organisations, an international organisation of democratic lawyers and personages to pay deep attention to the rescue of my elder sister and brother-in-law who were abducted by the South Korean \"Intelligence Service\" and to take active steps.\r\n   We make it clear that we will continue fighting for their reinstatement. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

On top of it, South Korea is covering a larger portion of expenses for the upkeep of the U.S. troops stationed in South Korea. The amount increased to 399 million U.S. dollars in 1998, the first year of his office or an increase of 36 million U.S. dollars compared to the figure of the previous year.\r\n   The present South Korean regime is shielding the Japanese authorities in their scheme to avoid liquidating Japan's past crimes and encouraging its militarism.\r\n   Typical of this is the Japan visit of the present chief executive of South Korea.\r\n   No sooner had he set his foot in Tokyo last October on a visit to Japan than he told the Japanese \"Emperor\": \"There was a very short period of unfriendly relations in the history of the two countries, and this was a serious blot on the long-standing friendly relations between Japan and South Korea. It was something disgraceful not only for the ancestors but also for the descendants.\"\r\n   His utterances are a wanton distortion of history and a mockery of the Korean people, victims of aggression by the Japanese imperialists.\r\n   Last September witnessed the signing of a \"fisheries accord\" between the South Korean regime and the reactionary Japanese government. under this accord, a wide expanse of South Korea's fishing grounds was handed over to the Japanese side and Tok Islet, an inviolable territory of Korea, was sold off.\r\n   The signing of the accord brougth the South Korean fishermen an annual loss of 1,072.5 billion won. \r\n   The South Korean regime opened doors wide for the Japanese culture, with the result that corrupt culture of Japan has made its way in South Korea.\r\n   It declared the fellow countrymen in the north \"principal enemy.\" while scheming to keep the country divided for an indefinite period, it has tried to hurt the fellow countrymen in the north hand in glove with outside forces.\r\n   When asked how he thought of northerners at a press conference, the present chief executive answered:   \"They are  our compatriots.  But they are our enemy as long as they remain communists.\"\r\n   Last December Kim Jong Pil also cried, \"Our enemy is doubtlessly the communist people's army which must be overpowered.\"\r\n   \"Minister of National Defence\" of South Korea Chon Yong Thaek told a meeting of the \"Defence Committee of the National Assembly\" held last October that the north is obviously \"the principal enemy.\"\r\n   The self-styled \"government for the people\" is zealously joining the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries in their criminal scheme to operate the U.S.-Japan-South Korea triangular military alliance on a full scale within the framework of \"operation plan 5027.\"\r\n   If the present South Korean rulers want not to be judged by history, they must immediately stop inflicting sufferings and misfortunes upon the fellow countrymen. s\r\n\r\n\r\n"
