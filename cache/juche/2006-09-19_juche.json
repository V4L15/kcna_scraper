            "content": "Kim Yong Nam Calls for NAM's Increased Role \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Havana, September 16 (KCNA) -- The Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) should put up collective actions against the arbitrary and high-handed practices of a specified country and take more practical measures to establish a new and fair international order.\r\n Kim Yong Nam, president of the Presidium of the DPRK Supreme People's Assembly, said this on Sept. 16 at the 14th NAM summit now under way in Havana. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over the past 45 years since the declaration of its birth the NAM has served as a banner for the developing countries in their struggle to build an independent and peaceful world based on justice and made a great contribution to the process of transforming the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The desire and aspiration of humankind after the just and peaceful 21st century are still facing serious challenges. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The international order is disturbed and peace and security in the world are seriously threatened by the high-handed acts and unilateralism of the superpower standing in the way of independent choice and development of countries and nations and the non-aligned countries have become their biggest victims. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has escalated all sorts of despicable moves against the DPRK since Washington singled out it as part of \"an axis of evil\", a target of preemptive nuclear attack, invariably pursuant to its hostile policy towards Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The grave situation where DPRK's security and interests are exposed to the U.S. threat to mount a nuclear attack on it compelled it to take an option to have access to nuclear weapons as deterrent for self-defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The government of the DPRK declared more than once that it will feel no need to keep even a single nuke when it is not exposed to the U.S. threat any longer after it has rolled back its hostile policy towards Pyongyang and confidence has been built between the two countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue between the DPRK and U.S. can be finally resolved only if the U.S. respects the sovereignty and option of the former and makes a switchover from its hostile policy to a policy of peaceful coexistence and basically remove all the nukes and nuclear war threat from the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present international situation requires the NAM to increase its position and role as an independent political force representing the South. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It is our view that the summit should pay a special attention to the following points in setting out the orientation of the NAM's activities to cope with the prevailing situation: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Firstly, the NAM should invariably remain true to its noble idea and principle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Secondly, the NAM should meet all challenges by the force of the unity and solidarity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thirdly, the NAM should put main emphasis on categorically rejecting the double standards in the international relations and ensuring the strict adherence to the principle of equality and impartiality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The government of the DPRK will as ever perform its responsibility and role in the efforts to achieve the human cause of independence and the growth of the NAM.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
