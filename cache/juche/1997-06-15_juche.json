Kim Jong Il guides cultural heritage inheritance\r\n Pyongyang, June 15 (KCNA) - Secretary Kim Jong Il guided the work of inheriting and developing the nation's cultural heritages on Saturday.\r\n   He was accompanied by secretaries of the Workers' Party of Korea Central Committee Choe Thae Bok and Kim Ki Nam and Vice-Premier of the Administration Council Jang Chol.\r\n   He first saw the folk dance suite \"people in the walled city of Pyongyang\" newly produced by the State National Art Troupe and learned how the art troupe was inheriting and developing folk dance and national music.\r\n   The performers vividly represented the justice- and patriotic-minded people in the walled city of Pyongyang as well as beautiful national dance and music.\r\n   He expressed great satisfaction, highly praised and thanked the creating staff and artistes of the art troupe for successfully producing the unique Korean-style folk dance suite.\r\n   He said it was of great importance in patriotic education to inform the people of fine culture and customs created by their ancestors while in national defence and industrious labor. He put forward important tasks to carry forward the nation's cultural traditions properly.\r\n   The consistent policy of the Workers' Party of Korea in inheriting and developing the nation's cultural heritages is to observe the principles of historicism and modernism and guard against restorationism and national nihilism, he noted, adding that as a result of strict observation of these principles, the nation's fine culture established by the ancestors is genuinely serving the working masses in the Workers' Party Age.\r\n   Time-honored dance movements and melodies were found out and represented to the tastes of the times, he said, adding that this is very significant in view of esthetics and inheritance and development of classics. He urged the workers engaged in literature and art and all other sectors to strive to keep the nation's fine cultural heritages properly and help the people to have a higher sense of national pride and honor.\r\n   He said that the unique principles and methods applied in the production of revolutionary operas in Korea should be introduced in the folk dance suite so that it could be reminiscent of the Workers' Party Age.\r\n   Literary and art works should be of eternal value and highest quality as they constitute the nation's valuable cultural heritage, he said. He called on the creating staff and artistes to be true creators and defenders of socialist literature and art by producing larger numbers of popular works that meet the demands of the times and strike the fancy of the Korean people. \r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun today condemns the announcement as an act of going against the trend of detente and a wanton challenge to the people's desire for peace.\r\n   The \"report\" raised the \"maintenance of overwhelming military power\" and the continued overseas presence of the US. troops  as the \"basic strategy of the U.S.  army in the 21st century\".\r\n   The news analyst says:\r\n   The \"strategy\" is one for aggression based on the arrogance of the United States styling itself as the \"only superpower\". It is aimed at intensifying the military arbitrariness in the future.\r\n   The U.S. military bellicose forces are trying to set in motion in the future leading to the 21st century the \"new military strategy\", the \"strategy for the solution of regional disputes\" which was declared as the state strategy after the end of the Cold War.\r\n   In a bid to carry into practice the \"strategy for the solution of regional disputes\", they are taking a serious view of the \"strategy of forward deployment\" of the U.S. forces. They are now intending to direct the main spearhead of their strategy of aggression to the Korean Peninsula and realize their policy for showdown of strength. They are also trying to realize their ambition for domination over the whole of Korea and, at the same time, make it a breakthrough in promoting the \"strategy of future\".\r\n   This is why they are intending to keep their forces 100,000 strong in south Korea and its surroundings.\r\n   If the United States continues stifling the DPRK with strength, we have no alternative but to take a self-defensive step to cope with it.\r\n   We have an option and a measure to defend the sovereignty, interests and security of the country. \r\n\r\n"

It is because the the economic and military strategic importance in the region has been increased unprecedentedly since the end of the Cold War.\r\n   The keynote of Japan's military assistance to the United States is a wholesale  support to the operation of the U.S. forces in Japan in case of \"emergency\" in the area surrounding Japan.\r\n   The \"emergency\" around Japan on the part of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries means \"crisis\" and \"disputes\" in certain areas and countries of the Asia-Pacific region.\r\n   The U.S. forces stationed in Japan are a shock brigade for the U.S. policy of aggression. So, Japan's assistance means a joint operation with the United States in a certain area of the world.\r\n   Japan is prohibited by law to conduct overseas military activities and to have the right to warring. If the Japanese reactionaries are to take a road of military overseas aggression, they must have a legitimate condition. To this end, they are bringing forward military assistance to the U.S. in case of \"emergency\" around Japan.\r\n   The first target of it will be the Korean Peninsula. Japan's military assistance is bringing the militarist and aggressive danger into bolder relief.\r\n   But the Japanese reactionaries' moves will be nothing but a suicidal act. \r\n\r\n"
