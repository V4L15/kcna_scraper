It is because its foundation is the Socialist Constitution authored by the president and it codifies the idea of Juche-oriented state building, immortal revolutionary feats and outstanding great personality of the president. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Reflected in the constitution are the faith and will of Kim Jong Il and the Korean people to hold Kim Il Sung in high esteem as the eternal president of the DPRK and finally accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Therefore, the constitution always sheds its rays as a great political charter based on the revolutionary outlook on the leader and the great Kim Il Sung constitution and a great monumental document as it broke a new ground in the human history of state constitutions, the article stresses.    \r\n\r\n"

This was an incident unprecedented in history.\r\n This crime committed in other country's territorial waters is nothing but brutal piracy and unpardonable terrorism of modern brand that could be committed only by Samurais of Japan in defiance of international laws. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the Japanese reactionaries are spreading a sheer rumour that the unidentified ship might be a \"spy ship from North Korea,\" describing their piracy as a \"measure for self-defence.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This proves that their loudmouthed case of the \"unidentified ship\" is another trite charade and a grave provocation, products of the anti-DPRK hostile policy of the Japanese reactionaries, who never open their mouths without pulling up the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-DPRK smear campaign launched by the Japanese authorities linking the DPRK with the case of the \"unidentified ship\" for no reason is little short of an act of adding to the crimes already committed against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities, not content with the recent terrorist act perpetrated against the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, an overseas compatriots organization of the dignified DPRK, are frantically escalating this hostile policy towards the DPRK under the above-said absurd pretext. We will never remain a passive onlooker to such moves of the Japanese authorities.    \r\n\r\n"
