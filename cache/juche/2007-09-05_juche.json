There is, therefore, no justification for Japan to frantically step up the moves to modernize the equipment of the SDF and beef up its armed forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the ulterior intention of the Japanese reactionaries to bring the situation in the Asia-Pacific to an extreme pitch of tension and spark an arms race and thus round off at a higher level their preparations for militarist overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such moves to bolster their military forces reveal themselves that Japan is a dangerous force for a war of aggression and an arch disturber of peace in Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries would be well advised to roll back at once their militarist policy of overseas aggression, thinking twice over the serious consequences to be entailed by their reckless moves to turn Japan into a military giant.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In this period the theses fully displayed its validity and great vitality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n More than 2.1 million intellectuals have been trained and the number of those holding academic degrees or titles has grown 25 times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The universal 11-year compulsory education system has been further consolidated, providing more favorable conditions and circumstances to train the people to be persons with secondary general knowledge, more than one technical skill and strong physical strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Computer Science College was established at Kim Il Sung University and College of Information Science and Technology and College of Machine Science and Technology at Kim Chaek University of Technology. Besides, courses of up-to-date science and technology were instituted at various universities and colleges. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The educational system for training field technicians has been established in different sectors of the national economy. As a result, the study-while-work colleges were arranged rationally in towns and countryside, industrial and agricultural areas and their function and role enhanced. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The material and technical foundations for education have been cemented, providing a sure guarantee for bringing about a fresh revolutionary turn in the educational work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An average of more than 1,000 intellectuals holding degrees and titles of academician, candidate academician, professor, doctor and associate professor and master have been produced every year since the 1970s. While their number was increasing, doctors and masters in their twenties and thirties were turned out in large numbers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The vitality of the theses is now more evidently proven in the practice of building a rich and powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The artificial earth satellite \"Kwangmyongsong 1\" was successfully launched with domestic technology, resources and efforts. And the go program was developed in Korean way, thus retaining the champion at the World Computer Go Championships for six consecutive times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Valuable research successes were made such as the technology of boosting the efficiency of hydropower turbine, the method of producing pure seeds of virus-free potatoes, and the fresh way of producing silk thread. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK won the top prizes in succession at such international contests as the International Math Olympiad, international Russian and Chinese contests and the international piano and violin concours.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is nothing but a modern version of the \"spirit of universal brotherhood\", the idea of reinvasion advocated by Tojo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is set to make inroads deep into other Asian countries and realize its old dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\", peddling \"Broader Asia\" initiative. It is, in essence, nothing but a wild ambition to contain the DPRK and China and establish the sphere of military domination in Asia and thus become its \"leader.\" The \"Broader Asia\" initiative precisely means a scenario for overseas expansion and a theory of conquering Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind Abe's assertion that Japan will render \"cooperation\" in all fields for regional integration is a sinister intention to step up economic infiltration into Asian countries, secure concessions and thus lay a springboard for overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are working hard to win confidence of Asian countries through sugar-coated \"diplomacy based on view on value\" while persistently shelving the issue of redeeming Japan's past. \"Money is all-cure.\" This is the conception of the above-said \"diplomacy\" of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During his recent trips to Asian countries Abe talked a lot about \"closer economic cooperation\" and the like. It was the true intention of Abe to calm down the anti-Japanese sentiment of those countries that may stand in the way of bringing rich raw material resources under Japan's control and securing markets and pave a broad avenue for exploitation and plunder. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries, not content with denying and distorting Japan's past history of aggression, have become so reckless as to deny even the decision made by the international tribunal against the Japanese imperialists' war crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has discarded the veil of the \"pacifist state\" which it professed for more than half a century after the Second World War, betraying its true colors as a warlike state for aggression and hegemonic force seeking to conquer Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to discard the anachronistic ambition to dominate Asia and truly strive to win confidence of the Asian people.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This marked a historic event of epochal significance in the development of education in the era of independence, the reporter noted, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the theses the President scientifically clarified that socialist education is, in essence, an undertaking to train people as independent and creative social beings and the aim of socialist education is to prepare people as genuine revolutionary intellectuals who have independence and creativity and gave comprehensive answers to the questions as to the contents and methods of education. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President wisely led the work to implement the theses, ushering in the great heyday in the development of Juche-oriented education, and worked heart and soul to develop this education till the last moments of his noble life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President's idea of education and his cause of building Juche-oriented education have been successfully carried forward at a new higher level by Kim Jong Il, the reporter noted, and went on to say: The greatness of the ideas and leadership of the peerlessly great men who provided the revolutionary and original great programme for education and the tremendous vitality of the theses have been fully demonstrated in the educational practice over the past three decades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Juche has been firmly established in the education and the contents and methods of intellectual education and the education in science and technology have remarkably improved as required by the party policy and the IT age. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The endeavors to raise the quality of the universal 11-year compulsory education resulted in improving the education in general basic science, foreign languages and basic technology, thereby enabling the younger generation to grow up to be able intellectuals possessed of a high level of secondary general knowledge and creative ability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a result of the consolidation of the socialist educational system under the rays of the educational theses, the DPRK is now covered with a dense network of schools, turning the country into a land of learning where people are given opportunities to study all their lives and putting it on a high level where it can successfully realize the intellectualization of all members of society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter called upon all officials and teachers to bring about fresh miracles and innovations in the education of the rising generation and thus thoroughly implement the behests of the President and uphold the Songun revolutionary leadership of Kim Jong Il with great achievements in education and scientific researches.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And it was further developed and enriched by Palhae, Koryo and Ri Dynasty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The horses for Masangjae were tall male ones with bright color. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The saddle, stirrups and bridle were made of light and solid materials and gracefully decorated with gold, silver and silk fabrics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Masangjae feats were slightly different according to the times. The main movements in the Ri Dynasty were very colorful. Among them were standing on one's feet, jumping over, standing on head and lying down across on the back of the riding horse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was disseminated to various countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Masangjae players of Korea, along with a mission, visited Japan in 1635 at the repeated requests of Tokugawa Shogunate.
