The total assets of public servants at the level of deputy secretary and above of the current administration are worth of 14 billion US$.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The anti-popular policies the Trump administration pursued openly in one year were, without exception, for the interests of a handful of the rich circles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the U.S., where genuine freedom of the press and expression does not exist, intervention in and crackdown on the press grew more intensified over the past one year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In 2017 the cases of searching and confiscation against journalists accounted for 12 and the cases of violation against them for 11. Moreover, 19 persons in the domestic press circles and four foreign journalists were arrested or detained.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Racial discrimination and misanthropy are serious maladies inherent to the social system of the U.S., and they have been aggravated since Trump took office.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The racial violence that took place in Charlottesville, Virginia, on August 12 is a typical example of the acme of the current administration's policy of racism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the U.S. the absolute majority of the working masses, deprived of elementary rights to survival, are hovering in the abyss of nightmare.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs a result, during the first week of March, 241,000 persons joined the large contingent of the unemployed; in May 9,000 public servants were fired from governmental agencies; in September the number of the unemployed increased by 33,000 as compared to that of the previous month.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In particular, unemployment of young people has become a matter of serious social concern; currently the unemployment rate of young people under 25 is 7.9%, and 31% of graduates from high schools do not have proper jobs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAccording to what the U.S. administration made public, in 2017 the homeless numbered 554,000, about 10% increase as compared to that two years ago, and number of the poor families, living in rented rooms devoid of elementary facilities for living, is on the steady rise.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The soaring school expenses are plunging the students into the hell of loans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThose who are diagnosed with a disease but cannot afford to pay their medical fees total 50 million. Flu, lung diseases and asthma cause 36,000, 40,000 and 150,000 deaths, respectively, on an annual average.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On the other hand, health-hazardous disqualified products are on sale across the country, which often leads to an outbreak of infectious diseases.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is one of the world's two countries that have yet to embrace paid maternity leave.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Over the past decade the proportion of American women who live below the poverty line has risen from 12.1% to 14.5%, and they usually receive 25% less salary than their male colleagues of the same post.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A woman is sexually abused every 89 seconds.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAccording to basic statistics, about 61,100 gun-related crimes took place in the U.S. last year, leaving 15,488 dead and 31,058 wounded.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to data, the number of marijuana users in the U.S. was more than 20 million, a 3% increase as compared with that a decade ago; and over 90 people lose their lives on a daily average from drug abuse.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the U.S. where crimes and evil are rampant, the number of imprisoned criminals tops 2.3 million and 70 million are ex-offenders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., \"guardian of democracy\" and \"human rights champion\", is kicking up the human rights racket but it can never camouflage its true identity as the gross violator of human rights, the white paper said."

Los bienes de los funcionarios superiores al subsecretario de la actual administracion son valorados en 14 mil millones de US$.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante el ano pasado, la administracion Trump practico las politicas antipopulares a favor de la minoria de privilegiados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la sociedad estadounidense no existe la libertad de prensa y de expresion. En particular, en un ano despues de la toma del poder de Trump, se han intensificado mas que nunca la intervencion y la represion sobre la prensa. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el ano 2017, se reportaron 12 incidentes de registro e incautacion y 11 casos de violencia contra los periodistas y fueron detenidos 4 reporteros extranjeros y 19 empleados del circulo de prensa nacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa discriminacion racial y la misantropia se hacen un grave problema del regimen social estadounidense y se agravan mas en el mandato de Trump. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl incidente de uso de violencia por el problema racial, ocurrido el 12 de agosto en una ciudad del Estado de Virginia, es el ejemplo tipico de la politica racista de la actual administracion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tViven en la penuria las abrumadoras masas trabajadoras privadas de los elementales derechos a la subsistencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn una semana de marzo, 241 mil personas perdieron el empleo y en mayo, 9 mil empleados fueron expulsados en masas de los organos gubernamentales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl numero de desempleados en septiembre se incremento 33 mil mas que el mes anterior. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSobre todo, el desempleo de la juventud se presenta como un grave problema social. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora la tasa de desempleo de los jovenes menores a los 25 anos de edad es de 7.9 %. Y el 31% de los graduados de las escuelas superiores vagabundean sin empleo fijo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl numero de los habitantes sin viviendas en 2017 llega a 554 mil con el incremento de 10% en comparacion con el ano 2015. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl mismo tiempo, se aumentan cada dia mas las familias pobres que viven en cuartos alquilados de malas condiciones. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos universitarios languidecen en dificultad con el pago de los gastos escolares, cada dia mas creciente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor falta de dineros, cerca de 50 millones de personas no reciben la asistencia medica y mueren cada ano 36 mil personas por el gripe contagioso, cerca de 40 mil por las enfermedades pulmonares y mas de 150 mil por el asma, respectivamente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos articulos defectuosos, que se venden abiertamente, sirven de la fuente de las epidemias.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. es uno de dos paises del mundo que no aceptan el sistema de licencia retribuida de maternidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante 10 anos ultimos, la proporcion de las mujeres pobres ascendio de 12.1% al 14.5% y el salario de las mujeres es 25% menos que los hombres con igual empleo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA cada 89 segundos, una mujer recibe maltrato sexual.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn 2017 ocurrieron casi 61 mil 100 crimenes de uso de armas, resultando 15 mil 488 muertes y 31 mil 58 lesionados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl numero de los usuarios de marihuana llego a mas de 20 millones, cifra incrementada en 3% al comparar con la de hace 10 anos y por el abuso de drogas, mas de 90 personas perdieron la vida como promedio al dia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos numeros de delincuentes penales y de reincidentes que cumplen la condena llegan a 2 millones 300 mil y 70 millones, respectivamente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor mas que EE.UU. describe a su pais como \"defensor de la democracia\" y \"defensor de DDHH\" y critica la situacion de los \"derechos humanos\" de otros paises, no puede encubrir su naturaleza de caudillo de violacion de DDHH, concluyo la carta blanca."
