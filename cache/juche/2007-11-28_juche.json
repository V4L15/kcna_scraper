He went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Above all, it is necessary to understand that the issue of the peace of Korea is the issue of defusing the military tensions and confrontation and removing the danger of war from A to Z. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also necessary to understand that the solution of the above-said issue is the matter pending a most urgent settlement among all the issues arising in the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is imperative to have a fresh understanding that this issue should be settled as required by the June 15 era of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He clarified the principled stand of the Korean People's Army concerning the military measures for the implementation of the October 4 declaration and proposed the following ways for carrying them out: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n First, the military authorities of both sides should take practical measures to put an end to the hostile relations in the military field and ensure detente and peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Second, they should take practical measures to prevent a war and sincerely honor their commitments to non-aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Third, they should cooperate with each other in the military field so that the top leaders concerned with putting an end to the ceasefire system and building a peace mechanism may declare the end of war as early as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Fourth, they should take measures to provide a military guarantee for north-south cooperation and exchange. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The head of the north side delegation called on the military authorities of both sides to pool efforts in the spirit of \"By our nation itself\", looking far into the future of the nation, and thus make a great contribution to ensuring peace and military detente and improving the overall north-south relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The chief delegate of the south side spoke next. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The talks continue.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It displayed the dignity and mettle of the independent nation, having established external relations with many neighboring countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to historical records, Koguryo had external relations with 24 countries in western and northwestern regions adjacent to it and engaged in brisk diplomatic and trade activities with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is well illustrated by a palace mural of Samarkand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The mural discovered in Samarkand of Uzbekistan in Juche 54 (1965) portrays Koguryo envoys who traveled tens of thousands of ri across the continent and conducted diplomatic activities in the western region (Central Asia). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It depicts a historical fact in the period of about 650-655. Shown there is a scene of the King of a state that reigned over Samarkand receiving twelve envoys from different countries. Among them there are two envoys conspicuous in their apparel and manner. These envoys yellow in skin color are wearing Jolphung (a kind of hat) with two feathers, a long yellow coat, its hem reaching the knees, with black belts tied around their waists and swords with a round tip dangling at their left waist. Each of them is wearing loose trousers and a pair of shoes with pointed toe-caps.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Intensive studies of academic circles have already confirmed that they are none other than Koguryo envoys. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To go to Samarkand from Koguryo, they had to pass through dry deserts, fields and steep mountains extending tens of thousands of ri. Koguryo people used the \"silk road\" peculiar to Koguryo which they pioneered independently without modern means of transportation, instead of the secure \"silk road\" of the earlier days.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan Urged to Lift Sanctions against DPRK  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, November 27 (KCNA) -- It is the stand of the DPRK that Japan may go ahead with sanctions against the DPRK if it likes but it should redress its past crimes without fail because it is not the issue that allows Japan to dodge its solution. It is an urgent demand of the times as its solution brooks not a moment's delay. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says this in its commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries recently decided to extend the sanctions against the DPRK six months including an embargo on the DPRK- flagged ships under the pretext of the abduction issue and they are making desperate efforts to deter the United States from delisting the DPRK as a \"sponsor of terrorism.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's move to do harm to the DPRK by slapping sanctions on it over the abduction issue is as foolish and crazy an act as trying to sweep the sea with a broom. The DPRK will remain unfazed even if Japan may extend the sanctions against it several decades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the issue of the U.S. option to delist the DPRK as a \"sponsor of terrorism\" is concerned, this is the measure that cannot be retracted because of Japan's obstruction as the label is unjust. The desperate frenzy on the part of Japan to check the above-said option would get it nowhere because it is the commitment to be fulfilled by the U.S. on the principle of \"verbal commitment\" and \"action for action\" agreed upon at the six-party talks.  Japan would be well advised to know clearly that its despicable behavior would only bring into spotlight its disgusting colors as a narrow-minded political dwarf. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is something to tell Japan loud and clear as it is going busy visiting its U.S. master, lost to all sense of shame. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has dodged the settlement of its past crimes for more than six decades. There are not a few countries in the world which committed war crimes. But it is only Japan that has played clumsy sleight of hand to cover up so hideous crimes and go without redressing them even in this new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the most urgent historic task for Japan to redeem its past wrongs in the light of the need of the times and in view of the gravity of the crimes perpetrated by the Japanese imperialists in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is a party concerned with the six-party talks aimed at denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. If Japan wishes the talks successful progress, it should not do anything obstructive to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to pay heed to the international public opinion. It would be wise enough for Japan to lift the counter-productive sanctions and honestly apologize for its past crimes and compensate for them just as Germany did and thus behave itself as required by the trend of the times.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a clear proof of the attraction and vitality of the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans should actively turn out in the efforts for national unity, not content with the successes made in the movement for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to achieve the unity of the whole nation it is necessary for the Koreans to actively promote solidarity and alliance and unite close around the organization with the single patriotic desire for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should wage a more dynamic struggle to achieve the unity, steadily giving momentum to the atmosphere of great national unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It presents itself as an urgent issue to boost the solidarity and alliance today when the separatist forces at home and abroad have become all the more undisguised in their anti-reunification moves, concludes the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan Branded as Nuclear Criminal State\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, November 27 (KCNA) -- According to a recently declassified document of the United States, Japan confidentially promised the United States to allow the latter's warships carrying nukes to enter the former's ports or pass through its territorial waters when the talks for the amendment of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty were going on in 1960. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fact goes to prove that Japan has long committed nuclear crimes before it raised the \"three non-nuclear principles\", Minju Joson today says in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Citing data to expose such crimes, the news analyst says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan allowed the United States to store in Japan proper nuclear weapons in the event of contingency and make free nuclear attack from there. In return for such allowance, it got the political support and material aid for turning itself into a military power and realizing its ambition for overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In particular, Japan has pushed ahead with the establishment of plutonium production processes, introduction of nuclear materials, acquisition of technology of manufacturing nukes, development of the means for carrying them and other measures for nuclear armament since it started the development of atomic energy in 1956.  It has already acquired all facilities and conditions needed to turn itself into a nuclear state anytime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, Japan is still now advertising the \"three non-nuclear principles\". The tricky intention of the Japanese reactionaries is to divert elsewhere the attention of the international community to Japan's moves for nuclear armament and revival of militarism under the signboard of the \"three non-nuclear principles\" and rush towards the road of militarist overseas aggression, including the provocation of a nuclear war, behind the curtain of \"peace\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries have ushered the U.S. nuclear warships into Japan in secrecy in a bid to pose nuclear threats to the Korean Peninsula and other parts of Northeast Asia and spark off nuclear arms race in the region. In this way they intend to make a pretext for Japan's nuclear arming and finally turn Japan into the leader of Asia with nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This tells that the Japanese reactionaries are the very ones who seriously wreck and threaten peace and security in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world, the commentary concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Pero, no podemos tolerar la evasion de este pais isleno en la cuestion de la liquidacion del pasado criminal que resulta una demanda impostergable y apremiante de la epoca. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Asi senala el periodico Rodong Sinmun en un comentario individual de este martes y continua: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Recientemente, los reaccionarios japoneses decidieron la prorroga de 6 meses de la sancion contra Corea incluida la prohibicion de la entrada de los barcos coreanos en los puertos japoneses bajo el pretexto del problema del secuestro. Y se esfuerzan desesperadamente por impedir la gestion de Estados Unidos de excluir a Corea en la lista de los \"paises de apoyo al terrorismo\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El intento de Japon de intimidar con la sancion a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea es ingenuo y absurdo. No nos asustaremos jamas aun cuando ese pais trate de prorrogar la sancion a decenas de anos. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El que EE.UU. excluya a la RPDC en la citada lista es una cuestion que se presento segun el principio de \"palabra vs. palabra\" y \"accion vs. accion\" acordado en las conversaciones a 6 bandas. Por tanto, el acto desesperado de Japon de impedirlo no surtira efecto sino pondra mas de relieve su abominable fisonomia de \"enano politico\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Antes todo, Japon debe liquidar su pasado criminal en vez de danar su honra adulando a su amo norteamericano. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ya pasaron mas de 60 anos desde el fin de la Segunda Guerra Mundial y en el mundo hay no pocos paises que cometieron crimenes de guerra. Pero, solo Japon se vale de todos los medios para evitar la liquidacion del pasado criminal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Tanto a la luz de la demanda de la epoca como en vista de la gravedad de los crimenes de los imperialistas japoneses la liquidacion del pasado deviene la tarea historica impostergable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Japon es un pais que forma parte de las conversaciones a 6 partes para la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana. Si desea la marcha exitosa de esta cita, debe abstenerse de los actos que la obstruyen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Japon debe prestar oidos a la opinion publica de la sociedad internacional. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Tambien debe levantar la sancion inutil y actuar con prudencia conforme a la corriente de la epoca que hace sincera disculpa e indemnizacion por sus crimenes del pasado como lo hizo Alemania.       \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
