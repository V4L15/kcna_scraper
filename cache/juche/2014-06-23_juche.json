However, Japan went the lengths of announcing the report on the \"results of review\" recently. This was a clear revelation of Japan's wrong view on history. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sexual slavery enforced by the Japanese imperialists was a hideous crime against humanity unprecedented in history and it, therefore, can hardly be written off no matter how persistently Japan may deny it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese imperialists forcibly drafted, lured and abducted 200 000 Korean women and many women of different other countries as sexual slaves to gratify the carnal desire of their soldiers. This crime was unprecedented in the war history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The gravity of the sexual slavery was that it was committed by the Japanese military in an organized manner with the government involved. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese imperialists regarded it as one of the important jobs of the military authorities to provide soldiers with \"sexual comfort\" as a measure for raising the combat spirit of the aggressors and set up even a department for handling the issue after igniting the Pacific War. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a result, a \"comfort station\" management system was established from the upper echelon to the lowest units of the Imperial Japanese Army and sexual slavery was enforced by it under its unified control and supervision.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the Sino-Japan War dragged on and areas under the Japanese troops' occupation expanded, the Japanese military saw to it that all the problems related to the sexual slavery were settled under its direction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese military directly provided the units stationed in the relevant areas with funds necessary for drafting and transporting sexual slaves and their passage and transport to the areas concerned were directly arranged by it or conducted under its supervision. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During the Pacific War the head of the Japanese government concurrently held the post of \"supreme commander of the armed forces.\" This was undeniable evidence proving that the government was directly involved in the above-said sexual slavery. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This being a hard fact, Japan is persistently distorting and denying the sexual slavery. But this will only invite international isolation and political frustration. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t International public had already warned Japan that its moves to deny the Kono statement would bring self-destruction to Japan, holding that its act of tearing off the pages of the blood-stained history would not help write off the evils perpetrated by it in the past. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the present Japanese government fails to rectify its wrongdoings in the past, the responsibility for them will rest with the next generation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan should face up to the trend of the times and stop at once the moves to distort and deny the Kono statement."

Explicitly speaking, what he uttered was so clear that it left no reason for any misunderstanding.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Mun Chang Guk is a wicked traitor who had already completely betrayed the soul and spirit of Korea and pro-Japanese lackey putting Ri Wan Yong, one of the five traitors of 1905, into the shade.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Mun's desperate bid to disguise himself as a member of the nation after throwing away his mask as a pro-Japanese element is another insult to the Korean nation and an unpardonable crime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By origin, Mun is a stupid trickster and like a seasonal bird as he has neither political career nor political philosophy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He is no more than a servant of those in power and hack writer who has an inveterate habit of kowtowing to the conservative forces to make his ends meet, to say nothing of the qualifications as a media man.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At a forum entitled \"For regime change\" during the \"presidential election\" in 2007 he called on the \"Grand National Party\" (GNP) to focus efforts on the seizure of power rather than on the selection of candidate, grumbling that the GNP is keen on this selection though  \"President\" Roh Moo Hyun interferes in the election. When Lee Myung Bak was set to come to power, Mun pointed an accusing finger at Park Geun Hye who was the former representative of the GNP before any others.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But when Park was elected \"president\" in 2011, Mun made a U turn in his behavior and lavished his praises on the \"yusin princess,\" trumpeting that the God appeared in the history like a defending angel in a fairy tale to protect south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  In order to please Park, Mun held the post of director of the Memorial Council for Park Chung-Hee when Kim Ki Chun, presidential chief of staff of Chongwadae, who is called de facto vice-president, was acting the first managing director of the council.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He is a political imbecile and bete noire having neither elementary reason nor faith as he has no principle in his behavior.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is hard to predict what a deplorable political position the tight-cornered Park Geun Hye group will find itself when Mun is given the post of the puppet prime minister."
