It goes on:\r\n The period of the \"Arduous March\", the forced march, was a proud one in which the army and people of the DPRK highly displayed revolutionary optimism, rallied close around leader Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their revolutionary optimism and conviction of victory represent the revolutionary optimism peculiar to the revolutionary people who absolutely trust and follow their leader and share their destiny with him in any adversity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their revolutionary optimism is based on intense loyalty to Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such loyalty to him serves as an ideological and moral source of enabling the army and people to staunchly fight with confidence and optimism without any hesitation and vacillation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the unshakable faith of the army and people in the DPRK that the road Kim Jong Il indicates is quite right and that there is nothing impossible if they follow it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  They have set an example of revolutionary and noble cultured practices in life in the Songun era with persevering efforts even under the present difficult conditions and spruced up their native places, villages and work sites to lead an optimistic life. They could do so because they are full confident of the justice and invincibility of the socialist cause. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary optimism of the army and people in the DPRK is based on the true outlook on life that one should not live for today but for tomorrow. The revolutionary optimism that an arduous long march is bound to bring happiness is their unshakable revolutionary will. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The drive to build a great prosperous powerful nation will be crowned with shining success thanks to the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il and the army and people of the DPRK struggling with revolutionary optimism.       \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

This diametrically runs counter to the basic spirit of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration in which both the north and the south committed themselves to achieve national reunification independently by the concerted efforts of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Asian Regional Committee to Support Korea's Reunification and the All India Indo-Korean Friendship Association assert that the south Korean authorities, if they have a will to achieve national reunification in the spirit of the declaration, must terminate the political and military confrontation and ease tensions between the north and the south and remove all barriers standing in the way of reunification such as the concrete wall without delay. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement strongly demanded the U.S. stop egging the south Korean authorities on to the confrontation with the DPRK and withdraw their aggressor troops and lethal weapons from south Korea without delay.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They are strong in sense of obligation and viability and noble in traits. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Typical of them is Kim Jong Suk, who was born there in 1917.\r\n She had been loved by villagers as \"little daughter of the Hoeryong House\" and \"girl of the Hoeryong House\" for her tender-heartedness and uprightness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Her lofty spiritual world can be seen in many anecdotes including stories that she guarded President Kim Il Sung at the risk of life in battles during the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The beauty of Hoeryong women has become all the more famous for her distinguished features, virtues and intelligence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n White apricot began to be cultivated in the Obong area of Hoeryong in the early period of Ri Dynasty. It bursts into bloom in May and bears fruit in summer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Suk, who lived in Hoeryong for only five years, missed white apricot so much and, with the hope that the tree would be in full bloom throughout the country, devotedly fought to bring up the day.\r\n Her desire was realized by President Kim Il Sung. White apricot can be seen in any part of the country now. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hoeryong earthenware of different blue-grey colors and unique shapes with kaolin as the main material are also renowned in view of both the features of folk handicraft and virtual utility. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Suk visited a pottery in Kyongsong in around September Juche 36 (1947) and encouraged its workers to make quality and useful earthenware for people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the meticulous guidance of Kim Jong Il Hoeryong earthenware have enjoyed greater popularity in the country.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
