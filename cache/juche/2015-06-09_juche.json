This fact has touched off great indignation at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t Stuxnet used by the U.S. is known as the most fatal cyber attack means in history and a malignant virus that was used by the U.S. and Israel in destroying more than 1 000 centrifuges of the uranium enrichment establishment in Natanz, Iran in 2010.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says the recent disclosure of the U.S. cyber attack on the DPRK clearly proves how hell-bent the former is on neutralizing the latter's nuclear facilities with cyber terror.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is indeed the most vicious destroyer of the cyber space and the chieftain of the cyber terror in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It now finds itself in an embarrassing situation, being unable to stifle the DPRK with the political, economic and military pressure and being at wit's end with the \"human rights\" campaign not offering any way-out.

Korean Chief Executive's Remarks against DPRK Censured\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- Park Geun Hye, addressing a meeting on June 6, talked about \"threat\" and \"abandonment of nuclear weapons\", while slandering once again the DPRK's step for bolstering up the capabilities for self-defense. She was so impudent as to let loose a spate of rubbish that the north should opt for \"dialogue and cooperation\" and she hoped the north would take the \"road of co-prosperity\".\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on this, papers here Tuesday term her remarks stinging outpourings reeking of extreme repugnancy and confrontation with follow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet chief executive's words and deeds over the past two years and her present-day acts indicate that she has regarded the DPRK as the target of confrontation and war, not as the fellow countrymen with whom to achieve reconciliation and unity, when approaching the north-south relations, Rodong Sinmun says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No one in the world will regard the shells fired by the puppet forces almost every day in the hotspot areas in the West Sea and the areas along the Military Demarcation Line as fireworks for reconciliation because they are serious threats to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park's rhetoric about \"abandonment of nuclear weapons\" is an open denial of the line and social system of the DPRK and a grave politically-motivated provocation against it. The DPRK's deterrence for self-defense with nuclear force as its pivot serves as the treasured sword guaranteeing the sovereignty and dignity of the country and the co-prosperity of the nation and it is not a bargaining chip which the DPRK can give up under pressure nor it is the one from which it hopes to get any reward.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson says: Park is malignantly slandering the DPRK's line on simultaneously developing the two fronts and its step for bolstering up the capabilities for self-defense, a revelation of her sinister intention to realize her ambition for \"unification through absorption\" with the backing of the U.S."
