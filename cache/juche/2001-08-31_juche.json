They became a batch of folksongs while being popular among the people.\r\n Those songs are diverse in theme and musical representation, but most of them are based on melancholy mood--sadness, wrath and complaint. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, \"Arirang for great prosperity\" is totally different in tone from the past gloomy \"Arirang\" songs. It is an advanced folksong arousing very rosy, optimistic and forward-looking sentiment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This song is easy for everyone to sing as it has popular, intensive and simple stanzas best suited to characteristics of folksong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As an Arirang in the army-first era written by the army and composed by the people, it truthfully represents the real picture of the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"
