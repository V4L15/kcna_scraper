For imperialism aggression and plunder are means of its existence. Its aggressive nature and bestiality can never change. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We must not forget even a moment that there always exist the class enemies who are working hard to destroy the socialist system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There are those who are opposed to the socialist system, those introducing the corrupt bourgeois way of life into society,  taken in by the imperialists' anti-socialist propaganda, those abandoning the socialist principle for money and those divulging state secrets for money and others who try hard to undermine socialism. All of them are the class enemies of socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The moves of the class enemies to disseminate unsound ideas into socialist society must be thoroughly frustrated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is necessary to solidly consolidate the socialist class base, strengthen the cohesion and unity of the revolutionary ranks and more firmly build up the armed forces of the class and the revolution, the article notes, urging the people not to be tricked by the talk about the super-class \"human rights\" and \"humanitarianism.\" \r\n\r\n"

Korea to act with discretion \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 18 (KCNA) -- The United States and the South Korean authorities are persisting in their anti-DPRK diatribe, paying lip-service to \"reconciliation and cooperation\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   For example, the South Korean authorities held the \"1st international meeting on the issues of human rights and refugees in North Korea\" in Seoul recently according to the script worked out by the United States,  despite the DPRK's warnings. The riff-raffs invited to the meeting were instructed to let loose a spate of piffles defaming the DPRK's social and political system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They were, in fact, dishonest scholars, hack writers and others bribed by the South Korean authorities to read papers full of lies about \"human rights\" in the north. This only goes to prove that \"reconciliation and cooperation\" which they tout whenever an opportunity presents itself are nothing but hypocrisy intended to cover up their anti-north confrontation policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   No one paid attention to the meeting for this \"human rights\" burlesque was staged in South Korea, a graveyard of human rights and a colony of the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   The United States and the South Korean authorities co-orchestrated this foolish farce in a political bid to divert elsewhere the world public criticism of the disclosed many human rights abuses in South Korea, including killings of civilians  in Rogun-ri and tone down the people's strong demands for the abolition of the \"security law\" and thus cover up the serious violation of human rights and freedom in South Korea. But this only invited derision from the world people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What merits a serious attention is that this anti-DPRK smear campaign was staged at the tacit connivance of the United States. This is an indication that the U.S. design to isolate and stifle the DPRK remains unchanged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States is talking about the DPRK-U.S. dialogue and improved relations  with it but has not made any switchover in its hostile policy towards the DPRK. It used the \"nuclear issue\", \"missile issue\" as a pretext to stifle the DPRK. It is now trying to use \"human rights issue\" to this end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This compels us to heighten our vigilance against its design. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the United States continues pursuing its anti-DPRK  hostile policy in contravention of the spirit of the DPRK-u.s. Agreed framework, the improvement of the DPRK-U.S. relations will not come true. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States and the South Korean authorities should ponder over the gravity of the situation and act with discretion. \r\n\r\n"
