This brings into bolder relief the aggressive and dangerous nature of the exercises. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. claim that the projected exercises are \"annual events\" and \"commanding post exercises\" is no more than sophism intended to cover up their criminal and dangerous nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now is the time for both dialogue partners to respect each other and build the relations of confidence.  The reality today when the six-party talks for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula are under way and the September 19 statement and the February 13 agreement are in the process of implementation requires one to refrain from any acts that may becloud the atmosphere of dialogue and peace and strain the situation. The above-said exercises diametrically run counter to this requirement and may create a complicated situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. double-dealing behavior of whetting the sword to invade the DPRK and leveling guns at the dialogue partner behind the scene while talking about \"dialogue\", \"peace\" and \"stability in the region\" will not be of any help to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and detente on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But the recent discovery shows that the walls of Pyongyang which had been constructed in the period of Koguryo were reinforced firmly during Koryo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historians also found out stone installations erected with trimmed quadrangular pyramid-shaped stones on the foundation of the wall. They thrust out 30 centimeters than the wall. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The three-storied stone installation consists of four quadrangular pyramid-shaped stones, two being laid abreast at the bottom and one laid on each floor. Its height is about 60 centimeters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The installation on the castle wall foundation is the first of its kind in the history of castle discovery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The newly unearthed relics are of great academic significance in clarifying the historical position of Pyongyang, a holy land of the Korean nation in a scientific way, solving the issue of the inheritance of Koguryo by Koryo and studying the castle construction technology of Koryo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Recognizing this, the local autonomous bodies of Japan took measures for reducing the fixed property tax on Chongryon-related facilities or exempting them from it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is only natural that Chongryon is placed under the protection of the Japanese government and local autonomous bodies. The Koreans in Japan represented by Chongryon are those who were forcibly taken away by the Japanese imperialists in the past to be subjected to all manner of national humiliation and physical pains and their descendents. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  In the sense of repenting of the past crimes, the Japanese government is under obligation to protect Chongryon and take preferential measures for it and Chongryon is entitled to be provided with preferential and protective measures. Nevertheless, the Japanese authorities are getting hysteric in suppressing and destroying Chongryon. This is a total perfidy to their historical and moral obligations. Moreover, the group of Abe saddled with more moral debts to Chongryon and the DPRK for the ignominious past of his family is rolling up sleeves in the anti-Chongryon and anti-DPRK campaign. This is an anti-human and a gangster-like act which can never be pardoned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In getting overheated in suppressing and attempting to destroy Chongryon, the Japanese authorities seek to divert elsewhere the criticism of the Japanese people focused on them in the current crisis of office. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Abe group would be well advised to give up such suicidal act as sparking off the hatred of the army and people of the DPRK against Japan. Abe himself must be well aware what formidable consequences would be entailed in case the hatred pent up among them against Japan down through history bursts forth. His group must not behave rashly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
