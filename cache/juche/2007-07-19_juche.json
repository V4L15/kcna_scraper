It is also necessary for them to categorically reject the outside forces' interference in the internal affairs of the nation and domination moves. And they should never tolerate the pro-U.S. sycophantic traitors cooperating with the outside forces while attaching greater importance to the outsiders than to the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The struggle to defend peace is the just patriotic struggle to ease the tension and remove the danger of a war on the Korean Peninsula and thus create peaceful environment for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the fellow countrymen in the north and the south and overseas should turn out as one in the struggle for peace against war and decisively shatter the moves of aggression and war that threaten the Korean nation and harass peace on this land so as to defend the dignity and destiny of the nation. They should put the earliest possible end to the U.S. forces' continued presence in south Korea aimed at domination and aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The struggle to achieve national unity represents the one to build the driving force for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the reunification movement organizations and Koreans from all walks of life in the north and the south and overseas should consolidate the unity with the June 15 All-Korean Committee, a nationwide organization for reunification movement, as a centre and steadily boost solidarity and alliance through the movement for reunification. The south Korean people should work harder to ostracize the reactionary conservative forces including the Grand National Party of south Korea who are making desperate efforts to reverse the June 15 reunification era to the era of confrontation in the past, flatly denying the idea of \"By our nation itself.\"    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Even now it is giving added spurs to the development of nukes while ceaselessly introducing nuclear war tools of the latest type, behind the curtain of its idle chatter about the settlement of the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula. And it continues presenting nuclear threats to the DPRK, shipping into south Korea ultra-modern nuclear war tools and staging massive war exercises. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the historical facts clearly show that a solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula entirely depends on the switchover of the U.S. policy towards the DPRK. In other words, the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula will be totally settled only when the U.S. gives up its hostile policy towards the DPRK and pulls all its nuclear war tools out of south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the September 19 joint statement of the six-party talks the U.S. gave assurances that it had no nuclear weapons in south Korea and had no intention to attack or invade the DPRK with nukes or conventional weapons. So it should fully convince others by a verifiable method. Without this, it is shameless and ridiculous of it to spin out trash about someone's \"threat\" and mumble about the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It was a deployment for defense, not for offensive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Robert, head of the U.S. military advisory group in south Korea, told the pressmen toward the end of May 1950 that now there was no sign of the buildup of the north Korean army along the 38th parallel, according to the U.S. publication \"U.S. and Korean War\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Early in May 1950 the then U.S. Ambassador in Seoul reported his country that there was scarcely any possibility of north Korea invading south Korea in the near future and Dulles, the warmonger, testified that he could not find any possibility of \"southward invasion\" from north Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even the U.S. intelligence bosses could not get a clue as to confirm \"southward invasion\" and the military inspection team of the \"UN Commission on Korea\" testified that it had not gotten any information on the \"aggressive design\" of north Korea.\r\n On the contrary, the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean bellicose elements were making full preparations in south Korea to invade the northern half of Korea in those days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n MacArthur testified at a hearing of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee in May 1951: The south Korean army has put its supplies and equipment in areas not far from the 38th parallel. They did not build positions deep inside. The whole area from the 38th parallel to Seoul was a logistic base. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The then intelligence director of the command of the U.S. forces in the Far East confessed that the greater part of the Syngman Rhee army were actually deployed already along the 38th parallel when the outbreak of the war was at hand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A staff officer of the above-said command, when he was a member of the U.S. military advisory group in Iran, told Iranian staff officers the Korean war was started by the south Korean army on the direct order of the U.S. command in Japan, according to the December 22, 1950 issue of the Indian paper \"Cross Road.\"    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
