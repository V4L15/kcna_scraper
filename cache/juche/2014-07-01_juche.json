            "content": "Kim Jong Un Inspects Hwa Islet Defence Detachment of KPA\r\n Pyongyang, July 1 (KCNA) -- Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and first chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK, inspected the Hwa Islet Defence Detachment standing guard over a forward post off the East Coast of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t He first went round the monument to the field guidance given by leader Kim Jong Il erected to hand down forever the immortal exploits he performed by inspecting the islet defence detachment in October 1999.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recalling that President Kim Il Sung gave dozens of precious instructions as regards the islet defence detachment and Kim Jong Il always paid deep attention to it, Kim Jong Un underscored the need to glorify their exploits performed in commanding the army with the shining achievements in rounding off the combat preparations and bolstering up combat capabilities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching the woodland on the islet and fruit trees of various species around the barracks, he said: \"The islet is full of trees. It's better to call the islet Song Islet instead of Hwa Islet as pine trees have formed thick verdure\". He highly praised the detachment for having turned the islet into a thick woodland and greenery and orchard as intended by the party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then he mounted the observation post and heard a report on the combat mission of the defense detachment from the commanding officers, examining in detail the defense plan of the detachment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Underscoring the need to wipe out the enemies coming in attack from the sea to the last man, he indicated new and unique war methods to be applied by the Hwa Islet Defence Detachment for rounding off its combat readiness such as the deployment of strike means and the effective use of the firing positions as required by the modern warfare. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"The Hwa Islet Defence Detachment is an advance base in the defence theatre of KPA Large Combined Unit 324 and an outpost in the East Sea guarding the gateway to the Party Central Committee,\" he noted, adding: \"It is an important task of the defence detachment to turn the islet into an impregnable fortress, unsinkable warship and the present-day Wolmi island.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He instructed the commanding officers to intensify the politico-ideological education among the service personnel to train them as phoenixes, underlining the need to make military training, in particular, part of their life and habit and thus build a-match-for-a hundred combat capabilities so that they may send all the enemies intruding into the territorial waters of the DPRK to the bottom of the sea once a battle starts. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He gave the defence detachment an order to conduct a sudden artillery firing and guided the drill.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He issued an order to open fire, watching with deep attention the artillery men in firepower service through a pair of binoculars.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The artillery pieces roared and shells accurately hit the targets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His face beaming with a broad smile, he said: \"They are very good at firing. All of them are crack shots and the commander of the defence detachment has successfully commanded the firing\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that the artillery men could hit all targets as they have undergone intensive training, bearing deep in mind the call of the party for waging a dynamic movement for becoming crack shots. He named the Fifth Company of the defence detachment which conducted the firing drill \"Crack Shots Company\" and extended the thanks of the KPA supreme commander to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round the soldiers' bed room, room for education, wash-cum-bath room, mess hall and stores of the Third Company of the defence detachment to take warm care of their living.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that it is very gratifying to hear that the defence detachment serves every service person with more than 360g of soy-based food every day and each mess hall of the companies is providing the service personnel with fish and with sumptuous meals by raising lots of domestic animals such as pigs, ducks and geese.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He noted that the companies of the defence detachment are like homes dear to the soldiers and the detachment is like their native village as it provides them with sumptuous meals and warm beds.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Praising the Hwa Islet Defence Detachment for most thoroughly carrying out the party's military  policy like the Ryo Islet Defence Detachment, he called on it to make a high-pitched drive for developing stockbreeding, fishery and soybean farming to turn itself into a more  proud and richer detachment in the future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He gave a pair of binoculars and an automatic rifle to the Third Company as gifts before having a photo taken with the service personnel of the Hwa Islet Defence Detachment and their families, expressing expectation and belief that the service personnel would remain true to the party's Songun revolutionary leadership.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by KPA Vice Marshal Hwang Pyong So, director of the General Political Bureau of the KPA, and Army Col. Gen. Pak Jong Chon, vice-chief of the KPA General Staff."

Stratemeyer, the then commander of the U.S. Air Forces in the Far East, south Korea's Yonhap News and other media recently disclosed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to the diary, an operational office of the Department of the U.S. Army began in September 1950 to examine the tactical use of A-bombs in close-support operation. In December that year, Dr. Ellis Johns of the office was dispatched to the Korean Front to study the nuclear use in action.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t U.S. President Truman told reporters in November 1950 that the U.S. had always kept the using of A-bomb under review, while MacArthur, commander of the U.S. forces in the Far East, declared in December that they would drop 30 to 50 A-bombs in Korea-China border area.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Declassified documents of the U.S. Army show that the U.S. nuclear weapon was deployed in the Korean Front in mid-August 1950 for the first time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the facts go to prove that the U.S. is an enemy of the Korean nation and the global peace as it directly spawned the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula from 60-odd years ago."
