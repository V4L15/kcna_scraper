He declared this year as a \"year of war\" on the plea of \"combating terrorism\" and is keen to impose a holocaust of nuclear war upon the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The manoeuvres involving armed forces and combat equipment quite enough to carry out a war are a product of a criminal intention of the u.s. to provoke an actual war when an opportunity presents itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a daydream for the U.S. warmongers to try to seize the DPRK by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the revolutionary spirit of the people's army and people of the DPRK to react to their hard line with the toughest stand and return fire for fire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. imperialist warmongers and their followers dare unleash a war of aggression against the DPRK, they will face only self-destruction.    \r\n\r\n"

The right of action impudently asserted by the U.S. is not its monopoly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the U.S. openly poses a nuclear threat to the DPRK the latter is left with no option but to take a substantial countermeasure to cope with it. It is its well-deserved right to self-defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to stop running amuck. This will do the U.S. good.     \r\n\r\n"

The U.S. described the nuclear weapons as a means to prevent someone's \"attack\" and \"threat\" in a bid to justify its moves for increasing nuclear combat power and practising nuclear strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has long attempted to unleash a nuclear war that may impose a nuclear holocaust upon humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The first a-bomb test of the U.S. was designed by war-thirsty Roosevelt. The a-bomb test was carried out by Truman who put spurs to the researches and manufacture of the a-bombs. And the first a-bombs were dropped over the heads of the Japanese people and the test of tactical nuclear weapons to be used in the Korean War was stepped up. Eisenhower hatched 22 plots to use atomic weapons against the DPRK and other socialist countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Later, Reagan put forward a \"strategic defense program,\" \"star wars\" to militarize space. And former U.S. President Bush advanced \"shining stones,\" a variety of \"star wars,\" which is followed by its another variety, the missile defense system. Such facts prove that the U.S. is pushing ahead with its nuclear strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With the establishment of the MD the present U.S. President, Bush, is trying to stand nuclear advantage over other countries, thus realizing the purpose of aggression which was not achieved by his preceding U.S. presidents. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The plan of nuclear attack was designed and released by Bush, prompted by such a wild ambition.    \r\n\r\n"
