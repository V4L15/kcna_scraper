Korean authorities hit for their mendicancy\r\n Pyongyang, December 28 (KCNA) -- The South Korean authorities are persistently trying to convince the U.S. military of the \"threat of attack\" by the DPRK, while begging for the permanent military presence of the U.S., \"establishment of joint defence posture\" and \"cooperation system\".\r\n   Their begging is the revelation of their criminal intention to put spurs on war preparations against North Korea in league with outsiders under the pretext of the fictitious \"threat of southward invasion\", says Rodong Sinmun in a commentary today.\r\n   The news analyst says:\r\n   They are bringing forth the already worn-out parcel of \"threat of southward invasion\" again for the purpose of calming down public demand for the U.S. troop pullout and justifying the permanent presence of the aggression forces in South Korea.\r\n   They are also begging \"establishment of joint defense posture\" and \"cooperation system\" of the U.S. master in a bid to provoke a war against North Korea with the backing of outside forces.\r\n   We treasure peace, and do not know mercy to the provokers.\r\n   The U.S. military should be mindful that if they continue encouraging the colonial puppets in their waning days to war, they will not go scotfree.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
