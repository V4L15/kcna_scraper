Its keynote is to beef up its military forces in the Asia-Pacific region, the Korean Peninsula in particular, following cutting the number of its forces in the Mid-east and Europe.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In other word, it is intended to realize the efficiency and active mobilization of its armed forces on the premise that a new war is unleashed in the Korean peninsula following the Mid-east.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. authorities have already made it an established fact to start another war in the Korean peninsular. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis can be illustrated by recent remarks of the present U.S. chief executive and defense secretary.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As part of executing their purpose, they plan to stage the largest-ever joint military exercises such as Key Resolve, Ssangryong and Foal Eagle after massively introducing the U.S. ultramodern military hardware into south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This goes to prove that the final purpose of the above-said joint plan is to launch a large-scale military action on the Korean Peninsula, that is, a new war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Worse still, the south Korean regime is ready to mobilize all its political, military and economic means and forces as cannon fodder for the U.S. forces and an igniter of new war any moment because it pursues a thoroughgoing U.S.-toeing policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This provides the U.S. with all conditions and possibility enough to ignite another Korean war unlike in Mid-east.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAny trifling provocative act will lead to an all-out nuclear war, regional war and finally a new world war in the Korean Peninsula because it is the largest arsenal of nukes and other weapons in the world and there is no durable system and guarantee to avert any war in the peninsula. Accordingly, there is no need to mention a local warfare on the Korean Peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. would be well advised to ponder over the serious consequences to be entailed by their war provocation moves."

Meanwhile, they forced the royal government to promulgate an \"order banning entrance of the royal palace\" aimed at blocking \"free access to the palace\" as a royal ordinance and made sure that the Japanese police took charge of \"guard\" over the royal palace and the king. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese Cabinet decided on the \"guidelines for dealing with Korea\" aimed at wresting the right of home administration and dethroning Kojong on July 10, 1907. The Japanese imperialists staged a \"ceremony of transferring power to crown prince Sunjong on July 20. They fabricated the \"Jongmi Seven-Point Treaty\" on July 24, completely depriving Korea of the right of home administration. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They thus deprived Korea of her right to administer foreign affairs, full command of armed forces, judicial power and police power through the \"Ulsa Five-Point Treaty\" and the \"Jongmi Seven-Point Treaty\". On August 22, 1910, they cooked up the \"Korea-Japan Annexation Treaty,\" turning Korea into a complete colony of Japan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They cooked up a \"memorandum on entrusting judicature and administration of prisons in Korea to Japan\" in July 1909, arresting, imprisoning and killing participants in the anti-Japanese independence movement en masse. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the wake of instituting \"rules for security\" by order of \"Residency-General\" No. 10, they forced the pro-Japanese puppet government to enact a \"law on newspapers,\" depriving Koreans of the freedom of speech and press and harshly suppressing the anti-Japanese patriotic newspapers. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the signboard of \"promotion of welfare\" they cooked up a \"law on mining minerals\" in June 1906 whereby they massively plundered Korea of gold, silver, copper and coal, etc. In November of 1908 they cooked up the \"Korea-Japan fishery agreement,\" robbing Korea of all her marine resources. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In December of 1908 they set up the ill-famed Oriental Development Company, plundering Korea of her land as they pleased. And in October of 1909, they set up \"Bank of Korea,\" etc., putting the financial field of Korea under their control and totally blocking the development of national capital. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hirobumi Ito, who was the first \"resident-general,\" saw to it that a \"museum\" was built under the pretext of \"protecting\" cultural treasures. He made sure that precious cultural treasures of Korea were massively shipped to Japan under various names. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In August of 1906 the Japanese imperialists promulgated the \"law on common schools,\" forcing colonial slave education on Korea. And in 1908 they instituted the \"law on private schools,\" forcing patriotic and anti-Japanese private schools to close. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They fabricated more than 60 \"laws\" and \"royal ordinances\" for two months from Nov. 18, 1907 to Jan. 18, 1908 for the purpose of strengthening their rule. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They committed too many crimes under the above-said rule to count. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the Japanese authorities are distorting the crime-woven history, claiming the Japanese imperialists started enforcing their colonial rule over Korea only after 1910. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is absolutely intolerable as it is a move to write off the period of their \"resident-general\" rule enforced before the period of the colonial rule by the governor-general of the Japanese imperialists in their history. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hearts of the service personnel and people of the DPRK are burning with towering anger and hatred for Japan as it has shunned the settlement of its past crimes, totally denying and distorting them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will unfailingly settle accounts with Japan, the sworn enemy of the Korean nation, and force it to pay a thousand-fold dearer price for the blood shed by the Koreans."

Korea, Japan and West about DPRK\r\n Beijing, January 31 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Defence dismissed the misinformation released by south Korean and Japanese media that the Chinese army is likely to advance into Korea in case of \"contingency\" on the Korean Peninsula, according to the Chinese Defense Daily on Tuesday.\n\t\t\t\t\t The Chinese Defense Ministry not only categorically denied the misinformation spread by media of Japan, south Korea, etc. about possible dispatch of Chinese troops to Korea but criticized it in strong terms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The spokesman said it is \"absolutely impossible\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Chinese military experts also said the report is baseless and absurd as Chinese troops' advance into Korea is impossible, the paper said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is clear that some foreign media sought an ulterior purpose when guessing the attitude of the Chinese army toward the \"contingency\" in Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not a few American experts assert the U.S., Japan and south Korea have limited ability to deal with the issue of the Korean Peninsula and no other country can replace China's role, while expressing hope that the Chinese side would play a more positive role in this regard.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As China does not keep step with the U.S., Japan and south Korea in concrete actions and measures, some foreign media talked a lot about this with their own calculations whenever an opportunity presented itself and even falsified and groundlessly slang mud at the former. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This can be illustrated by the misinformation that the situation on the DPRK border with China got strained and Chinese troops advanced into the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Worse still, some foreign media reported that there was a gunfight in an area along the above-said border, a plan for Sino-DPRK military drill was frustrated, China refused to sell its advanced  fighters to the DPRK in a bid to create differences between the two countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their ulterior intention is to sow the seeds of discord in the relations between the two countries and cause troubles between them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The aim of this misinformation is crystal clear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Firstly, it is aimed to tarnish China's policy towards the Korean Peninsula and, taking advantage of it, criticize the present policy of China and pressurize it to keep pace with the U.S. and Japan and south Korea in the end.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Secondly, it is to serve the purposes of their domestic policies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For example, most of Japanese media keen to spread the rumor on Chinese troops' \"advance into the DPRK\" are supported by ultra-right forces of Japan. The purpose of their rumors is obviously to weaken the influence of China on the Asia-Pacific region and increase their military expenditure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korean media floated such misinformation in an effort to spy on China's policy line.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Huan Qiu Shibao published by the People's Daily on Jan. 30 exposed the falsity of the report about the \"advance of CPLA into Pyongyang\" spread by south Korean conservative media."

Todos saben que los ejercicios militares conjuntos \"Key Resolve\" y \"Foal Eagle\",  agudizaban la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La banda traidora de Lee habla tanto del \"dialogo\", pero practicamente, trata de provocar la guerra de agresion a la RPDC.

Pero nunca podran realizarla\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La inmutable posicion revolucionaria de la RPDC es responder con el despiadado golpe de represalia a la provocacion de los agresores. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Las autoridades de EE.UU. y del Sur de Corea deben actuar con prudencia."
