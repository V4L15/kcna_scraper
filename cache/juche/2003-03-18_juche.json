Koreans socialism is the life and soul and happiness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people is in the heart of the leader and the hearts of the people are filled with the worship and longing for him and intention to share their destiny with him. The monolithic unity of the leader and people is more powerful than any nuclear weapon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The system of the DPRK has strong ideological, political, economic and military capability and the people live on their own. That is why the DPRK does not seek to get favor from anyone by threatening him. Particularly, it never feels the need to get the security of its system guaranteed. All its proposals and measures are for self-defensive and peaceful purposes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThey are aimed at settling the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and preventing a war in the peninsula, not getting anything. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the U.S. keen to stifle the DPRK the greatest tragedy is that it knows too little about the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should have a good understanding of its rival, stop spreading wild rumors and give up its policy of isolating and stifling the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA refutes Powell's remarks on religious freedom \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 17 (KCNA) -- U.S. Secretary of State Powell on March 5 listed six countries such as the DPRK, China, Iran, Iraq, Myanmar and Sudan as \"countries arousing special concern\" because of their suppression of religious freedom. \r\nRecalling that those countries were also listed as such last year, he claimed that \"religious freedom has not improved in the countries since then\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As an expression of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK his assertion is nothing but sophism intended to invent a pretext for impairing the image of its system and stifle and isolate it at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As stipulated in the DPRK's socialist constitution a citizen's religious freedom is fully guaranteed by law and even American religious leaders recognized it while witnessing the reality of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is only the United States that made religion a plaything of politics and is suppressing true freedom of religious belief. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are too many to cite as examples. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Before the liberation of Korea American missionaries made their way to Korea to engage themselves in espionage and plot-breeding and seek their own interests, while deceiving its people. During the Korean War the U.S. bombers indiscriminately destroyed even religious buildings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The suppression of other nations and their religion got more serious in the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is widely known to the world that since the \"September 11 Incident\" not only foreigners but citizens of the United States have become targets of constant watch and suppression by fib and other intelligence and investigation institutions for the mere reason that they are Arabs and Muslims. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Self-styled scholars are openly spreading wrong assertions aimed at fanning up confrontation and conflicts between nations and religions under the signboard of \"clash between diverse forms of civilization\" and wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are described as \"crusade\" and \"holy wars\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the reality of the U.S.  The United States has the poorest human rights record. It is, therefore, ridiculous and shameless for the U.S. to meddle in internal affairs of other countries over the religious issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is well advised to mind its own business instead of pulling up other countries over \"religious freedom\" only to meet their rebuff.    \r\n\r\n"

Such methods will only make the situation more complicated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. loudmouthed \"development of nuclear weapons\" by the DPRK is nothing but a subterfuge to internationalize its moves to pressure and isolate the DPRK and ignite a new war of aggression against it. It is quite senseless and unreasonable for the U.S. to insist that the DPRK poses a \"nuclear threat\" to the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the DPRK to yield to the demand of the U.S. and opt to compromise with it is little short of giving in to the enemies after becoming a \"real criminal\" itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula is a very crucial problem related to who beats whom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It will decide whether the DPRK's sovereignty will be trampled down by the U.S. or protected. It is quite obvious that such issue can not be settled by someone's unilateral pressure or demand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not the stand of settling the nuclear issue for the U.S. to insist on multilateral talks instead of responding to the direct talks with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. call for multilateral talks is aimed to internationalize the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula to evade its responsibility. This is, in fact, little short of refusing to solve the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not multilateral talks but direct talks between the DPRK and the U.S. that serve as a key to settling the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. will not lose its face while responding to the direct talks with the DPRK. on the contrary it will be welcomed by the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to give up its stand to stifle the DPRK and properly approach dialogue and thus fulfil its responsibility as the direct party concerned with the settlement of the nuclear issue on the peninsula.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "GNP's assertion blasted \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 17 (KCNA) -- The Grand National Party and some conservative media of South Korea have recently heaped accusations on the north, claiming its assertion about the issue of \"special inspection\" is \"interference in S. Korea's internal affair\". In this regard, Rodong Sinmun yesterday in a signed commentary dismissed it as a folly of political imbeciles.\r\n The commentary went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of cooperation between the Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee (KAPPC) and Hyundai of South Korea is not the issue confined to the south only. It is the one directly related to reconciliation and cooperation between the north and the south and unity and reunification of the whole Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The cooperation between them is an issue directly related to the interests of the whole nation. Yet, the GNP and some conservative media of South Korea are insisting on \"special inspection\" over the issue of the whole nation, the issue of north-south relations, to stoke confrontation. This can never be an internal issue of South Korea. The above-said cooperation in particular is a very important issue of the whole nation as it is related to the implementation of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration supported and welcomed by the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTherefore, it can not be an affair confined to South Korea only. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe GNP demanded \"special inspection\" over this issue, prompted by its aim to serve its partisan interests and realize its strategy. This is intended to bring the inter-Korean relations back to those in the era of confrontation. Then how can the action taken to disclose such anti-national, anti-reunification behaviour of the party be interpreted as interference in the south's internal affair? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has become more obvious that the north's assertion can never be interference in the south's internal affair now that the GNP linked the issue of \"remittance to the north\" to the historic Pyongyang meeting, which culminated in the publication of the June 15 Joint Declaration. On the contrary, it is interference in the north's internal affair to link the inter-Korean relations to the non-existent issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should call a spade a spade. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP and conservative media of South Korea are well advised to behave themselves, clearly aware what adverse impact their reckless diatribe will have on the inter-Korean relations and how seriously they will affect their fate.    \r\n\r\n"
