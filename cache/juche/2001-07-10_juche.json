Their military nexus is mainly targeted against the DPRK. This is clearly evidenced by the fact that the command system of military operation of the U.S. and Japanese forces has been coordinated and their joint operation plan worked out to cope with \"emergency\" on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and Japanese chief executives  agreed to establish an \"all-inclusive strategy\" and carry out a joint research into TMD in a bid to cope with a sort of \"threat.\" lurking behind this is their intention to have a military edge in the region and step up their aggressive Asian strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Security\" on their lips means \"security measures\" to realise their ambition for aggression in a bid to put the Asian countries under their political and military control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and Japan's loudmouthed \"security\" is little short of their call for aggression.    \r\n\r\n"

Korea \"military cooperation\" slammed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 10 (KCNA) -- Minju Joson today in a signed commentary urges the U.S. conservatives to immediately stop their anti-DPRK \"military cooperation\" with South Korea.\r\n They became more vociferous about the so-called \"military alliance\"  between the United States and South Korea and the strengthened \"military posture to cope with the threat of North Korea\" with the recent U.S. junket of the South Korean minister of defence as a momentum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This clearly shows once again that the u.s. call for the tightened U.S.-South Korea military nexus is aimed to stifle the DPRK at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By floating the story about \"military cooperation\" they seek to support the Bush administration's \"hard-line policy towards the DPRK\" with force and put pressure upon it to wrest a sort of \"political concession\" from it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their \"military cooperation\" aimed to attain something through military \"pressure\" to bear upon the DPRK cannot be construed otherwise than their foolish attempt prompted by a short-sighted way of thinking. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-DPRK \"military cooperation\" between the United States and South Korea is pushing the DPRK-U.S. relations to fresh confrontation, not to \"dialogue\" or \"negotiations,\" and seriously disturbing peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the firm conviction and will of the Korean people and people's army to deal a telling blow to the united states until the root cause of aggression is removed and reliably defend the dignity and sovereignty of the country if it opts to realize its wild ambition at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States should bear in mind that neither U.S. military pressure nor threat can work on the DPRK and it does not allow any slightest concession as far as the issue of defending the country's sovereignty and national dignity is concerned.    \r\n\r\n"
