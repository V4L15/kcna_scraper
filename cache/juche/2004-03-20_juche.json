The drill participated in by at least 8,000 GIs of U.S. marines from Hawaii and Okinawa will reportedly last until April. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On March 12 the command of the 8th U.S. Army announced a plan to pay an allowance to the U.S. soldiers in south Korea as an incentive to lengthen the term of their service there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such serious military moves of the U.S. forces in south Korea suggest that the day of the outbreak of a war is drawing near hour by hour in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has already staged various forms of war maneuvers one after another according to the war scenario based on the doctrine of \"a preemptive attack\" after shipping into south Korea the latest war hardware tested in the Afghan and Iraqi war. Recently, it conducted even a drill of evacuating families of U.S. servicemen and other Americans, something reminiscent of the eve of the last Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has been a usual practice for the U.S. to cite \"threat to security\" and \"defense\" as a pretext for kicking up a war racket but the recent developments have proved this is a sheer lie and the U.S. is chiefly to blame for the crisis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is hell-bent on the moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK politically, militarily and economically behind the curtain of dialogue for the settlement of the nuclear issue between them, working hard to plug Japan and its other allies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is keen to ignite a war against the DPRK, while working hard to bring back to the era of confrontation the inter-Korean relations favorably developing in the direction of national reconciliation, peace and reunification of the country after the publication of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. plans to stage large-scale war exercises through the massive transfer and deployment of its armed forces in its mainland and overseas and the mobilization of all the south Korean forces suggest what a dangerous political and military adventure it is going to make on the Korean peninsula.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Therefore, visits of Japanese politicians to the shrine have been censured as grave criminal moves to revive militarism and lashed all Asian countries into fury. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese politicians who have so far asserted the visit to the shrine and gone there are without an exception the right-wing conservatives who have encouraged the revival of militarism and spearheaded it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The chief executive of Japan has linked visits to the shrine to the \"tradition and religion of Japan.\" But this is not an issue related to the tradition and religion. This is rather a matter related to the Japanese authorities' political tendency and their attitude toward history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bowing to the memorial tablets of war criminals and praying for their soul can not be construed otherwise than a rash act to push ahead with the militarization in a bid to realize the old dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\" which they failed to do in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That was why whenever the chief executives of Japan paid official visits to the shrine in the past they touched off so strong public criticism at home and abroad and spawned serious political and diplomatic problems. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present chief executive of Japan can never evade the responsibility for all the consequences to be entailed by his repeated visit to the shrine and his remarks justifying it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is evidenced by the recent renewed passage of a bill on sanctions against Syria through U.S. Congress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. brigandish nature can be also proved by the fact that it is meddling in the internal affairs of other countries, assessing the \"human rights situation\" there with \"human rights standards\" of its own style and pulling them up over that issue as it pleases. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe U.S. unilateral acts, defiant of even international law, only bring to light its true colours as an international gangster. \r\n It is due to the U.S. brigandish acts that the international arena witnesses the abnormal and complicated situation where justice and progress are trampled underfoot and peace and stability disturbed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Progressive humankind should clearly see through the aggressive and brigandish nature of the U.S. and struggle against it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It created an atmosphere of pressure and dispatched war hawks to south Korea to put repeated pressure on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. coercive demand for troop dispatch clearly reminds one of the second order for troop dispatch to Vietnam and means a forcible requisition order to drive south Korean troops as a shock brigade and mercenaries in its efforts to realize its ambition to build a uni-polar world dominated by it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The additional troop dispatch is a product of the pro-U.S. treacherous acts of the \"Grand National Party\" that took the lead in the U.S. moves for troop dispatch. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ultra-right conservative forces acted more rashly when the prospect of additional troop dispatch was becoming gloomier owing to the protest of the people resolutely defying the U.S. pressure and the submissive acts of the pro-U.S. sycophantic elements. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP's pro-U.S. sycophantic treacherous forces became more desperate in their moves to put into practice the additional troop dispatch at a time when it was censured by the international community and its allies, too, rejected its demand for troop dispatch to Iraq after the disclosure of the fact that the U.S. invaded Iraq on the basis of false information. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The conservative press is fanning up an atmosphere for troop dispatch, spreading a rumor that the number of soldiers wanting to be dispatched to Iraq is increasing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The additional troop dispatch to Iraq fully revealed before the international community the ugly colors of south Korea as a complete colony of the U.S. and its war servant. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the U.S. began to force south Korea to additionally dispatch troops in September last year, the people of all social standings kindled a torch of the all-people struggle against the troop dispatch. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their struggle against the troop dispatch mounted higher, occasioned by Rumsfeld's visit to south Korea aimed to put pressure on it to additionally dispatch troops to Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the pro-U.S. right-wing conservatives passed the \"motion on additional troop dispatch to Iraq\" through the \"National Assembly\" in spite of such opposition and protest of the people, they turned out in a massive struggle with bitterer resentment.\r\n The massive struggle against the additional troop dispatch to Iraq is an eruption of the people's will to defend their interests and not to repeat the tragic destiny at the time of the Vietnamese war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The attack of the anti-U.S. resistance forces on the U.S. troops and the troops of its allies has been further intensified in Iraq since Bush declared the end of the Iraqi war and this resulted in killing 772 GIs and wounding 1,048 others in December last year alone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A miserable lot is awaiting the south Korean troops to be dispatched to Iraq as was the case with those who were dispatched to Vietnam. The troop dispatch to Vietnam left at least 5,000 persons dead and over 16,000 wounded. Many soldiers died of the aftermath of the defoliant spread by the U.S. after their return home and more than 50,000 victims of its aftermath are dying. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is chiefly to blame for the additional troop dispatch to Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people from all walks of life should wage a more dynamic anti-U.S., anti-war struggle to get the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces withdrawn from south Korea to the last one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the people should judge the 16th \"National Assembly\" which decided on the additional troops dispatch to Iraq and totally eliminate the chief culprits of the troop dispatch from the political arena by completely burying all the pro-U.S. treacherous forces of the \"Grand National Party\" in the coming \"general election\".    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This clearly shows that it seeks to invade the DPRK by force, while paying lip-service to \"dialogue\" and \"peace.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is nobody's secret that the U.S. has massively shipped into south Korea ultra-modern military hardware tested in the Afghan and Iraqi wars, after rounding off \"new operation plan 5026\" for the invasion of the DPRK, and recently conducted even an exercise of evacuating families of U.S. servicemen in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and south Korean bellicose forces are bringing the dark clouds of a nuclear war to hang over the Korean peninsula. This compels the army and the people of the DPRK to keep a high degree of vigilance against these moves. They are firmly determined to mete out a merciless punishment to the aggressors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should immediately halt its reckless moves to provoke a war against the DPRK, clearly understanding that strength is not all-cure and the Korean peninsula is neither Iraq nor Afghanistan.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
