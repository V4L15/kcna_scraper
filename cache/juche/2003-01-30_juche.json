            "content": "KCNA blasts U.S. \"tailored containment\" strategy \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 29 (KCNA) -- The Korean Peninsula is now exposed to a grave threat posed by the U.S. all-out offensive to pressurize the DPRK.\r\n It is attributable to the U.S. extremely hostile policy toward the DPRK to isolate and stifle the independent sovereign state, and the \"tailored containment\" strategy, its product, in particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a very dangerous strategy as it blatantly challenges the unbiased public opinion calling for a fair solution to the nuclear issue through dialogue and negotiations. This should never be allowed as it is aimed to wreck peace and security in Asia including the Korean Peninsula and the rest of the world, the most hideous crime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. \"tailored containment\" strategy toward the DPRK is, in a word, designed to isolate and stifle the DPRK by putting it under the siege of closely coordinated international sanctions and pressure in political, economic, military, diplomatic and all other aspects. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This strategy is also dubbed a \"serpent\" strategy as it is to be carried out in the way a serpent does, ie swallowing up the object after strangling it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to it, the South Korean KBS reported on December 29 last year that the U.S. seems to have what it calls a \"tailored containment\" strategy in the making to escalate its economic and political pressure on North Korea. The U.S. came out with the operation to destroy North Korea in retaliation against its brinkmanship tactics. It is the core of the \"tailored containment\" strategy to escalate the economic and political pressure to the extremes and push North Korea to collapse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As reported, the U.S. strategy is aimed to destabilize the system in the DPRK and destroy it, while refusing to recognize its political system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a conclusion made by the bush administration that there is no need to keep the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework unless the former collapses and therefore, it should be scrapped and it is necessary to work out the second scenario for the collapse of North Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration has worked to scrap the AF since it took office. It began spreading the rumour of \"north's collapse\", a fiction recorded in history, and escalated its hostile policy toward the DPRK after declaring it as a principal enemy. In the \"state of union message\" delivered at congress on January 30 last year Bush openly listed the DPRK as part of \"an axis of evil\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nLater the U.S. declared the DPRK as a target of its preemptive nuclear attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n International community was unanimous in rebuffing the U.S. talk about an \"axis of evil\" as each nation wanted its vital rights and interests to be protected and sought its own strategic aim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This could not but be a telling blow to the U.S. who was working hard to galvanize the world pubic opinion under the pretext of the \"axis of evil\" and, on this basis, isolate the DPRK and drive it to collapse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. felt an urgent need to fake up a shocking story to launch an international offensive to isolate and pressurize the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It took painstaking efforts to dream up the ridiculous story about the DPRK's \"nuclear development\" to capture the world attention. It sent Kelly to Pyongyang in the capacity of the president's special envoy last October in a foolish bid to make it a fait accompli. But he only got a serious warning from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should have seriously taken our warning and admitted its hostile policy toward the DPRK as an anachronistic one but it went the length of hatching such a political plot as the DPRK's \"admission of its nuclear weapons program.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was against this backdrop that the U.S. drafted the \"tailored containment strategy\" toward the DPRK and has put it into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While talking about international cooperation in implementing it the U.S. has taken a series of actions to step up the strategy. It prevented DPRK's neighbors and EU countries from making any deal with the DPRK and hamstrung inter-Korean exchange and cooperation. It stopped supplying heavy oil to the DPRK, its commitment under the AF, from December last year and committed piracy against the DPRK trading cargo ship Sosan in broad daylight as part of its sea blockade and attempted to check the service of liner Mangyongbong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to internationalize the offensive to pressurize the DPRK, the U.S. instigated the international atomic energy agency, its cat's paw, to adopt an ultimatum-like \"resolution\" and worked hard to bring the DPRK's \"nuclear issue\" to the UN in a bid to put economic sanctions on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is now desperately clinging to its strategy but there is no guarantee that it will prove successful. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the unshakable will of the DPRK to react to the hard-line with the toughest stand and strongly retaliate against the enemies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the U.S. scrapped the AF, the DPRK adopted a decision to lift nuclear freeze on December 12 last year and on January 10 this year it released the government's statement to withdraw from the NPT. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's withdrawal from the NPT dealt a heavy blow at the U.S. \"tailored containment\" strategy as it was a legitimate measure taken to cope with the U.S. moves to stifle the DPRK and the IAEA's partial behavior. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. strategy going against humankind's aspiration and desire to establish an international order for peace, progress, reconciliation and cooperation is now under fire by international community for its reactionary and dangerous nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"tailored containment\" strategy is bound to go bankrupt because of the strong trend of the times opposing the U.S. and war.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman on Powell's remarks \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 29 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Tuesday as regards the shameless remarks made by U.S. Secretary of State Powell at the world economic forum to evade the blame for the present nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula.\r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In a word, Powell's remarks meant that the United States has done what it should do as an \"apostle of peace\" while expressing its will for nonaggression and negotiated settlement of the issue but the present situation has not yet been settled because the DPRK refuses to move. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since he told such a lie to mislead public opinion, the DPRK cannot but dissect his remarks whether they are true. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In his speech at the forum, Powell said Pyongyang \"admitted\" the \"bald facts\" turned up by the U.S. over the uranium enrichment program. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for this matter, Kelly, assistant secretary of U.S. State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, took an arrogant attitude during his visit to Pyongyang, groundlessly urging the DPRK to admit the U.S. assertion for the \"program\". So, we took the attitude of neither denying it nor confirming it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"information\" repeatedly turned up by the U.S. is an invention which does not deserve even a passing note. We had experienced such practice through the case of \"secret underground nuclear facilities discovered\" in Kumchang-ri of the DPRK in 1998. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At that time the U.S. peddled what was called \"information\" only to find the tunnel in Kumchang-ri empty. So, the U.S. had to grant 600,000 tons of food to the DPRK in compensation for such groundless mockery of it. This is a serious lesson that the U.S. should have drawn. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Powell also stated that the U.S. has no intention of attacking the DPRK. However, his argument is quite contrary to the fact. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nUltra-large aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk-led warships of the U.S. were recently deployed in the East Sea of Korea, and he also remarked \"we keep all of our options on the table\", which includes an option of military strike to stifle the DPRK by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said that the U.S. was ready last summer to pursue a bold approach with Pyongyang, which would have entailed political and economic steps. This remark is very hypocritical as the Bush administration had delayed the LWR project, which is to be completed by the year of 2003, and attempted to enforce early inspection only after site preparations were made for LWRs. The administration had also claimed that it would never compensate for the delay. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The hypocritical nature of his remarks can be also found in the assertion that the nuclear issue is not just a matter between the U.S. and the DPRK and the U.S. is working with its allies and others in the region. In this way he attempted to create the impression that it is a matter between the DPRK and the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We cannot but mention that no other country in the world community except the U.S. has singled the DPRK out as a member of an \"axis of evil\" and a target of preemptive nuclear attacks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not the international community but the United States which has brought the present nuclear crisis to the Korean Peninsula in a bid to isolate and stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That is why we have already clarified its stand that it is strongly opposed to any attempt to internationalize the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and will never attend any form of \"multilateral talks\" over it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Powell also said, \"over the past nine years, the international community engaged North Korea in good faith with the nuclear agreements which we now know Pyongyang violated.\" This is the statement reversing black and white. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As soon as it came to power, the Bush administration turned down the \"engagement\" policy and slandered the DPRK as \"disgusting\". It is again the administration which listed the DPRK as part of an \"axis of evil\" and singled out it as a target of its preemptive nuclear attacks after adopting it as a national policy to destroy the system of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has already been well known to the world that the U.S. grossly violated the June 11, 1993 DPRK-U.S. Joint Statement, in which the U.S. assured that \"it would neither use armed forces including nukes nor threaten with them.\" The U.S. also violated the October 21, 1994 DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework, in which the U.S. promised to \"move toward the full normalization of political and economic relations\" with the DPRK, and the October 12, 2000 DPRK-U.S. Joint Communique, in which the U.S., declaring it would have no hostile intention toward the DPRK, reaffirmed that \"the bilateral relations should be based on the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and non-interference.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This convinced us that the bush administration is an untrustworthy rogue group, which did not hesitate to turn aside not only the bilateral agreements the preceding administration concluded, to meet its partisan interests, but also international conventions such as the ABM Treaty and the Kyoto Protocol. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That is why we contend that it is important to conclude a non-aggression treaty between the DPRK and the U.S. as it will have binding force after going through congressional procedures.    \r\n\r\n"
