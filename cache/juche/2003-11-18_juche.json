            "content": "S. Korean Democratic Party's Perfidy Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 17 (KCNA) -- The Democratic Party which had installed a \"government based on broad participation\" for the first time in the political history of south Korea did join its hands with the Grand National Party it has long considered to be a \"sworn enemy\" and went to the lengths of enacting a \"law on special inspection\" in a bid to bring down the present chief executive and the Uri Party.\r\n Dismissing this as political perfidy, a signed commentary of Rodong Sinmun today says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Democratic Party which identified a progressive reform with its avowed political idea behaved, even going beyond the limit overcome with emotion. This is little short of disgracing itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the \"law on special inspection\" which had been railroaded through the National Assembly under the pressure of the GNP is concerned, it is like a \"bullet proof jacket\" to save the GNP. How can the Democratic Party cling to the GNP's apron-strings and conspire with it though it is ill-famed for deceiving and mocking at the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This behaviour is, in essence, little short of political prostitution because the one who was styling oneself a \"standard-bearer of democratization\" in the period of military dictatorship disguised oneself overnight and joined those, who belonged to the dictatorial regime, to gratify one's greed for power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This behaviour of the Democratic Party created a political situation in south Korea reminiscent of a political crisis on the eve of May 16, 1961 when a military coup was staged. If the Democratic Party commits such perfidy as aligning itself with an opposition party whose idea is completely different from it simply because of antipathy toward the present chief executive, it would result in transferring the hard-won power to the ultra-right conservative forces including the GNP. This perfidy would remain cursed and denounced by history and the people generation after generation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Japan is, however, talking about \"legitimacy\" and \"legality\" of this illegal document of aggression though nearly a hundred years have passed since its fabrication. This is, indeed, a blatant denial of history by those who are keen on advocating the militarist idea of aggression. The Korean people's grudge against the Japanese imperialists is so towering that it can hardly be vented. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's increased efforts to cover up its past aggression of Korea would only bedevil the DPRK-Japan relations. The DPRK stands for improved relations with Japan but does not press it to have good relations with Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK-Japan relations can not improve unless Japan redresses its past crimes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It mapped out \"Operation Plan 5030\", \"Plan to Cope with Emergency\" and other plans for a war of aggression and has worked hard to put them into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seeks to ignite the second Korean war by surprise, while making the nuclear issue fester. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is getting more undisguised in its moves to destabilize and suffocate the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. aggressive hostile policy to isolate the DPRK can never be justified but is bound to be frustrated as it is reckless one of those keen on hegemony.    \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
