            "content": "S. Korean Authorities' Dispatch of \"Observers' Group\" to U.S.-led PSI Exercise under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 31 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland gave the following answer to a question raised by KCNA Tuesday assailing the south Korean authorities' dispatch of an \"observers' group\" to the U.S.-led PSI exercise:\r\n The south Korean authorities sent the \"observers' group\" to the U.S.-led PSI exercise now underway in the waters off Bahrain since Monday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The authorities' dispatch of the group intended to support the U.S. in its noisy racket of sanctions and blockade against the DPRK is another shameless act of treachery little short of involving themselves in the U.S. moves for a war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is well known to the world that the U.S. has committed aggression against other countries and wantonly interfered in their internal affairs even by searching their ships and airliners under the signboard of the PSI in violation of their sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The exercise is, in fact, a multinational military maneuver for aggression against the DPRK launched under the pretext of implementing the UN Security Council \"resolution.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The public in south Korea is expressing deep worry about its participation in the exercise, asserting that the participation in the U.S.-led \"PSI\" may \"spark off a dangerous armed conflict.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This notwithstanding, the south Korean authorities, pursuant to the U.S. policy, sent the above-said group to the exercise which they describe as \"maritime inspection\" of the DPRK ships and the like. They went the lengths of justifying their participation in the exercise, talking about \"international norm\" and \"the significance of the participation.\" This clearly proves that they are set to become an accomplice in the U.S. moves to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a serious provocation against the DPRK and a blatant challenge to peace and security of the country as it is an unpardonable criminal act of inviting confrontation between compatriots and a disaster of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has already clarified more than once that it will mercilessly punish anyone who encroaches upon its sovereignty and the right to existence even a bit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities would be well advised to stop their reckless action, pondering over the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by its participation in the above-said brigandish PSI for aggression.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's Reckless Arms Buildup under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 31 (KCNA) -- Japan is now hell-bent on the unbridled arms buildup and the moves to emerge a military power. This is aimed at maintaining a military edge in Asia and rounding off the preparations for going into military actions for aggression anytime.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionary ruling quarters are very nostalgic for the past days when Japan ruled Korea and other Asian countries after invading them and leaving no means untried to bring that era back. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the black-hearted intention of the Japanese militarist forces to stage a comeback to those countries, taking advantage of the tense situation now prevailing on the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Asia-Pacific due to the U.S. policy for escalating the pressure upon the DPRK. The Japanese reactionaries think that now is the time for them to clear all hurdles lying in the way of the militarist war chariot, beef up armed forces, unhindered, and launch reinvasion under the signboard of \"assisting\" the U.S. forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarists are seized by the ambition to build up their military muscle and embark upon conquering Asia in a bid to realize the will left by their predecessors unfulfilled, far from drawing a bitter lesson drawn from their inglorious past. That is why they are becoming all the more adventurous in their military moves than ever before. But Japan is gravely mistaken. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They would be well advised to know well that their reckless military overseas expansion is little short of a suicidal act of wrecking Japan's security and inviting disasters.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This indicates that the U.S. is set to provoke a new war, a nuclear war, on the Korean Peninsula at any cost.\r\n Minju Joson Tuesday observes this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is staging madcap war exercises after amassing huge armed forces in south Korea and in its vicinity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the recent 38th annual meeting of the south Korea-U.S. \"security consultative council\" the U.S. reaffirmed \"its commitment to providing nuclear umbrella\" and promised to dispatch not only its strategic nuclear weapons but tactical nuclear weapons to south Korea in \"case of contingency\" on the peninsula under the pretext of \"containing the bolstering of deterrent.\" These facts go to prove that the U.S. remains unchanged in its design to provoke a nuclear war on the peninsula but it has become more undisguised in its moves than ever before. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This being a hard reality, the south Korean warmongers are becoming more zealous in joining the U.S. in its moves for a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The hearts of the servicepersons and people in the DPRK are burning with towering resentment against the U.S. and south Korean warmongers as they are putting spurs to the preparations for a war against the dignified DPRK in a bid to bring down its political system. Should they ignite a nuclear war against the DPRK, they will not be able to escape a final doom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any war to be launched by them against the DPRK would lead to their self-destruction, the commentary warns.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
