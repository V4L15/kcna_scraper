Korea Puppet Accused of Blocking Resumption of Tour\r\n Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- Organizations of south Korea including the Solidarity for Progress, the Confederation of Trade Unions, the South Headquarters of the Pan-national Alliance for Korea's Reunification, the Youth Solidarity and the Federation of University Students in the 21st Century at a meeting held in Seoul on March 27 demanded the resignation of the puppet minister of Unification standing in the way of resuming the tour of Mt. Kumgang.\n\t\t\t\t\t Speakers at the meeting denounced the conservative group including the minister of \"Unification\" for blocking the resumption of the above-said tour, insisting on what it called \"three conditions\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They deplored that the confrontation policy of the present \"government\" has not only brought direct economic losses to south Korea but beclouded even the prospect of peaceful reunification and common prosperity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The tour of Mt. Kumgang paves the way for the Koreans to live together and achieve peaceful reunification, they said, urging the authorities to come out for the negotiations for the resumption of the tour as early as possible."
