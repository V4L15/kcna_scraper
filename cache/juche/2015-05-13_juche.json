Korean Authorities to Stop Cooperating with Foreign Forces against Compatriots\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, May 13 (KCNA) -- The present south Korean regime has become ever more undisguised in its bad habit of visiting foreign countries to slander fellow countrymen in the north and ask for their cooperation in the campaign against it, says Rodong Sinmun Wednesday in an article.\n\t\t\t\t\t The article recalls that the south Korean chief executive implored Latin American countries for \"cooperation in pressurizing the north\" during her visits to them, the south Korean puppet authorities held sinister confabs with outsiders over the nuclear issue and that they are going more reckless in the smear campaign against the DPRK over its \"human rights issue\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As long as the south Korean regime persists in these acts, it is impossible to expect the dialogue between the north and the south and to improve the inter-Korean ties.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Cooperating with foreign forces is an unpardonable criminal act as it stokes distrust and confrontation between the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such cooperation is a revelation of flunkeyism and the consciousness of confrontation with compatriots. Attaching importance to the relations with foreign forces enforcing a hostile policy towards the DPRK, and depending on it are a clear manifestation of the distrust of the fellow countrymen in the north and the hostility towards them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is the architect of the split of the Korean nation and a vicious disturber of national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our nation must pool its efforts in the struggle against the U.S. keen to start another war of aggression on the Korean peninsula while standing in the way of reconciliation and unity of the nation and independent reunification of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the way of protecting the nation's interests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the south Korean regime is persistently clinging to the sleeves of the U.S. for its cooperation in the moves to stifle the DPRK, while turning away its face from the fellow countrymen in the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an act of treachery to destroy the foundation and cornerstone for the development of the inter-Korean ties and make the destiny of the nation a plaything for foreign forces."

It is a sensitive political issue of whether Japan admits its past crimes or not and whether it has the will to reflect on its past crime-woven history and liquidate it or not. Nevertheless, it persistently refuses to admit its crimes, desperately trying to evade the blame for its past wrongdoings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the ulterior aim of Japan to repeat its past crime-woven history."
