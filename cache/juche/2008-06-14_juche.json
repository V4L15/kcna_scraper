He praised the agricultural working people there for devoting their patriotic zeal, aware of being responsible for the nation's agricultural production. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He highly appreciated the working traits and style of the officials and working people of the farm, expressing great satisfaction over the fact that they have brought about a signal turn in the agricultural production in recent years by properly managing and operating the farm, scrupulously organizing the labor force and tenaciously doing all farm work to meet the scientific and technological requirements. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He emphasized that it is the basic way of increasing the grain production to fully meet the requirements of the Juche-based farming method to suit the climatic and soil conditions of Korea and channel sustained great efforts into the implementation of the policy to bring about a radical turn in seed production, in particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by Kim Phyong Hae, chief secretary of the North Phyongan Provincial Committee of the WPK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

General Assembly as they have made important contributions to promoting the peaceful reunification of Korea and achieving world peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Accusing traitor Lee Myung Bak of attempting to stop the process of reconciliation on the peninsula and that of its reunification by hamstringing the efforts to implement these declarations, the statement called upon the world peace-loving forces to actively support the June 15 joint declaration and shatter the attempts to lay obstacles in the way of implementing it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
