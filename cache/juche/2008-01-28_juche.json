            "content": "Kim Jong Il Provides Field Guidance to Janggang County \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 26 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il gave on-the-spot guidance to the work in various fields of Janggang County. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The first leg of his guidance was the Janggang Mushroom Farm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Going round the exterior and interior of the farm including a spore cultivation room and a mushroom growing house, he acquainted himself in detail with the construction of the farm and its production. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Being informed that the family members of Kim Yong Jong, manager of the farm, have worked heart and soul to increase the mushroom production on the same farm, he highly appreciated their patriotic deed, saying that such people working hard for the prosperity of the country are true patriots. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is most important for cultivating mushroom is to establish a strict system for providing spores, he said, setting forth tasks to be fulfilled by the farm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The next leg of his guidance was the Janggang Foodstuff Factory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Going round the technologically updated production processes, he got familiar in detail with equipment and production there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  He called upon the officials and other working people in the field of the light industry to bring about a radical turn in its development through the dynamic light industrial revolution, bearing deep in mind the high honor and pride of working in the important domain to improve the standard of the people's living. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He gave field guidance to the Janggang Rabbit Breeding Stock Farm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went round the interior of the modernly built breeding stock farm and highly praised the feats of its employees. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He visited the family of Kim Chol Su, head of a work-team, who set an example in raising rabbits. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that rabbit is a domestic animal ensuring high productivity, he stressed the need to raise rabbits in a big way to provide the people in the county with conditions for richer diet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He commanded a bird's-eye view of Janggang township built as a socialist land of bliss. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He looked round a photo exhibition now under way in Jagang Province. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Seeing significant photos one by one, he recollected with deep emotion on the ten year-long history of hardships and the unforgettable officials and people of the province. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said with profound emotion that the workers and other people in the province are loyalists who took the lead in pulling through difficulties sharing the idea, intention, breath and destiny with the Party when the country was in the most difficult situation and the precious revolutionary comrades who gave him courage with staunch fighting spirit and matchless valor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No weapon can overpower the strength of the Korean people having such a great history as the \"Arduous March,\" the forced march as a legacy, he said, expressing great expectation and conviction that the working people in the province would continue to successfully perform the role of vanguard in the gigantic struggle to build a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by Pak To Chun, chief secretary of the Jagang Provincial Committee of the WPK, and Kim Ki Nam, secretary of the WPK Central Committee.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S., Source of Worldwide Economic Instability \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 26 (KCNA) -- The world economy is slumping into a serious disorder. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The growing alarm over the economic depression in the United States has caused stock price slumps worldwide and called forth voices of unrest and concern about an economic crisis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The main factor of this worldwide economic instability is generally traced to the sharp rise of the oil price and the crisis of housing market in the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But a close scrutiny reveals that the consequences of the reckless war policy and \"anti-terrorism war\" of the U.S. underlie it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Entering upon the 21st century, the U.S. has provoked three wars including the Afghanistan war and the proxy war in Lebanon, prompted by its \"anti-terrorism war\" strategy for maintaining its position as \"the only super power\" in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lebanese war ended with a woeful defeat of the U.S. and Israel and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, which had been started earlier, are sinking deeper into a hopeless bog. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The bankruptcy of the \"anti-terrorism war\" means the close of the \"U.S. age\". So the U.S. is hurling a greater amount of fund into these wars and trying to find a way out of the serious financial crisis in the growth of export by the devaluation of the dollar. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. administration has steadily cut the rate of interest by switching over from the dollar overvaluation policy to its devaluation policy over the last three years. The deficit recorded the lowest mark in the fiscal year of 2007 for recent five years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Consequent upon this, the oil price in the world market broke the 100 dollar mark per barrel, far beyond its real value, in January this year. This posed a serious threat not only to the oil consumer states but also to the oil producer states. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The dollar devaluation policy of the U.S. administration to fend off the catastrophic effect of the \"anti-terrorism war\" on the domestic economy is the fundamental cause of the jumping oil price, which cannot be put on a par with the speculation on the oil market and \"imbalance between demand and supply\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The crisis of housing market in the U.S. which was another fuse to the world economic instability finds its origin, in the final analysis, to the \"anti-terrorism war\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. administration has drastically cut down the social expenditures such as to health care and housing while increasing military expenditures without limits under the cloak of \"anti-terrorism\". It advertised a fine-sounding policy of tax reduction supposed to help people rise up for themselves by tax cut. But it was none other than the rich who benefited by it. Under the present U.S. administration, the number of the poor has increased some five million and the gap between the poor and the rich has got the broadest in history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aggravation of the state in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer resulting from the \"anti-terrorism war\" has inevitably touched off the crisis of real estate market and banking, while holding back economic growth by decreasing the expenses of the consumers, which is said to be the \"motive power of the U.S. economy\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The crisis of the housing market is its concentric reflection. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is foreseen that the losses in financial sectors caused by the slumping housing market will continue growing. Coupled with the sharp rise of oil and protracted dullness in the auto industry, the stagnation crisis of the overall U.S. economy further come to the surface. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in its report made public on January 9 warned the U.S. of pursuing a policy of sharp and disorderly dollar devaluation, noting that the housing market crisis and depression in the U.S. further increase the danger of leading the world economy to stagnation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System on Jan. 22 took one more measure of lowering the rate of interest to drive the world deeper into a commotion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the facts show that the politico-economic instability and mess in the world have been triggered off by the U.S. unlimited imperialistic rapacity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The progressive people across the world will vigorously turn out in the struggle for smashing the aggressive \"anti-terrorism war\" of the U.S. imperialists, the common enemy.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "ATCC analiza la causa de inestabilidad de economia mundial\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, 26 de enero (ATCC) -- La economia mundial va cayendo en el crisol de disturbio total. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En estos dias, la creciente incertidumbre por el estancamiento de negocios en Estados Unidos produce a escala mundial la caida en picada del valor de acciones y resuenan voces inquietas y preocupantes de una eventual crisis economica. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Es una opinion generalizada que el factor principal de esa inestabilidad de la economia mundial reside en la subida brusca del precio de petroleo y en la crisis desatada en el mercado de viviendas de EE.UU. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Pero, en el trasfondo de ella hay las secuelas negativas de la imprudente politica belicista de EE.UU. y de la \"guerra antiterrorista\" lanzada por este. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En el siglo 21, a tenor de la estrategia de \"guerra antiterrorista\" orientada a mantener su posicion de \"unica superpotencia\", EE.UU. desato 3 guerras desde la afgana hasta la de Libano que ejecuto a traves de sus titeres israelies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Esta ultima contienda belica termino con la derrota de EE.UU. e Israel y el primero esta empantanandose cada vez mas en las anteriores guerras afgana e iraqui. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El fracaso de la \"cruzada antiterrorista\" significaria el fin de los \"tiempos de EE.UU.\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Por esta razon, este imperio invierte fabulosos fondos en esas guerras estrategicas y trata de buscar la salida de la seria crisis financiera en el aumento de exportacion mediante la devaluacion del dolar. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La administracion norteamericana, que habia cambiado su politica del dolar fuerte por la del dolar debil, rebajo constantemente en los ultimos 3 anos la tasa de interes de esta moneda. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Por resultado, se incremento la exportacion de EE.UU. y su deficit presupuestario marco en el ano fiscal de 2007 una cifra mas baja que las registradas en el ultimo lustro. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  A cambio, a principios de este ano el precio del petroleo en el mercado mundial supero 100 US$ por cada barril por encima de su valor real, lo cual resulta una seria amenaza no solo para los paises consumidores sino tambien para los productores. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La politica del dolar debil de la administracion norteamericana, con que ella trata de eliminar los efectos catastroficos de la \"guerra antiterrorista\" sobre la economia nacional, deviene el factor principal del alza del precio de petroleo, incomparablemente grave que los actos especulativos y el \"desequilibro entre la demanda y la oferta\" en el mercado del crudo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La crisis del mercado de viviendas, otro detonante de la inestabilidad de la economia mundial, tambien tiene su genesis en la \"guerra antiterrorista\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Bajo el pretexto de \"luchar contra el terrorismo\", la administracion norteamericana aumento en gran medida los gastos militares a cambio de la reduccion considerable de los egresos para las ramas sociales como la salud publica y la vivienda. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Aunque anuncio la edulcorada politica de reduccion de impuestos, segun la cual los habitantes pueden mejorar por si solos sus condiciones economicas, los beneficiarios reales de ella son unicamente las personas acaudaladas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Durante el mandato de la actual administracion norteamericana, se registro un incremento de aproximadamente 5 millones en la cifra de los pobres y las diferencias entre estos y los ricos se agrandaron mas que nunca. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La exacerbacion de la situacion de \"los ricos se hacen cada vez mas ricos y los pobres se tornan cada vez mas pobres\", generada por esa \"guerra\", traera inevitablemente la reduccion de los egresos de los consumidores conocidos como \"fuerza motriz de la economia estadounidense\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  De esta manera, frena el crecimiento economico y busca una crisis en el mercado de bienes inmuebles y en los negocios bancarios. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Una muestra coherente de ello es la crisis del mercado de viviendas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Se preve que iran en aumento las perdidas de la rama financiera a causa de esa recesion en el mercado de viviendas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  A esto se suman el alza del precio de petroleo y el estancamiento prolongado de la industria automovilistica, los cuales acentuan el aspecto paralizado de la economia estadounidense en su conjunto. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Al publicar un informe el pasado dia 9, la Conferencia de la ONU sobre el Comercio y el Desarrollo dio una senal de alarma a EE.UU. en cuanto a la brusca y desordenada politica del dolar debil argumentando que debido a esa crisis de viviendas y recesion economica, la economia mundial corre cada vez mayor peligro del estancamiento. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Sin embargo, la Reserva Federal de EE.UU. anuncio el dia 22 otra medida para rebajar la tasa de interes del dolar, que intranquiliza mas a todo el mundo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Como muestran los hechos, la inestabilidad y disturbio economicos, que hoy sufre el mundo de modo sucesivo, se originan de la insaciable apetencia imperialista de EE.UU. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La humanidad progresista del mundo intensificara mas su lucha por frustrar esa agresiva \"guerra antiterrorista\" lanzada por el imperialismo norteamericano, enemigo comun.
