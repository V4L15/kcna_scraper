This is a product of their hostile policy toward the DPRK.\r\n   If Japan truly wants to solve the issue of improving its relations with the DPRK  on good terms and ensure a lasting peace and stability in the far east and Asia, it must throw away the double-dealing tactics against the dialogue partner, which is being pursued behind the curtain of dialogue, and approach dialogue and pending matters with reason.\r\n   Our resolution to establish good-neighbourhood with Japan is consistent and invariable.\r\n   Accordingly, Japan's attitude toward us is the key to the solution of the issue of improving the DPRK-Japan relations and pending matters.\r\n   Japanese political forces should not forget the lesson of history from Japan's militarism and overseas aggression.\r\n   It is high time that they made a clear estimation of the obtaining situation and interests of Japan and behaved with discretion.\r\n   We will sharply watch their moves going against the development of relations between the two countries and strongly cope with them. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
