            "content": "U.S. \"Human Rights\" Ballad Will Never Work on DPRK: DPRK FM Spokesman\r\n Pyongyang, April 23 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the DPRK issued the following statement on Tuesday:\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently the U.S. released the \"2012 report on human rights\" in which it malignantly slandered the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is unbecoming for the U.S. to style itself a \"human rights judge\" though it is the biggest human rights abuser that killed innocent people and caused untold disasters in all parts of the world through aggression and interference.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. stages the farce of evaluating the human rights performance in more than 190 countries of the world every year, which is aimed to invent a pretext for putting pressure on those countries disobedient to it and toppling them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. works out the \"human rights report\" with countries' obedience to its strategy for dominating the world as a criterion. So those countries aspiring after independence have become target of the U.S. accusations and attacks without exception.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. \"human rights report\" is a tool for aggression and interference to overturn the social systems of anti-U.S. independent countries. Herein lie its reactionary nature and danger.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  It is a trite method of the U.S. to charge with \"human rights abuses\" those countries with which it is displeased and interfere in their internal affairs with persistent \"human rights\" ballad and thus cultivate dishonest forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. employed this method when bringing down socialist system in the former Soviet Union and Eastern European countries during the Cold War and also when overturning different countries in the Mideast and North Africa recently.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Finding it difficult to topple down the DPRK by force of arms, the U.S. is now resorting to such a base method.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a result, the U.S. \"human rights\" ballad is nothing but a conspiratorial means to realize its hostile policy toward the DPRK to topple down its socialist system chosen by the Korean people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such ballad will never work on the Korean-style socialist society in which all the service personnel and people are single-mindedly united around the dear respected Marshal Kim Jong Un, a country which is possessed of modern nuclear deterrent for self-defence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The more undisguisedly the U.S. escalates its hostile policy toward the DPRK aimed at bringing down its social system, the further the DPRK will bolster its nuclear deterrent to defend its social system and will thoroughly shatter the U.S. \"human rights\" ballad its own way."

The U.S. present policy toward the DPRK has derived from its extreme ignorance and miscalculation of the changed relations of political and military forces on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is ignorant of the single-minded unity of the army and people of the DPRK around their leader and its might.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. thinks that it can undermine the social system of the DPRK through invasion against it accompanied by nuclear blackmail, ideological and cultural poisoning and economic sanctions aimed at \"undermining it from within\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This U.S. foreign policy may work on other countries but never on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has turned into a full-fledged political and military power under the banner of independence and Songun and the Korean people are demonstrating their dignity as independent people no one dares provoke. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Moreover, it has rich experiences and historical tradition of winning only victories in confrontation with the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean Peninsula is not what it used to be in the past. The geographic position of the country remains as same as before but it is not a weak country which was ruthlessly trampled down by big powers as a theatre for their power scramble. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's possession of nuclear weapons has totally changed the balance of political and military forces in the peninsula and the region. This has put an end to the imbalance of nuclear force in Northeast Asia including the peninsula and decreased the danger of the outbreak of a war in effect.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The DPRK is now in a position to take any physical counteraction positively on its own initiatives to guarantee peace and security on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  In contrast to it, the present U.S. Korea policy is anachronistic. This policy was shaped in the period before the DPRK's access to nukes and there is no change to speak of in its essence as well as means and method.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is just the tragedy of the U.S. that it is unaware of the DPRK and unable to follow up the changed objective situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. had better roll back its stereotyped hostile policy toward the DPRK, though belatedly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. misjudgment will lead it to its biggest historical defeat.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present U.S. administration should be serious about the lesson drawn by its predecessors who said the Korean war in the 1950s was a war of mistake that was fought in a wrong place at a wrong time against wrong opponent."

This was not just his private opinion but reflected the idea of the chief of Chongwadae, says Minju Joson Tuesday in a bylined commentary.\n\t\t\t\t\t The present south Korean authorities are inciting all-out confrontation with fellow countrymen at the instigation of the U.S. imperialists, the news analyst says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jang Su formerly served as minister of puppet Defense. He has been deeply engaged himself in confrontation with fellow countrymen and DPRK-targeted war drills.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His provocative remarks proved that the puppet south Korean regime's \"proposal for dialogue\" was nothing but a crafty trick to mislead the public opinion. The south Korean puppet regime which waged huge war drills against the DPRK with the U.S. imperialists made the dialogue offer to shift the blame for the strained situation on the Korean Peninsula on to the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet forces made the dialogue offer on one hand and went berserk, hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK on the Day of the Sun widely celebrated by the world on the other hand. Not content with this, they instigated such belligerent guys as Kim Jang Su to vociferate about \"provocation by the north\" and \"punishment\". This proves their sordid nature of crying wine and selling vinegar. Their intention is to rattle the DPRK and secure a pretext for provoking a total war against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The warmongers' remarks of further aggravating the north-south ties have touched off greater anger of the army and people of the DPRK. They have turned out in an all-out action against the U.S., determined to mercilessly punish the puppet warmongers who seek the provocation of a war against the DPRK."

Korea Dangerous War Scenarios\r\n Pyongyang, April 23 (KCNA) -- The south Korean military is seeking to include what is called \"scorched-land strategy\" in OPLAN 5015, a new war scenario against the DPRK, at the instigation of the U.S. imperialists.\n\t\t\t\t\t OPLAN 5015 is a combination of OPLAN 5026, the keynote of which is to mount a preemptive nuclear strike on the DPRK, and OPLAN 5027, the main contents of which are to deploy the U.S. \"rapid deterrent forces\" on the Korean Peninsula, destroy the \"strategic targets in the north,\" land huge troops on the coast of the DPRK, \"occupy it by force\" and set up a \"ruling machinery\" in it. Accordingly, this plan is aimed to let the U.S. forces present in south Korea and the south Korean puppet army deal a \"preemptive strike\" at the DPRK and occupy Pyongyang in a short time without any reinforcement from the U.S. mainland.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean forces are mulling adding the \"strategy for making havoc of the north Korean army\" to such dangerous OPLAN 5015. This is tantamount to an open declaration of war against the DPRK and goes to clearly prove the absurdity of their call for \"end to threat and provocation by the north\", raised by the U.S. and the puppets in south Korea as preconditions for dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is an open secret that the U.S. has long schemed to unleash a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula. This is clearly evidenced by its dangerous war scenarios, which have been steadily modified and supplemented every year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Right after the adoption of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the U.S. imperialists loudly spoke in public that it suffered a defeat in the Korean War because it did not use A-bombs. And they drew up all kinds of nuclear war scenarios intended to provoke another Korean war, which include \"8-53\" and \"10-54\" in the mid-1950s, \"9-day war plan\" in the 1970s, \"3-day war plan\" and \"120-day war plan\" in the 1980s and OPLAN 5027 and OPLAN 5027-98 in the 1990s.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the new century, they listed the DPRK as an \"axis of evil\" and worked out and modified a number of DPRK-targeted war scenarios, including OPLAN 5027-04 and OPLAN 5030.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such nuclear war scenarios are becoming a reality through annual DPRK-targeted military drills of various forms in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists had staged war drills on more than 13 700 occasions till 2007, among them being at least 900 joint military exercises conducted in league with the south Korean forces and 2 400 odd drills of services and arms by the U.S. troops single-handedly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is needless to say that the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military exercises, now being conducted by the U.S. and south Korea for nearly two months, are a test nuclear war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the facts clearly show that the U.S. is the very one who is escalating the tension on the Korean Peninsula and bringing the danger of war to it while wrecking its peace."

But such behavior is aimed only to evade their responsibility for the present crisis on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t Down through history, the call for dialogue on the part of the U.S. was a ploy to mislead the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the Bush administration appeared in the U.S., the DPRK government proposed direct talks for peace on the peninsula several times, strongly urging the settlement of the nuclear issue through conclusion of a nonaggression treaty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the U.S. insisted on \"nuclear program renouncement first, dialogue later\", raising preconditions that the DPRK should refrain from nuclear proliferation, dismantle its long-range missiles, slacken the intimidatory posture of conventional armed forces and fully comply with the safeguards accord under the Non-proliferation Treaty. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It went the lengths of asserting that any progress in the DPRK-U.S. talks entirely depends on the former's attitude towards the key problems and that the talks would focus only on the performance of its obligation. Their assertion was little different from the U.S. refusal to have talks with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. rhetoric about dialogue in 2006 was no more than a smokescreen to cover up its intention to stifle the DPRK. Just after an agreement on the resumption of the six-party talks, the U.S. launched \"reception, staging, onward movement and integration\" (RSOI) exercises, driving the talks into total collapse.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At present the U.S. cries out for starting dialogue in an appropriate environment, in an appropriate time and under appropriate condition, urging the DPRK to stop the \"provocative\" remarks and show its will to realize denuclearization and suspend missile launch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such gangster-like logic can never work on anyone as the DPRK and the U.S. are in hostile relationship and the latter is the very one that pushed the Korean Peninsula to such a touch-and-go situation as now."

            "content": "Mal juicio de EE.UU, le traera la derrota historica, comenta ACNC\r\n Pyongyang, 23 de abril (ACNC) -- En estos dias, Estados Unidos habla tanto del \"juicio peligroso\" y \"conducta imprudente\" de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea en cuanto a la situacion actual de la Peninsula Coreana, diciendo que la propuesta de dialogo de si mismo es para prevenir la consecuencia catastrofica y refleja la demanda de la region y de la sociedad internacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t En otras palabras, las medidas superintransigentes de la RPDC son \"actos imprudentes\" basados en el juicio malintencionado y por eso, EE.UU. hace esfuerzos por salvar la situacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Esto es una artimana astuta para aumentar el ambiente de aplastamiento a la RPDC poniendo de relieve el \"caracter belicoso\" de esta. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La politica sobre la RPDC de EE.UU. se basa en la ignorancia a su rival y en el juicio erroneo sobre las correlaciones politicas y militares cambiadas de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t EE.UU. no sabe de la unidad monolitica y el poderio de la RPDC donde estan unidos compactamente el ejercito y el pueblo en torno al lider con la unica alma y proposito. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Cree que podria derrocar el regimen norcoreano con la invasion armada basada en el chantaje con bombas atomicas, la ofensiva ideologica y cultural para la \"desinformacion interior\" y la sancion economica. Pero, esta politica exterior del imperio no surte efecto nunca mas en la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Bajo la bandera de la independencia y el Songun, la RPDC ya se ha convertido en la potencia politica y militar y el pueblo coreano exalta el poderio como pueblo independiente a quien nadie se atreve a atacar. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Y la RPDC tiene abundantes experiencias y la tradicion historica de haber logrado siempre victorias en la confrontacion antiyanqui. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La Peninsula Coreana no es la de ayer, aunque es invariable su posicion geografica. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En particular, la posesion de armas nucleares de la RPDC modifico completamente las correlaciones politicas y militares en esta region incluso la Peninsula Coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ya se acabo el estado de desequilibrio nuclear en la Peninsula Coreana y el resto del Nordeste Asiatico, gracias a lo cual se ha reducido notablemente el peligro de estallido de guerra. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ahora la RPDC puede tomar cualesquier medidas intransigentes fisicas para preservar la paz y la seguridad de la Peninsula Coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Al contrario, la politica de EE.UU. sobre la RPDC tiene en consideracion el tiempo antes de la posesion de armas nucleares de la RPDC. Pues, no tiene algun cambio tanto en su esencia como en su medio y metodo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Es anacronica la politica norteamericana de apoderarse de toda la Peninsula Coreana al derrocar el regimen norcoreano con la invasion armada segun el chantaje de bombas nucleares y la campana ideo-cultural para la \"desintegracion interior\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Esta politica exterior de EE.UU. no surte efecto nunca mas en la RPDC, pais con armas nucleares y con abundantes experiencias y la tradicion historica de haber logrado siempre victorias en la confrontacion antiyanqui.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La tragedia de EE.UU. esta en no saber nada de la RPDC ni de la realidad objetiva.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Aunque sea ahora, el imperio norteamericano debe abandonar la caduca politica sobre la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El mal juicio de EE.UU. le traera la derrota nunca vista en la historia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La actual administracion norteamericana debe sacar la leccion en la confesion de sus antecesores quienes dijeron que la guerra coreana de hace 60 anos fue una contienda erronea."
