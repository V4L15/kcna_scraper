            "content": "Those Who Hurt Dignity of DPRK's Supreme Leadership Are Bound to Meet Stern Punishment: CPRK Spokesman\r\nPyongyang, April 14 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) made public a statement Sunday as regards the fact that only the south Korean puppet forces are making malignant and ill-boding remarks when all Koreans in the north and the south and overseas and the world progressives are significantly celebrating the birth anniversary of President Kim Il Sung (the Day of the Sun).\n\t\t\t\t\tThe puppet forces let reptile media slander the north, saying it fans up festive mood to celebrate the Day of the Sun while creating an extreme wartime atmosphere. They are letting loose vituperations terming the celebrations a \"demonstration of the justice of its system\" and \"intention to rally the ranks\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey even spoke ill of the true picture of the single-minded unity between the leader and people with such invectives of \"shoring up of loyalty\" and \"consolidating system\", blaring the supreme headquarters in the north is now \"in trouble before the south side's proposal for dialogue.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe statement said that it is another unpardonable hideous provocation that the puppet forces insult the celebrations of the Day of the Sun and hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK in the wake of responding to the just and toughest steps taken by the DPRK's army and people to protect the country's sovereignty and dignity with a nuclear war racket with their American master.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey should not lose discretion even though they are mad on confrontation with fellow countrymen and there should be a limit to revelation of their ignorance, the statement noted, and continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe ever-escalating heinous provocation of the puppet group is the last-ditch efforts of those being taken aback by the spirit of the army and people of the DPRK determined to resolutely shatter the anti-DPRK moves of the U.S. imperialists and hostile forces, rallied close around the great leader. It is also desperate efforts to undermine the invincible might of Songun Korea ushering in a new era of the great succession and arrest its dynamic advance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is only the south Korean puppet forces who let loose invectives against the holiday of fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTraitor Lee Myung Bak was labeled as the first target of the DPRK's strike because he dared slander and insult the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and its social system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe reality clearly proves that the present conservative group of south Korea is the hordes of traitors indifferent from the Lee group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe extreme phase of confrontation has been created on the Korean Peninsula. This is a product of the inveterate hostility of the south Korean puppets toward the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and their deep-rooted nature of confrontation against its social system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe puppet group has no future as it is hostile toward fellow countrymen and resorts to confrontation policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe army and people of the DPRK are greatly enraged at the group's act of slandering the Day of the Sun, the greatest holiday of the nation, and hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe more desperately the enemies make vituperation, the stronger the DPRK's will for retaliation will become, and the moment when it is given full play, the group of traitors will be wiped out to the last man from this land.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs one can not get the sun eclipsed by palms, no one on earth can arrest the DPRK from triumphantly advancing backed by the tremendous military muscle under the rays of the sun of Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThose hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK will face a stern punishment."

            "content": "CPRK Urges S. Korea to Drop Confrontation Stance\r\nPyongyang, April 14 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) Sunday gave an answer to a question put by the KCNA as regards the recent proposal of dialogue made by the incumbent chief executive and the puppet minister of Unification of south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe chief executive at a dinner with parliamentary members from the \"Saenuri Party\" at Chongwadae on Thursday clarified her stand to resume dialogue with the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMinister of Unification Ryu Kil Jae said on the same day in an exceptional \"statement to the north\" that he \"hoped the north's authorities will show up at a conference room for dialogue especially for the discussion of issues of the north side's own concern\", calling for settling the issue of normalizing the Kaesong Industrial Zone through dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs regards this, the core member concerned of Chongwadae said Ryu's statement was an official proposal of dialogue that reflected the will of the chief executive.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBut to us, it is nothing but a crafty trick to cover up their crimes of driving the Kaesong Industrial Zone into a crisis and their nature of confrontation by misleading the public opinion, the spokesman said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThose, keen on \"sanctions\" and \"pressure\", nuclear war maneuvers against the DPRPK and moves for confrontation with fellow countrymen in league with foreign forces, talked about dialogue, not uttering a word of apologizing or claiming responsibility in disregard of their crimes. This shameless act is an insult to and a mockery of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Foal Eagle war maneuvers are now being staged in south Korea and the U.S. and the puppet warmongers are deeply engaged in the moves for igniting a war against the DPRK under the pretext of its military countermeasures.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs for the proposal for dialogue, it is an empty word without any content.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThose, who fostered the present grave situation, showed no candid and sincere attitude toward the dialogue with the north but took the stand of listening to what the north thinks and wants. This is the height of arrogance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWorse still, the chief executive and the minister of Unification of south Korea let loose a spate of venomous outcries for \"provocation\", \"dismantlement of nukes\", \"change\" and \"repetition of vicious cycle\" toward the north to whom it proposed dialogue. This goes to fully prove that they still harbor hostility and intention for confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDo they think is it possible to have dialogue under such situation and have they ever thought of what results will such dialogue produce.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe present chief executive of south Korea appears to follow the policy of transferring to the \"confrontation with dialogue\" from \"confrontation without dialogue\" touted by the \"yusin regime\" early in the 1970s. If she really hopes it, she had better stop the farce of dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe north-south dialogue is neither a game nor verbal spar. Such dialogue will be meaningless and useless.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean authorities can never evade the blame for the present acute situation though they are resorting to crafty moves, misleading public opinion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tConfrontation is incompatible with dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf they have true intent for dialogue, they should drop the attitude of confrontation, to begin with, not getting inveigled in wordplay.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe possibility of dialogue entirely depends on their attitude."
