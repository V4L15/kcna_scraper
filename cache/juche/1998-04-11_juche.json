She also went round food-for-work projects which have already been completed or are now under way with help of the WFP.\r\n   She expressed satisfaction at the fact that food rendered by the WFP and other international organizations and charitable bodies has been supplied to inhabitants and has been helpful towards their living and that the WFP-assisted food-for-work projects have paid off.\r\n   She voiced deep concern over effects to be caused by months of food shortage in the country where the total stock of food has been exhausted and called on the international community to positively respond to the WFP's appeal.\r\n   She also attended the opening ceremony of the Wonsan branch office of the WFP's mission here and inspected at Nampho Port the unloading of the first shipment from the 200,000 tons of food supplied by the United States in response to the appeal.\r\n   During her stay here, she paid a courtesy call on Vice-President of the DPRK Ri Jong Ok, had talks with Vice-Premier of the Administration Council Kong Jin Thae and met with Minister-level officials of the Foreign Ministry, the Education Commission and the Ministry of Public Health to discuss issues concerning emergency food assistance.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is not a matter which Japan can solve willfully through such \"private fund.\"  \r\n   This special anti-ethic crime should be handled in the way that the Japanese government makes apology and compensation in a responsible manner according to international law on human rights.\r\n   The International Association of Democratic Lawyers, too, has urged the Japanese government to make state compensation.\r\n   However, the Japanese government insisted, as regards \"comfort women\" issue, that its policy is not to make any compensation to an individual and, worse still, put pressure even upon the UN special rapporteur. This shows their moral vulgarity well.\r\n   Former \"comfort women's\" demand is not for some \"money of charity\" but for the Japanese government's apology and compensation.\r\n   The Japanese government, which has so far refused to make apology and compensation, is committing another crime by attempting to gloss over the settlement of the past in such a way.\r\n   It should probe  the \"comfort women\" issue in an allround way and open to public its truth,  make  an adequate compensation for its victims and punish all those responsible for it.    \r\n \r\n\r\n"
