Then he set forth the tasks facing the factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The factory has a very important duty, he said, underscoring the need for it to wage a dynamic drive not only for keeping the production going at a high rate but also for thoroughly guaranteeing  the quality of products and turning out varieties of syringes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He instructed the factory to update it as required by the age of knowledge-based economy in order to increase the production of syringes systemically and produce various sizes of those products and needles for diverse uses as many as it wishes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the Party's intention to modernize the factory so that it may be a model and standard of the nation's medical appliances factory, he noted, underlining the need to turn the factory into the world-level one producing syringes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is necessary to hold high the banner of self-development-first principle, the banner of locally producing things in the work for updating the factory, he said, calling on its officials and employees to build modern technological processes with indigenous efforts and technology by pooling creative wisdom with scientists and technicians in the relevant field.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The level of medical service largely depends on how to provide medical appliances, the main means for preventive and curative medical care, he said, adding that the Party would take necessary measures to ensure that more good quality syringes and instillators are produced so they may be sufficiently provided to the service members and civilians.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He called for directing sustained great efforts to the work for consolidating the material and technical foundation of Juche-based public health, the healthcare for the people, including the construction of more modern medical appliances producers based on the cutting-edge scientific and technological successes so as to enable the people to fully benefit from the socialist healthcare system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed the expectation and belief that the officials and employees of the factory would positively contribute to giving the fullest play to the advantages and might of the socialist healthcare system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by So Hong Chan and Jo Yong Won."

Korean Pro-U.S. Lackeys in Anti-DPRK Racket\r\n Pyongyang, September 24 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Country of the DPRK gave an  answer to a question put by KCNA Saturday to condemn the UN secretary general for taking the lead in the racket for ratcheting up sanctions against the DPRK in collusion with pro-U.S. conservative forces in south Korea. The spokesman said:\n\t\t\t\t\t UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon right after the DPRK's nuclear warhead explosion test had an exceptional press interview by abusing his power in which he blustered \"it was a wanton violation of UN resolutions\" and \"the UN condemns it in the strongest words.\" In several official appearances he unhesitatingly spouted such extremely sinister and sordid outbursts as \"the north poses threat to the world security\" and \"the UN Security Council should immediately take measures to stop the north's additional provocation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This clearly proves that though Ban stalks as UN secretary general, he is, in fact, a political philistine pleasing the U.S. and the south Korean puppet group and blindly complying with their brigandish demands as he is bereft of elementary impartiality and reasonable thinking power to discern the right from wrong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He is a confrontation maniac as he has abused the UN as a sinister political platform for slandering the DPRK, a full-fledged member of the UN, zealously pursuant to the hostile policy of the U.S. and its vassal forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The spokesman disclosed the sinister aim sought by Ban in taking the lead in fostering the atmosphere of the campaign against the DPRK in the international arena.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ban whose tenure of office is expected to expire by the end of this year was reported to have expressed his intention to run for \"presidential election\" due in south Korea next year, revealing his political ambition, the spokesman said, and continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As he has no support base and he is incompetent in politics and, furthermore, he is not aware of the situation in south Korea, he has no other way but to cling close to the U.S. master and Park Geun Hye only to play the role of their marionette.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We do not care whether he tries to seek the presidency of south Korea in quest of power after being dethroned as UN secretary general.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But we keep tabs on all the high treasons he has committed by taking the lead in the moves to tighten international sanctions and pressure to stifle the DPRK, while acting as a faithful servant of the U.S. and marionette of the pro-U.S. conservative regime of south Korea at the UN.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ban should bear in mind if he acts in concert with the Park Geun Hye group and goes mischievous while getting involved in the sanctions against the DPRK, out of his despicable partisan calculation, he will be made to pay a very high price.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will closely follow the future behavior of Ban."

They are naturally arousing high vigilance among regional countries. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter what fig-leaf Japan uses to hide the nature of the projected drill, no country in the region would be taken in by it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is a war criminal which imposed immeasurable misfortune and pain upon the Asian people including Koreans through ceaseless wars of aggression in the last century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is the only shameless country in the world which has persistently denied its state obligation to make an apology and reparation to those countries which suffered from its aggression, refusing to admit its crimes in the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, Japan is putting spurs to the moves to turn itself into a military giant though it is the defeated nation which is banned from having any right to belligerency or right to participate in a war and a regular army by its Constitution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan expanded to worldwide the scope of actions of its \"Self-Defense Forces\" (SDF) which had been limited to its vicinity through the revision of the \"Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation Guidelines\" and adoption of \"security legislation\". It is now allowed to exercise the \"right to collective self-defense\" under the pretext of military support to allies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present Japanese government is going busy developing and purchasing modern weapons and equipment. It shaped a defense budget for fiscal 2017 amounting to 51.6 billion U.S. dollars, an all-time high in its history. Its SDF is staging ceaseless military drills in the sky and on the ground and sea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan has never dropped its wild ambition for becoming \"leader of East Asia\" with the backing of big powers. Just as Japanese public disclosed, \"the ulterior goal of the Abe Cabinet is to fight a war alongside the U.S., unhindered overseas.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In-fight tankers will be massively involved in the upcoming joint drill, going beyond the scope of \"defending the territory.\" This fact clearly shows Japan's militarist ambition for reinvading Asian countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is as clear as noonday that what horrible misfortune and pain will bring to humankind if Japan ignites a war of aggression again.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is, indeed, a destabilizing factor and fascist state in the East as it is creating military tension in Asia and gravely threatening world peace and security.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is that the UK is joining in the criminal moves of the Japanese reactionaries. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The UK's intention to let its fighter jets fly in the sky above the areas around the Korean Peninsula thousands of kilometers away from its mainland is a very dangerous action zealously spurring Japan's militarization and helping realize its ambition for reinvasion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The UK suffered huge damage due to fascism in the last century and was subject to disgrace of offering cannon fodder to the U.S. during the Korean War. However, it is acting in concert with Japan under the baton of the U.S. again, oblivious of the lesson taught by history. This is an act of tarnishing its image itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t And it is as good as betraying the international community opposed to fascism and war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's above-said moves will only face stronger rebuff and opposition from the peoples of Asia and the rest of the world."

            "content": "RPDC eliminara causa raigal del peligro de guerra nuclear, afirma Ri Yong Ho\r\nPyongyang, 24 de septiembre (ACNC) -- En el 71o periodo de sesiones de la Asamblea General de la ONU, pronuncio un discurso el dia 23 el ministro de Relaciones Exteriores, Ri Yong Ho, quien preside la delegacion de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\tAnte todo, expreso la esperanza de que la presente reunion con el tema de \"Metas de Desarrollo Sostenible: Un Impulso Universal para Transformar Nuestro Mundo\" haga un aporte significativo a promover el desarrollo pacifico y la prosperidad de todos los paises. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa paz y la seguridad son el tema permanente de la ONU y el desarrollo sostenible tambien las toma como premisa, comenzo el ministro y continuo: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn estos momentos en que la ONU aspira a la transformacion para el desarrollo sostenible, se levanta en el mundo la oleada de terrorismo, azota la crisis de refugiados causada por los disturbios de guerra y se incrementan las zonas candentes del mundo, lejos de reducirse. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa mas candente es la Peninsula Coreana que entrana hasta el peligro de guerra nuclear. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo la sociedad internacional ve todos los anos, la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana se encuentra a menudo en el estado controlable debido a EE.UU. que libra sin parar los ejercicios de guerra de agresion en la Peninsula Coreana y su contorno sin abandonar su politica hostil a la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido a las brutales maniobras de dominio e intervencion de las fuerzas imperialistas encabezadas por EE.UU. en la arena internacional, se desprecian abiertamente ahora los principios fundamentales de relaciones internacionales, reconocidos en el mundo, y la justicia se criminaliza como lo injusto segun los intereses de potencias imperialistas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En el trato del problema de la Peninsula Coreana, el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU disimula con la cortina de la ONU el despotismo y las arbitrariedades de EE.UU. faltando a la injusticia y al derecho internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En la reciente XVII Cumbre de los Paises No Alineados, se aprobo la Declaracion de Margarita que denuncia las unilaterales medidas coercitivas que se instituyen y se aplican contra los paises miembros del movimiento violando la Carta de la ONU, las leyes internacionales, especialmente, el derecho a la autodeterminacion, la independencia y el principio de no intervencion en asuntos internos de esos paises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esto deviene la posicion comun de los paises no alineados que representan casi dos tercios de toda la plantilla de la ONU, es decir, la voz verdadera de la sociedad internacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa justicia internacional no se realiza espontaneamente, sino se hace posible cuando sean fuertes los paises independientes antiimperialistas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa consolidacion de las fuerzas armadas nucleares constituye la linea invariable de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras exista el pais poseedor de armas nucleares que esta en relaciones hostiles con la RPDC, la seguridad de nuestro pais y la paz de la Peninsula Coreana seran defendidas solo con el disuasivo nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tContinuaran las medidas de incremento cualitativo y cuantitativo de las fuerzas armadas nucleares para defender nuestra dignidad y derecho a sobrevivir y la verdadera paz desde la creciente amenaza de guerra nuclear de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara defender la paz y seguridad mundiales al hacer valer la verdadera justicia internacional y alcanzar las metas de desarrollo sostenible definidas por la ONU, es necesario quebrantar el caduco orden internacional en que campea la injusticia bajo el cartel de \"justicia\" y establecer el otro imparcial y justo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl gobierno de la RPDC luchara vigorosamente por eliminar de raiz el peligro de guerra nuclear, impuesto por EE.UU., apoyandose en el poderoso disuasivo nuclear, defender la paz y seguridad del planeta y realizar la desnuclearizacion del mundo."

            "content": "Vocero de CRPP critica a Ban Ki-Moon por su adhesion a la campana anti-RPDC\r\nPyongyang, 24 de septiembre (ACNC) -- En relacion con que el secretario general de la ONU se pone al frente de la campana de sancion anti-Republica Popular Democratica de Corea en confabulacion con las fuerzas conservadoras pronorteamericanas del Sur de Corea, el portavoz del Comite por la Reunificacion Pacifica de la Patria dio el dia 24 a la ACNC la siguiente respuesta:\n\t\t\t\t\tInmediatamente despues de la prueba de explosion de ojiva nuclear de la RPDC, el secretario general de la ONU, Ban Ki-Moon, concedio excepcionalmente abusando de su cargo una conferencia de prensa individual en que califico la prueba como \"cinica violacion de la resolucion de la ONU\" y la denuncio en el \"lenguaje mas fuerte\". Y en varias audiencias oficiales dijo sin vacilacion alguna unos disparates, tales como \"el Norte de Corea (RPDC) constituye una amenaza para la seguridad mundial\" y \"el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU debe tomar medidas urgentes para frenar la provocacion adicional del Norte\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste hecho demuestra claramente que aunque se ufana de su cargo, Ban Ki-Moon no pasa de ser un sirviente politico barato que no tiene ni elemental sentido de imparcialidad ni racional modo de pensar y se mueve al dictado de EE.UU. y la banda titere surcoreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, es maniaco de enfrentamiento que vino malempleando la ONU como escena politica contra la RPDC, digno pais miembro de esta organizacion internacional, en adhesion a la politica de hostilidad anti-RPDC de EE.UU. y sus satelites. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora, Ban Ki-Moon actua al frente de la campana para fomentar el ambiente anti-RPDC en la sociedad internacional con la siniestra intencion de satisfacer su anunciada ambicion politica de presentarse como candidato en las elecciones presidenciales del Sur de Corea, que tendran lugar el ano proximo, despues de terminado su mandato a finales de este ano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPuesto que no tiene el terreno de apoyo ni conoce bien la realidad surcoreana ni es politico capaz, el no tiene otro remedio que lisonjear a su amo norteamericano y a Park Geun-hye y cumplir como marioneta sus mandados. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo nos importa que el, obsesionado por el poder, reemplace o no su cargo de secretario general con el de presidente surcoreano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, tenemos en cuenta detallada su crimen de haber tomado la delantera en la campana de sancion y aplastamiento anti-RPDC en la arena de la ONU actuando como sirviente de EE.UU. y de las fuerzas conservadoras pronorteamericanas del Sur de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBan debe tener presente que pagara muy caro si sigue involucrandose en la farsa de sancion anti-RPDC en contubernio con la camarilla de Park Geun-hye para satisfacer su sucia ambicion politica. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tObservaremos con mirada rigurosa su comportamiento posterior."
