            "content": "Danger of Military Exercises of U.S. and S. Korean Puppet Armed Forces Flailed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 23 (KCNA) -- Leading newspapers today carry a military commentator's article disclosing the dangerous nature of the reckless war exercises of the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppet armed forces which may lead to confrontation and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Terming the military exercises now under way in and around south Korea a direct product of the U.S. imperialists' unchanged policy to stifle the DPRK and the Lee Myung Bak group's policy for confrontation with it, the article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already disclosed, the U.S. imperialists' policy of aggression calls for turning the world into a \"pan-American world\" in which U.S.-style democracy prevails and the U.S.-style market economic system dominates. The present Bush administration's policy to stifle the DPRK is based on this policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a matter of fact, the U.S. promises a peaceful and negotiated settlement at talks but seems to be keenly interested in unhesitatingly breaking the promise and exercising \"the strength of the U.S. without limit\" behind the scene, pursuant to this policy of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Traitor Lee Myung Bak's new policy for confrontation with the DPRK is a replica of the above-said policy of aggression of the U.S., his master. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He is uttering sugar-coated words, calling fellow countrymen in the north those the south should get reconciled and cooperate with while talking about \"co-existence and co-prosperity.\" But behind the scene, he is crying out for the policy of confrontation with the north and the theory of war of aggression against it after labeling the fellow countrymen in the north \"principal enemy.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a natural result of this policy that the traitor steeped in the bitterness toward the DPRK to the marrow of his bones has become frantic recently in saber-rattling targeted against fellow countrymen while egging the puppet Defense Ministry on to justify the policies pursued by the successive military dictatorial regimes as ones that \"checked the activities of pro-north leftist forces\" and \"contributed to the modernization of the nation\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unending war exercises are, in all aspects, a product of the policy of aggression and the theory of war against the DPRK pursued by the master and the servant, and an open racket of military confrontation aimed at \"tightening south Korea-U.S. alliance.\"\r\n Herein lies the danger of the saber-rattling staged by the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The military maneuvers being staged in and around south Korea are part of the master and the servant's war preparations aimed at finally examining the feasibility of the already rounded off strategy and operational plan for aggression on the DPRK in direction of tightening the \"alliance.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' strategy for a war of aggression on the DPRK has been perfectly rounded off after undergoing several phases of amendment and supplementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This war strategy precisely means a \"strategy for a preemptive attack\" and a \"shock and awe strategy\" veiled with \"prevention strategy\" which had already been applied on a trial basis to other countries including Iraq for the aggression of them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppets have carefully worked out detailed operational plans to swallow up the DPRK according to this strategy with various situations into due consideration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the war exercises that have escalated going beyond the tolerance limit in south Korea since Lee Myung Bak came to power are aimed to reexamine the feasibility of all the operational plans and enhance the joint and combined operational capabilities of the U.S. imperialist aggression troops and units of the puppet forces based on them and finally round off the overall preparations for a war of aggression now that the \"issue of tightening the alliance\" is high on the agenda. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Herein lies greater danger of the saber-rattling of the U.S. imperialists and the puppets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said war exercises now under way in and around south Korea are the maneuvers staged under the simulated conditions of an actual war with huge U.S. aggression troops and three services of the south Korean puppet armed forces as well as various type nuclear strike means involved under the pretext of \"tightening the alliance\" for aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is none other than the heinous U.S. imperialists and the Lee group who are openly pursuing the hostile policy toward the DPRK while pressurizing the DPRK to dismantle its nuclear weapons unilaterally after throwing away the agreement of the six-party talks and even the principle of \"action for action\" based on it recognized by the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are mobilizing huge aggression troops and shipping various type nuclear strike means, timed to coincide with such moves, in a bid to make a nuclear war to be launched by them an established fact. This betrays even greater danger of their war exercises. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these moves go to clearly prove that the ruckus of \"tightened alliance\" and war exercises being staged by Lee together with his American master are an act of evidently swimming against the trend of the times and an outright challenge to the desire and demand of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an unpardonable traitorous and anti-peace action to continue staging dangerous war exercises under the pretext of \"threat\" from someone and \"security\", still seized with the concept of confrontation dating back to the Cold War era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Aggressors are bound to meet merciless punishment by the army of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists and traitor Lee Myung Bak would be well advised to clearly understand that all DPRK-targeted war exercises aimed at \"tightened alliance\" are hideous and traitorous crimes going against reunification and peace as they quell all the Koreans' desires and wishes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lee should bear in mind that if all the people are killed and the whole territory turns into a debris due to confrontation and war, Lee himself will not be able to survive, much less achieving \"co-existence and co-prosperity\" so much touted by him. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean Warmongers' Distortion of History under Fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 23 (KCNA) -- The Lee Myung Bak group will have to pay dearly for the reckless anti-DPRK confrontation racket aimed at blocking the north-south reconciliation and unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Tuesday warns this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Accusing the south Korean puppet military of working hard with bloodshot eyes to fan up confrontation with the DPRK, the commentary notes: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is evidenced by the fact that the south Korean \"Ministry of National Defence\" submitted a \"25-point proposal\" for revising history textbooks for high schools to the \"Ministry of Education, Science and Technology\" under the pretext of strengthening \"anti-communist and security education,\" claiming that \"leftist tendency\" was observed in some history textbooks. What should not to be overlooked is the fact that the puppet military malignantly slandered the system of the DPRK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean military group seeks to whitewash the crime-woven history of fascist rule enforced by the erstwhile dictatorial regimes, characterized by sycophancy towards the U.S., treachery, mass killings of patriotic people and hideous human rights abuses, and advertise the fascist rule as \"an unavoidable measure taken against the north.\" They have gone the lengths of kicking up a racket of confrontation, defaming even the political system of the dignified DPRK. This is touching off irrepressible resentment among the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean puppet military's reckless actions are a grave politically motivated provocation to the DPRK and traitorous criminal acts to stir up atmosphere of confrontation with the DPRK in south Korean society and drive the inter-Korean relations into uncontrollable bankruptcy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The puppet military has nothing to do with the issue of history textbooks for high schools in south Korea. Nevertheless, it is keen to meddle in this issue and retrogressively revise the textbooks, linking them with the DPRK. This brings to light the treacherous nature of the puppet military hell-bent on confrontation with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that traitor Lee Myung Bak is sticking to the policy of confrontation with the DPRK veiled with the watchword of \"pragmatism,\" it is obvious that his underlings are not in a position to say anything different from his words and all the \"government\" officials have no option but to pursue reactionary conservatism and confrontation with the DPRK. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Acting upon the above-said scenario for territorial expansion, ships of Japan's Maritime \"Self-Defence Force\" are now keen to intrude into and occupy the islet, thus rendering the situation in the East Sea of Korea tense. This clearly indicates who is posing threat and who is exposed to threat as far as the relations between the DPRK and Japan are concerned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government emphasized the need to institute a \"permanent law\" for dispatching the SDF overseas in the \"defence white paper\". It is aimed to justify its military aggression of any part of the world any time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's evermore frantic moves to stifle the DPRK in conspiracy with the U.S. would only heighten the vigilance and resentment at Japan among the Korean people and compel them to bolster up their armed forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to stop its foolish moves for reinvasion.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

And he hoped that Korea would be reunified peacefully in the interests of all the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain (Marxist-Leninist) noted that the Korean people have made a dynamic advance under the wise leadership of President Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il.
