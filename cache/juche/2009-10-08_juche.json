This was the most unpardonable illegal act against humanity in history and the most hideous crime against the Korean nation and its state as it was an organized brigandish infringement upon its sovereignty and dignity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t More than a century has passed since the \"Ulmi Incident\". However, the Japanese reactionaries are foolish enough to try to keep the truth behind the incident buried into oblivion forever. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With nothing can the Japanese imperialists hide the criminal assassination of Empress Min. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The desperate efforts on the part of Japan to distort the blood-stained history of Korean aggression and evade the responsibility for the crimes committed in the past would only touch off bitterer hatred for Japan among the Korean people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan would be well advised to properly understand the Korean people's bitterness towards Japan and their spirit of national independence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They will certainly force Japan to pay for the past crimes it committed against the Korean nation century after century."

He formulated a plan to set up a revolutionary vanguard organization for the anti-Japanese national liberation struggle and formed the Down-with-Imperialism Union (DIU) in October 1926.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The formation of the DIU marked the starting point for founding a Juche-oriented revolutionary party in a unique way. Its programme was the basis of the programme of the WPK, its principle was that of the Party construction and activities and the revolutionaries of the new generation brought up by the DIU became the backbone of the Party foundation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The President indicated a unique way for the foundation of the revolutionary Party, putting forward the Juche-motivated line of the Korean revolution at the Kalun meeting in June 1930.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The President said at the meeting that they should found a new revolutionary party by themselves without fail and that basic party organizations should be formed first and then the party be founded by the method of expanding and strengthening them constantly and the preparatory work for its foundation done in close combination with the anti-Japanese struggle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The President formed in early July 1930 the Society for Rallying Comrades, the first party organization, which was the origin of the WPK, and expanded it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a result, the party organization was formed with members of the revolutionary organizations in the area of Onsong in early October of 1930 and many basic party organizations came into being within armed ranks and in the area of East Manchuria nearby the River Tuman and in the northern border area in a short span of time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Right after reorganizing the Anti-Japanese People's Guerrilla Army into the Korean People's Revolutionary Army (KPRA) in March 1934, the President took measures of instituting the party committee of the KPRA so as to control and guide local party organizations as well as the party organizations of all levels in the army units.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Therefore, party organizations were formed in the units of the KPRA and the vast areas inside and outside the country and linked with the headquarters of the Korean revolution in an organizational way, with the result that the party's leadership over the overall Korean revolution was realized with success.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Indeed, the accomplishment of the cause of founding the Juche-oriented revolutionary Party in a unique way will shine long as a great feat performed by the President for the first time in the history."
