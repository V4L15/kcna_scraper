It was rebuilt in a peculiar and grand style as befits the mausoleum of the founding father of the Korean nation in architectural point of view. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Stone statues of the four sons of King Tangun and the subjects close to the king are standing on both sides of the stone steps leading up to the mausoleum of the central section and a stone table, a stone incense burner and stone sculptures of tigers are around the mausoleum on the platform. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Erected at the four corners of the central section are four bronze dagger towers depicting the Pipha-shaped dagger, the symbolic weapon of Kojoson, and there are in the mausoleum room the remains of King Tangun and his wife and the king's portrait. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Going round the section of the monument to the rebuilding of the mausoleum, the visitors deeply feel the patriotism of President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il who found the founding father of the Korean nation and wisely guided the rebuilding of the mausoleum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Among the visitors were over 20,000 figures and people of all walks of life from south Korea, overseas compatriots and foreigners. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Koreans and overseas compatriots said in unison that the mausoleum was a national treasure pronounced in national character as it houses the remains of the king and has historical contents showing the developed cultur e and the political, economic and military might of Korea in the Tangun era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Foreigners from five continents including a FAO delegation and a delegation of the \"Boat of Peace\" of Japan, after going round the mausoleum, said with great admiration that it well represented the time-honored history, wisdom and spirit of the Korean nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun Friday says this in a signed lengthy article.\r\n The article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary culture created by servicepersons includes the best contents of the culture created by the working masses throughout a long history. It is the acme of culture aimed to fully realize the independent aspiration and desire of the working class. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said culture was created at a time when the revolutionary soldier spirit was highly displayed among the servicepersons of the Korean People's Army and the cultural standard and ideological world of the people got nobler and more beautiful on the pattern of the army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Cheerful art performances given by KPA companies and art presentations made by officers' families whose repertoires include numbers dealing with everyday common life by use of simple musical instruments, etc. represent a model of popular culture and art in the Songun era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even under the conditions where they have to defend the country and carry out socialist construction simultaneously, the servicepersons set an example of the revolutionary and emotional way of living to be followed by all members of the society.\r\n Many monumental edifices built by them are flawless in terms of architectural and cultural levels. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Revolutionary soldier trait and the soldiers' cultural and emotional way of living are in full bloom in all parts of the country thanks to the example set by the servicepersons and the positive influence exerted by the discharged soldiers now active at the sites of socialist construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary culture created by soldiers serves as a powerful weapon for reliably defending the socialist ideological and cultural position of the DPRK from the U.S. imperialists' ideological and cultural offensive and building noble, sound and beautiful culture that meets the intrinsic need of man while rejecting all manifestations of decadent and reactionary culture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and the people of the DPRK will surely build a great prosperous powerful nation and emerge victorious in the ideological and cultural confrontation with the U.S. imperialists as they have such a powerful weapon as the revolutionary culture created by the soldiers.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean Ultra-right Conservatives' Anti-DPRK Campaign Assailed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 29 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland in an answer given to a question put by KCNA Thursday accused the ultra-right conservative forces in south Korea including the Grand National Party of becoming more desperate in their moves to stir up hostility toward the DPRK after the \"North Korean Human Rights Act\" took effect in the U.S.:\r\n No sooner had the Bush group effectuated the act in its bid to destabilize the DPRK and stoke confrontation between fellow countrymen in the north and the south of Korea than the GNP convened a meeting of executives of the party at which it actively supported the effectuation of the act in the U.S. \r\nIt is now behaving as if it had been waiting for this event to take place, blustering that it would force the National Assembly to adopt a resolution urging the improvement of human rights performance in the north in step with the effectuation of the act. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those who are engrossed in their smear campaign to abduct \"north Korean defectors\" going under the mask of a \"civilian organization\" are now fighting a fierce dog-fight to receive more money from the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, reckless remarks calling for taking a positive approach toward the human rights issue in the north, not keeping mum about it any longer are also heard from the south Korean authorities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"North Korean Human Rights Act\" is a provocative war act whose aim is to destabilize the north over the \"issue of north Korean defectors\", check the progress of the era that came to the Korean Peninsula after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration and incite confrontation and war between Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Acting in accordance with this act is a total negation of the June 15 joint declaration as it leads to confrontation and war on the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP is a group of hideous human rights abusers and fascist hooligans who are not entitled to talk about human rights as it has wantonly violated the elementary freedom and right of people on the strength of the evil \"National Security Law\" in south Korea holding the position of ruling political party for scores of years there. It is actually ludicrous for it to talk about the human rights issue of the north under such situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP and other pro-U.S. conservative elements had better apologize for the human rights abuses they have committed for the past scores of years and stop anti-DPRK smear campaigns before talking about the human rights issue of the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those who are engrossed in a dog-fight to receive a few dollars from the U.S. going under the signboard of a \"civilian organization\" are sure to be sternly punished for their act as they have conducted a smear anti-DPRK psychological operation while amassing what they called \"north Korean defectors\" and taking them to south Korea from a third country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK can not but take a serious note of the fact that the south Korean authorities are showing a tendency to chime in with the U.S. smear campaign over the \"north Korean human rights issue.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should clarify their stand of whether they would implement the June 15 joint declaration or bring the scourge of war to this land pursuant to the act. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only a miserable self-destruction awaits those who are supporting the U.S. in its moves for confrontation with the DPRK despite the fact that the U.S. is keen to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and perpetrate aggression and war against them.    \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Issues Indictment\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 29 (KCNA) -- KCNA issued a lengthy indictment on Oct. 28 in which it termed the United States the most cruel and despicable \"empire of evil\" and laid bare its bestial nature and miserable fate during the four years of the Bush administration in office.\r\n It branded \"Bush doctrine\" on which the present policy of the Bush administration is based as the most dangerous trend of imperialism in the present times as it aims to build a world dominated by an empire, an empire lording it over the world, by aggression, plunder, the use of force and high-handed practices. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The document dealt with the motive of the advocacy of \"Bush doctrine,\" new trend of imperialism, and how it was adopted as a policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bush advocated \"American-style internationalism\" which calls for demonstrating to the world its strength and authority as a diplomatic doctrine of the new administration in February 2001. Then followed the emergence of such brigandish logic based on \"strength-all mighty theory\" and unilateralism allegedly reflecting the \"peculiarities of the U.S.\" \"Bush doctrine\" formally appeared as a new trend of imperialism in the wake of the \"September 11 incident.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Right after the incident Bush became so impudent as to urge all the regions and countries either to side with the U.S. or stand by terrorism. His outcry became a basis of \"Bush theory,\" a theory of war which listed not only individual groups but sovereign states as targets of \"anti-terrorism war.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn line with this theory the Bush administration designated imaginary \"enemy\" called \"terrorist\" and declared to the world unilateral criteria to discriminate between friend and foe by the logic you will be my enemy if you don't support me and to retaliate against him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In 2002 the Bush group worked hard to formally adopt the new trend of imperialism as its policy as evidenced by the fact that the theory of \"axis of evil\" was spelled out at the end of January and there emerged in June of the same year \"theory of preemptive attack\" \"Bush doctrine\" being its core. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThese were adopted as a state policy and strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"theory of preemptive attack\" and \"Bush doctrine\" based on it are the worst theory of aggression and the most dangerous trend of imperialism in the history of the preceding empires. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialistic nature of Bush doctrine and its gravity are unthinkable apart from neo-conservatism. Bush doctrine is the other side of neo-conservatism and its development because it is a brainchild of the despicable political hooligans who took the lead in the movement for fascistization against communism in the U.S. in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The neo-conservatives' dominationist view on the world that what the U.S. does is all right and strength only represents justice, a megalomaniac idea of preaching a jungle law, was enunciated by neo-conservative forces of the Bush administration as Bush doctrine and this served as an ideological basis of the \"empire of evil\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush group retrieved such conceptions of world domination by the U.S. as \"Pax Americana\" (conception of U.S.-led peace) and the theory of \"bankrupt state\" from the dumping ground of history to use them as a leverage to support Bush doctrine. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Arrogance, aggressive nature, cruelty and wickedness are characteristic of the \"empire of evil,\" the nature of \"Bush doctrine.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"war against terrorism\" desperately fought by the Bush administration during its term was based on Bush doctrine, a contemporary trend of imperialism, the indictment said, disclosing the crimes committed by the U.S. under the pretext of combating terrorism. It went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The September 11 incident and the \"war on terrorism\" waged by Bush group in its wake is a continuation of the plot-breeding operation conducted by empires in the past to realize their wild ambitions. The Bush group is little different from the rulers of the erstwhile empires in war hysteria. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. \"anti-terrorist war\" is precisely the other side of brigandish state-sponsored terrorism and the slogan of \"anti-terrorism\" put up by the Bush group is nothing but a fig-leaf to cover up its state-sponsored terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The number of cases of terrorism of various forms that occurred worldwide in 2003 alone when the U.S. \"war against terrorism\" raged most furiously totaled 3,213, an all-time high. The vicious cycle of terror and retaliation is a product of \"Bush doctrine\" and his group can never evade responsibility for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The indictment cited the most hideous and monstrous abuse of POWs perpetrated by GIs in Iraq, Afghanistan and other countries and regions in an organized and premeditated way in the course of \"combating terrorism\" as evidence proving that the U.S. is the worst human rights violator and a rogue regime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Recalling that the Bush administration formally declared its withdrawal from the ABM Treaty, an obstacle to its establishment of the missile defense system, and deliberately reduced \"Kyoto Protocol\" to a dead document, thus overturning the international legal mechanism, the indictment went on: This hooliganism can be perpetrated only by the \"empire of evil.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Moreover, the Bush administration has persistently refused to sign the CTBT, thus fully betraying its true colours as the arch criminal proliferating weapons of mass destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush forces have attained their main goal of throwing a dense network of their military bases all over the world through their \"anti-terrorism war.\" At present the U.S. has 702 bases in nearly 130 countries and more than 6,000 military bases in its mainland and the territories under its domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the crimes committed by the \"empire of evil\" while fighting \"anti-terrorism war\" are unpardonable and indelible as they have brought horrible disasters to humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Conservative politicians and reptile media in the U.S. are becoming very zealous in their efforts to paint the U.S. as a \"new empire\" but the world once again teaches the historical lesson that the days of the empire are numbered. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that the \"empire of evil,\" the \"American empire\" is destined to go to ruin just as the Nazi empire of Hitler did, the indictment observed, citing fair world public opinion proving the truth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Imperialism is the filth of history as it has lived out its days. It is a miscalculation and a fantastic daydream for the Bush group to revive the era of the outrageous and arrogant empire, swimming against the trend of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world will no longer remain an onlooker to the arbitrary and reckless moves of the \"empire of evil\" to disturb peace and human civilization but mete out a stern judgment to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. conservative hard-liners would be well advised to bear this in mind and stop acting rashly.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
