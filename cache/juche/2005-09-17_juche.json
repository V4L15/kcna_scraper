            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on Ever-Triumphant Songun Idea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 16 (KCNA) -- The Songun idea serves as an all-powerful treasured sword and an eternal banner for the victory of the revolutionary cause of Juche. The principle for making a revolution in reliance upon an army has been the core and starting point of all kinds of the Juche-oriented line and principles, strategy and tactics and leadership methods of the Korean revolution. Rodong Sinmun Friday says this in an editorial article.\r\n The Songun idea tested in the rigorous tests of history has demonstrated its vitality as an invincible revolutionary banner in the course of glorifying the new era of the Juche revolution as the era of Songun, the article notes, and goes on: The Songun idea is a great revolutionary philosophy to realize independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea is based on the Juche idea ideologically, theoretically and methodologically. It is the idea of prizing arms and attaching priority to the military affairs as it clarifies the position and role of an army in the revolutionary struggle of the popular masses for independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army takes a key position and plays a decisive role in winning power and firmly defending it and transforming all fabrics of social life in a revolutionary manner, a role no other force can do. Power comes out of the barrel of the gun and is maintained and consolidated by the army. The army is a core force representing the national power. As seen above, an army is essential for revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An army is not a temporary force for revolution. It is the most precious treasured sword to be tightly held in the whole course of the struggle to achieve independence of the popular masses. Herein lies the essence of the philosophy on the army clarified by the Songun idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An army represents a powerful weapon for national liberation and class emancipation. It serves as the only weapon in the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle in our era.\r\n Attaching importance to the army is the most effective way of achieving independence and carving out the destiny of the popular masses. One can live without candy but not without bullets. The Songun idea serves as a treasured sword for winning a sure victory in the cause of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea has served as an invincible banner as it has indicated the most correct ways of carrying out all the tasks arising at every stage of the developing revolution in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was Songun that created a new history of national liberation from the colonial rule in Korea. \r\n The revolutionary army has fully ensured victory in the two serious and complicated social revolutions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun politics has served as an invincible treasured sword as it has brought the might of the country to the highest level in its history spanning 5,000 years.\r\n The Songun idea represents scientific guidelines as it indicated the master key to strengthening the driving force of the Korean revolution in every way.\r\n The idea laid an immovable milestone as it clarified the basic factor of invariably preserving and glorifying the Juche character of the Korean revolution.\r\n Only when advancing under the uplifted Songun banner is it possible for all generations to always preserve their revolutionary character. This is the main historical review of the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun idea is an eternal banner for winning victory in the Korean revolution.\r\n It is necessary to firmly defend the headquarters of the Songun revolution and implement the great Songun idea in a do-or-die spirit and forge ahead, holding higher the banner of anti-imperialist struggle for the victorious advance and final completion of the revolutionary cause of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Immensely rosy is the future of Songun Korea as long as there remain the unshakable idea and line of the headquarters of the revolution and there are the strong army and people who uphold them as immutable truth.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Blasted \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 16 (KCNA) -- Laporte, commander of the U.S. forces in south Korea, when interviewed by American media recently, disclosed that the United States is \"modifying its military strategy in the direction of depending on ultra-modern weapons to cope with the possible outbreak of military conflict with north Korea.\"\r\n Rodong Sinmun Friday says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Multi-faceted dialogues and cooperation are now brisk between the north and the south of Korea and the six-way talks are under way to settle the nuclear issue and put an end to the military confrontation for the purpose of building confidence. The reckless remarks made by him against this backdrop, hinting at setting out a new military strategy, cannot be construed otherwise than a revelation of the U.S. design to chill the atmosphere of inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation and provoke a war of aggression on the Korean Peninsula at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is ridiculous is his assertion that \"though the main concern of the six-way talks is focused on north Korea's nuclear capability but its conventional weapons still remain a threat that should not be ignored\". He did not bother to talk nonsense that \"he is aware of north Korea's massive stockpiling of chemical weapons and its biological weapons are under constant test.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While paying lip-service to \"dialogue\" and \"peace,\" the U.S. is pushing forward in real earnest its work to round off the preparations for a preemptive attack on the DPRK, whetting its sword for aggression behind the scene. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The noisy false propaganda launched by the U.S. to charge the DPRK with the spread of weapons of mass destruction is nothing but a plot to create an international environment for mounting a preemptive nuclear attack on it. Herein lies a sinister aim of the U.S. to list the DPRK as a \"dangerous state\" by inventing a variety of fictions such as stories about \"chemical and biological weapons\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ever-increasing danger of war on the Korean Peninsula urgently demands the withdrawal of the U.S. troops from south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States would be well advised to stop making much ado about \"threat of aggression against the south\" from somebody, an old fiction, and quit south Korea as early as possible, taking with it its aggression troops.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed article.\r\n These slogans fully reflecting the noble patriotic will and line of the Party for the reunification of the country and the nation serve as a banner of struggle and victory as they inspire all the fellow countrymen to the struggle for national reunification, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The noble patriotic will of the Party to achieve national sovereignty and exalt the dignity and honor of the nation is expressed in the joint slogans.\r\n For the Koreans nothing is more patriotic than working hard to establish sovereignty as their national sovereignty has been violated by foreign forces due to the division of the country that has lasted for the last six decades. For the 70 million Koreans to struggle for national reunification is the most patriotic one and the most vivid manifestation of love of their country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whoever cherishes patriotic desire and will should work heart and soul for national reunification, linking one's own destiny with that of the country and the nation.

The undying feats performed by the President will shine for all ages with the glorious history of the complex, he added.\r\n He dropped in at No. 1 Machine Shop to acquaint himself with the production and watch newly manufactured compressors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He highly praised the feats performed by the workers of Ryongsong, noting it is a great success that they have built modern compressors by their own efforts and technology in a short span of time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Strongly backed by many giant machine plants including the Ryongsong Machine Complex, the DPRK could successfully realize the socialist industrialization in such a short span of time and augment its economic potential at a high rate and dynamically push ahead with the building of a great prosperous powerful nation, he said, and went on: This goes to prove the validity and great vitality of the WPK's unique economic line on giving priority to the development of heavy industry with the machine-building industry as its core, while simultaneously developing light industry and agriculture.\r\n He set the goals to be attained by the complex in a few years to come and indicated tasks and ways to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe second leg of his inspection was the Hungnam Pharmaceutical Factory. \r\n He went round the monument to the on-the-spot guidance given by President Kim Il Sung and the room devoted to the history of the factory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the wise leadership and meticulous care of the President the factory could cover the road of progress as a mother factory in the nation's pharmaceutical industry, he noted, adding that the people should always remember the benevolence the President showed for them, while working heart and soul for them all his life. \r\n He learned about the equipment and production at the factory, going round its interior including compounding shops and the industrial experiment station.\r\n He underscored the need to channel great efforts into the production of medicines so that the people may fully benefit from the free medical service. \r\n What is most important in the production of medicines is to boost the production of household medicines always required by people in their life, he noted, underlining the need to pay primary attention to this matter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Calling for developing in depth the work to put the production of Koryo medicines on a scientific and industrial basis, he urged the technicians and workers in the field of pharmaceutical industry to steadily raise their scientific and technical level and, at the same time, sufficiently secure basic raw materials for the production of medicines. \r\n He stressed the need to provide the best sanitary conditions and establish the highest level of cultured practice in production as the factory turns out medicines related to people's life and indicated ways to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He set forth tasks to be fulfilled to reconstruct it on modern lines. \r\n He was accompanied by Kim Ki Nam, Pak Nam Gi and Ju Kyu Chang.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
