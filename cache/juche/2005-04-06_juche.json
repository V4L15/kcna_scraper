            "content": "U.S. Report on Human Rights and Democracy under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- Some days ago, the U.S. State Department slandered the DPRK again in its \"2004-2005 report on U.S. efforts for human rights and democracy.\"\r\n In this regard, Rodong Sinmun Tuesday in a signed commentary says: \r\n The U.S. dared talk this or that about issues of \"human rights\" and \"democracy\" in the DPRK, falsifying truth. This is an unbearable insult to the Korean people, an outrageous interference in their internal affairs and a blatant challenge to justice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is the most repressive society in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Citing concrete facts to prove that the U.S. has mercilessly cracked down upon and arrested all forms of socio-political activities of the people by fascistizing its ruling system and inhumanely abused and punished prisoners in various parts of the world, the commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is a crude violator of human rights and a strangler of freedom and democracy. The ulterior aim sought by the U.S. in vociferating about the \"improvement of human rights and democracy\" is to realize its ambition for world domination and its immediate purpose is to bring down the anti-U.S. independent countries. In a word, the U.S. seeks to tarnish the image of the above-said countries and isolate them internationally under the pretexts of the issues of \"human rights\" and \"democracy\" and instigate the counterrevolutionary elements to stoke the social confusion and discontent in a bid to force those countries to change their regimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The spearhead of its operation is directed to the DPRK. Much upset by the might of the DPRK, the Bush forces even adopted the \"North Korean Human Rights Act\" aimed at \"overturning its regime\" in a bid to escalate their criminal human rights offensive against the DPRK &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should abandon its shameless sinister intention to overthrow the anti-U.S. independent countries and achieve its ambition for world domination under the signboard of the \"improvement of human rights and democracy.\"    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This fully betrays its\r\nshameless and cunning moves to emerge a political power and realize its dream for overseas expansion by taking advantage of this position.\r\n Minju Joson Tuesday says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the fact that the Japanese Foreign Ministry recently worked out a \"diplomatic blue book\" which clarifies that the main target of Japan's diplomacy this year is to \"get permanent membership of the UNSC and make international contributions commensurate with its status, the commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has no elementary qualification to be even a member nation of the UN, much less becoming a UNSC permanent member. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The past history of Japan is recorded with bloody wars of aggression fought against humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is now working hard to repeat the above-said history, zealously whitewashing and beautifying it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should not be allowed to make a pitch for permanent membership of the UNSC in view of the international community's cool reaction to it and in the light of the purpose of the UN reform. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world should select only those responsible countries which have made great contributions to defending global peace and security and can do so in future as permanent members of the UNSC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But if permanent membership is given to such countries which persistently commit crimes against humanity in pursuit of selfish interests as Japan, it will not lead the UN to reform but to a collapse and herald its doom. This will be as clear as daylight. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the countries should ponder over the political upheaval and grave consequences to be entailed by Japan's pitch for UNSC permanent membership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's dream for this would never come true unless it totally redresses its crime-woven past history and starts with a clean slate. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

He had gone through the bitter sorrow and suffering of a ruined nation from his childhood, being subject to the severe oppression of the Japanese imperialist aggressors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He had wandered about at home and abroad, not knowing what to do before he found his leader who would indicate the right way for struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was only under the exceptional leadership of President Kim Il Sung who was hewing out the path of the Korean revolution that Cha found himself worth living as a true revolutionary and turned over a new leaf in his life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He became a member of the Down-with-Imperialism Union, a genuine revolutionary organization of Juche type formed by the President, and later a leading member of the Anti-Imperialist Youth League and the Young Communist League of Korea. And he made all his efforts for the foundation of the Korean Revolutionary Army and the Anti-Japanese People's Guerrilla Army (AJPGA) while working hard to expand the basic party organizations as a core member of the Society for Rallying Comrades which was the first party organization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the birth of the AJPGA, Cha assumed an important post of its chief of staff and assisted with heart and soul the President in his revolutionary activities for the strengthening and development of the anti-Japanese armed struggle, thus greatly contributing to pioneering the revolutionary cause of Juche and ensuring its victorious advance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He died a heroic death at a bloody battle site in Dunhua on Oct. 30, Juche 21 (1932). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter noted that he had upheld the leader of the revolution with the purest conscience and the highest sense of obligation and devoted his sincere heart of loyalty to realizing the idea and cause of the leader. His noble life was that of an ardent loyal subject who made distinguished contributions to the history of the movement of the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The heroic events in the first period of the Korean revolution--the formation of the Korean Revolutionary Army, the laying of mass foundation for the anti-Japanese armed struggle, the struggle for acquiring weapons, the foundation of the AJPGA and the start of the anti-Japanese war--were associated with the precious feats of Cha, who devoted his all to materializing the President's idea and line of giving priority to arms, upholding them as the only banner of righteous struggle of the Korean revolution, the reporter said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  He emphasized: Cha's life is a brilliant model teaching us how a revolutionary should hold his leader in esteem and live and fight for the country and the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  On the occasion of his centennial birth anniversary, wreaths were placed before his bust at the Revolutionary Martyrs Cemetery in Mt. Taesong here today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Meanwhile, Pyongyang-based newspapers Tuesday carry articles telling about his undying revolutionary feats. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
