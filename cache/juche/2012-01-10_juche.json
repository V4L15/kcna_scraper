            "content": "S. Korean Military's War Hysteria Slammed: Rodong Sinmun\r\nPyongyang, January 10 (KCNA) -- The south Korean Defense Ministry in a recent \"2012 work report\" called for maintaining \"attitude of prompt and resolute punishment\" and training \"combat-type strong forces\", alleging again \"there remains possibility of provocation\" from someone. \n\t\t\t\t\tThe military in the report specified that \"In case of enemy provocation, it will strike back the provocateurs and supporters till the threats are completely removed\", an indication of its dangerous doctrine for a war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn another development, the U.S. and the puppet forces announced they would sign the \"plan to jointly cope with a limited warfare to be provoked by somebody\" within January and start regular joint exercises from the first half of this year. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRodong Sinmun Tuesday says in a bylined commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis serious politically-motivated military provocation against the DPRK is aimed to make a fait accompli the theory of \"provocation from the north\" in a bid to justify the outbreak of a war and ignite a war against the north in collusion with outside forces at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe publication of the report amounts to a declaration of war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat should not be overlooked is that traitor Lee Myung Bak eggs on puppet warmongers to fan up hysteria.  In his recent \"special New Year address on state policy\" he blared that a \"strong counteraction will be taken at a time of provocation\", crying out for adoption of \"impregnable security posture\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe puppet military was known to have decided to additionally deploy various watch and precision striking means on the five islands in the West Sea under the pretext of \"increasing the capabilities to defend the islands in the northwestern area\". The military is also set to strengthen the \"troop information and education\" to help soldiers \"establish the view on security\" under the pretext of \"liquidation of forces subjugated to the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBut, this is the last-ditch efforts of those whose days are numbered. There is no way out for the group of traitors. The enraged Korean nation will mete out stern punishment to them."

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun critica informe de trabajo del ministerio surcoreano\r\nPyongyang, 10 de enero (ACNC) -- Hace pocos dias, el Ministerio de Defensa del Sur de Corea apunto en su \"informe de trabajo de 2012\" que \"queda todavia la posibilidad de provocacion\" de alguien y que \"formaria un poderoso ejercito combativo\" manteniendo la \"disposicion de represalia inmediata y rotunda\". E inserto en ese informe esta doctrina de guerra: \"en el caso de la provocacion de enemigos, hay que responder resueltamente a ella y atacar las fuentes de provocacion y a las fuerzas de apoyo hasta que fuera eliminada completamente la amenaza\". \n\t\t\t\t\tPor otra parte, Estados Unidos y los titeres surcoreanos anunciaron oficialmente que firmaran dentro de enero el \"plan de operaciones conjuntas para hacer frente a la provocacion local\" y libraran periodicamente los correspondientes ejercicios conjuntos desde el primer semestre del ano en curso. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl diario Rodong Sinmun, en un comentario individual de este martes, lo califica de otra grave provocacion politica y militar contra la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsos pasos parten de la aventurera intencion de la cupula militar surcoreana de justificar sus acciones belicistas y desatar sin falta la guerra de agresion contra la RPDC en contubernio con las fuerzas extranjeras haciendo hecho consumado la supuesta \"provocacion del Norte\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl citado informe de trabajo es precisamente la declaracion de guerra contra la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo que no se puede pasar por alto es que el traidor Lee Myung Bak fomenta al frente el belicismo de sus subordinados militares. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn su reciente \"discurso especial de la politica estatal para el Ano Nuevo\", Lee disparateo sin titubeo que \"tomaria fuertes contramedidas en el caso de provocacion\" hablando de la \"firme disposicion de seguridad\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun trascendidos, la capa militar surcoreana decidio emplazar adicionalmente este ano en los alrededores de las cinco islas del Mar Oeste los medios de vigilancia y de ataque a precision de todo tipo pretextando el \"mejoramiento de la capacidad defensiva de las islas del noroeste\" e intensificar la \"educacion politica\" para los soldados para \"establecerles la concepcion de seguridad\" bajo el rotulo de \"eliminar a las fuerzas seguidoras al Norte\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, todo eso no pasa de ser el ultimo coletazo de los que tienen los dias contados. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda del traidor Lee no tiene salida y sera condenada severamente por la indignada nacion coreana."
