            "content": "Hay que mantener principio de igualdad, insiste Rodong Sinmun\r\nPyongyang, 7 de agosto (ATCC) -- Las relaciones entre los Estados deben ser iguales, ocurra lo que ocurra, y establecidas en el principio de reciprocidad.\n\t\t\t\t\tSenala el diario Rodong Sinmun en un articulo individual fechado 7 y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl principio del particular es la regla principal de actividades a ser mantenida sin falta en las relaciones mutuas entre los paises y una de las guias generales de las actividades exteriores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando no se mantiene este principio de igualdad,  se vera violada la soberania de los paises en la escena internacional y se crearan las relaciones de dominacion y subyugacion, o sea, las de desigualdad entre los paises. Tambien se permitiran el despotismo y la arbitrariedad de algunos paises, lo cual obstaculizara la democratizacion de la sociedad internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy dia, algunos paises pretenden mantener el desigual y caduco orden internacional apoyandose en sus superiores potencias militares y economicas. Por lo tanto, se presenta mas apremiante el problema de mantener el principio de igualdad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl no materializar el principio en cuestion basado en la independencia en las relaciones internacionales, la humanidad progresista no puede liberarse del lazo de la dominacion y la subyugacion de los imperialistas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi todos los paises y naciones mantienen este principio en las relaciones internacionales, sera posible establecer y desarrollar las relaciones de cooperacion, beneficio mutuo y la no intervencion en los asuntos internos entre aquellos. Con ello, se garantizara con firmeza y se consolidara la soberania de los paises y las naciones, y a la larga, se construira un nuevo mundo independiente, pacifico y amistoso.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa Republica Popular Democratica de Corea ha venido abogando por el desarrollo de las relaciones internacionales basadas en el principio de igualdad  de la independencia y esforzandose activamente por su realizacion. Tambien en el futuro luchara dinamicamente por mantener susodicho principio en las relaciones entre los Estados y por el desarrollo de las imparciales relaciones internacionales."
