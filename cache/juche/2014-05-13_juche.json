            "content": "We Will Finally Settle Accounts with Park Geun Hye Group: NDC of DPRK\r\n Pyongyang, May 13 (KCNA) -- The National Defence Commission (NDC) of the DPRK Tuesday released a crucial report in which it declared it would finally settle accounts with the vicious Park Geun Hye group of hooligans.\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park Geun Hye group on Monday let idiot-like spokesman of the puppet Ministry of Defense Kim Min Sok make an official appearance to term the just demand made by the inspection group of the NDC of the DPRK again for clarifying the story about the \"north's involvement\" in the drone case and making a joint investigation into it a far-fetched assertion that makes a profound confusion of the right and wrong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Min Sok shouted hoarse to dare slander the DPRK as a \"country that can hardly be called a country\" and \"a country bereft of human rights and freedom\". He went the lengths of talking such rubbish that \"it is a country which should disappear at an early date\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The crucial report of the NDC of the DPRK denounced this as an intolerable challenge to the DPRK and the height of confrontation with fellow countrymen in the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has never recognized south Korea as a normal sovereign state as its name the \"Republic of Korea\" is a copy of the name of the country that existed in the closing period of the Feudal Joson Dynasty which was on the decline being chopped to pieces at the hands of big powers because of its flunkeyism and treachery, the report said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet forces of south Korea, a colony where they have the prerogative over the army, a basic criteria of a sovereign state, usurped by the U.S. and find themselves in such a poor position in which they have to eat without complaint beef infected with mad cow disease offered by the U.S. and suffer from high fever being caught by a cold if the U.S. makes a cough.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Hye, who claims to be \"president\", has to stammer out American English when she is in the U.S. to play the coquette with her American master. Only then can she be regarded as a faithful dog and servant. This is the wretched plight of south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That's why we have long regarded south Korea as a group of puppets and colonial servants who are steeped in dependence on outsiders and treachery to the marrow of their bones. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Stressing that the DPRK can never overlook the fact that such guys dared point an accusing finger at the DPRK, the most dignified country in the world, the crucial report continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is also pitiful to see the south Korean puppet forces making a false show of power after pinning their hope on their U.S. master's such common war hardware as assault fighters, aircraft carriers and guided missiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK doesn't hide that it possesses strike means more powerful than all the latest war hardware noisily advertised by the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a resolution already made by the DPRK to force the enemies to pay a dear price whenever an opportunity presents itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We cannot but take a serious note of such reckless remarks made by Kim as he termed the DPRK \"a country which should disappear as early as possible\", unaware of such a reality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such reckless remarks have never been made in the distress-torn history of national division.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What the Park group uttered this time cannot be construed otherwise than a total denial of compatriots in the north, an undisguised revelation of its wild ambition to achieve the \"unification by absorption\" and a declaration of all-out confrontation of the social systems.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The baneful consequences to be entailed by these reckless outbursts can be neither retrieved nor put under control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the service personnel and people of the DPRK and the mindset of all other Koreans are strongly calling for wiping the Park group out of this land as it didn't hesitate to perpetrate thrice-cursed treason.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group will have to keenly feel what miserable consequences it will face for its vitriol."

Korean Ministry of Defense\r\n Pyongyang, May 13 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) released a statement on Tuesday in denunciation of the anti-DPRK invectives let loose by the spokesman for the south Korean puppet Ministry of Defense.\n\t\t\t\t\t It said: On Monday spokesman for the south Korean puppet Ministry of Defense called Kim Min Sok, an idiot, at a regular news briefing went the lengths of daring defame the inviolable sovereignty of the DPRK, not content with pulling up it again over the \"case of drones from the north\" recently cooked up by the south Korean regime. This was nothing but a ridiculous charade.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement ridiculed what he uttered as nothing but the last-ditch effort as it only brought to light the wretched plight of the Park regime desperately working to tide over its worsening ruling crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group is now finding itself in the worst ruling crisis due to the ferry disaster unprecedented in history, etc., the statement said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thrown into extreme fear and uneasiness, Park and her yes-men are desperately pulling up the DPRK like a rabid dog in a bid to get rid of their pretty fix. They seem to ignite even a war. However, this is as foolish an act as jumping into fire with faggot on their back.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. styling itself the world's only superpower though it is acting boss of hooligans dares not provoke the DPRK while regarding the latter as a thorn in its flesh. But the hordes of bumpkins led by country woman Park dares point an accusing finger at the DPRK. This has become a big laughing stock of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Min Sok talked such rubbish that the \"country should no longer exist\" but people are comparing the DPRK which is dashing by leaps and bounds toward an ideal country where all people lead luxury under socialism thanks to the great politics of loving care for the people and the rising generations with south Korea which has turned into a mourner's house after being reduced to a hell cursed by the people. They are quite clear which \"country\" should exist and which regime should disappear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Idiots like Kim Min Sok should clearly understand that Chongwadae of south Korea and its colonial system will have to disappear in face of strikes to be entailed by their reckless tongue wagging.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park should immediately and severely punish Kim Min Sok and his manipulators who dared point an accusing finger at the DPRK, if she wants to prolong her remaining days even a bit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Otherwise, Chongwadae, to say nothing of the puppet Ministry of Defense, will never be able to go scot-free but be forced to pay a very high price."

They said they felt as if they were entering a deluxe hotel and a wonderland. Happy laughter is heard from those facilities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That is why they sing the song \"We are the happiest in the world.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the fate of children in south Korea is quite different from this.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ferry Sewol sank, claiming lives of many teenagers. The sky above south Korea is, therefore, overcast with dark clouds.

The cries of those bereaved families who attempt to commit suicide to join their dead children and wailing of other parents are heard not only from Phaengmok Port but also from other parts of south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ferry Sewol tragedy will be followed by other disasters in south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Everybody in south Korea is suffering from a nightmare under the rule of Park Geun Hye. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the south Koreans including schoolchildren cannot sleep in peace as south Korea is threatened with ceaseless disasters similar to the sinking of the ferry Sewol. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The disaster of the ferry Sewol shows the real picture of the corrupt and ailing society under the misrule of Park Geun Hye. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Had the south Korean authorities taken proper measures to rescue victims from the very moment of the accident, they would have minimized the casualties and shortened the time for rescue operation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The despicable nature of the corrupt south Korean society was brought to light. The captain was the first to leave the ferry and the \"president\" did not make any proper apology for the huge disaster. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Hye held a meeting of senior secretaries of Chongwadae a few days after the disaster but she was busy shifting the blame for the accident onto the inferiors, talking about \"system for dealing with crisis\". She branded the assertion that the sinking of the ferry Sewol was caused by the rapid change of route due to war drills as a wild rumor. She also blustered it was a \"sinister intention\" to spark a social chaos and cried out for pursuing those who spread such rumor to the last so that they be \"held accountable for it.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She behaved so recklessly as to invite the U.S. president to tour south Korea which turned into a veritable mourner's house and host a banquet for him, far from making much effort for rescue operation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet authorities and public officials went round the scene of the rescue operation, copying the practice of their master. However, they attempted to have a photo taken before the list of the victims, utterly indifferent to the sorrow of the bereaved families. They let loose such invectives against the bereaved families and people holding them responsible for the accident, claiming that their demand \"is politically motivated and they are \"uncivilized people\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The ferry Sewol disaster was a product of the unpopular rule of Park Geun Hye. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The dignity and political rights of south Koreans are now trampled down and they are deprived of even elementary right to existence under the fascist rule of the conservative forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The social evils of the rich getting ever richer and the poor getting ever poorer have become serious and the living of inhabitants is in distress in south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Education has been commercialized to be a lever for profiteers' money-making and a lot of university students are saddled with huge debts due to the snowballing registration fees. Streets and lanes are flooded with the unemployed and the number of those who commit suicide due to abject destitution is on the annual increase. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, the puppet Intelligence Service, military, prosecution, police and other power bodies and the right-wing conservative media have reduced the south Korean society to a huge prison without bars and tundra of democracy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not only south Korean media but also foreign media, describing the tragic reality of south Korea, claim that \"an era of barbarians has come and the Park Geun Hye regime is leading south Korea to the era of dictatorship.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality of south Korea where the ruling crisis is evermore deepening after the ferry Sewol disaster goes to prove the inevitable doom of the group of traitors. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sinking of the Park regime is the inevitability of history."

Parece que ellos desaten la  guerra contra la RPDC, lo cual deviene una estupidez al igual que meterse en la boca de lobo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHasta EE.UU., autodenominado como unica superpotencia, no se atreve a atacar a la RPDC aunque la considera como espina en su garganta. Pero, un grupo de cobardes dirigidos por Park trata de atentar la RPDC, lo que causa solo las risas burlonas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta vez, Kim Min Sok chismeo que la \"RPDC debe ser eliminada\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, esta claro cuales son el \"pais\" y el \"gobierno\" a ser desaparecidos en este mundo al comparar la situacion del Sur de Corea que se hunde en el infierno por el repudio de las opiniones publicas, y el aspecto maravilloso de la RPDC que avanza con firmeza hacia un mundo ideal donde todo el pueblo goza a sus anchas de la opulencia socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay que darse clara cuenta de que \"Chongwadae\" y el regimen colonial del Sur de Corea son los que deben ser eliminados por rafagas de fuego.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara mantener el resto de su vida, Park debe castigar severamente a Kim y sus manipuladores que se atrevieron a difamar la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el caso contrario, el Ministerio titere de Defensa Nacional y hasta la \"Chongwadae\" no podran estar a salvo."
