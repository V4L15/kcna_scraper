Rodong Sinmun says this in a signed commentary Saturday.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP has prolonged its remaining days citing the confrontation with the DPRK as a pretext to cross over every crisis. It is well known to everyone that this party noisily talked about \"remittance to the north\" faked up by the U.S. during the last presidential  election campaign in a bid to take the initiative in handling the political situation. It also pushed the inter-Korean relations to those of confrontation by brandishing the sword called a \"special inspection of the remittance to the north\" in order to bridge over the crisis caused by its defeat in the election. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP is repeating its outdated theory of confrontation even in this new century which calls for national reconciliation, unity and reunification. It is the only way for this party, a leftover of the old era, to go to the dumping ground of history. That is an unanimous demand of the south Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Not a chance should be given to this GNP ilk in the upcoming general election as it seeks only confrontation and division.

Its joint report was released on Jan. 16.\r\n The report makes a detailed account of how Pak was taken as a comfort woman for the Japanese army, what a gruesome life she led as a sexual slave and how she survived. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The report says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pak was born to a poor coal-miner's as the eldest daughter in Kangso County, South Phyongan Province on December 15, 1921. One day in August 1939 she was taken by a Japanese cop to Pyongyang Railway Station where she was put on a van together with some 15 other Korean girls aged about 20. They were taken to China. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pak was carried to a comfort station about 500 m away from the command of the \"Japanese forces stationed in China and Indochina\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThere were only Korean women and it was registered as \"Li Zixiang Comfort Station\" at that time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She was forced to provide sex to Japs at Room No. 19 on the first floor of the second block of the station. She had to serve at least 20 to 30 Japanese soldiers a day. If she resisted or disobeyed even a bit they assaulted her and even dragged her by hair to a \"room for corporal punishment.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She had been subject to such inhuman sexual slavery for three years in Nanjing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The places where she was forced to serve as a \"comfort woman\" bear witness to the Japanese imperialists' escalation of their war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From Nanjing she was taken together with other Korean women to Lashio, Myanmar, not far from the Chinese border. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There she was put in a comfort station called \"Itgakuro\" and was forced to provide sex to Japs again, going with the Japanese name of Wakaharu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She was molested by Japanese soldiers from morning till night in a small room. There was only a blanket on the floor of the room covered with large leaves growing in the southern region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She spent a little over one year there. Then she was taken to Songshan bordering on Myanmar together with over ten other women. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThere they were forced to provide sex to Japanese, while treating wounded soldiers as nurses and doing all other chores such as washing uniforms and cooking food. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On September 7, 1944 the Japanese army herded comfort women into an air-raid shelter in Yokomata base and massacred them. Pak and several other women ran away from the shelter and hid themselves in a nearby mountain. Several days later they went to the shore of a river where they were captured by Chinese soldiers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pak and three other women were taken to a concentration camp in Baoshan and later transferred to the Kunming Concentration Camp. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She spent there for about one and half years before hearing the news of the country's liberation. She went to Inchon by a ship and then to Seoul and Chongdan. She came home in the spring of 1946. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As proven by the truth about the damage done to Pak, the sexual slavery enforced by the Japanese army was the most hideous state-sponsored crime against humanity in the 20th century as it was systematically committed in an organized way by the old Japanese government and the military ranging from the installation and operation of comfort stations, recruit of women to their transfer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities should drop its wrong attitude and stand toward the issue of redeeming Japan's past, though belatedly, sincerely repent of all its crimes committed against humanity, thoroughly probe the truth about them and make full apology and compensation to the victims and their bereaved families.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is another red herring and a charade intended to escape people's denunciation and the punishment of history in the election slated for April. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The bulletin branded the GNP as a traitorous party bent on pro-U.S. flunkeyist acts and moves against reunification and peace and a den of despicable human trash keen on pursuing a corrupt money-manipulated policy. Its true colors as a corrupt traitorous and fascist party can never change though some of its members are replaced by others, it notes, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The shake-up projected by the GNP is an intolerable mockery and insult to the south Koreans calling for national sovereignty and dignity and demanding a genuine policy free from corruption and irregularities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Koreans from all walks of life should mete out a stern judgment to the GNP in the upcoming general election. The GNP has no future as it lived out its days. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
