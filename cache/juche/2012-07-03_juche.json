People do not want to go there because they are aware that they were aimed to abet anti-DPRK confrontation with false stories and fabrications and they often ended up in chaos. That is why the authorities cook up such methods as alluring the defectors with money. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t One time south Korean media loudly asserted that \"defectors from the north\" who went to China were taken back to the north. Later, it was disclosed that the authorities cooked up the story for anti-DPRK propaganda by using the names of those who went abroad unable to live in south Korea or were already dead. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Asked how they came to south Korea, one man said that he was allured by a lump sum and expensive materials at a restaurant and another said that he went to a toilet being drunken and somebody threatened him to go to south Korea. There was even a man who said he was tempted by women. There were many other reasons. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In fact, the worst human rights abuser is none other than the Lee Myung Bak group. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group is now persistently vociferating about the issue of \"defectors\" and making desperate efforts to defame the DPRK by use of human scum.

Their real purpose is to coordinate the missile defense system established by south Korea and U.S. forces in south Korea independently. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This move means that the U.S.-south Korea military alliance shows a new trend of development and seriously affects the future security structure in Northeast Asia and the whole of the Asia-Pacific region. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  In June 2009, the U.S. promised south Korea to provide \"extended deterrence\" for the first time. This specifically involves nuclear umbrella, conventional weapons and missile shield. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In March this year the U.S. assistant secretary of Defense clarified the will to deploy regional anti-ballistic missile shields in Asia and Mideast. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The coordination of the U.S. and south Korean missile shields would signify a step forward not only in carrying out \"the U.S. strategy for extended deterrence\" but in building a missile shield in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said the U.S. would increase its troops to be deployed in Asia in a couple of years to come and bolster the deployment of high-tech weapons in the region as its new strategy is focused on it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Fresh cooperation between the U.S. and south Korea in the field of missile defense will inevitably arouse concern of outside world for its baneful impact.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This cooperation will not only increase the complexity of the issue of security and nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula but cause the proliferation of missile defense technology, thus adversely affecting the international control of armament and prospect of disarmament.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It will, at the same time, deepen the strategic concern among the regional states and even trigger off another regional arms race. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This will evidently have an unpredictably baneful impact on the establishment of a multilateral security mechanism in Northeast Asia."

historial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe detuvo ante la foto de Kim Jong Il realizando la visita de orientacion sobre la fabrica y recordo con gran emocion aquel dia en que le acompano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSubrayo que el Dirigente prestaba especial atencion a la fabrica y se habria alegrado mas que nadie si hubiese podido escuchar el parte sobre el incremento de la capacidad de produccion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDando vueltas por el taller de medias de la mujer y el otro nuevo para el hombre, se informo en detalles de la dotacion tecnica y el estado de produccion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl examinar la elasticidad de las medias hechas en la fabrica, evaluo la calidad diciendo que ellas se pegarian bien al tobillo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCalificando de buenas las especificaciones de la maquina empaquetadora hecha por cuenta propia en la fabrica, aprecio el exito de su inventor Jo Su Gyong, investigador de la Universidad de Maquinaria de Pyongyang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tViendo la marca \"Choljuk\", dijo que son muy importantes el embalaje y la marca y estos factores aumentan el valor de mercancias. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAgrego que en el sector de bellas artes industriales deben trabajar con constancia para disenar bien las marcas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la sala de muestras vio las medias de diferentes colores y variedades y dijo satisfecho que el pueblo se pondria contento cuando las use.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando distinguio las medias para ninos, instruyo hacer sus marcas con los dibujos favoritos de la poblacion infantil.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEncomendo a los funcionarios y obreros que no olvidaran las huellas de abnegacion dejadas en esta fabrica por el Dirigente y lograran grandes exitos en la produccion para suministrar al pueblo mucho mas medias de mejor calidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRecalco que para producir mas articulos con poca mano de obra, hay que eliminar los trabajos manuales de obreros. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tResalto la importancia de automatizar los procesos hasta hacerlos teledirigidos y ubicar racionalmente la mano de obra para seguir ampliando los exitos de produccion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tActo seguido, Kim Jong Un visito el Almacen para Ninos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRecorrio varios puntos del Almacen desde su primer piso hasta el tercero averiguando destalladamente las variedades y la calidad de mercancias y el plan de servicios.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el mostrador de utilidades escolares, examino minuciosamente la calidad de creyon, boligrafo y portaminas, el papel para pintura, libretas y otros articulos y dio valiosas instrucciones para producir y suministrar mayor cantidad de esos productos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPregunto donde se ha hecho la bicicleta para ninos y al ver las pelotas colgadas de la pared del mostrador, enseno que hay colocarlas en los cestos para el confort de los ninos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tViendo los equipos de juego de diversos generos instalados en el area de diversion bajo techo, senalo sonriendo que no solo los ninos sino los adultos acompanantes tambien visitarian primero este lugar cuando vengan al almacen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el segundo piso, destaco que hay que distribuir adecuadamente los mostradores tomando en cuenta las caracteristicas del almacen para los ninos y aconsejo que instalen el puesto de juguetes que contribuyan al desarrollo intelectual de los ninos como crucigrama de pinturas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el mostrador de ropas interiores y vestimentas multicolores, enfatizo que lo mas importante no es la exhibicion sino producir y proveer continuamente de esas mercancias.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAveriguo detalladamente la elegancia y la calidad de botas impermeables y otros calzados infantiles e instruyo el metodo de anotacion de tallas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tExaminando las mercancias exhibidas en los mostradores de juguetes moviles, hebillas de marca Cosmos, equipos deportivos y flores, indico los problemas que se presentan para mejorar la calidad, forma, color y otros indices de ellas a las alturas del nuevo siglo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLe acompanaron en esta ocasion Jang Song Thaek, miembro del Buro Politico del Comite Central del PTC y vicepresidente del CDN, Pak Pong Ju, jefe de departamento del CC del PTC, Ri Jae Il, primer subjefe de departamento del CC del PTC, y Ryang Chong Song, subjefe de departamento del CC del PTC."

Por eso, se inventan las maneras de movilizarlas con el dinero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUn dia, los medios de prensa del Sur de Corea reportaron bajo grandes titulares que los \"fugitivos norcoreanos\" fueron secuestrados en China y llevados al Norte de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDespues, se conocio que los hombres mencionados en esa demagogia fueron los que emigraron a otros paises impotentes de ganarse la vida en suelo surcoreano o murieron.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPregunte a varias personas porque vinieron al Sur de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEllos me contaron varios motivos, tales como por el dinero, la amenaza y la mujer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe verdad, la pandilla de Lee Myung Bak es violadora flagrante de DDHH.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy en dia, ella sigue hablando del problema de \"fugitivos norcoreanos\" y anda con desesperacion para manchar la imagen de la RPDC por conducto de las escorias humanas, pero, esto no pasa de ser una tonteria."
