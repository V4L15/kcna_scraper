Korean Authorities Urged to Clarify Stand on KIZ\r\n Pyongyang, May 20 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the General Bureau for Central Guidance for the Development of the Special Zone gave the following answer to KCNA Monday in connection with the fact that the south Korean authorities keep groundlessly pulling up the DPRK while evading the settlement of a fundamental issue for the resumption of the operation in the Kaesong Industrial Zone (KIZ):\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities in a statement of a spokesman for the Unification Ministry said that it is \"very regretful\" that the north declined the dialogue offer and shifted the responsibility and the \"north is entirely to blame\" for the suspension of the operation in the KIZ and the lack of the south-north consultation. They even said that the north's measure of allowing businessmen to take out goods was an act that aroused skepticism about its sincerity and it was distortion of truth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They branded the DPRK's regular military exercises as a \"provocation\" even though they stage mad-cap nuclear war exercises against it with the involvement of the U.S. super-large nuclear carrier. they even made absurd remarks intentionally linking the exercises with the KIZ.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The mastermind who pushed the KIZ into the phase of a catastrophe talked about \"regret\", \"responsibility\" and \"sincerity\", shameless sophism distorting the essence of the situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities are busy making excuses following the publication of the DPRK's magnanimous measure over the KIZ issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Had they responded to the DPRK's offer, the KIZ would not have reached such a phase as now, to say nothing of the phase of taking out raw materials and products.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But they have resorted to a sleight of hand, concealing their sinister design. This resulted in the huge damage to the innocent south Korean businessmen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities claim to have deep interest in the livelihood of the businessmen. But as was proved by a recent statement, they kept silence about the normalization of the operation in the KIZ and touched only on the issue of taking out raw materials and products. This proves that they are not pleased with the resumption of the operation in the KIZ.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is more urgent than the taking out of the products is whether to keep or break the KIZ.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an issue on which hinges the living of the south Korean businessmen and the future of the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What the south Koreans truly want today is the normalization of the operation in the KIZ rather than the taking out of the products from the KIZ.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now is the time for the south Korean authorities to state before the public whether it has intent to fundamentally settle the KIZ issue or not.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should not try to distort the essence of the issue and deceive the public but clarify its stand on this issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their attitude will affect the DPRK's decision."

It also calls for studying nuclear deterrence strategy under the pretext of threat from someone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Though the proposal is veiled with the word \"defence,\" it is no more than a war programme for attaining the goal of aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters is that Japan is groundlessly accusing the DPRK. Tokyo is misleading the public opinion at home and abroad, asserting that it is compelled by Pyongyang to exercise the right to collective self-defence, build \"the defence army\" and attack enemy bases.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What Japan claimed has nothing to do with defence. It is nothing but an excuse to carry out its scenario for overseas aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the goal of the Japanese reactionaries to turn Japan into a war state with the right to belligerency and the right to participate in a war. The \"normal state\" touted by Japan precisely means a war state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By pursuing a war Japan can never shake off the dishonor of being a defeated nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To legalize militarization and overseas aggression amounts to a criminal act of blatantly challenging the international conventions stipulating Japan's position as a war criminal state, defeated nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Should Japan launches a war of aggression overseas, openly denying its crime-woven past, it will always remain a defeated nation bound to go to ruin."

Y disparatearon que \"es muy dudosa\" la medida del Norte de permitir a los empresarios la salida de materiales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, sin decir nada de sus freneticos ejercicios de guerra nuclear contra la RPDC, librados con la participacion del superportaaviones nuclear norteamericano, califican de \"provocacion\" los ejercicios militares normales de la RPDC y los vinculan artificialmente con la ZIK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs una conducta cinica que el culpable de la cierre de la ZIK hable de \"lastima\", \"responsabilidad\" y \"sinceridad\" de alguien. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl darse a la publicidad la magnanima medida de la RPDC sobre la ZIK, las autoridades surcoreanas se apresuran a buscar una excusa con que puedan frenar la repercusion de ella. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi ellas hubieran aceptado nuestra propuesta, no habria surgido el problema de salida de materias primas y productos ni habria caido en la crisis actual la ZIK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, los inocentes empresarios surcoreanos tienen que sufrir enormes perdidas por las autoridades surcoreanas que hacen todo lo posible para ocultar su malsana intencion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas actuan como si tuvieran gran interes en los negocios de los empresarios. Pero, como muestra la reciente declaracion, hablaron solo de la salida de materias primas y productos sin decir nada de la normalizacion de la ZIK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto demuestra que ellas no quieren la reapertura de la ZIK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora lo mas urgente en la ZIK no es la salida de los productos, sino el cierre o no de la ZIK, del cual dependen la subsistencia de los empresarios surcoreanos y la perspectiva de las relaciones intercoreanas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy dia, la poblacion surcoreana desea de todo corazon la normalizacion de la ZIK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora es el momento en que las autoridades surcoreanas deben aclarar al interior y exterior la voluntad de resolver fundamentalmente o no el problema de la ZIK, sin tergiversar la esencia ni enganar la opinion publica. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestra decision dependera de la actitud posterior de las autoridades surcoreanas."

            "content": "CRPP rechaza nueva acusacion de EE.UU. y Sur de Corea\r\nPyongyang, 20 de mayo (ACNC) -- En su informacion no. 1038 publicada el dia 20, el Secretariado del Comite por la Reunificacion Pacifica de la Patria denuncio a los imperialistas norteamericanos y los titeres surcoreanos que censuran los rutinarios ejercicios militares del Ejercito Popular de Corea para consolidar por todos los medios la capacidad de defensa nacional. \n\t\t\t\t\tEl portavoz de la Casa Blanca calumnio los recientes ejercicios de lanzamiento de cohetes del EPC como una \"provocacion\" diciendo que \"el Norte de Corea debe cumplir su compromiso con la sociedad internacional\", mientras que los titeres surcoreanos publicaron una \"declaracion\" hablando de \"accion provocativa del Norte\" y de \"urgirle la conducta responsable\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto es otro desafio nunca tolerable a la RPDC y una provocacion abierta que lleva al extremo la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana, revela la nota y continua: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. y los titeres surcoreanos dicen como si los ejercicios militares de nuestro ejercito fueran motivo de la tension de la Peninsula Coreana y la region. Pero, esto es un acto cinico que parte de la logica de bandido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, es el climax de cinismo el hecho de que quien habla de la \"provocacion\" de alguien fuera la banda titere surcoreana que se entrega a la confrontacion fratricida y la provocacion de guerra contra la RPDC mendigando a su amo norteamericano el fortalecimiento de la alianza militar. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. y los titeres surcoreanos se desesperan por inducir en error la opinion publica hablando de la supuesta \"provocacion\" con el designio criminal de eludir las criticas de la sociedad internacional a su aumento armamentista y sus maniobras de guerra nuclear anti-RPDC, recrudecer la amenaza de agresion militar contra ella, y a la larga, apaciguar el ambiente de lucha anti-\"gobierno\" de la poblacion surcoreana, irritada por las politicas antinacionales y antipopulares, el caso de violacion sexual, etc. y salir de la \"crisis\" de dominacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa realidad demuestra claramente que nuestra linea de desarrollar paralelamente la construccion economica y la de fuerzas armadas nucleares es muy justa y unica via para defender la soberania y dignidad del pais y lograr la reunificacion y prosperidad de la nacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tConsolidaremos mil veces mas el disuasivo nuclear del ejercito revolucionario del monte Paektu sosteniendo en alto la siempre victoriosa linea sobre el desarrollo paralelo y aniquilaremos despiadadamente a la horda de invasores que se atrevan a atentar, aunque en lo minimo, contra nuestra soberania nacional."

            "content": "ACNC critica derechizacion de sociedad japonesa\r\nPyongyang, 20 de mayo (ACNC) -- En estos tiempos, la sociedad japonesa se contagia con la fiebre de derechizacion. \n\t\t\t\t\tAprovechando la corriente ultranacionalista, las fuerzas ultraderechistas del Japon actuan intensamente para enmendar la \"constitucion pacifista\" en funcion de preparar la garantia legal de Estado belico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDescontentas de la constitucion vigente, vinieron intentando modificarla para poder tener un ejercito y tener la capacidad de ejecutar la guerra y para sentar la base legal de militarizacion y expansionismo a ultramar. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Partido Democratico Liberal elaboro recientemente el llamado \"proyecto sobre la defensa\" para la aprobacion de nuevo \"programa de defensa\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl proyecto estipula el ejercicio de derecho a la autodefensa colectiva y la fundacion del ejercito de defensa nacional mediante la \"enmienda de la constitucion\", la disposicion de capacidad de ataque contra las bases de lanzamiento de misil y el estudio sobre la estrategia de disuasivo nuclear bajo el pretexto de la amenaza de alguien.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo problematico es que el pais isleno acusa a la RPDC induciendo en error la opinion publica interna y externa como si tuviera la necesidad de ejercer el derecho a la autodefensa colectiva, fundar el \"ejercito de defensa nacional\" y atacar las bases enemigas para hacer frente a la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, ese argumento no pasa de ser un pretexto para realizar su ambicion de agredir a ultramar. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos reaccionarios japoneses tienen la meta de convertir a Japon en el pais con el derecho a la beligerancia y a la participacion en guerra. Pues, el \"Estado normal\" de que habla el pais isla es el de guerra. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon la guerra no se puede cambiar su posicion de pais criminal y derrotado. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa justificacion de militarizacion y de agresion a ultramar deviene un crimen y desafio abierto a los convenios internacionales que fijan ese estatus de Japon. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi Japon desata la guerra de agresion a ultramar negando abiertamente sus crimenes sangrientos del pasado e inclinandose a la derechizacion, se quedara siempre como pais derrotado."
