            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on DPRK's Nuclear Deterrent \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 1 (KCNA) -- The U.S. bellicose forces these days are throwing together the balderdash that the DPRK's nuclear deterrent is intended to \"threaten and blackmail\" somebody and to be sold to other countries and it may strike U.S. cities when it finds its way into the hands of terrorists.\r\n Refuting this, Rodong Sinmun Monday in a signed commentary says that all this is a nonsense and the DPRK's nuclear deterrent force is aimed at coping with the U.S. preemptive nuclear attack on and armed invasion of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our nuclear deterrent which embodies the principle of self-reliant defense based on the Juche idea is of defensive nature. In other word, it is, to all intents and purposes, a means of defending sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is utterly groundless that our nuclear deterrent poses \"threat\" to somebody. And it is the height of folly to argue that our nuclear deterrent is a \"threat\" to the U.S. and nobody would believe this. It is, indeed, a brigandish logic that only our nuclear deterrent is \"dangerous\" while U.S. nuclear weapons raise no problem on the Korean peninsula. Our nuclear deterrent for defending the sovereignty of the country can never be a threat to anyone. Unless anyone provokes the DPRK, its nuclear deterrent will remain unused. There is no need for a country not hostile but friendly to the DPRK to worry about its nuclear deterrent. The defensive nature and mission of our nuclear deterrent will remain unchanged.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Day of Non-aligned Movement Observed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 1 (KCNA) -- The non-aligned movement has invariably made a long drive over the past 42 years and this is a result of its firm adherence to the idea of anti-imperialism and independence and the fundamental principle of non-alignment, says &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRodong Sinmun today in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp\r\n If the non-aligned movement is to maintain its noble idea and fundamental principle and increase its influence, it should, first of all, direct the sharp edge of its struggle against the U.S. imperialists' strong-arm and arbitrary practices and unilateralism. When the non-aligned countries got united and put up a tough struggle against the U.S. imperialists' strong-arm and arbitrary practices and unilateralism, the latter would not ride high and mighty and a great progress would be made in accomplishing the cause of independence and peace. When the non-aligned and developing countries crop feathers of the U.S. imperialists with their united force, international relations based on sovereignty and equality will be established without much difficulty and the democratization of the international community be accelerated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp\r\n If the movement is to fulfil its mission as a powerful anti-imperialist independent force, it is very important to achieve the unity of action in the movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp\r\n The United States is deliberately fanning up differences among non-aligned and developing countries in a bid to largely broaden them and lead them to collision and disputes. The non-aligned and developing countries should heighten vigilance against these moves of the imperialists and take joint steps and unity of action in the anti-imperialist and anti-U.S. struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp\r\n The non-aligned movement should expand and develop south-south cooperation to cope with the \"globalization\" schemings of the imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp\r\n The DPRK, as a dignified member of the movement, will as ever remain loyal to the idea and principle of the movement and make energetic efforts for its development and victorious advance.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

At least 23,000 innocent Koreans were killed by a brutal method baffling human imagination during the Kanto quake on September 1, 1923, the statement said, and went on.\r\n The Japanese government has not yet properly probed the truth of this incident, far from feeling any guilty conscience and responsibility for the massacre, though 80 years have passed since then. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp\r\n The frantic anti-DPRK rackets and unceasing violence and threat to Korean residents in Japan remind one of what the Japanese reactionaries did 80 years ago to \"exterminate Koreans.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp\r\n The issue of redeeming the crimes committed by Japan against humanity serves as a touchstone showing whether its talk about human rights, civilization, humanitarianism and law-abidance is true or false. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp\r\n The committee will surely force the Japanese government to probe the truth of all the crimes committed by Japan against humanity and apologize and compensate for them and thus help Koreans heal the wounds inflicted upon them by Japan and give vent to the grudge of the victims.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
