            "content": "U.S., S. Korean Authorities' Anti-DPRK Moves Condemned\r\n Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- As already known, the south Korean puppet warmongers recently opened to public the fact that they conducted a ballistic missile test-fire with a range of 500 km.\n\t\t\t\t\t They are talking nonsense that they will develop a missile with longer range next year and then they will be able to put the whole area of the northern half of Korea within the striking range.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t And while they are opening to public the fact that they newly formed a missile command in the south Korean puppet army, they are vociferating that their command is to \"cope with the strategic force command of the north\" and will \"play a key role in building a 'south Korean style missile defense system.'\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The spokesman for the Academy of the National Defence Science said in a statement issued on Monday in this regard that this is an unpardonable grave provocation against the DPRK and a challenge to the public at home and abroad aspiring for the detente on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has developed and had access to diversified various type missiles to cope with the U.S. moves to ignite nuclear war against the north but has never aimed at hurting the compatriots and talked about attacking the whole area of south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the DPRK's powerful missile forces are a self-defensive deterrent to cope with the U.S. moves for aggression, their main target is the U.S. bringing the danger of the nuclear war to the Korean nation and the military bases of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces under any circumstances.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is for firmly defending the sovereignty and dignity of the nation to consistently hold fast to the line of simultaneously pushing forward building of an economic power while bolstering up the national defence capability centered on the nuclear force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than the U.S. that instigates and supports the development of ballistic missiles of the south Korean puppet forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. helps the south Korean puppet forces in every way such as lifting restrictions on range and warhead weight and transferring its technology while inspiring them to develop ballistic missiles in order to use them effectively as a shock brigade for a war of aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The double-dealing and hypocritical nature of the U.S. was more saliently revealed by the south Korean puppet forces' test-fire of its ballistic missile behind the curtain of the anti-DPRK missile racket under the U.S. patronage and backing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the U.S. and the south Korean regime felt guilty, hit hard by the answer given by the spokesman for the Strategic Force of the KPA laying bare their despicable nature, they kept mum about their criminal development of missiles and made much fuss about what they called drones in a foolish bid to divert the public attention elsewhere.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, such a trite conspiratorial racket is not workable on anyone in this bright world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are in such awkward position that they can no longer take issue with the DPRK over its launch of ballistic missiles and the UN Security Council, too, has no reason to blame it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is needless to say that the DPRK's self-defensive deterrence such as nukes and ballistic missiles can never become subjects for negotiations as long as the U.S. persists in nuclear threat to the DPRK and its moves to invade the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will further bolster up its missile and nuclear deterrence\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tunder the prevailing situation no matter what others may say and no\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tone is entitled to take issue with its measures.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's Juche-based national defence science is firmly guaranteeing the dignity, sovereignty and vital rights of the country with the best and latest military science and technology and military hardware and no force can break the DPRK's firm faith and will or dampen its determination to achieve a final victory by dint of Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Although the south Korean regime's development of its missiles seems to be a childish play, but the DPRK will never remain a passive onlooker to the U.S. and the south Korean regime's extremely provocative remarks against it and the neighboring countries, too, will not look with folded arms on south Korea's increase in the range of its missiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If a US missile or the south Korean puppet forces' missile falls on any part of the DPRK, it will pound all the strongholds of the enemy with merciless shower of missiles to reduce them to ashes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK never says empty words but will decisively react to nukes and missiles of the U.S. and other hostile forces in kind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean war-like forces would be well advised to stop their reckless actions, properly understanding the disastrous consequences to be entailed by their missile test-fire."
