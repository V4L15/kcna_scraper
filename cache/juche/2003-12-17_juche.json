            "content": "Minju Joson Assails GNP's Financial Scam \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 16 (KCNA) -- Scandals of the Grand National Party of south Korea have been disclosed one after another there recently to create a great public furor. After making the \"election\" of Ri Hoe Chang a fait accompli on the threshold of the \"presidential election\" last year its heavyweights put pressure on LG group, Samsung Group and other business groups to contribute a huge amount of illicit \"political funds\" to the party.\r\n Commenting on this, Minju Joson today in a signed commentary says the scandals committed by the GNP during the last \"presidential election\" is an extra large crime baffling human imagination. This tells what dirty and base acts the GNP perpetrated last year in quest of power, it adds. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The news analyst goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP kicked up dust over the \"financial scam\" of close associates of the present chief executive and faked up the \"law on special inspection\". With the law vetoed, Choe Pyong Ryol went to the lengths of staging a \"hunger strike\" in \"protest\" against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Worse still, the GNP raised a fabulous amount of illegal \"political funds\" to gratify its dirty political greed. Yet, it kicked up a racket of \"special inspection,\" raising a hue and cry over the \"drain on resources\" and the like when a petty amount of money was spent for the regular economic dealing. It went to the lengths of throwing those involved in it into prison one after another and driving Jong Mong Hon to death. How can it be tolerated?  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the GNP which does wrongs only going against the trend of the times, indifferent to the will and interests of the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Neither the democratic development of the south Korean people nor social progress nor the peace and reunification of the country can be achieved unless the GNP is eliminated. The people from all walks of life in south Korea should resolutely punish the GNP, the headquarters of the bellicose forces and traitors, force it to dissolve itself immediately and not allow it to raise its head again.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Slams U.S. Northeast Asia Strategy \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 16 (KCNA) -- The United States is clinging to a new military strategy to put Northeast Asia under its domination to meet its interests.\r\n It is working hard to relocate its troops in south Korea at an early date, push forward a massive \"arms buildup plan\" on the Korean peninsula and speed up the establishment of the missile defense system involving south Korea, Taiwan and Japan in real earnest. These fresh military developments are indicative of the U.S. scheme to escalate the military standoff on the Korean peninsula and extend the sphere of operations of the U.S. troops in south Korea to the rest of Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This can not but arouse high vigilance of the people in the region as these are very dangerous developments which may render the overall situation in Northeast Asia unstable and escalate tensions there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. Northeast Asia military strategy is a key link in the whole chain of its strategy to put the world under its domination. Policy-makers of the U.S. styling itself the world's only superpower after the end of the Cold War designated Middle East and Northeast Asia as major targets in realizing its ambition for world domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. claims that it has laid a springboard from which to put the Middle East under its control after occupying Iraq, a sovereign state. It is now concentrating its efforts on carrying out its Northeast Asia military strategy. It is because there exist in this region the DPRK demonstrating the might of Songun politics and big powers advocating the multi-polarization of the world challenging the U.S. view on value of the uni-polar world. \r\n It was against this backdrop that the U.S. had already expanded the radius of the military operation of the U.S. and Japan as far as the Taiwan Strait in the \"U.S.-Japan Joint Security Declaration\" in 1996. It is now working hard to expand the sphere of operation of the U.S. troops in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The relocation of the U.S. troops in south Korea is now under way within the framework of the U.S. Northeast Asia strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is by no means fortuitous that the October 11th issue of the Chinese People's Daily reported that the U.S. is likely to expand the operation radius of its troops in south Korea as far as Taiwan in China, saying that this may meet the rebuff of China and Russia and the Voice of Russia reported on December 2 that the U.S. keeps going against Russia and China, saying that it may mobilize its troops stationed in south Korea for operations not only on the Korean peninsula but for those against other countries of Northeast Asia in the near future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This new strategy of the U.S. is aimed to establish an unchallenged domination over Northeast Asia through a steady escalation of tensions there. This, therefore, will inevitably spark off confrontation and conflict in this region as this would block the settlement of other disputes in the region including the Taiwanese problem, to say nothing of the Korean problem. \r\n The U.S. refusal to take a bold decision to drop its anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK, the policy which spawned the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. and its act of hamstringing a peaceful solution to the Taiwanese problem are part of the U.S. strategy of steadily escalating the tensions in the Northeast Asian region. This, therefore, runs diametrically counter to the common interests of the countries in the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. Northeast Asia military strategy swimming against the trend of the times is bound to go bankrupt, censured by the people in this region and all other progressive people in the world.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan Urged to Respond to Government-level Talks with DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 16 (KCNA) -- Former war criminal states are seeing off this year, feeling as if a weight had been lifted from their hearts after admitting hideous human rights abuses they committed in violation of international law and after or while making repentance and material compensation or reparations. But only Japan is seeing off another year after refusing to make any sincere apology or express any willingness to compensate for the monstrous crimes it committed against humanity in the 20th century by resorting to all sleights of hand. Rodong Sinmun says this in a commentary today.\r\n The news analyst continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The point is the shamelessness and moral vulgarity of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The crimes committed by Japan against the Korean people were more hideous than those committed by other war criminal states against humanity in the past. The Japanese authorities have left no means untried to evade apology and compensation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThey even went to the lengths of asserting that \"there is no ground for Japan to make compensation in view of the existing laws\" and \"there is no evidence of forcible drafting.\" This clearly proves how far the Japanese authorities' shamelessness and moral vulgarity have reached. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Germany and other war criminal states have made or are making compensation or reparations because their authorities have made bold political decisions with reason, conscience and sense of moral obligation. The Japanese authorities, however, are taking a completely contrasting attitude. This is a clear proof of the shamelessness and moral vulgarity peculiar to Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has already proposed to Japan to hold government-level talks, proceeding from the stand to discuss the issue of compensation to those who fell victim to human right abuses in the past. But Japan has not yet responded to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should rectify its wrong way of thinking and respond at an early date to the DPRK-proposed government-level talks to discuss the issue of compensating to human rights victims. This will do Japan good, too.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's Scheme to Introduce MD System under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 16 (KCNA) -- Japan is heading for the introduction of the missile defense system, raising terrific outcries over fictitious \"threat from north Korea\" in an effort to hasten its conversion into a military power and overseas aggression under this pretext, says Minju Joson today in a signed commentary.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When it was finding its way to the introduction of the MD system jointly with the United States, it tricked the international community, saying that it would confine itself to the stage of researches. But now it is inventing new pretexts, finding it hard to hide its scheme to introduce the MD system any longer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are shouting themselves hoarse that they should have their own MD system to cope with \"the missile threat from north Korea\" and putting up military alliance with the U.S. as a subterfuge. But they can never conceal their sinister intension with these pretexts. \r\n The missile of the DPRK is a self-defensive means to protect its security and dignity from the hostile forces' moves to stifle it. Therefore, the missile of the DPRK would not be a threat to Japan, if it had no hostile designs against the former. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has become obvious that the Japanese reactionaries are working hard to drive the world into the holocaust of another war of aggression by employing every conceivable tactics. So it should be perfectly clear that its surrounding countries would not remain passive onlookers. This immediately means an arms race.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
