It is also the history of a prominent leader who left marks in the history of the world socialist movement and powerfully accelerated the cause of human independence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il developed in depth the Juche idea by adding new principles and contents to it as required by the times and the developing revolution and comprehensively formulated and systemized the socialist theory on the basis of it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He strictly adhered to the firm anti-imperialist independent stand and socialist principle in the whole course of revolutionary leadership, foiled the enemy's offensive against revolution through a revolutionary offensive, advanced the revolution and construction in the Korean style and thus consolidated and developed socialism of Juche and strikingly demonstrated its invincibility.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He, regarding it as his lifetime political faith to believe in the people as in Heaven, put forward the people as the most precious beings in the world, settled all matters on the principle of absolutely prioritizing their interests, let the party, state and army serve them only and made sure that all the wealth of society contributed to promoting their wellbeing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He developed the WPK into a strong guiding force for carrying out the cause of socialism and consolidated the unity and cohesion of the party and the revolutionary ranks as firm as a rock, opening up a new path of building a socialist ruling party for over half a century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He developed the Korean People's Army into a powerful revolutionary Paektusan army capable of annihilating any imperialist aggressor forces at a single strike, putting the defence industry on a fresh Juche and modern basis and put all the people under arms and turned the whole country into an impregnable fortress.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the world socialist movement was sustaining serious setbacks, he held higher the banner of Juche-based socialism, set an epochal example in the drive for realizing the independence of the popular masses, instilled confidence in victory into the progressive people and powerfully accelerated the advance of the socialist movement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The revolutionary career and immortal feats of Kim Jong Il who provided a firm foundation for the victory of the cause of the people for independence and the socialist cause and opened a bright prospect in the glorious era of Kim Jong Un will shine for all ages.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reporter called for accomplishing the socialist cause of Juche with Kim Jong Il's idea and feats as the eternal cornerstone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also called for dynamically advancing toward the final victory of the socialist cause of Juche, rallied close around Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Similar meetings were held in each province, city and county and at industrial complexes on the same day."

Therefore, the DPRK will never acknowledge the UNSC \"resolution\" which termed the DPRK's nuclear test and rocket test-fire \"illegal\", and will never do in the future, either.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We categorically reject the press release of the UNSC which took issue with the right of a sovereign state to self-defence under the high-handed pressure of the U.S. in utter disregard of the DPRK's just demand."

            "content": "KCNA Commentary Slams Scrapping of Business Mobile Phones of High-ranking Officials in S. Korea\r\n Pyongyang, February 15 (KCNA) -- It was recently disclosed that business mobile phones of high-ranking officials in south Korea are being physically scrapped, sparking off great furor.\n\t\t\t\t\t Documents were massively destroyed at Chongwadae, the Intelligence Service and other power bodies of south Korea in the past, but it is the first time that even the business mobile phones of ministers and chiefs of agencies are scrapped.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such farce of the south Korean puppet group is a cunning artifice conceived by Park Geun Hye and her yes men to destroy evidence proving their crimes being disclosed almost everyday.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As well known, not a few serious crimes of Park and her lackeys were proved by records in mobile phones after the outbreak of \"Park Geun Hye-Choe Sun Sil scandal\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The contents of records in the mobile phone of Jong Ho Song, former chief secretary affiliated to Chongwadae, disclosed the true colors of Park, a puppet of female shaman Choe Sun Sil. The vice-chairman of the \"National Federation of Businessmen\" and An Jong Bom, former chief secretary for policy coordination of Chongwadae, responded to the investigation by the prosecution only after scrapping their mobile phones containing conversations and messages in a bid to destroy evidence proving their crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With the doomsday of the Park regime drawing nearer, it is going busy with the above-said ruckus.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a mean attempt being made by those with guilty conscience.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is hard fact that most of the incumbent ministers and chiefs of agencies who scrapped their mobile phones before any others are those who have shielded Park and Choe or have been suspected of being involved in the hideous scandal. This goes to prove that Park and her yes men are running the whole gamut of sinister intrigues to seek a way out.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korean opposition parties and personages of different social standings bitterly denounce the scrapping of mobile phones, branding it as \"a stopgap measure to dodge the special investigation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, a relevant person of the puppet Intelligence Service made excuses in a bid to fool the public, claiming that some of the numbers of former and incumbent high-ranking officials' phones leaked at the time of hacking attack of the north against the south Korean defense ministry in December last year and it proposed the replacement of business mobile phones to prevent the repetition of damage.\" However, south Koreans are spitting at the poor and disgusting behavior of the Park group vociferating about the \"threat from the north\" at the death-bed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was none other than the Intelligence Service which organized the mobile phone scrapping campaign and forced high-ranking officials to do so from the end of last year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The IS has played the role of a shock brigade to check the impeachment of Park Geun Hye under the pretence of \"coping with the north's hacking\", and this brought to light that Chongwadae is the center of all criminal operations and conspiratorial plots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the conservative group that should be thrown overboard to the last man as it is forsaken by the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group's base campaign is only precipitating its doomsday."
