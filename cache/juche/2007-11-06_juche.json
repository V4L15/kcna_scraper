These moves are the root cause of a fresh arms race, a new Cold War in the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to abandon its wicked intention to attain its sinister purpose while talking about someone's \"threat.\" It had better behave itself, cogitating over the fact that its moves to hold a military edge in Northeast Asia would only precipitate its own self-destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Upholding Songun alone guarantees the existence and development of the nation and its bright prospect and rosy future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But for such powerful treasured sword as the Songun politics, the Korean Peninsula would have become a plaything of foreign forces long ago and the Korean people would have already been put again under the yoke of disgraceful slavery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The peace of the country and the security of all Koreans depend on how they uphold Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It is a vital issue related to the destiny of the Korean nation and the victory of the cause of national reunification to ensure lasting peace and security on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the Songun politics that helps achieve durable peace, protect the destiny of the nation and guarantee a dynamic advance of the cause of national reunification on the peninsula. This politics makes it possible to smash the U.S. moves for aggression against peace by dint of powerful deterrent for self-defence and firmly defend peace and security on the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  If the DPRK had failed to pursue Songun, a war would have broken out on this land a hundred times and the Koreans would have suffered an unimaginable holocaust. It is an undeniable truth that only when the Koreans firmly uphold the Songun politics is it possible to achieve the peace of the country and the security of the nation and national reunification and bring common prosperity to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Upholding Songun serves as a great banner for defending the Korean nation and guaranteeing the dignity and prosperity of the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But, the Japanese government is delaying the solution to the issue because it stupidly calculates that everything will be hushed up if those survivors pass away, it pointed out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement held that the Japanese and south Korean governments should settle the issue at an early date so that those survivors may not bear any grudge any longer.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
