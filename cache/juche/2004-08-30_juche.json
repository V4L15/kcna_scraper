            "content": "Japan Urged to Redress Its Past as Early as Possible \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 29 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Sunday carries an article 94 years after the Japanese imperialists proclaimed the \"Korea-Japan annexation\" after fabricating the \"Korea-Japan Annexation Treaty\" at the point of bayonet.\r\n The article cites to prove that the \"Korea-Japan annexation\" proclaimed by the Japanese imperialists on August 29, 1910 was a brigandish and illegal annexation. Noting that due to the Japanese imperialists' brigandish annexation of territory and colonial fascist rule, the Korean people suffered immeasurable misfortune and pain and Korea was far removed from modern civilization, the article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists did not grant even elementary freedom and right to the Korean people and forced them to unconditionally submit and obey the order that was enforced by them for their occupation and colonial rule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They abducted and forcibly drafted more than 8.4 million young and middle-aged Koreans to use them as cannon fodder in battle fields or drive them like beasts of burden in such slave labor sites as the construction sites of ore and coal mines and military installations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, at least 200,000 Korean women were taken away as \"comfort women\" for the imperial Japanese army and forced to provide sex to it. Most of them fell victim to the Japanese imperialists' atrocities. They died in alien lands with grudge against them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During their occupation of Korea the Japanese imperialists savagely plundered it of its rich resources and indiscriminately vandalized and looted its precious cultural treasures. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Not content with this, they took away even brass bowls and brass spoons and chopsticks used by families of Korea, to say nothing of brass candlesticks and brass wine cups on tables used during memorial services and ornamental hairpins of women. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists had long kept an eye to the cultural treasures of Korea. So as soon as they occupied it, they came to Korea like a pack of wolves and ruthlessly looted those treasures and shipped them to Japan to make them their own properties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese acts of looting and burning up Korea's national classics reached their height in vandalizing and looting the cultural treasures of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialist gangsters shipped \"Rijosillok (the true records of Ri Dynasty)\"listed as a cultural treasure of the world, and many precious books preserved in Kyujang Pavilion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists committed such outrages as burning up over 200,000 volumes of books recording the history of Korea, branding them as \"seditious books\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They enforced such harsh national culture obliteration policy in Korea as disallowing the Koreans to use their spoken and written languages. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists declared the Japanese language the \"national language\" and did not hesitate to impose fine upon Koreans and give them physical punishment if they did not use the Japanese language. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They pursued such a cruel policy of assimilating Koreans as Japanese as forcing them to change their names into Japanese. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These shuddering atrocities committed by the Japanese imperialists during their occupation of Korea in the last century were extremely hideous ones against humanity, the nation and history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though 60 years have passed since the defeat of Japan, it has not yet redressed its past. Japan should settle its past at an early date in the spirit of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration in order to redress the hideous crimes it committed against the Korean people and make a fresh appearance before the times and humankind.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It serves as the unique Korean style line of building socialist economy as it makes it possible to protect the dignity and authority of the country and fully display the advantages and might of socialism under the banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a sacred undertaking to remain true to leader Kim Jong Il's Songun revolutionary leadership for the officials and other working people to thoroughly implement the line of economic construction in the Songun era. It is also a worthwhile work to effect a fresh leaping advance and innovations in this year's general offensive for building a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All efforts should be channeled into giving priority to the development of the national defence industry. We should consider it as a vital issue related to the destiny of the country and the revolution to keep the munitions production going, improve the quality of its products and modernize the equipment of the People's Army and provide it with everything necessary on a top priority basis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also necessary to exert efforts to develop light industry and agriculture simultaneously in order to decisively improve the standard of the people's living. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The paper calls for waging a drive to implement the above-said line to the letter by the Songun political mode.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They represent a heroic epic in which he has victoriously led the struggle to defend socialism and achieve the prosperity of the country in firm reliance upon the youth as well as the Party and the army.

All of them should thus emerge young heroes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the young people must learn harder to become true men of ability in the Songun era with high ambitions and great hope to glorify their country and nation with admirable capability and know-how. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should take the lead in getting the revolutionary soldier spirit prevail throughout the society as befits the younger generation of the DPRK which enjoys high dignity thanks to the Songun policy.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is intended to equate the probe into the past crimes that has become a trend of the times with the confrontation between the pro-north, pro-communist forces and the forces \"defending freedom and democracy.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This far-fetched assertion is aimed to brand pro-reunification patriotic figures and organizations of different strata and even those supporting the June 15 joint declaration as pro-north and pro-communist elements. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It can not but be an anachronistic and treacherous act going against the desire of the nation to raise the issue of \"pro-north and pro-communism\", the old conception of confrontation in the Cold War era, today when all the Koreans in the north and the south are getting reconciled and united and working hard to solve the issue of reunification by the concerted efforts of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP's moves are aimed to cover up its crime-woven past in which it perpetrated pro-U.S. sycophantic and treacherous acts and fascist and anti-reunification crimes after springing up from the roots of pro-Japanese acts, scuttle the on-going \"probe into the past crimes\", disregard what has been gained by the movements for independence, democracy and reunification and bring back the old era of dictatorship and confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Koreans from all walks of life should throw overboard these dregs of society through the struggle to probe the truth about the past crimes just as they sternly punished GNP coteries who challenged the mind-set of people during the crisis over the motion on impeachment against the president and the April general election.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
