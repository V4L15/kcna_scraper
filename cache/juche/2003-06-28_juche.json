            "content": "KCNA warns against any infringement upon DPRK's sovereignty \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 27 (KCNA) -- High-ranking officials of eleven countries met in Madrid recently and discussed the so-called \"Madrid proposal\" under the manipulation of the U.S., talking about the DPRK's \"nuclear and missile issues and drug smuggling.\"\r\n There the U.S. made trite, far-fetched assertions that the DPRK-flagged trading vessels illegally transport drugs, counterfeit money and weapons of mass destruction and its followers agreed to lay a tight international siege to the DPRK under the pretext of \"preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and drugs.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is that this agreement has something in common with the proposal for \"sea blockade against the DPRK\" made public by Bush in May last. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This indicates that the U.S. preemptive block strategy aimed to isolate and stifle the DPRK internationally has entered the phase of its implementation and the touch-and-go situation created on the Korean peninsula may lead to an outbreak of war anytime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has already served a strong warning that it would regard sea blockade against the DPRK as a breach of the armistice agreement, a declaration of war and a war action, in the long-run, no matter how hard the U.S. may try to cover up its nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration is much publicizing the proposal as an \"international agreement\" but those eleven countries represent neither the international community nor the un and, moreover, if they intercept the DPRK-flagged vessels, that will be, in fact, an act of wantonly violating international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present international law defines it as a serious infringement upon the sovereignty of other countries to stop, search and seize ships of those countries in the open sea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTherefore, those acts have so far been dismissed as piracy and a blatant challenge to the un charter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some countries which profess respect for international law and the un charter have chimed in with the U.S. blockade operation little short of openly infringing upon the sovereignty of the DPRK, pursuant to its unilateral and self-justified strategy for world supremacy. This can not but be a height of folly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality clearly proves that the Bush administration is the world's biggest group of hooligans who utterly disregard international law and the UN Charter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a publicly recognized fact that the U.S. is the most dangerous country in the world that proliferates nukes, missiles and drugs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the U.S. which harassed mid-east peace and stability by transferring nuclear-related technology to Israel and it is again the U.S. which gained huge profits by massively selling missiles to different parts of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some countries are supporting the U.S. in its moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK, oblivious of those facts. They should clearly know that their act will only result in allowing the U.S. to becloud even their political future and bar their economic prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. and its followers infringe upon the sovereignty of the DPRK even a bit, talking about \"blockade\" and \"sanctions\", the DPRK, as it has already clarified, will deal merciless retaliatory blows at them no matter who its opponent is.    \r\n\r\n"

They even used chemical and biological weapons without hesitation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their murder and exploitation have continued in South Korea even after the ceasefire and peace has not yet been settled on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are now beefing up the aggression forces in and around South Korea under the pretext of the \"nuclear issue\" to bring a nuclear holocaust to the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Korean people will invigorate the anti-U.S. struggle to get the U.S. imperialists, the root cause of all the misfortune and sufferings, out of South Korea, and achieve the country's reunification.    \r\n\r\n"

They regard the U.S. forces deployed near the military demarcation line unfavorable for fighting a war of high intensity, given that the Korean peninsula is bounded on three sides by sea and has narrow land front. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the view of U.S. military strategists that when a war starts in Korea, Seoul and areas north of it will turn into sea of fire in a matter of a few days due to North Korea's strong artillery fire power and none of the U.S. troops within its firing range will be able to survive. That's why they are now craftily working to prevent disastrous consequences through the redeployment of the U.S. forces before the outbreak of a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The redeployment of the U.S. forces in South Korea is a very dangerous military measure prompted by the U.S. imperialist attempt to use nukes in the second Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is by no means a step for military detente. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Bush forces opt for taking a military option as now a war on the Korean peninsula will be unavoidable.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They are Juche-oriented patriotic traditions whereby the Korean people can hew out the destiny of their country and nation their own way and on their own, traditions of resolute anti-imperialist struggle for independence whereby they fight against imperialists in a do-or-die spirit tightly holding arms in their hands and patriotic traditions in which love for the country is blended with that of people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people built the republic and won a shining victory in the hard-fought fatherland liberation war in the same patriotic spirit with which the anti-Japanese revolutionary forerunners readily dedicated their lives to the liberation of the country. All miracles and victories achieved by the republic during a 55-year-long history are a precious fruition of those traditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present circumstances of our struggle are not different from those of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle where the Korean people could believe only in their own strength and they had to pull through indescribably rigorous trials. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEverybody should uphold the Songun policy, the patriotic policy of the Workers' Party of Korea, with loyalty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the officers and men of the people' army should become the first-line death-defying corps defending socialism, the contingent taking the lead in upholding Kim Jong Il's politics of giving priority to the army just as the anti-Japanese fighters did when hewing the untrodden path of revolution with arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAll the party members and working people should thoroughly implement the policy of putting all the people under arms and turning the whole country into a fortress, having warm love for the army, earnestly learning military affairs and consistently assisting the people's army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to firmly uphold and glorify the traditions it is necessary for all people to become true patriots who firmly maintain the principle of national independence in all fields and prove their real worth in the drive to build a great prosperous powerful nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
