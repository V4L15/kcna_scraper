            "content": "DPRK Government's Efforts for Peaceful Solution to Nuclear Issue \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 11 (KCNA) -- One year has passed since the DPRK formally withdrew from the NPT.\r\n Last year the DPRK government made every effort to seek a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the DPRK government's statement on its withdrawal from the NPT was made public on January 10, Juche 92 (2003) the United States, persistently turning away from the DPRK proposal for concluding a non-aggression treaty with the U.S., has viciously moved to create an international atmosphere of pressurizing the DPRK by misleading the public opinion over its peaceful nuclear activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK government has disclosed and denounced the injustice and shamelessness of the imperialist allied forces' hostile policy towards it through statements of the Foreign Ministry spokesmen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At a time when the U.S. imperialists made the Iraqi war of aggression a fait accompli, reinforced the armed forces for aggression in and around the Korean peninsula and launched frantic war drills to threaten the DPRK with an attempt to make a preemptive nuclear attack under the pretext of \"contingency,\" the DPRK declared all the U.S. moves as a complete abrogation of the Armistice Agreement through a statement of a spokesman for the Panmunjom Mission of the Korean People's Army and took a resolute military measure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And when laying international siege to the DPRK, military pressure and nuclear threat did not go down any longer, the U.S. could not but change its former stand \"No negotiation but talk\" and come out to the negotiating table in response to the DPRK's just demand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK government put forward a new and bold proposal for the settlement of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. at the Beijing tripartite talks in April last year with a view to materialising denuclearization of the Korean peninsula at any cost and ensuring peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to the initiative proposal and positive efforts of the DPRK government the Beijing 6-way talks was arranged in August 8 last year amid the expectation and concern of the world peace-loving people. But owing to the foolish and brigandish assertion of the U.S. who had no willing to drop its hostile policy towards the DPRK, the talks did so much harm but not any good. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK government at the 1st Session of the 11th Supreme People's Assembly solemnly declared at home and abroad that it would keep strengthening self-defensive means to check the nuclear preemptive attack of the U.S. and ensure peace and security on the Korean peninsula and the region in an effort to cope with the reckless moves of the U.S. \r\n Even under the situation in which the U.S. legalised research into smaller nukes against the DPRK and allocated a large amount of budget to it, the DPRK government repeatedly expressed its will to freeze its nuclear activity. And it proposed a package solution based on the principle of simultaneous actions as a basic way of settling the nuclear issue and provided a framework of resuming the 6-way talks to agree at least on the action program of the first stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's just proposals for the settlement of the nuclear issue have been supported worldwide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The 13th summit meeting of the non-aligned countries held in February last year in its final document expressed the unanimous view on settling the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula by the parties concerned by a means of dialogue and negotiation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world is now watching whether the U.S. has a true will to settle the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula on the principle of simultaneous actions and peaceful co-existence.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Kumgang, block again railway and road links between the north and the south and stop construction of industrial zone in Kaesong under the pretext of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and U.S.\r\n In this regard papers today carry signed commentaries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentaries charged that such move of the U.S. is a ferocious interference in the internal affairs of the Korean nation and unpardonable infringement on its sovereignty, and a serious challenge to all the Korean nation who are striving to achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the country under the banner of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. interruption in the development of inter-Korean relations and the process of national reconciliation betrays its attempt to invade the DPRK, Rodong Sinmun says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The progress of cooperation between the north and the south such as relinking railways and roads, tourism to Mt. Kumgang and construction of industrial zone in Kaesong is the work that should be done by the north and the south, not a work in which the United States interferes. There is neither reason nor justification for the U.S. to meddle in the projects. The United States revealed again its intention to keep the occupation of south Korea and pursue the policy of aggression on Korea by hampering the development of inter-Korean relations and the reunification movement which the Korean nation is pushing forward in conformity with its desire and will. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson says that the United States is persistently disturbing the improvement of inter-Korean relations at any cost to turn the structure of the Korean nation versus the United States confrontation into that between the north and the south and unleash a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula. That is why the U.S. put pressure upon south Korean authorities this time to control the speed of promotion of inter-Korean relations.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

That was a big mistake. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another serious mistake was that the army and the people of Iraq had lived in peace without a correct viewpoint of a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that the arms guarantee peace, the article notes that only when the army and people reliably defend their posts with keyed-up and mobilized attitude can they frustrate aggression and war moves of the imperialists, defend the sovereignty and peace of the country and successfully push ahead with the revolution and construction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

We showed this to Lewis and his party this time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is our view that if the visit of Lewis and the nuclear specialist and their party helped the U.S. even a bit drop its ambiguous view on the DPRK's nuclear activities, it would serve as a substantial foundation for a peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. in the future. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
