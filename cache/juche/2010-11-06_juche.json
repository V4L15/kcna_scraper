Korean Authorities' Talk about \"Principal Enemy\" Censured\r\nPyongyang, November 6 (KCNA) -- The talk about the \"principal enemy\", a stumbling block lying in the way of reconciliation and unity, should never be allowed in the present era which calls for achieving reunification and prosperity by the concerted efforts of the Koreans as it is a leftover of the old era of confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Saturday observes this in a signed article.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Shortly ago the south Korean military released and distributed what it called a \"2010 report on army policy\" in which the conception that \"the north is the principal enemy\" is clearly stipulated in the wake of the call made by the ultra-right conservatives of the \"Grand National Party\" for labeling the north as \"the principal enemy\" in the \"white paper for national defence\" for this year, the article notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"principal enemy\" touted by the south Korean conservative group is a treacherous watchword for confrontation denying the national reconciliation and unity and fostering and aggravating the mistrust and confrontation between Koreans as it clearly reveals their conception of hostility towards the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The homogenous Korean nation desires reconciliation and unity, not confrontation, and hopes for peace and prosperity common to the nation, not a war, as it has lived in harmony in the same territory for 5000 years.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the south Korean conservative group's loudmouthed \"principal enemy\" totally denies this fact. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In a word, its much touted \"principal enemy\" defines fellow countrymen as the people with whom it should stand in confrontation and who should be destroyed by force of arms, not as the people with whom reconciliation and unity should be achieved. This conception is rebuffed and denounced by all the Koreans as it is a call for confrontation and war against reunification quite contrary to the June 15 era of reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said conception is nothing but one of confrontation and war which drives the inter-Korean relations to collapse and increases the danger of a war of aggression against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  It is preposterous for the south Korean ruling forces to talk about dialogue and the improved inter-Korean relations while noisily trumpeting about the \"principal enemy\" and crying out for confrontation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities would be well advised to stop at once the row about the \"principal enemy\" and sincerely respond to the DPRK's efforts for reconciliation, cooperation, peace and reunification."
