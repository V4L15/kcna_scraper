President Kim Il Sung dropped in at a rural village in South Phyongan Province to spend a night during his long journey of on-site guidance soon after the liberation of the country (August 1945).\r\n In the night he sat knee to knee with farmers to learn about their farming and living conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the midst of the talk, a farmer burst into cough and many others followed him one after another. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They were troubled with coughs and their flushed, tear-stained and distorted faces made others painful to see the president took close to heart the fact that they were suffering from an endemic disease as they drank standing water. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He hardened his determination at once to start a project to admit water from other region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thus beginning was the Phyongnam irrigation project to water the vast plains and farmers in the coastal area in the central part of the country. It was in autumn Juche 49 (1960) that the president saw a new apple tree planted in the garden around his house and asked officials where they brought it from. Upon hearing that they brought it from Kwail county, he instructed them to bring it back and plant it again in the orchard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He admonished the officials for uprooting the apple tree grown up by farmers with perspiration, saying that the orchard farm is a precious treasure to be handed down to the rising generations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The apple tree was replaced. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is another anecdote about him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp \r\n It was on March 13, Juche 76 (1987). The president canceled his plan to go to the Kum Song General Tractor Works and called a consultative meeting of leading officials in the field of machine industry. At the meeting he told the officials that he canceled his plan to go to the works this morning because he heard that workers were working at the works with no heating. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp \r\n He reprimanded the officials for their irresponsible manner of work, saying how he could put on a fur cap and a woolen overcoat to go to meet the workers working at the work place where temperature was below zero. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp \r\n He saw to it that a measure was taken to provide heating to their working place. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp \r\n It was only once in his lifetime that he canceled his plan for pleasant on-site guidance.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
