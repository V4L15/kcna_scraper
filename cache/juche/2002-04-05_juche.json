He said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nLet us find out it together. He looked round topography around the village before going to an ascent of a valley not far from the village together with officials of the farm. He looked around and pointed to a spot, telling them to dig there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When they dug the spot, marvelously a fountain of water gushed out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The villagers have since been freed from trouble over water. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One day of may, Juche 70 (1981) the president got aboard a ship once to fix a site of the west sea barrage, which was a difficult matter in the project. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The site he appointed was the point where water flowing from the sea and the River Taedong converged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Experts were moved to see a line of distinction between clear water of the sea and muddy water of the River Taedong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There were favorable geological conditions at the bottom of the sea and phi islet standing in the center of the sea. So it was easy to dam off a lot of water flowing from the river with the islet as a strongpoint. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At this most suitable site the west sea barrage was built in a matter of five years, demonstrating the might of the DPRK.    \r\n"

Since the division of the country the Workers' Party of Korea and the DPRK government have put forward realistic and just proposals and policies in conformity with the specific conditions of the movement for reunification and the requirements of the Korean nation and made every effort to materialize them. It is entirely because of the U.S. that these proposals and efforts failed to bear fruits and the country's reunification has not yet been achieved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is getting frantic in its moves to torpedo the process of inter-Korean reconciliation which had made good progress since the adoption of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and bring the situation back to that in the period of the confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has converted South Korea into its military base for aggression and made its people fall victim to armed crackdown. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThese crimes top the criminal index in the modern history. They clearly testify to the brigandish and barbaric nature of the U.S. imperialists who regard aggression and terrorism against other nations as a mode of their existence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists have been hell-bent on the moves to stifle and isolate the DPRK regarding Korean-style socialism as a thorn in their flesh. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean War ignited by the U.S. imperialists is characterized by mass killings and destruction unprecedented in human history. The Korean people's towering resentment at the U.S. imperialists is coupled with their firm pledge to take revenge upon the enemy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As clearly evidenced by Bush's recent remarks pulling up even the social system in the DPRK and openly disclosing hostility toward it, the U.S. intention to stifle the DPRK has gone beyond its limit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists have done immeasurable damage to the Korean people and hurt their self-respect in a bid to serve their interests in aggression and sinister political purpose. This has earned the U.S. imperialists the ill-fame of sworn enemy of all Koreans.  \r\n"
