Paektu Czech-Korean Friendship Association said in a statement that the U.S. has staged joint military exercises with South Korea every year for the purpose of invading the DPRK.  The U.S. ambition for great-power chauvinism has reached the climax, the statement noted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In a statement the Al Ansar Jordan Arab Party said that it is the U.S. mode of politics to achieve \"peace\" and \"security\" by means of war if dialogue partner goes against the grain with the U.S., while threatening it with war rackets such as joint military exercises.\r\n   The Sweden-Korea Friendship Association in a statement stressed that the U.S. must stop military threats  at once and lend an ear to the world public calling for making efforts to normalise relations with the DPRK.\r\n   The general secretary of the All-India Peace and Solidarity Organisation said in a statement that the U.S. must honestly fulfil the DPRK-U.S. joint statement and the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework and immediately take a measure for withdrawing its aggression troops from South Korea. \r\n \r\n"

That is a great exploit performed by Pomminryon in the history of the movement of reunification of the nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Pomminryon organisations face an important task to make a turning-point in the struggle of national reunification. \r\nThis is to fully support the struggle of the South Korean people for independence against outside forces and to achieve great unity of the whole nation.\r\n   All the regional organisations of Pomminryon should continue to push ahead with a vigorous struggle to frustrate the war moves that the South Korean authorities wage, joining hands with outside forces, and to remove the \"National Security Law\", the \"Agency for National Security Planning\" and the \"Ministry of National Unification,\" sources of escalating distrust and confrontation between the north and south.\r\n   They also should work hard for the release of all the illegally-arrested pro-reunification patriots in South Korea, frustration of the authorities'  moves for separation, alienation and  suppression against pro-reunification patriotic organisations and legalisation of the south headquarters of Pomminryon. \r\n \r\n"

Choe Chang Dong (former professor of law at Pusan College of Foreign Studies) was infiltrated into Pomminryon for the purposes of disintegration and destruction of the organisation.\r\n  Choe stole some of computer files of Kim Kyong Phil and transferred them to the ANSP.\r\n   Han Yong Su, an agent of the ANSP, kidnapped the couple on January 13 with the document as a bait.\r\n   The Chosun Ilbo Newspaper of South Korea January 17 spread a rumour about the North Korean diplomat's \"defection to America.\" The next day, other mass media of South Korea reported that Kim Kyong Phil asked the U.S. consulate for \"asylum.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   On January 20, South Korean media quoted a government official as saying that Kim might seek \"asylum\" in a third country, not the United States. The press reports were incoherent because the incident was not \"asylum\" but abduction.\r\n   We strongly warn the South Korean government and the ANSP. \r\n   If you do not return the innocent couple, we will inform the world public and conscientious-minded people of this fact, and the Kim Dae Jung regime of South Korea will be branded by the international community as a terrorist regime. The incident will be described as a second kidnapping case in east Berlin, and you will be to blame for the consequence.\r\n   The South Korean regime must immediately release the couple and apologize for the criminal act.\r\n   We will indict the South Korean regime's international terrorism, informing the German public that this is a second east Berlin case.\r\n   The South Korean regime must give up despicable terrorism and kidnapping abroad at once. \r\n\r\n"
