This was shocking extra-large crimes against human rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, Japan has not made a sincere apology and compensation for them till today when 60 years have passed since its defeat and, on the contrary, is drawing out the sword of sanctions against the Korean people like the guilty party filing the suit first. This is a robber-like act over which all people lament. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japanese reactionaries' improper act in trying to fake up other's fault in a far-fetched way, while shelving their own extra-large crimes against human rights must be cursed and denounced by the international community and be called in question without delay.\r\n The DPRK is never frightened by the disgusting drama of the Japanese reactionaries.\r\n The DPRK has nothing to pay to Japan with regard to the human rights issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt has only the right to get compensation for all the miseries and sufferings inflicted upon the Korean people by it in the past.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's Insult to World's Conscience Lambasted \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 11 (KCNA) -- The Japanese delegate gabbled at the 28th extraordinary session of the U.N. General Assembly held some time ago on the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the Oswiecim Concentration Camp that\r\nJapan \"saved\" Jews fleeing from Hitlerite Nazis during the Second World War and swaggered as if Japan has cleansed itself of the stigma of an \"enemy state\", waxing quite eloquent about the issue of U.N. fund sharing.\r\n Commenting on this, an analyst of Rodong Sinmun Friday says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is an intolerable insult to the Asian people and the world peace-loving people, being a crafty petty trick to cover up and embellish Japan's past crimes and to grab the seat of a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the height of sarcasm for the Japanese delegate to claim that the Japanese imperialists did \"something good\" for Nazi victims during the Second World War. Quite nonsensical is the jargon that Japan which was a military ally of fascist Germany \"saved\" Jews from Hitler, betraying its ally. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Still more impudent is the claim that Japan has cleaned itself of the stigma of an \"enemy state\" thanks to its U.N. fund sharing. In the past the Japanese imperialists invaded   Korea, China and other Asian countries, imposing shocking misfortunes and calamities upon their peoples. Japan, however, does not admit still today the grave crimes it committed against the world and humankind in past century and persistently evades the settlement of the past. For this, it has not yet been cleaned of the dishonor of an \"enemy state\" and finds itself the target of curses, denunciation and vigilance of all people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The stigma of an \"enemy state\" is not wiped out by U.N. fund sharing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In trumpeting about what it calls \"international contribution\" while openly distorting and beautifying its past history of aggression on the UN rostrum, Japan seeks to evade to the end a proper compensation for the grave crimes committed by it in the last century and grab at any cost the seat of a permanent member of the UN Security Council   and thus behave as a political power and a military power. This seat is neither sold and bought with money nor got with mere wish. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to sincerely settle its past before stealing a look at the seat of a permanent member state of the UNSC.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "GNP's Defense of NSL Blasted \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 11 (KCNA) -- The south Korean Grand National Party which is denounced and rejected by the south Korean people is these days inviting a spate of criticism even from its own lawmakers.\r\n Commenting on this a Minju Joson analyst Friday says this criticism is coming from those who have a rather correct view of the reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The deputy floor leader of the GNP a few days ago said in a sharp tone at a meeting that the falling rate of support to the party these days resulted from the impression left by its diehard conservatism, defense of vested rights and seclusionist management of the party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the GNP seeks is to return to the past and bring back the dark policy and dictatorship, persisting in conservatism and seclusion, not innovation and progress. This is explained by the issue of the National Security Law. \r\n Last year the GNP blocked the repeal of the NSL within the year by bringing forward the question of \"crisis of the nature of the system\" and it is this year opposing its discussion at the \"extraordinary session of the national assembly\"   under the pretext of \"economic stagnancy\" and \"hardships of people.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Is the GNP truly concerned over the economy and people's living? Never! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Paying no heed to the lot of the people and the catastrophe of the economy, they do whatever they please and engage themselves in bickering, regarding the NA as a theater of plot-breeding for power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP right-wing conservatives are seeking to maintain the confrontation structure with the north through the maintenance of the NSL, by shelving its debate at the NA under the pretext of \"people's living and economy.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP's attempts to keep the NSL will only lead to its self destruction.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
