Notably, the Park Geun Hye regime is behaving so foolishly as to peddle such anti-reunification watchwords as \"confidence-building process on the Korean peninsula\" and \"Dresden declaration\" in breach of the declaration and get the international recognition of them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is nothing but an anti-reunification act of pursuing the \"unification by absorption\" under the \"liberal democracy\" and inciting the confrontation of the social systems in the north and the south in total denial of the idea of By Our Nation Itself, the basic spirit of the June 15 joint declaration, and the proposal for reunification by federal formula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group put up the showy slogan of \"confidence\" outwardly but, in actuality, has desperately kicked up the confrontation of the social systems. This is little short of declaring a war against the DPRK as it is a blatant challenge to the June 15 joint declaration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reunification of the north and the south by federal formula provides a way of ensuring durable peace on the Korean peninsula and in the rest of Northeast Asia but \"unification by absorption\" will only bring a war to the peninsula. This is the truth recognized not only by all Koreans but also by their neighboring countries and the rest of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"Dresden declaration\" and the \"great opportunity for unification\" touted by Park in the final analysis fully revealed before the world that the \"confidence-building process on the Korean peninsula\" claimed by her is no more than a process for the confrontation of the social systems in the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those countries which are concerned for the Korean issue and support and welcome the June 15 joint declaration should see through the anti-peace nature of Park's \"confidence-building process on the Korean peninsula\" which diametrically runs counter to the declaration.   They should be well aware of the fact that if they stir up the process for the confrontation of the social systems against their will or not, failing to maintain a fair and discreet attitude toward the north-south relations, the ensuing catastrophic consequences would not be limited to the Korean peninsula only.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reporter and speakers called on the  progressive personages who love justice and peace, international democratic organizations and peace-loving people in the world to heighten vigilance against the anti-reunification acts of the Park group, resolutely reject and denounce it and extend support and solidarity to the Korean people in their just cause of achieving reunification by federal formula based on the June 15 joint declaration and ensuring peace and stability on the peninsula and in the rest of Northeast Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The meeting also discussed the issues of boosting the interaction among the social organizations as required by the prevailing situation and conducting vigorous activities to disclose the anti-reunification moves of the Park group and achieve peace and stability on the peninsula."
