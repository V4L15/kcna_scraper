            "content": "Rodong Sinmun condena el armamento nuclear de Japon\r\nPyongyang, 11 de agosto (ATCC) -- En un comentario individual publicado el dia 11, el periodico Rodong Sinmun condeno la locura militarista de los reaccionarios japoneses que aumentan sus fuerzas armadas y tratan de tener las armas nucleares para realizar su siniestra ambicion de conquistar a Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t Un colectivo de investigacion perteneciente al gobierno japones, conocido ampliamente como organo consultivo del premier y entidad de cerebros que representa a las fuerzas militaristas, publico un informe relativo a la \"nueva politica de seguridad\" que contiene serios problemas que no se pueden pasar por alto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Asi senala el comentarista y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El problema esta en que ese informe servira de base teorica del \"gran programa de defensa\" que va a enmendar el gobierno japones dentro de este ano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El nuevo \"programa\" deviene el plan militar agresivo que estipula oficialmente los problemas que Japon debe tomar como su guia en el sector militar durante casi 10 anos futuros.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En aquel informe dicha entidad planteo la revision del articulo de la prohibicion de introduccion de armas nucleares en los \"tres principios para la desnuclearizacion\" hablando de la necesidad del ofrecimiento del \"paraguas nuclear\" de EE.UU. a Japon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esto demuestra claramente cuan grave es la locura de la \"vibora\" militarista por armarse con artefactos nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Los militaristas japoneses dan acicate al aumento de las fuerzas armadas agresoras para realizar con la fuerza su descarada ambicion de ser \"caudillo de Asia\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La RPDC es el primer blanco de ataque en la eventual agresion de Japon a ultramar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Las fuerzas militaristas de Japon tratan de realizar a toda costa su ambicion de agredir otra vez a Corea y su largo sueno de la \"esfera de coprosperidad de la gran Asia Oriental\" usando la alianza militar con EE.UU. como palanca de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Resulta obvio que si el teatro de operacion de las fuerzas militaristas de Japon se amplia a la vasta region de Asia y el Pacifico, incluida la Peninsula Coreana, traspasando la frontera de ese pais, seran perturbadas la paz y la estabilidad de esta region y se repetira la historia de agresion ensangrentada de los imperialistas japoneses."
