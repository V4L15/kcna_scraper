They talked rubbish, expressing regret at the fact that the prime minister and cabinet ministers did not visit it, a news analyst notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This proves that by pressurizing politicians who did not visit the shrine the Japanese reactionaries seek to put the group visit of the ruling quarters to the shrine on a regular and traditional basis in a bid to let militarism prevail in the Japanese society and call back the departed soul of militarism and thus launch reinvasion come what may. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese ultra-right conservatives are contemplating converting the shrine into a state cemetery so that all Japanese including political heavyweights may regularly visit it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is nothing but a criminal move to arm the Japanese with militarist idea and militarize Japan. The ulterior aim sought by the Japanese reactionaries is to militarize Japan and realize their overseas aggression. Herein lies the serious and dangerous nature of the Japanese reactionary conservatives' visit to the shrine. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whether the Japanese reactionary quarters visit the shrine or not is a touchstone showing whether Japan opts for peace after redressing its crime-woven past or pursues militarism and reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries have become evermore frantic in their moves to build an ideological groundwork for overseas aggression and create social atmosphere in favor of it through the visit to the shrine and other moves while persistently evading the redemption of Japan's past crimes, talking nonsense that it was Japan that underwent sufferings in the past. This is little short of precipitating its international isolation and digging its own grave.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This eventful development represents a great diplomatic success made by the DPRK and a powerful demonstration of the validity of its independent foreign policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The achievements gained by the DPRK in its external relations constitute a positive contribution to the development of the situation on the Korean Peninsula and Asia-Pacific region and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Independence, peace and friendship are the avowed idea of the foreign policy of the Workers' Party of Korea and the DPRK government. The DPRK, guided by this idea, has developed the friendly and cooperative relations with different countries of the world advocating independence and consistently maintained the stand of developing good neighborly and friendly relations with the capitalist countries which respect its sovereignty and are friendly toward it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The independent, peace-loving and friendly foreign policy of the DPRK government and its activities are fully supported and welcomed by the world progressives advocating independence. It has become an irresistible trend of the times that the international interest in the DPRK is growing deep day by day and many countries wish to improve and develop their relations with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even those countries which had kept aloof from the DPRK are now developing their relations with it on good terms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the great successes and progress made by the DPRK in the external relations are the shining fruition of the Songun politics, independent politics pursued by Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the firm will of the DPRK to strictly abide by the generally accepted norms and principles governing the international relations and make sustained energetic endeavors to establish a new and fair international order and build a new world, independent, peaceful and friendly, concludes the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
