They went So far as to vilify the DPRK over a political issue which had nothing to do with the aid.\r\n   The vicious anti-DPRK diatribe came at a time when the South Korean intelligence service was zealously spreading a rumour that three million people died of starvation in North Korea in the past four years, in a bid to frustrate international humanitarian aid to it. So, the recent anti-DPRK campaign cannot be considered to be a separate one at all. It proves that with a view to using international humanitarian aid for the \"disintegration and overthrow\" of the system in North Korea hostile elements are now turning to an extremely despicable means.\r\n   We are exerting every possible effort to make sure that international humanitarian aid is effectively used for stable living of the people in the afflicted areas and rehabilitation in those areas and rendering every sincere cooperation to aid organisations in their performance.\r\n   As already clarified, the DPRK has always adhered to the principled stand that it welcomes any aid,  purely humanitarian, but it will not accept any aid with political conditionally meant to serve a sinister aim.\r\n   We will never pardon those who dare vilify the political and socialist systems in North Korea, whoever they may be and whatever the reason.\r\n   The responsibility for consequences of the recent smear campaign will lie with those who orchestrated the farce and those involved in it. \r\n     \r\n"
