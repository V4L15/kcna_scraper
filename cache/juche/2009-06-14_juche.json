            "content": "Lee Myung Bak Group's Anti-DPRK Outbursts Rebuked\r\n Pyongyang, June 14 (KCNA) -- Traitor Lee Myung Bak, addressing a recent meeting commemorating the Memorial Day, blustered that the north is \"threatening global peace and security\" and south Korea these days and cried out for \"resolutely and decisively coping with the threat.\" He, at the same time, let loose a spate of balderdash about \"denuclearization\", \"dialogue\" and \"cooperation\". When meeting with a U.S. inter-agency delegation on a visit to south Korea earlier, he begged the U.S. for its \"cooperation\" over the issue of the DPRK's nuclear test and missile launch. He was so impertinent as to utter that south Korea \"would render huge assistance to the north if it dismantled its nukes.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Sunday in a signed commentary carried in this regard terms what Lee uttered an unpardonable challenge and mockery of the DPRK as it was treacherous remarks which could be let loose only by those seized with antagonism against fellow countrymen and ambition for confrontation with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a publicly recognized fact that the stability of the Korean Peninsula and global peace are gravely threatened by the U.S. brandishing nuclear weapons and the puppet war maniacs, its lackeys.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With no sophism can the puppet bellicose forces cover up the truth about the evermore growing threat of aggression against the north or conceal their dirty colors as the nuclear war servants of the U.S. imperialists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was none other than Lee Myung Bak who took the lead in creating complexity in settling the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula and torpedoing the process of denuclearization, while echoing his U.S. master's claim that \"north Korea should dismantle its nukes first\" from the very day he came to power and frantically kicking up a racket of confrontation with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His reckless remarks are, in the final analysis, nothing but a wordplay and a smokescreen to conceal his scenario to hurt and stifle compatriots and realize his criminal ambition for \"achieving unification by invading the north\" in league with foreign forces including the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Every sin brings its punishment with it and a criminal is bound to be judged by history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee will not be able to escape a stern judgment of history for having slandered the DPRK with his trite sophism about \"threat from the north\" and kicked up with bloodshot eyes a racket to stifle fellow countrymen in cooperation with outside forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had better drop his foolish dream of seeking a way out in the confrontation with the DPRK."
