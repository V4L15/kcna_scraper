            "content": "CPRK Secretariat Denounces S. Korean Regime for Moving to Disband Unified Progressive Party\r\nPyongyang, October 24 (KCNA) -- The south Korean conservative group urged the puppet Ministry of Justice to form a \"team of experts to take measures against political parties and organizations violating constitution\" and staged the farce of making legal examination for the disorganization of the Unified Progressive Party. It decided to request the puppet constitutional court to try the case and is inviting lawyers for the trial.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe coteries of the \"Saenuri Party\" at a state inspection of the \"National Assembly\" set the disbandment of the Unified Progressive Party as an issue top on agenda and are fanning up hysteria, talking about \"enemy of liberal democracy\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea in its information bulletin No. 1048 on Thursday said the south Korean puppet conservative group's moves for the disbandment of the Unified Progressive Party are a shocking fascist rowdyism unprecedented in history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe group calls for disbanding the Unified Progressive Party, linking it with the DPRK. This is an unpardonable provocation and challenge to the DPRK, the information bulletin said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe group is talking about \"political party following the north\" and \"plotted rebellion\". This is illogical sophism that can be made only by those obsessed by confrontation with fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is quite natural that the south Koreans of all social standings are denouncing the group's moves for the disbandment of the Unified Progressive Party as \"an act violating democracy\", \"neo-fascist act\" and \"an act of raising wind of McCarthyism\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe group is also trying to disorganize the Teachers Union, calling it the \"heart of forces following the north\" and \"inside enemy\". It even seeks to shut down Jaju Minbo, a progressive internet paper.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIts suppression is aimed to remove the core of the progressive forces in south Korea, shrink all the forces standing for reunification through alliance with the north and forces for democracy and reform and lay a springboard for its long-term stay in power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe prevailing situation clearly proves that the puppet group is a horde of hideous fascist hooligans and confrontational maniacs who put the past military dictators into the shade."

This fact was proven by earthenware depicting silkworm from the relics dating back to the Neolithic and Bronze ages, discovered in Pongsan County, North Hwanghae Province.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIts silk-weaving technique was spread even to Japan in the period of the Three Kingdoms in Korea.  According to a Japanese history book, Korean technicians had been active in Japan from the 4th-5th centuries to the 7th century to teach how to produce silk.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe silk-producing technique further developed, with silk fabrics increased in number of varieties, in the period of Koryo Kingdom (918-1392). And the fabrics was exported even to the Middle and Near East for its good quality and widely known to the world as \"Koryo Silk\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere appeared a large number of silk production bases and areas of mulberry during the Feudal Joson Dynasty (1392-1910). \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe localities of Korea noted for silk production are Nyongbyon in North Phyongan Province, Songchon in South Phyongan Province, Kumya, Jongphyong, Kowon, Pukchong and Tanchon in South Hamgyong Province, Kilju and Myongchon in North Hamgyong Province, Cholwon in Kangwon Province, Suan in North Hwanghae Province, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAmong the famous silk fabrics, there are Yaksandan and Kuryongdan silks named by President Kim Il Sung. Yaksandan, patterned with azalea, was named after Yaksandongdae, a well-known area in Nyongbyon, and Kuryongdan the River Kuryong skirting Yaksandongdae.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThese kinds of silk cloth are produced at the Nyongbyon Silk Mill, a famous silk producer in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe modernly-equipped mill also turns out various kinds of silk fabrics such as polychromatic silk, brocade and satin, with silk thread produced at the Pyongyang Kim Jong Suk Silk Mill and rayon yarn at the Chongjin Chemical Fibre Mill as main raw materials.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Korean silk is still very popular among foreigners as well as local people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Pyongyang Silk Shop, located in Mansudae Street in the capital city of the DPRK, serves many silk products including chima (skirt) and jogori (coat) and bed suites."

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun Slams Park Geun Hye's \"Confidence-building Process on Korean Peninsula\"\r\nPyongyang, October 24 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Thursday runs a commentator's article on the lapse of 8 months since Park Geun Hye took office, touting \"confidence-building process on the Korean Peninsula\" as her policy towards the north. \n\t\t\t\t\tThe article says:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe \"confidence-building process on the Korean Peninsula\" is, in a nutshell, a ridiculous watchword aimed to lead the north to changes and induce it to dismantle its nukes under the signboard of \"confidence\" and conduct \"economic cooperation\" if it abandons its nuclear program and brings about a system change. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis watchword is, in essence, nothing different from \"no nukes, opening and 3 000 dollars,\" a policy of confrontation with the DPRK pursued by traitor Lee Myung Bak as it is designed to realize her wild ambition for invading the north in collusion with outside forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt may be called a very cunning and sinister confrontation and anti-reunification policy veiled with the high-sounding word of \"confidence\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe \"confidence-building process on the Korean Peninsula\" is a treacherous policy for fostering distrust and hostility between the north and the south and seeking confrontation with fellow countrymen. It is a policy of a war against the DPRK as it is aimed to force it to unilaterally dismantle its nukes and disarm it and realize her scenario for invasion of it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs soon as Park came to power, she revealed her true colors as a confrontation maniac, claiming that the \"confidence-building process on the Korean Peninsula\" was not the \"policy of appeasement\" but the one \"based on military deterrence supported by the south Korea-U.S. alliance\" and that \"south Korea would strongly counter the north's provocation through south Korea-U.S. cooperation.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMoreover, south Korea staged DPRK-targeted madcap war exercises of various forms including Key Resolve, Foal Eagle and Ulji Freedom Guardian with the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean puppet conservative group derailed the hard-won talks between authorities of the north and the south, blustering \"south Korea would not have dialogue to be pulled by the north\" and \"it would stick to its principle\". Park drove the Kaesong Industrial Zone into a crisis, vociferating about \"hostage incident\" and \"operation of commando unit of the U.S. forces,\" something her predecessor dared not do. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is the present regime in south Korea which staged a ridiculous farce of opening even the minutes of the north-south summit to public in a desperate bid to mar its historic significance. It is again the regime that deleted all the points related to the October 4 declaration from \"the second principal plan for the development of south-north relations\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLee Myung Bak begged the U.S. for \"extended deterrence\" which assures the provision of U.S. nuclear umbrella. Not to lag behind him, Park Geun Hye adopted the \"tailored deterrence strategy\" for preemptive attack on the north by mobilizing even a nuclear force in the U.S. mainland and went the lengths of fully joining in the establishment of the U.S. missile defense system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSince Park came to power, the danger of a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula has reached its height.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark and her group urge the DPRK to dismantle its nukes and cancel its new line of simultaneously pushing forward economic construction and the building of nuclear force under the pretext of \"confidence-building\". Lurking behind this is a sinister intention to disarm the DPRK and achieve their goal of aggression in collusion with foreign forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe above-said watchword is an anti-reunification policy as it totally denies the mending of the north-south relations and seeks confrontation of the social systems. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTraitor Lee Myung Bak pursued a \"waiting strategy\" obsessed with a daydream of \"contingency\" in the north. But Park Geun Hye went one step ahead to cry out for \"leading the north to changes, not just waiting for them.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe newly adopted \"principal plan for the development of south- north relations\" singles out \"the process of leading the north to changes\" as a key principle and orientation and clarifies the will to strengthen cooperation in the campaign to pressurize the DPRK to implement it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTheir talk about \"changes\" is nothing but pressure upon the DPRK to stop following the road of independence, Songun and socialism but introduce corrupt American style capitalism just as they did. It is an intolerable insult and vicious provocation to the people of the DPRK who regard the dignity of the supreme leadership and the social system as their own life and soul. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is none other than the south Korean authorities who should take a right option and opt for changes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey should make a major policy switchover as they desperately insist on extending the transfer of the OPECON (wartime operation control) which they had been supposed to take over from the U.S. and are working hard to revive \"Yusin\" dictatorship enforced decades ago.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll facts go to prove that the above-said watchword is nothing but an extremely sinister scenario as it is not aimed at building confidence and improving the north-south relations but at fostering distrust, confrontation and war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. is behind the \"confidence-building process on the Korean Peninsula\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is the U.S. scenario for invading the north it provided to the south Korean puppet forces in a bid to introduce into the Korean Peninsula the \"Helsinki process\" which succeeded in bringing down socialist countries. It is a product of the U.S. policy of aggression toward Korea and Asian strategy from A to Z.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. instigated south Korea to advocate the \"confidence-building process on the Korean Peninsula\" as a new doctrine for aggression to maintain the pro-U.S. conservative regime in south Korea and use the south Korean puppet forces as a cat's paw in the moves to put the whole Korean Peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia under its control. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is nothing but an empty talk and hypocrisy for the south Korean authorities to vociferate about \"confidence\" while running amuck to escalate the confrontation with fellow countrymen and launch a war against the north in collusion with outside forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Park Geun Hye group, in particular, has no face to talk about \"confidence\" as it has malignantly slandered the dignity of the supreme leadership and the social system in the DPRK which its service personnel and people regard as dearer than their own life. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat the Korean nation wants is not such play of words as \"confidence-building process\" but the earliest possible implementation of the historic north-south declarations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe implementation of the joint declarations guarantees confidence, improved relations, peace on the Korean Peninsula and reunification and prosperity of the nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNow is the time for the Park group to give up its anachronistic sycophancy toward the U.S., take a right option and bring about  changes in the idea of \"by our nation itself\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf she truly wants confidence-building and improved relations between the north and the south, she should roll back the policy of confrontation with fellow countrymen, stop the war moves and opt for implementing the north-south joint declarations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK will as ever join hands with anyone who hopes for national reconciliation, unity, peace and reunification, not asking about one's past. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark Geun Hye would be well advised to pay heed to the DPRK's advise and call with good reason, though belatedly."
