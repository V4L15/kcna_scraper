He praised the soldier-builders for successfully constructing them as required by their designs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To keep pace with the arrangement of environment is important in construction, he noted, underscoring the need to pay attention to land leveling and plant trees and create greenbelt, at the same time, in a planned manner so as to wind up the project, leaving no traces of construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After learning about the progress made in the construction of school, kindergarten, hospital and other public buildings and welfare and  service facilities, he called for focusing efforts on the structures nearing  completion and pushing ahead with the project as scheduled.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching the park under construction in the area, he said that people and school youth and children like to visit the rebuilt parks in Pyongyang.

Whenever there arises a difficult task, he is used to visit the army and assign it to it, he added. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Primary attention should be paid to ensuring quality in the construction, he said, calling for completing the houses in a perfect manner and providing them to scientists so that they may be fully satisfied with them, leaving nothing inconvenient.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This year is a year of scientists who demonstrated before the whole world the dignity and national power of the country with signal scientific and technological achievements, he said, stressing that there is nothing to spare for them who proved in practice the justice of the WPK's policy of attaching importance to science and technology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He instructed the WPK Central Committee and the Cabinet to dispatch responsible officials to the spot to learn about the progress made in the construction and review daily, weekly and monthly fulfillment of quotas and take measures to ensure that no job is delayed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying he would frequently visit the construction site to learn about the progress made in the construction, he noted the houses can be provided to the scientists only when their construction meets the requirements of the standard set by him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He gave an instruction to successfully complete the houses to be proud of before the world by the Day of Songun when leader Kim Jong Il started his Songun revolutionary leadership.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Choe Hwi, Pak Thae Song, Hwang Pyong So, Hong Yong Chil, Ma Won Chun, Yun Tong Hyon, Pak Jong Chon and Ju To Hyon."

            "content": "CPRK Accuses S. Korean Chief Executive of Her Anti-DPRK Remarks\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, July 1 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) Monday gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA as regards the provocative remarks made by the south Korean chief executive against the DPRK during her trip to China:\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Hye let loose a whole string of provocative remarks seriously hurting the dignity and social system in the DPRK while visiting China.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the \"summit talks,\" conversations, press conference and in a special lecture given at a university during her trip she persistently raised the \"nuclear issue in the north\", expressing \"concern\" and \"disallowance.\" She went the lengths of blustering that the DPRK's new strategic line on simultaneously pushing forward economic construction and the building of nuclear force is \"something impossible from the beginning\" and \"this only invites self-isolation.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Describing the DPRK's nukes as a threat to the peace in the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia, she impertinently urged it to \"dismantle nukes\" and \"turn itself into a responsible member of the international community\" and implored China to help in the issue of \"defectors from the north.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She made so desperate efforts to garner support for south Korea that her shamelessness and disgusting nature reached the height.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As for the nuclear issue, even a mere child knows that the issue was spawned by the U.S., and the nuclear threat to the Korean Peninsula is coming from the U.S. and south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She kept mum about U.S. nukes for aggression despite the fact that it is the arch criminal who staged largest-ever madcap maneuvers for a nuclear war against the DPRK after bringing nuclear strategic means into south Korea. She, however, vociferated about \"disallowance\" and the like, taking issue with fellow countrymen's nuclear shield of justice. This reminds one of guilty party filing the suit first.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What merits a more serious attention is that Park, defying repeated warnings of the DPRK, dared take issue again with the DPRK's new strategic line during her trip.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a blatant challenge to the dignity, social system and political line of the DPRK and an unpardonable grave provocation against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's new line is the most independent and patriotic one for building a thriving nation to enable its people to fully lead wealth and luxury under socialism. Because it calls for bolstering up nuclear force and the  country's defence capability so as to provide a sure guarantee for the security and prosperity of the nation and direct greater efforts to economic construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lurking behind the malignant accusations made by Park against the DPRK over its most just great line even in a foreign country is a sinister intention to persist in her moves to escalate confrontation and aggression, much upset by the DPRK's ever-increasing might and position and the failure of U.S. policy of a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She again cried out for \"change\" in the DPRK while talking about \"new south-north relations\" and \"new Korean Peninsula\", but it is the south Korean regime which has to be changed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is proved by the fact that the voices censuring the present regime for being worse than the Lee Myung Bak regime in confrontation with compatriots are growing stronger in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to grab power the Park Geun Hye regime let the Intelligence Service interfere in the \"presidential\" election and even fully open to public the minutes of the inter-Korean summit to stay in power, an act which traitor Lee Myung Bak dared not to do, turning south Korea into a pandemonium and making its ruling system shake to its very foundation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This being a hard fact, Park feigned ignorance of this. During her trip she uttered the word \"confidence\" whenever an opportunity presented itself, blaring \"confidence is what she considered as most important while enforcing politics and she regarded diplomacy based on confidence as the cornerstone of diplomacy.\" This brings her brazen-faced nature to light.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Can the DPRK have dialogue based on confidence with such south Korean authorities in the future?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Talking about \"confidence-building process on the Korean Peninsula\", Park asserted south Korea would never allow the north's access to nukes under any circumstances and it would resolutely counter the \"provocation\" but would help the north if it dismantles its nukes and opts for change. This clearly indicates that the \"confidence-building process\" she spelled out as the \"policy toward the north\" is a dangerous confrontation policy little different from the watchword \"no nukes, opening and 3 000 dollars\" put up by the Lee Myung Bak regime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In a final analysis, her ulterior intention is to disarm the DPRK with the help of foreign forces and bring about a change in its social system through international cooperation. This is, however, nothing but a daydream.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During her recent trip, Park spoke of her compatriots so ill to embarrass others that she was advised to \"have goodwill.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Explicitly speaking once again, Park should clearly know that the DPRK's nukes, shield for justice and peace and treasure for the nation, can never be a bargaining chip in any case and they cannot be subject at a negotiating table no matter how vociferously the puppet group, war servants of the U.S., may talk about them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will never pardon those who pursue confrontation with fellow countrymen while daring hurt the dignity of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is following Park with last patience.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean authorities truly want dialogue with the north and improved relations, they should stop such foolish behavior as sycophancy toward the U.S. and confrontation with compatriots and their demeanor inciting confrontation which does them nothing good but take a national stand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This will be the only right option for inter-Korean relations and for themselves."

            "content": "CRPP rechaza palabras de Park Geun-hye dichas en visita a China\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPyongyang, 1 de julio (ACNC) -- A la pregunta de la ACNC formulada el dia primero en relacion con que durante su visita a China, la mandataria surcoreana pronuncio palabras provocativas a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea, el vocero del Comite por la Reunificacion Pacifica de la Patria (CRPP) dio la siguiente respuesta:\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante su visita a China, Park Geun-hye dijo unas palabras provocativas que insultaron seriamente la dignidad y el regimen de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la \"cumbre\", entrevistas y ruedas de prensa y conferencia especial impartida en una universidad, ella cuestiono obstinadamente el \"problema nuclear del Norte\" expresando \"preocupacion\" e \"inaceptabilidad\" y calumnio la linea de desarrollo paralelo de la RPDC como \"cosa imposible\" y \"camino que busca el aislamiento propio\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, al describir el arma nuclear de la RPDC como amenaza para la paz de la Peninsula Coreana y el Nordeste Asiatico, senalo que \"(el Norte) debe abandonar ese artefacto y hacerse un miembro responsable de la sociedad internacional\" y mendigo el apoyo en el asunto de \"fugitivos norcoreanos\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tResultaron repugnantes el cinismo y la postura miserable con que Park trato de buscar el apoyo a su camarilla.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs bien conocido que el problema nuclear fue causado por Estados Unidos y la amenaza nuclear en la Peninsula Coreana proviene de ese imperio y el Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA decir verdad, es precisamente el Sur de Corea el que introdujo en su territorio los medios estrategicos nucleares de EE.UU. y lanza demencialmente la inusitada campana de guerra nuclear contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, sin hacer referencia alguna al armamento nuclear agresivo de EE.UU., dice con la logica de bandido que es \"inaceptable\" el escudo nuclear de justicia de la connacional RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo mas grave del caso es que a pesar de las repetidas advertencias, Park censuro otra vez en su estancia en China la linea de la RPDC de impulsar simultaneamente la construccion economica y la de fuerzas armadas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto constituye un desafio frontal a la dignidad, el regimen y la linea politica de la RPDC y una provocacion nunca tolerable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsa linea es la orientacion mas independiente y patriotica para fortalecer las fuerzas armadas nucleares, de modo que se consolide en todos los aspectos la defensa nacional, se garanticen la seguridad y prosperidad de la nacion y se de mayor impulso a la construccion economica con la meta de construir un Estado prospero donde los habitantes puedan vivir en opulencias en el sistema socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa acusacion de Park es para recurrir a toda costa a la confrontacion y las maniobras de agresion contra la RPDC al ver que el poderio y el prestigio de la RPDC han llegado al climax y las maniobras de guerra nuclear de EE.UU. se encuentran en la crisis de fracaso. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta vez, Park parloteo otra vez del \"cambio\" diciendo sobre las \"nuevas relaciones entre el Sur y el Norte de Corea\" y \"nueva Peninsula Coreana\", pero, el que debe cambiarse primero es el \"poder\" del Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo prueba el hecho de que en el Sur de Corea se alzan las voces de calificar el \"poder\" de Park de un poder mas conflictivo que el de Lee Myung Bak.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara tomar el poder, el \"poder\" de Park instigo al Servicio de Inteligencia a intervenir en las \"elecciones presidenciales\" y dio a la publicidad la nota del dialogo de la Cumbre Norte-Sur de Corea en que ni el traidor Lee Myung Bak se atrevio a pensar, de manera que reinara caos en el interior del Sur de Corea y se sacudiera de raiz el sistema de gobernacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA pesar de esto, Park dijo cinicamente que \"lo que pienso al hacer la politica es la confianza\" y \"la diplomacia esta basada tambien en la confianza\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY al decir del \"proceso de confianza de la Peninsula Coreana\" insistio en que bajo cualesquier condiciones, es intolerable la posesion de armas nucleares del Norte, hara rotundo frente a su \"provocacion\" y ayudara al Norte si este toma el camino de cambio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon tales peroratas puso al desnudo que el \"proceso de confianza\" tomado por ella como su \"politica sobre el Norte\" es una politica conflictiva y peligrosa igual a \"la desnuclearizacion, la apertura y 3 000 dolares\" de la banda de Lee Myung Bak.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn una palabra, la intencion de Park es desarmarnos con las fuerzas foraneas y cambiar nuestro regimen a traves de las cooperaciones internacionales anti-RPDC, lo que es una ilusion irrealizable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor su procedimiento conflictivo, la mandataria surcoreana recibio un consejo de que \"tuviera una buena alma\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tElla debe saber claramente que no podra ser objeto de regateo nuestra arma nuclear, considerada como escudo para la justicia y la paz y tesoro nacional por mas que picotee tanto la sirvienta de guerra de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestro ejercito y pueblo no perdonaran jamas a quienes recurran a la confrontacion fratricida burlandose atrevidamente de nuestra dignidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la actualidad, observamos a Park con la ultima paciencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi las autoridades surcoreanas desean de veras el dialogo entre el Norte y el Sur y la mejora de las relaciones intercoreanas, deben poner fin a los actos conflictivos inutiles inclusive el servilismo a EE.UU. y la confrontacion fratricida y tomar la posicion nacional botando las palabrerias
