On the other hand, she is amassing her fortune and preparing a luxury mansion and resorting to all other despicable acts, away from the eyes of the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She intentionally created the atmosphere of crisis throughout society while vociferating about \"state emergency\" and she took under her wing her confidants though the motion calling for their dismissal passed through the puppet National Assembly. All this is aimed to build a springboard from which to realize her ambition for stay in office.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not content with collecting taxes from the people by abusing power, she has gone desperate to accumulate a sizeable amount of funds to be used after retirement. These are known through the disclosure of a series of power-backed scandals.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No one knows how many hand-raised confidants like U Pyong U and Kim Jae Su she had appointed to important posts for her subsequent stay in power and how many ghost-like corruption-tainted entities like MIR Foundation, K Sports Foundation she created for amassing funds for meeting her political and financial greed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Yet, the traitor is mocking at the public just like a vendor crying wine and selling vinegar with such rhetoric as \"honest politics\" and \"miracle of the River Han\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the worst tragedy and misfortune for the south Korean people that the descendant of the \"yusin\" dictator and the worst imbecile and bete noire seized by embezzlement and prodigality, not feeling guilty at all of turning south Korea into the worst theatre of fascist rowdyism, barren land of people's living and the veritable hell in history, is still holding the power in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Crime is bound to bring punishment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean people have to take Park out of Chongwadae and bury her at once."

            "content": "Vocero del CRPP compara con canto funebre chismes anti-RPDC de Park Geun-hye\r\nPyongyang, 18 de octubre (ACNC) -- En exclusiva con la ACNC concedida en relacion con que ultimamente, la traidora surcoreana Park Geun-hye vierte calumnias a la RPDC, el portavoz del Comite por la Reunificacion Pacifica de la Patria (CRPP) dio el dia 18 la siguiente respuesta:\n\t\t\t\t\t  El dia primero, la traidora Park Geun-hye habia dicho en el llamado \"discurso conmemorativo del Dia de las Fuerzas Armadas\" unos disparates que agitaban abiertamente la \"fuga del Norte\" de nuestros habitantes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Posteriormente, no dejo de decir palabras absurdas como \"derrumbe del Norte de Corea\" y \"agrietamiento de su regimen\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Al referirse el dia 16 a la supuesta \"amenaza de provocacion del Norte\", dijo que \"el Norte amenaza el futuro de la nacion y la paz\" y \"hay que cambiarlo\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Todos esos chismes son alarido de la psicopata quien se quedo aturdida por la exitosa prueba nuclear de la RPDC, que estremecio al mundo, y desesperada por el fracaso total de su politica conflictiva con la parte connacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La siniestra intencion de Park reside en mantener a toda costa su fracasada politica de enfrentamiento fratricida y remediar la extremada crisis de dominacion calmando el clima antiyanqui, antibelico y anti-\"gubernamental\" que se eleva cada dia mas en el Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Aunque ella invierta los hechos con chismes, la verdad no se oculta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La chismografia de Park, que esta dando ultimos pataleos para salir del abismo de arruinamiento, terminara con el canto funebre mas tragico."

            "content": "Instituto coreano revela el caracter criminal de las \"resoluciones de sancion\" anti-RPDC\r\n　Pyongyang, 18 de octubre (ACNC) -- EE.UU. y sus satelites estan invirtiendo la verdad hablando como si las \"resoluciones de sancion\" contra la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea hubieran sido aprobadas segun la \"demanda de la sociedad internacional\".\n\t\t\t\t\t  Al respecto, el Instituto de Estudio de los Asuntos Internacionales de la RPDC hizo publica el dia 18 un acta de acusacion para revelar el caracter criminal de esos documentos aprobados coercitivamente por aquellos abusando del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Las \"resoluciones de sancion\", fabricadas por EE.UU. y sus satelites son documentos criminales que desprecian la Carta de la ONU y las normas del derecho internacional y violan la soberania de un Estado soberano, comienza el acta y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El articulo 39 del capitulo 7 de la Carta de la ONU establece que el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU determina la existencia de la amenaza a la paz, la quiebra de esta y el acto agresivo, hace recomendaciones para el mantenimiento y recuperacion de paz y seguridad internacionales y toma las medidas correspondientes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Abusando de ese articulo, EE.UU. describe como \"amenaza a la paz y seguridad internacionales\" las pruebas nucleares, el lanzamiento de satelites artificiales y los ensayos de disparo de cohetes balisticos y esgrime el garrote de sancion aplicando el articulo 41 (medidas no militares).\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Entonces, hay que preguntarle en cual parte de la Carta de la ONU, que consta de 111 articulos de 19 capitulos, o de las normas del derecho internacional se encuentra el articulo que haya definido las pruebas nucleares, el lanzamiento de satelites artificiales y los ensayos de disparo de cohetes balisticos como \"amenaza a la paz y seguridad internacionales\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Si fuera asi, deberian ser blancos de sancion los mismos paises miembros permanentes del Consejo de Seguridad que hasta la fecha, realizaron mas de 2 mil pruebas nucleares en total, lanzaron mas de 7 mil satelites artificiales y ensayan periodicamente el disparo de ICBM de alcances superiores a 10 mil kilometros.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Las \"resoluciones de sancion\" anti-RPDC persiguen unanimemente el cruel objetivo de privarla de los derechos a la existencia, la vida y al desarrollo al bloquear por todos los medios y metodos sus cotidianas actividades economicas despreciando las normas del derecho internacional, estipuladas en la clausula 3 del primer articulo del primer capitulo de la Carta de la ONU, la clausula 2 del primer articulo y la 1 del segundo articulo de la convencion internacional sobre los derechos economicos, sociales y culturales, el articulo 110 de la convencion de la ley maritima de la ONU y el articulo 15 de la convencion sobre el alta mar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La campana de sancion de EE.UU. y sus satelites es un acto ilegal que impone como \"unica pauta mundial\" su logica de bandido despreciando totalmente la imparcialidad y la neutralidad, principios fundamentales de las actividades de la ONU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En enero de 2013, ellos inventaron la \"resolucion 2087\" insistiendo absurdamente en que el lanzamiento de la unidad 2 del satelite de observacion de la Tierra \"Kwangmyongsong-3\" es \"disparo de misil de largo alcance\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Al incluir en la \"resolucion 2270\" el parrafo de \"la RPDC no puede realizar ningun tipo de cooperacion tecnica en el lanzamiento mediante el uso de la tecnica de misil balistico aunque se trate de satelite artificial o objeto lanzado al cosmos\", expusieron abiertamente sus malas entranas negando totalmente el derecho de la RPDC al uso del cosmos con fines pacificos y el mismo tratado espacial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Aparte de esos documentos, llegan a decenas las leyes de sancion que aplica independientemente EE.UU. contra la RPDC violando flagrantemente el derecho internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El reclamo de la camarilla de Obama por la \"sancion y bloqueo sin vacios\" no es mas que el ultimo alarido de los atemorizados ante el formidable poderio de la Corea del Songun que emergio en el Oriente como potencia nuclear y de cohetes estrategicos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Aunque las fuerzas hostiles recrudezcan la campana de sancion anticoreana, no podran conseguir nada mas que el vergonzoso fracaso total."
