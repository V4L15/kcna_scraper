Not content with this operation, they perpetrated such genocide by using even internationally banned weapons. These are the worst human rights abuses in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCiting facts to prove that Israel has been hell-bent on the military aggression against Palestine and mass killings of its civilians by use of lethal weapons supplied by the U.S., while behaving in the same way as the U.S. has abused human rights, perpetrating high-handed and arbitrary acts in utter disregard of international law and human rights, the commentary goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe indiscriminate use of WMDs by the U.S. imperialists and the Israeli aggressors defying the protest of the world public fully disclosed the bestial nature of those who are keen on aggression and war and mass killings.

This is nothing but rhetoric intended to justify its moves to escalate the confrontation with the DPRK which have driven the inter-Korean relations into the crisis of collapse and push them to the brink of a war, the commentary notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the past the north and south authorities had adopted agreements on putting an end to the state of political and military confrontation including the issues of respecting each other's ideologies and systems, stopping slanders and calumnies each other and preventing armed conflicts. But none of them had been implemented due to the dictatorial regimes of south Korea forsaken by the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak regime which emerged under the signboard of \"pragmatism,\" in particular, has turned down and completely scrapped the points of the inter-Korean agreements by reducing them to dead documents through the worst policies of confrontation with the DPRK in history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The traitorous clique has desperately resorted to such anti-DPRK operations as \"human rights\" campaign, spread of leaflets and smear broadcasting, while openly advocating \"unification under the liberal democratic system.\" It went the lengths of kicking up a racket for a war of aggression against the DPRK, talking about even what it called \"emergency situation\" and \"preemptive attack\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll these moves for confrontation with the DPRK led to nullifying all the agreements adopted between the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The CPRK issued a statement in which it declared totally null and void all agreements on removing political and military confrontation between the north and the south and nullified the provisions concerning the maritime military boundary in the West Sea. This was a just and legitimate measure for self-defence taken in view of this reality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the group of traitors is getting evermore frantic with its anti-DPRK confrontational racket, slandering its proper measure. This clearly proves that the group is keen to ignite a war against the DPRK at any cost in league with foreign forces, pursuant to its treacherous policy of confrontation with compatriots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group will be held fully accountable for the disastrous consequences to be entailed by its reckless moves to escalate the confrontation with the DPRK, warns the commentary."

            "content": "All Koreans Called upon to Work for Independent Reunification\r\nPyongyang, February 11 (KCNA) -- The banner of Songun held aloft by the Workers' Party of Korea, which is ushering in a brilliant heyday of Songun Korea sounding the general advance, serves as a great banner of the nation as it instills immense national pride, self-esteem and honor into all Koreans in the north and the south and abroad and vigorously accelerates the advance of an era of independent reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Wednesday observes this in a signed article.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Songun policy of General Secretary Kim Jong Il today serves as a great symbol of independence and dignity, an invincible shield which reliably safeguards the peace on the Korean Peninsula and the security of the nation and a powerful driving force advancing the June 15 era of reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Songun policy reflects the most patriotic will to realize with arms of justice the ardent desire of the nation for independent reunification and national prosperity as it is a great political mode for ushering in a new era of independence and dignity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It serves as a symbol of national sovereignty and dignity today because it represents the iron will to punish without fail anyone who encroaches upon every tree and even a blade of grass in the country and hurts the dignity of the Korean nation no matter from where the intruder comes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe matchless and ever-victorious Songun policy and military deterrent in the DPRK are like a powerful treasured sword and invincible shield as they reliably safeguard and guarantee the peace of the country and national security from foreign aggression. It is thanks to the army of Songun which serves as a powerful treasured sword defending peace that the moves of the foreign aggressor forces to ignite a new war are checked and frustrated on the Korean Peninsula and the peace of the country and national security are guaranteed. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Jong Il possessed of such disposition as love for his country and nation provided the historic June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration based on the principle of national independence under the banner of Songun, putting the movement for national reunification on a new higher stage. It is quite natural for the Koreans from all walks of life at home and abroad to highly praise the Songun policy, which demonstrates its tremendous vitality in practice, as the greatest patriotic policy which saves the nation and carves out a bright future of reunification and prosperity and support and defend it irrespective of ideology, political view and religious faith.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The WPK will as ever powerfully encourage all the Koreans in their efforts to achieve independent reunification and peace and prosperity, reliably guaranteeing the cause of national reunification and decisively shattering the anti-reunification forces' moves with matchless arms, concludes the article."
