            "content": "Kim Jong Un Visits Ryugyong Health Complex, People's Open-Air Ice Rink\r\n Pyongyang, July 26 (KCNA) --  Marshal Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, first chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission (NDC) and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, went round the Ryugyong Health Complex and People's Open-Air Ice Rink nearing the completion. \n\t\t\t\t\t He went to the Ryugyong Health Complex first. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Examining the exterior of the health complex, he said that recently appearing buildings including the complex are diverse and peculiar in shape. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the nice and clean hall he said it seemed that he was briefed on the project in front of the panoramic map a few days ago, but the complex has changed beyond recognition. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Walking along the corridor he said the wall decorated with stone pieces was good just as he said before. The contents of the structure hinge on the building materials used at the final phase of the construction, he added. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He personally opened a dressing box of mass bathroom and dropped in at hot dry, wet and pine tree saunas to learn in detail about the construction. It is important to take thorough-going measure for disinfection of bathrooms including saunas and sanitation is most important, he said. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going around a barber's, massage room, family bathroom and other places, he corrected shortcomings one by one. He underscored the need to give finishing touches with an idea that there is no satisfaction in working for the people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the popular restaurant on the fourth floor he learned about the service program there. He said that people want to drink refreshing drinks after bathing. It will be good to serve soft drinks, noodle and other foods, he said, adding that the Ryugyong Health Complex should be well known to the people for its tasty noodle. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He then went to the People's Open-Air Ice Rink.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round various places of the ice rink including skating hall, skate service room, lounges for players, clinic, broadcasting room and observation room to learn in detail about the construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On the spacious icy ground he was satisfied to see people skating, saying that it is nice to see people skating even in the hottest period of summer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said the architectural style and content are fresh and peculiar and everything of the ice rink ranging from its design to construction is on a high level.  He set forth the tasks for completion of the construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Looking at the space in front the ice rink, he said that the ice rink would be perfect in all aspects as a multi-functional skating ground if a roller-skating ground was added to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said as the Ryugyong Health Complex and People's Open-Air Ice Rink were presents of the Workers' Party to the people it is important to keep the content ahead of the style. He stressed the need not to care for bringing earlier the day of the completion but make the projects impeccable in a more responsible manner. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　He was accompanied by Kim Kyong Hui, member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the C.C., the WPK, Jang Song Thaek, member of the Political Bureau of the C.C., the WPK and vice-chairman of the NDC of the DPRK, and Ryang Chong Song, vice department director of the WPK Central Committee."
