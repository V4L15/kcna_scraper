            "content": "North-South General-level Military Talks Held \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mt. Kumgang, May 26 (KCNA) -- The first round of the north-south general-level military talks took place at Mt. Kumgang resort Wednesday to militarily guarantee the implementation of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration.\r\n Present there were the north side's delegation led by Major-General of the Korean People's Army An Ik San and the south side's delegation with Commodore Pak Jong Hwa from the Ministry of National Defence of south Korea as chief delegate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the talks the heads of the two sides made keynote addresses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The head of the north side said: One round of the ministerial talks of the armed forces of the two sides and more than 20 rounds of military working talks and contacts have taken place for the last four years since the adoption of the joint declaration. As a result, several agreements on military guarantee were adopted and effectuated to set up districts under the north-south control in the east and west coastal areas and push forward the railway and road projects for relinking the north and the south and thereby pulling down the barrier of division that has lasted for more than half a century. The day of opening them to traffic is at hand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are several issues to be negotiated and settled between the two militaries at present, but we should settle, first of all, the issues which may spark a grave military conflict any moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To begin with, propaganda in the frontline areas should be completely stopped as it is the leftover of the Cold War era which breeds seeds of confrontation and distrust and practical measures be taken as early as possible to eliminate all its means. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also necessary to negotiate and settle the issue of preventing the skirmish on the West Sea at an early date. The two sides should not repeat the inglorious past in which the armed skirmish in the waters of the West Sea left painful wounds on the nation and put the favorably developing inter-Korean relations in the danger of going back to those of confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Both sides shared the view that the issues of stopping the above-mentioned propaganda and eliminating its means and preventing skirmishes on the West Sea are urgent issues to be settled to ease the military tensions on the Korean peninsula and agreed to continue the discussion at the next talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Both sides agreed to hold the second round of the inter-Korean general-level military talks at Mt. Solak resort in the area of the south side on June 3.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Through this the U.S. pursues a crafty aim to reuse its old \"security\" theory for stamping out the rapidly mounting movement for independence against the U.S. and giving a shot in the arm of the moribund ultra-right conservative forces. It also seeks to step up the arms build-up under the pretext of filling the \"security gap\" and round off its plan for a war of aggression on the north at an early date. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Peace and stability on the Korean peninsula can never be guaranteed by the U.S. It is the common task of the 70 million Koreans to preserve them through effective national cooperation by themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the U.S. has done for nearly 60 years after occupying this land is nothing but its colonial domination over the people, subjugation, murder and plunder and other crimes. It has only persisted in its moves for a war against the north in a bid to swallow up the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The only way of ensuring the stability of the nation and peace on the Korean peninsula and protecting the existence of the people is to get the U.S. forces in south Korea, the biggest source of war and the root cause of all misfortunes and sufferings, withdrawn from this land to the last man.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In their speeches they called on the 70 million Koreans to wage a vigorous struggle to force the U.S. imperialists out of south Korea and achieve independent reunification by their concerted efforts till the day they will be able to live as one nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They underscored the need to check the government's plan to send troops to Iraq without fail and drive the mean U.S. forces out of south Korea by their own efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A resolution read out at the meeting noted that what the U.S. troops have done in south Korea for nearly 60 years since their occupation of it were nothing but the division of the Korean nation, a war provoked by them against it and an unbroken chain of crimes. The U.S. is chiefly to blame for having chilled the desire of the Koreans in the north and the south for reconciliation, cooperation and reunification and increased the danger of war on the Korean peninsula, noted the resolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It stressed that all the people would wage a vigorous struggle for the withdrawal of the U.S. troops from south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the end of the meeting its participants burned the Stars and Stripes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
