Korea under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 15 (KCNA) -- Bell, commander of the U.S. forces in south Korea, at a hearing of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee some time ago let out a shameless sophism that the military power of north Korea poses a serious and constant threat to the security of south Korea and other U.S. allied countries and Northeast Asia. \r\n Commenting on it, Minju Joson today says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Describing the DPRK military power for defending peace and security of the Korean Peninsula as a \"threat\" is a distortion of reality and an intolerable provocation against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is the real threatening force which coils up the situation of the Korean Peninsula and the area surrounding it and increases the danger of war.\r\n After the Second World War the United States occupied south Korea by force of arms and provoked the war against the north. For scores of years after the war it has consistently kicked up war rackets against the DPRK. Its moves to invade the DPRK are now getting evermore pronounced under the pretext of the \"relocation\" and \"strategic flexibility\" of the U.S. troops in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are instigating the south Korean army to confrontation with the fellow countrymen, while stepping up their preparations for armed invasion of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialist warmongers persistently distort the reality and mislead public opinion to slander the self-reliant military power of the DPRK. It is their constant and ulterior intention to ignite a war against the DPRK at any cost and occupy the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If a nuclear war breaks out in the peninsula, the Korean nation will be the first to suffer disasters. Therefore, the fellow countrymen in the north and the south of Korea should turn out as one to prevent a war of aggression and the U.S. imperialists should repeal its hostile policy towards the DPRK without delay.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The Bush administration has brought the six-party talks for a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue to a stalemate by imposing financial sanctions against the DPRK under false charges of \"counterfeit notes\" and \"illegal dealing\". The untenable sanctions and pressure are delaying the resumption of the six-party talks and the peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue. The U.S., however, does not show any sign of their withdrawal. On the contrary, they are going to escalate military threat and pressure against the DPRK through large-scale joint military exercises. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality gives a clear answer as to who is the one beclouding the prospect of the six-party talks and bedeviling the improvement of the north-south relations  and who is the belligerent force screwing up  confrontation and tension on the Korean Peninsula to a new fever pitch and driving the situation to the brink of war.\r\n The U.S. imperialists' persistent moves to start a reckless war for aggression will force the army and people of the DPRK to step up all the steps to defend sovereignty under the banner of Songun. If the aggressors dare provoke a war, the Korean army and people will deal merciless annihilating retaliatory blows at them and uproot the danger of a war in this land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean bellicose forces betraying the nation while cooperating with the aggressors from outside will never go scot-free, either.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Dangerous Nuclear Policy under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 15 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists are the common enemy of humankind as they are bringing the dark clouds of a nuclear war to hang over the world and blocking social progress and independent development of countries and nations.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. It goes on: \r\n It is the unanimous demand of the peace-loving people of the world and an urgent task to be tackled by the times to completely eliminate nukes and realize nuclear disarmament. Nevertheless, the United States has put spurs to the development and production of new type nukes and bolstered up its modern nuclear forces, defying the worldwide demand for nuclear disarmament and going against the trend of the times towards it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the consistent military policy and the strategic target of the U.S. to beef up its nuclear forces and hold nuclear supremacy. The U.S. is pushing ahead with the production and development of new type nukes in real earnest in a bid to steadily bolster up its nuclear forces, retain its nuclear supremacy and carry out its nuclear war strategy. The U.S. nuclear tests are a link in the chain of its efforts to implement the strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Of late the U.S. carried out a sub-critical nuclear test at the Nevada underground nuclear testing site under the signboard of \"guaranteeing the security of the existing nukes.\" It was the 22nd sub-critical nuclear test since 1997 and the 9th one since the emergence of the Bush administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists pin great hope on nukes, regarding them as an all-powerful means in carrying out its strategy to dominate the world by force. \r\n It is the ulterior intention of the U.S. imperialists to dominate the world and nuclear blackmail and war are their basic military means for realizing it. A preemptive nuclear attack is the core of the U.S. imperialists' nuclear strategy.\r\n The DPRK is the major target of the U.S. imperialists' strategy of preemptive nuclear strike. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists have staged ceaseless nuclear war drills against the DPRK by massing nuclear means in and around south Korea, openly talking about the use of nukes in the \"event of contingency\" on the Korean Peninsula. This has increased the danger of a nuclear war in this part of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are contemplating bringing a nuclear-powered carrier to south Korea in the future. The commander of the U.S. forces in south Korea hinted at this at a recent hearing of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee.\r\n The U.S. imperialists plan to deploy a nuclear-powered carrier in Japan on a permanent basis. They are deploying in Guam more strategic bombers and other means for nuclear strike at the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their evermore undisguised moves to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK compel it to pay utmost attention to this development and maintain full readiness to foil it. \r\n The moves frantically escalated by the U.S. to unleash a nuclear war against the DPRK, pursuant to its theory of preemptive attack, will only give further momentum to the latter's work to bolster up its deterrent for self-defence.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
