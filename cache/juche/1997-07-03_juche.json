            "content": "DPRK Foreign Ministry memorandum on great exploits of President Kim Il Sung for reunification \r\n Pyongyang, July 3 (KCNA) -- The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on July 2 made public a memorandum on the undying exploits performed by President Kim Il Sung for the reunification of the country on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the publication of the historic July 4 North-South Joint Statement declaring the three principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity as a reunification programme of the north and the south of Korea.\r\n   The memorandum read:\r\n   On May 3, 1972, President Kim Il Sung received a delegate of the south side who had come to Pyongyang for the inter-Korean high-level talks, when he put forward the three principles of national reunification which are vital to the solution of the reunification issue.\r\n   The south Korean delegate said that he would adopt the three principles as the biggest pillars for reunification and voiced full support to them.\r\n   The then ruler of south Korea told the delegate of the north side who had gone to Seoul for the second high-level talks that he approved and fully supported the three principles advanced by President Kim Il Sung.\r\n   Therefore, on July 4, 1972, a North-South Joint Statement was made public. Its keynote is the three principles of national reunification -- independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity.\r\n   After advancing the three principles, President Kim Il Sung took practical measures to put them into practice.\r\n   In the middle of the 1970s, the separatists at home and abroad torpedoed north-south dialogue which was arranged with much difficulty and incited inter-Korean confrontation.\r\n   Entering the 1980s, their schemes to perpetuate the division of Korea were further intensified.\r\n   In order to remove obstacles lying in the way of reunification and pave a new road, the president in his report at the 6th Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea held in October 1980 advanced the proposal for reunification through confederation which fully embodies the three principles of national reunification.\r\n   This proposal, based on the principle of one nation, one state, two systems and two governments, is one to build a reunified state in our own way.\r\n   In the 1980s he formulated the proposal for founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo and took positive measures to promote the great unity of the nation.\r\n   On his initiative, a proposal for convening a meeting for the promotion of national reunification with the involvement of representatives of political parties and  organisations in the north and the south and overseas Koreans was put forward in August 1981 and a proposal for holding a 100-men joint meeting involving Korean politicians in the north, the south and overseas was advanced in February 1982.\r\n   Basing himself on valuable experience and achievements gained in the struggle to achieve the unity of the nation, he proclaimed \"10-Point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the Reunification of the Country\" at the fifth session of the 9th Supreme People's Assembly on April 6, 1993, the programme which he personally formulated.\r\n   He raised the issue of ensuring peace on the Korean Peninsula as a prerequisite for national reunification, made many proposals for easing the tensions and took realistic measures for the relaxation of tensions.\r\n   At the third session of the 5th Supreme People's Assembly held on March 25, 1974, he proposed that the DPRK and the United States, signatories to the Korean Armistice Agreement, hold talks to replace the armistice agreement with a peace one.\r\n   In January 1984, he proposed that the DPRK, the United States and south Korea hold tripartite talks at which the DPRK and the U.S. sign a Peace Agreement in place of the Armistice Agreement and the north and the south adopt a non-aggression declaration.\r\n   In the 1990s, the President, determined to eliminate the root cause of war on the Korean Peninsula in a few years and step up the process of peaceful reunification, he set forth a highly important proposal for demolishing the concrete wall in the area south of the military demarcation line, realising free travels between the north and the south and holding north-south high-level talks and summit meeting.\r\n   In mid-June, 1994, in order to open up a decisive phase for national reunification, he made a bold dicision to hold a north-south summit meeting without an equal in the history of national reunification movement and suggested this to the south side.\r\n   On this initiative, an inter-Korean Vice Premier-level preliminary contact for the summit meeting was held on June 28, 1994. A complete agreement on holding the first north-south summit meeting in Pyongyang from July 25 to 27, 1994 was reached there.\r\n   However, he unexpectedly passed away to the sorrow of the people at 02:00 on July 8, 1994. On July 7, he signed his name on an important document related to the issue of national reunification.\r\n   The memorandum stressed that the DPRK Government will as ever invariably uphold and implement the lines and policies formulated by the president in the cause of national reunification. \r\n\r\n"
