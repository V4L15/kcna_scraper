            "content": "U.S. branded as chieftain of aggression and war \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, May 31 (KCNA) -- The DPRK government made public a memorandum on Tuesday disclosing the real aggressive and war aims sought by the United States in its efforts to falsify the truth of history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The memorandum, published on the occasion of the half centenary of the Korean War, brands the U.S. as a provoker of this war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What the U.S. really sought in provoking the Korean War (June 25, 1950-July 27, 1953) was to expand its sphere of military domination to the whole Korean peninsula, considering it as an advance base for carrying out its anti-communist strategy and Asian strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Macarthur, the then commander-in-chief of the U.S. Far East command, said he always regarded Korea as a military advance base of tremendous importance. (February 4, 1957, issue of the U.S. newspaper the New York Times) he also stressed that conquest of Korea as a whole would enable the U.S. to cut off the only and one supply line linking Soviet Siberia to the south and control the whole area between Vladivostok and Singapore. (page 148  of Herschel Meyer \"Modern History of the United States\") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   After visiting South Korea as a special envoy of the U.S. President to inspect the process of converting it into a military base Wedemeyer, a U.S. Lieutenant General, reported that if Korea's reunification and independence were allowed, it would constitute great threat to the overall interests of the U.S. It is advisable for the U.S. to expand its military occupation to the whole Korea, he added. (page 18 of the Japanese book \"U.S. Military Strategy In the Far East\") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Pointing out that the U.S. had a vital stake in igniting the Korean War as it was undergoing a serious economic crisis, the memorandum says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Though the U.S. reaped fabulous profits during the World War II, its economy faced a serious recession in 1949. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese book \"Korean War\" said in its page 128 that the Korean War was a way out of the U.S. economic crisis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   On the accelerated preparations of the U.S. for the war, the memorandum says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In May 1949 the then U.S. ambassador to South Korea, Muccio, told \"Defence Minister\" Sin Song Mo and \"Minister of Home Affairs\" Kim Hyo Sok of South Korea: as there is the United States behind you, everything will go well. We hope that you will trust us and carry out our recommendations and instructions faithfully. A solution to any problem is the strength. This solution can be provided only by the U.S. strength and you should solve this problem as quickly as possible. (page 113 \"Collection of Documents Proving the Korean War Provoked by the U.S. Imperialists\" Pyongyang) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. and Syngman Rhee of South Korea frantically stepped up arms buildup with a goal to gain an \"upper hand of ten to one\" over the north's armed forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   On July 18, 1949, Rhee, in a letter sent to Jang Myon, South Korean \"ambassador\" to the U.S., said that South Korea would train and equip 100,000 standing troops, 200,000 reservists and 100,000 policemen, 400,000 in all, for \"national defence.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Johnson, chief of the E.C.A. office in the \"ROK,\" testified at the U.S. budget committee of the House of Representatives on May 19, 1950 that \"100,000 South Korean soldiers equipped with U.S. weapons and trained by the U.S. military advisers group were already ready to go into action at any time.\"  (page 40 of the Japanese version of the U.S. book \"Who Started the Korean War\") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Macarthur testified that the U.S. amassed all military supplies and weapons in the area along the 38th parallel to attack North Korea on the eve of war. At the senate hearing held from May 3 to 14, 1951 he disclosed that \"ROK\" army kept supplies and equipment in places near the 38th parallel and it did not build position in its rear. (Austrian paper Volksstimme dated July 16, 1990, page 69 of the Japanese version of the U.S. book \"Who Started the Korean War\" and page 96 of the Japanese version of the U.S. book \"The History of the Korean War\") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The \"ROK\" army committed a total of 2,617 cases of armed provocations  in the whole area along the 38th parallel in the year of 1949. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. mapped out the operation plan for \"northward expedition\" and the \"NSC-68\" strategic plan for a special action to be taken at the time of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This plan was worked out and accepted at the joint  meeting of the U.S. State Department and the joint chiefs of staff by the order of Truman in January 1950 and ratified at the U.S. National Security Council on April 2 and handed to the South Korean authorities as it was in early 1950 before the outbreak of the Korean War. (the U.S. paper the New York Times dated April 13, 1964) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Upon getting everything ready to provoke the war against the north, the U.S. and Syngman Rhee lost no time to put the plan into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   On his arrival in South Korea as Truman's special envoy, Dulles inspected the 38th parallel on June 17, 1950 and came back to Seoul on June 18 where he instructed Syngman Rhee to \"start an attack on the north while conducting the counter-propaganda that North Korea invaded the south first.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He appeared at the South Korean \"National Assembly\" on June 19 to state that \"the U.S. was ready to offer all moral and material assistance to South Korea in the fight against communism.\" (page 4 of the Japanese book \"Who Is Aggressor\") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Macarthur said at the meeting of the U.S. senate foreign relations and armed services committee held in May 1951 that the North Korean army was deployed very far from the 38th parallel, adding that was the deployment for defence, not for attack, according to a \"secret report\" of the South Korean \"ambassador\" to the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Flying corps of the U.S. air force already began military action on June 25, 1950  and indiscriminately bombed the areas of the northern half of Korea from June 26 and the U.S. 7th fleet launched military operations in the seas off Korea on the same day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. played cunning tricks to falsify the truth of its war of aggression and justify its undisguised armed intervention by abusing the name of the United Nations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It cooked up a \"resolution\" on branding the DPRK as an \"aggressor\" at the meeting of the UN Security Council on June 25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The then U.S. President, Truman, quoting the \"resolution\" calling for the full-scale involvement of the U.S. forces in the Korean War, said the security council asked all the member nations of the UN to render all forms of assistance for implementation of the \"resolution.\" He admitted that he ordered the U.S. navy and air force to assist and support the \"ROK army\" under such situation. (the U.S. newspaper Minneapolis Times July 23, 1950) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. let the meeting of the UN Security Council adopt on July 7 a \"resolution\" which called for allowing U.S. forces to go under \"UN forces\" helmets and putting troops of its satellite countries under its control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In fact, such \"resolutions\" were fabricated in the absence of the representative from the DPRK in violation of article 32 of the UN charter which calls for inviting a party to a dispute under consideration to participate in the discussion relating to the dispute. Moreover, they were passed in the absence of the Soviet representative in Breachof article 27 of the UN Charter which provides for adoption of any decision on procedural matters, by an affirmative vote of 7 members of the UNSC including the concurring votes of its 5 permanent members. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. thus shifted the responsibility for the outbreak of the war onto the north under the abused UN name from the outset of the war and employed every possible means and method in the war. It mobilized one third of its land force, one fifth of its air force and most of its pacific fleet to the war and even armed forces of 15 satellite states under the name of \"UN forces.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is chiefly to blame for breaking all articles stipulated in the Armistice Agreement which serve as a prerequisite for ensuring peace and security on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Article 60 of the AA stipulates that within three months after the Armistice Agreement is signed and becomes effective, a political conference of a higher level of both sides be held by representatives appointed respectively to settle through negotiation the questions of the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Korea, the peaceful settlement of the Korean question, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   On July 28, 1953, the day after the conclusion of the AA, U.S. secretary of state Dulles openly declared that the U.S. would walk out of the political conference after lapse of 90 days and the U.S. side, in actuality, deliberately threw obstacles in the process of the DPRK government-proposed preparatory talks held in October that year in Panmunjom for the political conference and unilaterally walked out of the meeting, thus bringing the talks to a rupture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Subsequently it breached the articles of the AA that bans the introduction of military hardware and combat materiel. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At a hearing of the U.S. House Appropriations Committee held in February 1960, the then U.S. army chief of staff, Lemnitzer, confessed that through scores of years of sustained efforts the U.S. succeeded in scrapping paragraph 13 D of the AA and came to have new type equipment in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. also completely paralyzed the functions of the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission tasked to discuss and solve violation of the AA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. troops in South Korea are the root cause of the danger of a new war, the memorandum notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States signed the \"mutual defense treaty\" with South Korea on August 8, 1953 and shifted the 8th U.S. army command and the \"UN command\" to South Korea from Japan respectively in July 1955 and July 1957 in a bid to massively beef up offensive forces for a new war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. House of Representatives at a meeting held in May 1975 to examine the budget for national defense disclosed that at least 1,000 U.S. nuclear weapons were already deployed in South Korea.  Member of the U.S. House of Representatives Ronald Dimlongz admitted at the congress that the United States introduced at least 1,000 nuclear weapons and deployed 54 planes capable of carrying nuclear bombs in South Korea, according to the reports of \"Hapdong News\" June 3, 1975 and Jiji on June 20, 1975. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States has ceaselessly perpetrated espionage and provocations against the DPRK since the armistice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In January 1968, the U.S. armed spy ship \"Pueblo\" was captured while conducting espionage after illegally intruding deep into the territorial waters of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. belligerent forces worked out many operation plans to attack the DPRK which have been steadily amended and supplemented.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In a recent year the U.S. worked out even a plan for the second war of aggression on the Korean peninsula called \"operation plan 5027-98\", a more perfect one than the previous one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The ceaseless U.S.-South Korea joint military drills are aimed to round off the operation plans under the simulated conditions of an actual war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. design to provoke a new war of aggression finds a more vivid expression in its moves to knock into shape the \"triangular military alliance\" grouping the United States, Japan and South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK government has made every sincere effort in order to replace the state of armistice by durable peace on the Korean peninsula from its unshakable peaceloving stand,  the memorandum notes, and demands the United States immediately stop its moves to start a new war, drawing a proper lesson from its shameful defeat in the last Korean War, and dismantle the \"UN command\" and withdraw its forces from South Korea at once as required by the resolution of the 30th UN General Assembly. \r\n\r\n"
