            "content": "Kim Jong Il's Immortal Exploits in Songun Revolutionary Leadership \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, August 25 (KCNA) -- Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army Kim Jong Il, who has taken the Songun idea and the Songun revolutionary line of President Kim Il Sung as his political creed, started his Songun revolutionary leadership with his historic inspection of the Guard Seoul Ryu Kyong Su 105 Tank Division on August 25, Juche 49 (1960).\r\n Over the last years he has performed immortal exploits which will shine long in the Juche-based army-building history with his indefatigable Songun revolutionary leadership.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He, with rare political and military ability and commanding art, has inspected over 3,100 KPA units from August 1960 to the end of 2005 to develop the KPA into a-match-for-a-hundred revolutionary armed forces in which the leadership system of the Party has been firmly established. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He advanced the slogan \"Let us defend the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Kim Il Sung even with our lives!\" and implanted it in the minds of the servicepersons as their faith in the early years of his leadership over the army. And, in the 1970s, he put forward the army-building programme on modeling the whole army on the Juche idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He also set forth such powerful slogans as \"Let us fight devotedly for the great leader!\" and \"Let us train, study and live like the anti-Japanese guerrillas!\" and aroused the whole army to carry them into practice and thus built the KPA as the leader's army and the Party's army both nominally and virtually. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On February 6, 1963 when he called at the army post in Mt. Taedok, he clarified the essence and requirements of the slogan \"A match for a hundred\" put forward by the President and indicated the way for implementing the slogan to provide the guideline for strengthening the army as an invincible one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to bring up the soldiers to be a-match-for-a-hundred stalwarts, he inspected several hundred KPA units in the 1960s alone and put his heart and soul into modernizing the military hardware of the army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the meticulous guidance of the brilliant commander of Songun, the KPA has grown into a large contingent of fighters who devotedly defend the leader like Jang Ryong Chol, Kim Kwang Chol, Kil Yong Jo and 17 heroes of Mujae Peak and the revolutionary armed forces of Juche-type which thoroughly carry through the policies of the Party and are ready to willingly lay down their lives for the cause of the Party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK, with the strong army, has firmly defended socialism, frustrating the incessant provocations of the U.S. imperialists including the \"Pueblo\" incident (1968), large-sized spy plane \"EC-121\" incident (1969), \"Panmunjom Incident\" (1976) and \"Panmunjom Gunfight Incident\" (1984). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the great Songun revolutionary leadership of Kim Jong Il, the KPA will display its invincible might fuller.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Thus, it made a great contribution to saving the movement from the crisis of division and advancing it in conformity with its noble mission and objective. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over the past years the DPRK has devotedly worked to defend the idea and principles of the NAM from the imperialists' obstructive moves, preserve its purity and ensure the unity and cohesion of it and its strengthening and development. In every period and at every stage of revolution, it clarified all the problems arising in checking the international reactionaries' attempts to divide the NAM, strengthening its position and might and raising its function and role. It thus worked hard to propel the victorious advance of this movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The NAM has made big progress, but its noble idea and objective have not yet been realized, the article points out, and goes on: The sovereignty of the non-aligned countries is being violated or threatened by the imperialist forces. Only when support and solidarity are boosted among them and collective and joint actions are taken by them under this situation, is it possible to protect the sovereignty and interests of the NAM member nations and enhance the NAM's position and role in international relations.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
