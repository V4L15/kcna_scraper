The snowballing burden caused the successor to take greater pain as it is directly related to the rise or fall of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Clapper made a serious advice in the transition period of the U.S. administration. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was a daydream of the U.S. in the past to force the DPRK to dismantle its nukes and the latter's access to nuclear weapons and its steady bolstering of nuclear force are stark realities today.
