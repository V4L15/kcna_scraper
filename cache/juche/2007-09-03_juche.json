            "content": "Kim Jong Il Provides Field Guidance to Different Units\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 2 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il provided field guidance to different units in Songgan and Jonchon counties of Jagang Province. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The first leg of his guidance was the February General Steel Enterprise. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He visited the revolutionary museum of the enterprise before going round several production processes to acquaint himself in detail with its technological equipment and production there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He highly appreciated the feats performed by the workers and technicians of the enterprise in dynamically pushing ahead with the modernization of the steel enterprise, expressing great satisfaction over the fact that they are mass-producing quality steel, while cutting down the electricity consumption norm by actively introducing advanced technology and inventing and manufacturing various types of equipment by themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He set forth the tasks to be fulfilled by the enterprise. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He underscored the need for the enterprise to make an effective use of the existing foundation for production and continue energetically pushing forward the technological updating in order to boost the production of iron and steel. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the consistent policy of the WPK to firmly establish Juche in the metallurgical industry, he said, calling for thoroughly establishing the steel production system based on Juche steel. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then he went round the supply service facilities of the enterprise built in peculiar style. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The next leg of his guidance was the Jonchon Rock-Drill Factory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He looked round the monument to the on-the-spot guidance given by President Kim Il Sung and the room devoted to the history of the factory before dropping in at the processing workshop to familiarize himself with the production there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He highly appreciated the feats performed by the workers of the factory, noting that they have produced many quality rock-drills and supplied them to different fields of the national economy in the past, thus making a great contribution to the nation's economic development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After making the rounds of the combined stock farm and other supply service bases, he said that they have been built well to bring benefits to the workers and appreciated the way they are managing their economic life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He put forward the tasks to be carried out by the factory, saying that lots of rock-drills are required to further develop the mining industry and build roads and hydropower stations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The last leg of his visit was the Jonchon County Commercial Management Office. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He looked round the monument to the on-the-spot guidance given by the President to the office and the room for the education in the revolutionary history, guided by Jong Chun Sil, director of the office. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He recollected with deep emotion the profound loving care and benevolence shown by the President for Jong Chun Sil and the office. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that Jong Chun Sil has grown to be a recipient of \"Kim Il Sung Order\" and twice labor hero well-known to the whole country and loved by the people amid the particular trust and loving care of the President, he told her to always bear deep in mind the President's noble wish to see her remaining a faithful servant for the people all her life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He visited the Jonchon manufactured goods shop to learn about how it is using the \"Memo-book of our family\" introduced by Jong decades ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not easy to meet the requirements of inhabitants for goods without fail at present when they are in short supply, he said, adding that this suffices to guess what noble and pure sense of moral obligation she has towards the leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The posture and attitude of a soldier and disciple of the President should always remain unchanged as is the case with Jong, he said, stressing the need for the party members and other working people to learn from her intense loyalty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He had a souvenir picture taken with Jong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He expressed the expectation and conviction that the party members and other working people of Jagang Province would play the role of vanguard and shock brigade in all fields of socialist economic construction with the same vim and vigor with which they took the lead in weathering out the difficulties before the revolution in the revolutionary spirit of fortitude. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by Pak To Chun, chief secretary of the Jagang Provincial Committee of the WPK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Kim Jong Il Provides Field Guidance to Industrial Establishments\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 1 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il provided field guidance to industrial establishments in Manpho City. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The first leg of his guidance was the Manpho Smeltery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He familiarized himself with the technological updating of the smeltery and production there, going round several production processes including the general production command room. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He learned about the technical principle and capacities of the updated production equipment. He highly appreciated the feats performed by the workers in the smeltery and members of the scientists and technicians' shock brigade of Kim Chaek University of Technology, expressing great satisfaction over the fact that they have completed modern and efficient smelting processes in a short span of time by introducing ultra-modern science and technology true to the Workers' Party of Korea's idea of attaching importance to science to boost the production of quality non-ferrous metals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said that the experience of the smeltery eloquently proves that technological progress is the master key to increasing production, adding: The major task facing the smeltery is to actively introduce advanced technology, while keeping production going on at a high rate, and thus steadily raise the actual extraction rate and retrieve all valuable metals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to mine and process a large amount of ores and supply more quality concentrated ores to the smeltery in time in order to operate it in full capacity, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The next leg of his guidance was the Amnokgang Tyre Plant. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He learned in detail about technical equipment of the plant and production there, making the rounds of moulding workshops, finishing workshop and other production processes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Watching for a long while with delight various kinds of quality tyres streaming out of every worksite equipped with modern equipment, he was greatly pleased to learn that the workers of the plant have kept the production going at a high rate after radically changing its appearance by fully displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n How gratifying it is to see the plant sharply boosting its production and its workers working with ease in a good production environment as a result of the successful modernization of the plant, he noted. He praised the officials, workers and technicians of the plant for having devoted themselves to the work to bring about such signal change and highly appreciated their successes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was very pleased to hear that the discharged soldiers who volunteered to work at the plant in hearty response to the Party's call have played a key role in the production and construction after becoming junior cadres and skilled workers and the fighting spirit of all the employees has remarkably gone up.  It is the precious success which cannot be bartered for anything that the position of the working class has grown stronger in the course of pulling through rigorous ordeals, he added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then he looked round the room for the education in the revolutionary history, the room for the study of the reminiscences of President Kim Il Sung, a canteen, a store for what they produced through sideline farming and other facilities for ideological and cultural education and supply service to learn in detail about the political work and supply service for the workers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He highly praised the shining successes made by the workers of the plant. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He set forth tasks to be fulfilled by the plant. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Underscoring the need to continue to pay deep attention to the matter of putting the production on a normal track, he called for increasing the production of tyres to suit the actual conditions of the country. He stressed the need to establish a synthetic rubber production system for the purpose of finding a satisfactory solution to the problem of rubber, the main raw material for the production, in the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the plant has a solid material and technological foundation for steadily boosting the production and very high zeal of its workers, he underlined the need for the officials to more scrupulously organize the economic work on the principle of profitability in keeping with this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  He showed profound love and solicitude for the workers of the plant, calling for providing better living conditions to the workers and always taking deep care of them as they have devoted their all to the Party and the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Expressing satisfaction over the fact that the workers in Manpho City are working and living in a revolutionary manner after sprucing up not only factories but urban and rural areas to meet the need of socialism, he praised the Korean working class as a large revolutionary contingent intensely loyal to the Party and the leader and strong in organization and discipline. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by Pak To Chun, chief secretary of the Jagang Provincial Committee of the WPK.     \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
