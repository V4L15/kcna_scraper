            "content": "Kim Jong Il Gives Field Guidance to Work in Different Fields in Hwaphyong County \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 2 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il gave field guidance to the work in various fields in Hwaphyong County. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He looked round President Kim Il Sung's statue standing in Hwaphyong Township.\r\n After seeing the statue with deep emotion, he said that the President covered the road of the revolution recorded with stern trials from his boyhood in order to regain the country usurped by the Japanese imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said that the 250-mile Journey for Learning and the 250-mile Journey for National Liberation are very instructive courses which help the Party members and other working people and school youth and children know through life experience what arduous path of revolution the President traveled to liberate the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then he moved on to the nature preservation area in Mt. Oga. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was briefed on the area before a huge painting showing a panoramic view of the area. Feasting his eyes on the forest stretching around the pass on Mt. Oga and more than a thousand years old trees listed as rare living monuments, he acquainted himself with the preservation and management of the nature preservation area in detail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He expressed great satisfaction over the fact that the nature preservation area in Mt. Oga with a long history is not only kept in its original state but has become richer in its contents in the era of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  He stressed the need to preserve and manage the area with good care and hand it to posterity as it is a national treasure of which the nation should be proud and indicated the tasks to be fulfilled and ways to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then he put forward important tasks which would serve as guidelines in making the mountains and rivers of the country more beautiful. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He provided field guidance to the Hwaphyong Army-People Power Station built by the county by its own efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After being briefed on the power station, he went round its exterior and interior to acquaint himself with its construction and electricity production. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He praised the county for having completed the construction of the modern power station with big capacity in a brief span of time by its own efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then he learned about the construction of minor power stations in the county. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hwaphyong County has made remarkable progress in all work including the power station construction, agricultural production and rural construction, he said, highly appreciating the successes all the Party members and other working people in the county have registered by making uninterrupted innovations and advances as befitting the creators of the spirit of Kanggye. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that the county is a regional centre and unit in socialist construction, he underscored the need to increase the role of the county. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said that the experience gained by Hwaphyong County eloquently proves that if the role of the county is increased and local resources and potentials are properly tapped and utilized, the county can settle by itself the issues arising in the livelihood of the people and steadily improve the standard of people's living in the county without causing a heavy burden to the state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He expressed great expectation and belief that the people in Hwaphyong County would continue to successfully play the vanguard role in the gigantic struggle to build a great prosperous powerful nation in the future, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by Pak To Chun, chief secretary of the Jagang Provincial Committee of the WPK, Kim Ki Nam, secretary of the C.C.,WPK, and Pak Nam Gi, department director of the same.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

In consequence of such criminal acts of the group of traitors the distrust and confrontation are growing acute between the north and the south and the danger of a war increasing, far from expecting national reconciliation and unity and peace and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lee group is running amuck to reverse the trend of history, staking their fates only on the sycophancy towards the U.S. and dependence on foreign forces in disregard of the reunification of the country and the destiny of the nation. Its wrong behaviors give a greatly negative effect to the Korean nation's struggle for carving out its independent destiny. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now the Korean nation are striving to usher in the new era of the independent reunification, peace and prosperity by implementing the historic June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration, its action program. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that the reunification and peace of the country and the co-prosperity of the nation can not be achieved without removing the Lee group who denies the said declarations and oppose their implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans will dynamically usher in the new era of independent reunification, peace and prosperity, smashing the desperate moves of the south Korean pro-U.S. conservatives with ardent patriotism and by their united efforts.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They are now developing into the movements demanding the resignation of the \"government\" under the slogans \"Let's impeach Lee Myung Bak!\" and \"Lee Myung Bak, step down!\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All members of the puppet Cabinet have already tendered their resignation, the \"National Assembly\" has not been in session for more than two months and \"support rate\" for Lee has sunk as low as less than 10 percent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the trite method of the successive fascist cliques of south Korea to stage a crafty and deceptive charade whenever they faced the massive resistance of the people. The \"special press conference\" called by Lee and his hue and cry over \"change in the pure nature of candlelight demonstration\" are nothing but a crafty ploy to tide over the serious crisis and get rid of the abyss of ruin at any cost through the tactics to appease and hoodwink people and fascist suppression of them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The prevailing situation reminds one of the June People's Resistance more than two decades ago when the military fascist dictators tided over the crisis by issuing the hypocritical \"June 29 declaration\" and usurped the fruits reaped by the south Koreans through their struggle for democracy. It is no more than a daydream for Lee Myung Bak to try to deceive the people and mislead the public opinion at home and abroad, concludes the commentary. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
