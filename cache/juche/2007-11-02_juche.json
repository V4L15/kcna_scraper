The imperialist reactionaries took the opportunity to loudly talk about \"end of socialism\" and further intensified the moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With an immutable will to take the road of socialism pioneered by President Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il authored the famous work \"Socialism Is a Science\" on November 1, 1994. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He, in the work, clearly expounds that socialism is an inevitable stage of the historical development, is the most advanced society conforming to the independent nature of the human being and is based on the most correct Juche-oriented view and standpoint on man and herein lie the scientific accuracy and truth of the Korean socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The work, therefore, carries the philosophical principle that socialism is imperishable as a science. Its validity and invincible vitality have been proved clearly in Korea where the people are dynamically progressing the construction of a great, prosperous and powerful socialist nation with the faith in the certain victory of the socialist cause. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As they were firmly believed in the rosy morrow of socialism, the Korean people bridged over the grave difficulties in the unprecedented \"Arduous March\" and forced march with the indomitable will to live not merely for today but for tomorrow and with the optimism to push ahead through the thorny path in high spirits under the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In those days the great revolutionary soldier spirit representing the Songun era was created and the Kanggye spirit came into being and the torch of Songgang flared up in the process of generalizing the former. The country experienced the building of many monumental edifices. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nothing can break the Korean people's will and faith in sure victory of the socialist cause which has been consolidated as firm as rock in the trials of history.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
