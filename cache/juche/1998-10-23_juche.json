Kumgang\r\n Pyongyang, October 23 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the DPRK Ministry of Public Security today mentioned the tourism of Mt. Kumgang for South Koreans.\r\n   He said:\r\n   Preparations for tourism of the scenic Mt. Kumgang are being promoted in the final stage amid great expectation and interest of people at home and abroad. Some time later, South Koreans' tourism of Mt. Kumgang will begin.\r\n   The organisation of tourism is a product of the noble patriotism of the DPRK, which takes into account the desire of South Koreans to see the most beautiful mountain, and an expression of its unshakable position to reunify the country at an early date through great unity of the nation.\r\n   The Ministry of Public Security of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will, as ever, guarantee the personal safety and safe return of all tourists and personnel concerned who come to Mt. Kumgang with feelings of national reconciliation, unity, patriotism and compatriotic sentiment, and will take necessary measures in case there happens an accident or disaster.    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n"

            "content": "Kim Jong Il visits Manpho\r\nPyongyang, October 23 (KCNA) - General Secretary Kim Jong Il gave personal guidance to various units in Manpho on Thursday.\r\n   Kim Jong Il first visited the Kosanjin Revolutionary Site.\r\n   Kosanjin is where  President Kim Il Sung stayed from November 8 to December 18, 1950 during the most rigorous period of the Fatherland Liberation War, when he laid down policies of counteroffensive operations, wisely commanded the operations, smashed the \"All-Out Christmas Offensive\" of the U.S. and brought about a fundamental change in the war situation.\r\n   Kim Jong Il went round a monument to Kim Il Sung's revolutionary activities, the Kosanjin Revolutionary Museum and historic houses, recalling the unforgettable days of war. \r\n   He described Kim Il Sung as an ever-victorious iron-willed brilliant commander, outstanding military strategist, peerless patriot and great man who defeated formidable imperialist enemies in two revolutionary wars and saved the destiny of the motherland and the people. The immortal revolutionary exploits of Kim Il Sung, who devoted his whole life to the good of the people, pulling through all sorts of trials, will be kept in the hearts of the Korean people forever, he added.\r\n   Under Kim Il Sung's wise leadership, the Korean people, once oppressed and maltreated, could lead a worthy life and Korea, once deprived of its sovereignty, could become a powerful socialist state admired by all people, he said, and called for exalting the Juche socialist motherland associated with the whole life of Kim Il Sung.\r\n   Kim Jong Il urged Jagang Province to preserve valuable historical sites associated with Kim Il Sung's activities including the Kosanjin Revolutionary Site and to use them for education of the party members, other working people, servicemen, young people and children so that they may learn Kim Il Sung's revolutionary ideas more deeply.\r\n   He had a picture taken with the employees of the Kosanjin Revolutionary Museum, praising them for having done a lot of things for preservation of the historical site and education.\r\n   He then went to the Amnokgang tire plant.\r\n   He looked round various production processes to learn about production and management of the plant. He met and warmly encouraged workers and technicians on the spot.\r\n   He expressed great satisfaction and highly praised the workers of the plant for having successfully built a solid tire industrial base on the Amnok River through constant increase of the production capacity and made innovation in production through proper management of the machines and other equipment, aware of being the masters of the country and the plant.\r\n   He gave tasks to the plant, saying that the plant has a very important duty to perform because tires are in increasing demand due to rapid development of different kinds of rolling stock.\r\n   If the existing production capacity is utilized effectively, larger quantities of tires can be produced, he said.\r\n   He set the plant objectives and ways, saying that there is nothing impossible to do as long as there are workers determined to uphold the party with increased production.\r\n   The workers who devotedly work for the party and the revolution should be provided with better living conditions and should be looked after warmly at all times, he said, and did them great favors.\r\n   He then went to the Unhwa Factory.\r\n   After hearing an explanation in front of the panorama of the factory, he went round production processes to learn about production. He noted with great satisfaction that the workers of the factory were not only keeping the worksites neat and clean but also vigorously working to overfulfil their assignments of production.\r\n   He urged them to plant many trees around the factory, keep the inside and outside of the factory neat and tidy at all times and hand the factory, a valuable asset of the people, down to posterity.\r\n   He was deeply satisfied that the workers in Manpho were keeping factories, towns and villages as clean as befits socialism and working and living in a revolutionary way. He said there is no such revolutionary unit as the working class of Korea who have intense loyalty to the party and the leader and a strong sense of organisation and discipline.\r\n   All parts of Jagang Province are pervaded with revolutionary and militant spirit, he said, adding that the Korean revolution is sure to win final victory because of the powerful wholehearted unity of the workers and other people of Korea who firmly defend socialism with redoubled efforts and in high spirits -- in the revolutionary spirit of soldiers and the Kanggye spirit -- true to the principles of socialism, the principles of revolution, in any storm and stress.    \r\n \r\n"

Accordingly, we cannot but prepare ourselves for this.\r\n   If their attempt to break the framework agreement represents the U.S. stand, we will not prevent them from doing so but make our own choice as we like.\r\n   We are not frightened or terrified by their total reexamination of the \"North Korea Policy.\" \r\n   As their reexamination means a reckless tough policy of frustrating dialogue and improvement of  relations between the DPRK and the United States, we are compelled to take a similar stand.\r\n   The U.S. conservative hardliners will be held wholly responsible for ill-omened consequences of their moves.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n"
