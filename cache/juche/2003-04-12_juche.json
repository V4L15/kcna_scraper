But the nation had been harassed by backwardness and poverty caused by the corrupt and incompetent feudal rulers' flunkeyism and treachery and then put under the rule of the Japanese imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was since the country was liberated by Kim Il Sung that the Korean people have been able to enjoy a new life.\r\n He, who was born into a family patriotic and revolutionary through generations, began activities for the liberation of the country in his early years, keenly feeling the sorrow and sufferings of the ruined nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With twenty years of the hard-fought struggle against the Japanese imperialists, he accomplished the historical cause of national liberation in 1945. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the liberation of the country he led the three-year war against the U.S. imperialist aggressors to victory, defending the sovereignty of the country and the dignity of the nation. In a short period after the war, he built a powerful socialist state independent, self-reliant and self-supporting in national defence, and dramatically enhanced the prestige of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the international arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to his great devotion and tireless efforts for the country and the nation, Korea, which had suffered an eclipse on the world map, exercises its independent rights in the international arena and the people enjoy a worthwhile life and happiness in the socialist society of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is why the Korean people venerate Kim Il Sung as the founder of socialist Korea, eternal president of the DPRK and father of the nation.    \r\n\r\n"
