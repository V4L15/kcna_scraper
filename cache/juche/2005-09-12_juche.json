            "content": "Traitors' Shameless Intention Brought to Light \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 11 (KCNA) -- Documents related to the south Korea-Japan \"talks\" in the period from 1951 to 1965 was opened to the public in south Korea, touching off great resentment of the Korean nation. These documents recording the whole process of the \"talks\" have brought to light the fact that the south Korean rulers sold off the dignity and interests of the nation to Japan for a few pennies of money.\r\n The traitorous group of south Korea did not mention the issue of liquidating the past crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists including the assessment of their past history, illegality of the Korea-Japan \"annexation treaty\" and the issue of individual claims of the victims during their occupation of Korea. And they failed even to set the nominal amount claimed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun Sunday carries a signed commentary. It goes on:\r\n At the political bargaining with Japan the south Korean dictatorial regime sold off the dignity and interests of the nation for a penny of money and covered up the past crimes of Japan. This is an unpardonable crime against the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the documents, Japan raised a brigandish demand just like a thief crying \"stop thief\". The Japanese reactionaries threatened to appeal to the International Court of Justice, asserting that Tok Islet belongs to Japan. Finally at the talks, they insisted on blowing up the controversial islet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is now working hard to gloss over the crimes related to sexual slavery committed by the imperial Japanese army while talking about the final solution to the issue of postwar reparation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States manipulated behind the scene the whole course of the \"talks\" and the fabrication of \"agreements\" with a view to forming the triangular military alliance by establishing \"normal relations\" between south Korea and Japan and using the alliance to materialize its Korea and Asia strategy for aggression.\r\n Japan and the U.S. are the sworn enemy of the Koreans as they have done harm to the interests of the Korean nation through despicable and base swindles and conspiracy.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean Troops' Preparations in Iraq for War against North Denounced \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 11 (KCNA) -- The south Korean troops have stepped up their preparations for a war of aggression against the north while participating in the Iraqi war under the signboard of \"peace and reconstruction\".\r\n In this regard Minju Joson Sunday in a signed commentary says that any attempt to invade the north is intolerable in any case. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean troops have conducted more than 2,900 military drills independently or together with the U.S. troops in Iraq for a year last.\r\n South Korea's military operations in Iraq are being done according to the U.S. strategy for a war of aggression against the DPRK, in which the U.S. troops take charge of maritime and air battles and the south Korean troops ground battles.\r\n The south Korean authorities are working hard to increase the capability for a war of aggression against the north while extending the period of troop presence in Iraq, quite contrary to the will of the Korean nation. All these facts show that the south Korean authorities' troop dispatch to Iraq was not forced by the U.S. but an initiative one for confrontation with the fellow countrymen in the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities would be advised to immediately stop making reckless preparations to do harm to the fellow countrymen behind the scene while paying lip-service to reconciliation and cooperation. They should withdraw their troops from Iraq at once.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "End to U.S. Policy of Occupation of S. Korea Demanded\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 10 (KCNA) -- The policy of occupation of south Korea pursued by the United States for the last 60 years is a product of its strategy to dominate the Korean nation, says Rodong Sinmun Saturday in a signed article.\r\n The U.S. imperialist aggression troops landed in Inchon Port under the pretext of \"disarming\" the defeated Japanese imperialists 60 years back when the Koreans were aspiring after the building of an independent and sovereign state, rejoiced at the fact that the heroic anti-Japanese war waged by them culminated in putting an end to the 40 odd year-long Japanese imperialists' colonial rule over Korea. \r\n The U.S. forces' talk about \"disarming the Japanese troops\" was no more than an excuse, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nJapan declared an unconditional surrender on August 15, 1945. In actuality, the U.S. forces did not disarm the Japanese imperialists but kept the Japanese colonial repressive machines including police organs and rallied pro-Japanese traitors in a desperate bid to establish their ruling system in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bolstered its armed forces in south Korea and made attempts to invade the north from the very day of its forces' landing in a bid to dominate the whole of Korea.\r\n It ignited the Korean war in the 1950s to realize this plan. The U.S. ambition for invading the north remained unchanged even after imposing unspeakable disasters upon the Korean nation and sustaining a bitter defeat in the war.\r\n The desire for reunification is growing stronger on the Korean Peninsula. But the U.S. is getting frantic in its moves to invade the north while ceaselessly beefing up the combat power of the U.S. forces present in south Korea so as to realize those moves.\r\n The reality proves that the Korean people cannot save its destiny unless they put an end to the U.S. policy of occupation of south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Koreans can live in peace and achieve reunification and prosperity only when the U.S. forces are driven out of south Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "GNP's Anti-Reunification Racket under Fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 10 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland in a statement Saturday bitterly denounced in the name of the whole nation the Grand National Party of south Korea for whipping up distrust and confrontation between the north and the south and laying a big obstacle to the efforts to implement the June 15 joint declaration and develop the north-south relations, going against the aspiration of the fellow countrymen for reconciliation, unity and reunification.\r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP was so dishonest and unreasonable as to find fault with the sincerity and favor the north showed for the delegation of the south Korean authorities by broad-mindedly and lucidly clarifying a series of issues arising in the inter-Korean relations during its visit to Pyongyang on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the June 15 joint declaration. As to the north delegation's visit to the \"Memorial\" while staying in Seoul during the August 15 grand national festival, the GNP hurled vituperation at the north, claiming that it was a \"psychological warfare peculiar to the north\" and little short of digging a \"pitfall\" and south Koreans should not be taken in by it. Worse still, it egged ultra-right conservatives on to seriously vilify the north, asserting that the festival was manipulated by someone behind the scene.\r\n Meanwhile, the GNP is weaving a plot to build up a new pro-U.S. and anti-north conservative group made up of such living dead as Ri Hoe Chang already forsaken by history and the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such moves of the GNP are stirring up the resentment of the whole nation as they were prompted by an attempt to dampen the tendency towards alliance with the north and reunification rapidly growing strong in south Korea, block the process of warming up the inter-Korean relations, stem the trend of the situation at any cost and take a position favorable for it in the local election next year and the 2007 \"presidential election\", the spokesman said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP should be thrown overboard as it is an anti-reunification traitorous party only adding to its crimes, obsessed by its inveterate consciousness of confrontation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
