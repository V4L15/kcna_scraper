This has proved that the Korean nation is a homogeneous nation which built a powerful state in the East with Tangun as its ancestor more than 5,000 years ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The forefathers of the Koreans have unswervingly carried forward the national lineage down through a long historical period, repelling the ceaseless invasion of foreigners. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They made and used iron tools and bronze products fairly high in quality and technology in those days far earlier than the European countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Koguryo tomb murals and Korean paintings remain unfaded, though many years have passed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Constellations engraved in dolmens of ancient Korea, the constellation in a Koguryo tomb mural, Chomsongdae Astronomical Observatory built in the first half of the 7th century and others show well the high level of the development of astronomy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The creation of Hunminjongum (the Korean alphabet) in the 15th century laid the foundation for the development of the country's science and culture. The Korean ancestors also made the world's first metallic type, rain gauge and turtle-shaped iron-clad warship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Koryo celadon, silk cloth and paper are widely known to the world.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans' movement for national reunification is a nationwide patriotic movement gaining in scope and strength thanks to their ardent patriotism, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are now fully displaying patriotism with the will to settle the reunification issue by their concerted efforts with the Korean nation as a driving force for the reunification movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their reunification movement is a sacred one to rejoin the severed blood ties of the nation and achieve national unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In south Korea the people's sovereignty and dignity are being violated by outside forces.

It is, therefore, a very vital issue related to the reunification of the country and the destiny of the nation to defend peace on the Korean Peninsula. The defence of peace guarantees the destiny of the nation, the reunification of the country and national prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality goes to clearly prove that both independent reunification and peace are achievable only when all the fellow countrymen pool their efforts and struggle in the idea of \"By our nation itself\" from a patriotic stand and viewpoint.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is the fundamental demand for the triumphant advance of socialism to take the ideological education as a lifeline. Rodong Sinmun Thursday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An ideological work precisely means the vitality of socialism and its destiny depends on how to strengthen the ideological work. This is a lesson and truth taught by the world socialist movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The introduction of a capitalist method whereby people are motivated by use of money while the ideological work is neglected in the socialist society would entail such grave consequences as destabilizing and degenerating socialism and bringing it to a collapse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It is a more essential requirement to strengthen the ideological work in the socialist society now that the imperialists are becoming all the more undisguised in their ideological and cultural offensive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists are spreading the bourgeois ideology and culture while intensifying all sorts of smear propaganda about socialism. They are pursuing a sinister aim to weaken the people's faith in socialism and instigate them to reject it in a bid to bar them from heading for socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists' ideological and cultural poisoning inevitably provides the counter-revolutionaries with an opportunity to raise their heads. The imperialist ideology and culture are nothing but ideological poison as they are aimed at destabilizing and degenerating socialist countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is taking place on the international arena goes to prove that socialism cannot be defended unless the imperialist ideological and cultural poisoning is not checked. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The practical experience gained by the Korean revolution while firmly defending socialism from the persistent anti-socialist offensive of the imperialists clearly proves that the ideological work provides a fundamental guarantee for the triumphant advance of socialism. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
