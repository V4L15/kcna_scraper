And the north-south relations run through with antagonism and confrontation are being converted into a reconciliation and cooperation under the idea of \"by our nation itself\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The years have witnessed brisk governmental and non-governmental exchanges between the north and the south. Among them are inter-Korean ministerial talks, grand festivals for national reunification to mark the publication of the June 15 north and south joint declaration, national rallies to observe the August 15 liberation, inter-Korean conference of workers, inter-Korean conference of peasants and reunion of separated families and relatives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year, too, the solidarity and unity have been strengthened through the reunification campaign of the nation including the joint meeting of youths in the north and the south and the north-south conference of women. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are still many difficulties in the reunification campaign including obstructions of the United States. But, the Korean people will certainly accomplish the cause of the independent reunification, upholding the five-point policy for the great unity of the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
