Then why does Japan behave so imprudently, poking its nose into the issue that has nothing to do with it? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In a word, it is prompted by its dark design to prevent the solution of the Korean issue at all costs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan's piffle that the DPRK's launch of missile has not been frozen is intended to use that as a pretext to realize its ambition to become a military power at any price. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the old bad habit of the Japanese politicians to speak ill of others and do harm to them and poke their nose into other's affairs to behave silly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   That is why Japan is experiencing a hot agony of shame and  standing isolated by the world public. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese authorities are well advised to drop their bad habit of meddling in other's affairs and slandering him before suffering bitterer shame.  \r\n\r\n"
