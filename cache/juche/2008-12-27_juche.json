This reminds one of a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\"\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson today observes this in a signed commentary.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t How to approach the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration is a touchstone to discern whether one wants dialogue or not because they were accepted by all Koreans as a milestone of national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Traitor Lee has been hell-bent on the confrontation with fellow countrymen since he adopted the treacherous and anti-reunification watchword \"no nukes, opening and 3,000 dollars\" as his \"policy toward the north,\" totally negating the north-south joint declarations. Lee torpedoed the inter-Korean dialogue by abandoning of his own accord the status as a dialogue partner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is nothing but a brazen-faced wordplay for the Lee group to call for dialogue as it is the arch criminal who scuttled the inter-Korean dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What the group wants is neither the inter-Korean dialogue nor the improvement of the relations. Its ulterior motive is getting on the nerves of the army and people of the DPRK by passing the buck for the suspended dialogue to the north in a bid to further strain the inter-Korean relations and intensify the suppression of the progressive pro-reunification forces under this pretext and tide over the deepening ruling crisis. Precisely for this reason it is trumpeting about \"dialogue\" in an attempt to create an impression that it is interested in the inter-Korean dialogue and misleading the public opinion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBut, such poor trick will never work in this bright world.

If the group persists in the confrontation with fellow countrymen, making an empty talk about \"dialogue\" without taking such practical measures, it will have to pay a very high price for the above-said crimes."

EE.UU. habla de la \"paz\" y la \"estabilidad\" de la Peninsula Coreana, pero, eso no pasa de ser una cortina para encubrir su intento agresivo contra la RPDC.

            "content": "Minju Joson critica intencion de Lee Myung Bak en torno al dialogo N-S\r\nPyongyang, 26 de diciembre (ATCC) -- En un comentario individual difundido este viernes, el periodico Minju Joson revela que lo esencial de la enganosa demanda sobre el \"dialogo\", que formula ultimamente la banda de Lee Myung Bak del Sur de Corea, es que la RPDC es la culpable del cese del dialogo Norte-Sur y de la peor situacion actual de las relaciones intercoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\tPara este caso viene como anillo al dedo el refran coreano: \"El ladron se queja primero del robo\", ironiza el comentarista y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa posicion y la actitud sobre la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio y la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre, aceptadas por todos los coreanos como jalon de reunificacion de la patria, constituyen la pauta que distingue a los partidarios del dialogo de los oponentes a esto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNegandolas totalmente, el traidor Lee persiguio locamente la confrontacion fratricida tomando la teoria de \"desnuclearizacion, apertura y 3000 dolares\", de caracter antinacional y anti-reunificacion, como su \"politica sobre el Norte\". De esta manera, Lee desclasifico a si mismo para el dialogo con el Norte, que fue abortado por su culpa. Sin embargo, ahora este responsable del fracaso de las conversaciones intercoreanas esta demandandolas descaradamente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo que desea la horda de Lee no es el dialogo ni la mejora de las relaciones entre ambas partes coreanas. Su verdadera intencion es buscar el empeoramiento de las relaciones intercoreanas provocando al ejercito y al pueblo de la RPDC al imputarle la responsabilidad por el cese del dialogo y tomarlo como pretexto para intensificar la represion a las fuerzas progresistas por la reunificacion y salir de esta manera de la cada dia peor crisis de gobernacion. He aqui la razon por la cual esos compinches distraen la opinion publica hablando del \"dialogo\" como si estuvieran interesados en las conversaciones con el Norte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, este truco tan torpe no puede enganar a nadie en el mundo actual tan claro.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl contrario, abultara el expediente de los crimenes antinacionales cometidos por esa horda siendo otro acto criminal que burla e insulta a los connacionales que desean la reconciliacion, la unidad y la reunificacion independiente de la nacion coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi la camarilla de Lee esta interesada de veras en el dialogo, debe pedir disculpas a la nacion por haber llevado al caos las relaciones Norte-Sur, renunciar a su \"politica sobre el Norte\" a favor de la confrontacion fratricida y poner en claro su posicion de ejecutar las dos declaraciones intercoreanas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi ella recurre a las maniobras de confrontacion fratricida hablando hipocritamente del \"dialogo\" sin tomar tales medidas practicas, tendra que pagarlo muy caro."
