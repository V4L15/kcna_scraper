Korea \"Agreement on Mutual Assistance of Munitions\" Demanded \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 8 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland Saturday issued its information bulletin No. 938 as regards the lapse of 20 years since the U.S. and the south Korean puppet warmongers concluded the criminal \"agreement on mutual assistance of munitions\" aimed at preparations for a war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The information bulletin held that the U.S. and south Korean authorities should breach all the military \"agreements\" intended for invasion of the DPRK, including the above-said \"agreement,\" and immediately stop the reckless reinforcement of ultra-modern forces and war drills, squarely seeing the trend of times and the gravity of the situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and the south Korean warmongers are nowadays getting evermore pronounced in arms buildup for a war of aggression on the DPRK, it noted, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. military warmongers are reinforcing and deploying its means for nuclear war and precision weapons including ultra-modern fighter planes and nuclear-powered aircraft carriers in and around south Korea, while reorganizing the U.S. troops in south Korea into a task force under the signboard of transfer of their military bases and realization of \"strategic flexibility\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, the bellicose Lee Myung Bak regime is openly advocating about the \"theory of preemptive attack\" on the DPRK, following the outsiders. It is now busy purchasing from the U.S. weapons and military technology needed for such attack, including fighter planes of latest types, air-to-ground cruise missiles and latest air-to-air missiles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some days ago, Lee visited the U.S. to beg its master to upgrade south Korea's \"status in purchasing U.S.-made weapons.\" And he revealed his intention to import 36 armed helicopters Apache Longbow used by the U.S. army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lee Myung Bak regime is scheming even to join in the PSI and the missile defence system which the former regimes hesitated to do. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Due to the persistent moves of the U.S. and the pro-American bellicose forces of south Korea, the inter-Korean relations favorably developing after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration have been scuttled and the military tension and danger of a nuclear war are growing on the Korean Peninsula day by day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality clearly proves that \"dialogue\" and \"peace\" much touted by the U.S. and the Lee Myung Bak group are no more than a veil to mislead the public opinion at home and abroad and cover up their aggressive colors and they seek only confrontation and war by force.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Its evil policy against the nation and people has driven the politics of south Korea into utter confusion, made a mess of the economy and scuttled the favorably developing north-south relations. And the dignity and sovereignty of the nation are being utterly violated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As long as Lee Myung Bak, a foul flunkeyist and traitor, a die-hard separatist standing for confrontation, and a fascist tyrant, is left intact, the south Korean people will suffer bitterer misfortune and pain and the whole nation can not avoid tremendous catastrophe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people should never be taken in by the deceptive trick of the Lee group but continue their vigorous all-out resistance until they get the final surrender from it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement expressed belief that the south Korean youth and students would fully display their patriotic spirit and indomitable will in the struggle to reject the Lee Myung Bak regime and bring about independent, new policy and new life.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The same can be said of their recent behavior. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From the outset of the DPRK-U.S. negotiations, they were displeased with them, grumbling that \"north Korea is not the one to be trusted.\" They have become evermore desperate when their injustice was brought to light by the steady progress made in the process to settle the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any act of disturbing the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is an unpardonable challenge to the unanimous will of the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To do harm to the six-party talks precisely means damaging the interests of all the countries concerned including the U.S. This would only result in making the position of the U.S. in the Asia-Pacific region and the international community more difficult. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is obvious is that the progress of the six-party talks and the trend of the international politics are quite contrary to the intention of the U.S. conservative hardliners. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only a miserable end awaits those who are marginalized by history, insensitive to reality.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
