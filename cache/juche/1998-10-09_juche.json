            "content": "Why does U.S. please Japan's whim = KCNA commentary = \r\n\r\n   Pyongyang, October 9 (KCNA) -- Nowadays the United States is calling, at the request of Japan, for the release of \"kidnapped Japanese\" and the repatriation of \"hijackers\" of the ship Yodo, which are not its business.\r\n   The \"abduction\" and \"Yodo\" issues were a product of Japan's trick to evade apology and compensation, which are preconditions to normalization of DPRK-Japan diplomatic relations. They had already been rejected after their truth was clarified.\r\n   Nevertheless, those issues have been raised again by the United States which is styling itself \"superpower\".\r\n   This shameful and discreet behavior of the U.S. cannot be construed otherwise than an intention not to keep its promise to lift sanctions on the DPRK by continuing to brand it as a \"terrorist state\" at Japan's request.\r\n   The U.S. attempt to keep \"sanctions\" on unreasonable charges shows that it has no willingness to implement the DPRK-U.S. framework agreement.\r\n   Our people and army are never afraid of that attempt as they have built a powerful state even under \"sanctions\" of the imperialist allied forces more than half a century.\r\n   The U.S. will be held wholly responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom. \r\n \r\n"

It has been proved scientifically that Mt. Kumgang area had been glaciated once in the quaternary of the Cenozoic era and the framework of scenic Mt. Kumgang had been formed by glaciation.\r\n   A national symposium on glacial traces in Mt. Kumgang area was held at the Grand People's Study House on Wednesday.\r\n   Speakers cited samples and moraine collected from the spot, pictures and video tapes to elaborate on the glacial traces, time, scale and features and glaciation on the natural features and plants of Mt. Kumgang.\r\n   They said that the discovery and scientific confirmation of glacial traces on Mt. Kumgang will be a basis for studying natural environment of Korea from the position of Juche. It is of weighty significance in verifying animals and plants of Korean origin and, especially, the evolution process of humankind, they stressed. \r\n\r\n"

Moreover, voices of protest are rising louder also in Japan.\r\n   Irritated by this, the Japanese reactionaries are employing conceivable means and method to appease public opinion at home and abroad and justify their arms expansion and nuclear arming.\r\n It is motivated by their sinister purpose that they branded the DPRK's artificial satellite as \"missile\" and raised a \"nuclear issue\" in the DPRK.\r\n   Their reckless anti-DPRK hostile acts and nuclear arming have fuelled anti-Japanese feelings of the Korean people.\r\n   The Korean people are firmly determined to make Japan compensate for their past crimes as soon as possible. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
