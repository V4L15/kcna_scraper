            "content": "International situation after \"September 11 incident\" reviewed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 19 (KCNA) -- It is the review of the international situation one year after the \"September 11 incident\" that nothing can stop or reverse the onward movement of humankind for independence and peace despite temporary ups and downs and turmoil in the course of the advance of history and the ambition to build a uni-polar world is nothing but an anachronistic daydream. Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After declaring the \"anti-terrorism strategy\" a major policy to carry out its strategy for world domination in the 21st century with the \"September 11 incident\" as a momentum the United States seeks to put Central Asia, the region of strategic vacuum, under its control by means of war under the pretext of \"mopping up terrorist forces,\" secure a monopoly on oil and natural gas in the Caspian region and lay military siege to the big powers in the region from the three directions of Central Asia, Europe and northeast Asia to expand the sphere of its domination over it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the incident it easily seized Afghanistan with the support and cooperation of the \"international anti-terrorism alliance\" and realized its military infiltration into Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kirgyzstan and Georgia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Last January the United States listed Iraq, Iran and the DPRK as members of an \"axis of evil\" and urged all the countries of the world to choose between \"terrorism\" and \"anti-terrorism.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. warlike forces have stepped up the massive arms buildup, singled out a \"preemptive attack\" as basic means of its \"anti-terrorism war\" and made a nuclear war a fait accompli. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. strategy of escalating the \"anti-terrorism war\" is a very dangerous military strategy intended to carry out more savage aggression, state-sponsored terrorism, interference and war under the pretext of \"combating terrorism\" and unhesitatingly impose a nuclear disaster on humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-U.S. sentiment has grown stronger worldwide and the U.S. has been rejected and tight-cornered in every place under the confused and complicated situation since the \"September 11 incident.\"    \r\n   \r\n"
