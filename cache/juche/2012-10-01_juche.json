Korea-U.S. \"Mutual Defense Treaty\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, October 1 (KCNA) -- 59 years have passed since the U.S. and the Syngman Rhee puppet regime of south Korea concluded the \"Mutual Defense Treaty\" on October 1, 1953. Rodong Sinmun Monday runs a bylined article in this connection. \n\t\t\t\t\t The treaty is a criminal one for aggression as it allowed the U.S. imperialist aggression forces to stay in south Korea for an indefinite period and provided the U.S. with a legal foundation for launching all-out armed aggression against the DPRK together with south Korea any time, the article says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After holding the real right to rule south Korea on the strength of the treaty, the U.S. strengthened its domination over all fabrics of society including military affairs, politics, economy, culture and diplomacy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The treaty is a main factor of blocking the unity of the Korean nation and national reunification and increasing the danger of a nuclear war to an extreme phase. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the ulterior intention of the U.S. to egg the puppet forces on to escalate the north-south confrontation and ignite a war against the DPRK by keeping south Korea under its indefinite control. Prompted by this motive, the U.S. turned south Korea into an advanced base for invading the DPRK and the biggest arsenal for a nuclear war in the Far East on the strength of the treaty. The U.S. drove the south Korean puppet regime to ceaseless military provocations against the DPRK, pushing the situation on the Korean Peninsula to constant tension. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts go to prove that the south Korea-U.S. \"Mutual Defense Treaty\" is a stumbling block lying in the way of achieving sovereignty of the nation, peace on the peninsula and its reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The criminal treaty should be scrapped at once as it is going against the trend of the times for independent reunification, peace and prosperity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. persistently pursues the anachronistic policy for its military presence in south Korea on the strength of the \"Mutual Defense Treaty\", a leftover of the era of the Cold War, it will not be able to escape strong protest and denunciation at home and abroad."

Korean Regime's Suppression of Patriotic Organization under Fire \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, October 1 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee on Measures for Compensation to Former Korean Sexual Slaves for the Imperial Japanese Army and Drafting Victims in the DPRK made the following statement on Monday:\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean regime recently imposed a fine on the Council for the Solution of the Issue of the Volunteers' Corps in south Korea under the pretext of releasing a joint anti-Japan statement with the north without \"permission\", sparking off surprise and anger among all Koreans. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already reported, the above-said organizations made public on the occasion of Aug. 15, liberation day of Korea, a statement urging Japan to make an apology and reparation to the Korean nation for its past crimes, denouncing Japan's ambition to grab Tok Islets and militarist moves for reinvasion and checking the military cooperation between south Korea and Japan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean regime's imposition of the fine on the council which expressed a righteous patriotic will is a thrice-cursed action to serve Japan as it is aimed at hushing up the crimes it committed in the past as the sworn enemy by imposing all sorts of misfortunes and sufferings upon the Korean nation and its moves for reinvasion and desecrating the will of all Koreans to settle accounts with it a thousand times. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The committee bitterly denounces the treacherous action of the group as intolerable insult to the Koreans who were killed with bitter grudge including 200 000 women whose youth was mercilessly trampled down upon by the Japanese imperialist brutes and all Koreans who turned out in the actions to force Japan to settle the Japanese imperialists' past crimes and check its moves for reinvasion. It also vehemently condemned the group for its treacherous act of using the joint actions of the nation against the sworn enemy for escalating the confrontation with compatriots. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a nationwide patriotic action the north and the south should conduct in unity for the dignity and interests and sovereignty of the nation to force Japan to make reparation for its monstrous past crimes and reject the Japanese reactionaries' moves for reinvasion. It is the work common to the nation which should be encouraged. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That is why even the preceding fascist rulers of south Korea dared not bring charges against the joint anti-Japanese actions conducted by various organizations and people of south Korea in solidarity with the fellow countrymen in the north. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of traitors including the Ministry of Unification of south Korea pressurized the above-said organization to delete the part opposing the conclusion of the military agreement between south Korea and Japan from the joint statement of the organizations. When that part was contained in the statement, the group imposed such fine upon the organization of south Korea. This self-exposed that they are the worst group of traitors steeped in sycophancy towards Japan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said action taken by the group against the organization, far from urging Japan to make an apology for its monstrous crimes committed against the Korean nation proves that it is the group of traitors, its back turned on the nation. It is quite natural that the Ministry of Unification is cursed and condemned for being a ministry for confrontation with fellow countrymen and against reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts go to prove that it is impossible for the Korean nation to protect the sovereignty of the nation by its concerted efforts and develop normal inter-Korean relations and achieve independent reunification as long as the Lee Myung Bak group is allowed to work with blood-shot eyes to escalate the confrontation with fellow countrymen, keen on sycophancy towards the U.S. and Japan in utter disregard of the dignity and interests of the nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean people should not allow any longer the tragic situation in which treachery punishes patriotism, flunkeyism insults independence and anti-reunification elements block reunification movement. They should vigorously turn out in the actions to sternly punish the group of traitors."
