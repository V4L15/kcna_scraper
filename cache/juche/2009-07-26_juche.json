The undying feats performed by the President in the war served as a banner inspiring the army and people of the DPRK to win victory after victory in the confrontation with the U.S. generation after generation and noble revolutionary assets. The undying feats and tradition he performed in the war have been firmly carried forward and glorified under the outstanding Songun revolutionary leadership of Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t More than half a century has passed since the ceasefire of the war but durable peace has not yet settled in this land but stand-off with imperialism is going on.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A touch-and-go situation is now prevailing on the Korean Peninsula due to the reckless \"sanctions\" and military provocations of the U.S., the south Korean bellicose forces and the Japanese reactionaries against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will mercilessly and resolutely counter the enemy's \"sanctions\" with retaliation, its \"all-out war\" with all-out war. We will deal unimaginably deadly blows at the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppets if they ignite a war, obsessed with a foolish ambition, and achieve the historic cause of national reunification, the cherished desire of the nation, without fail."
