It also acceded to the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and recently to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will as ever continue cooperation with the FATF-Style Body while taking positive steps for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism but will never allow the U.S. and other hostile forces to abuse the FATF-Style Body for their sinister politically-motivated purposes."

And it poured 20 billion dollars of military spending and 73 million tons of war supplies, 11 times those used in the Pacific War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists dropped on Pyongyang City alone at least 428,000 bombs, more than its population, blustering that they would totally remove 78 cities in the northern half of Korea from the world map.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the whole period of the war, flying corps of the U.S. air force made more than 800,000 sorties and those of the marines and navy over 250,000 sorties, delivering bombs 3.7 times those it dropped on the Japan mainland during the Pacific War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On the order of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, they also conducted a germ warfare in the northern half of Korea. In the period from early January to March 1952 alone, they dropped various types of germ bombs in 169 areas on a total of 804 installments with mobilization of hundreds of war planes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t And the U.S. imperialists used even chemical weapons, prohibited under the international convention, in cities, counties and frontline areas of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Due to such cruel actions, 1.23 million innocent inhabitants were killed in the northern half of Korea during the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In Sinchon County alone, the U.S. imperialists massacred more than 35,000 citizens, a quarter of its population, in less than two months.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such mass killings were made in the southern half of Korea, too. The U.S. imperialists slaughtered at least one million innocent inhabitants under the pretext of \"operations for routing communist bandits and arresting all persons in touch with bandits\" during the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the war the U.S. imperialists destroyed more than 18,000 enterprises and financial institutions and 4,878,920 public buildings and houses and reduced 976,900 hectares of cropland into desolate land.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean people will never forget the barbarity committed by the U.S. imperialists in the last Korean War, but force them to pay dearly for their crimes without fail."

He went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That's because all sovereign states should solve the problems of their own countries and nations in line with their peoples' desire and interests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is utterly a hysterical fit for any third one to hammer its own opinion to the divided nation which is trying to discuss national reunification issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. had better quit its interference moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tragic situation occurred in such countries as Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya owing to the U.S. moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We are opposed to the U.S. interference in the sovereign states.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is thanks to the outstanding leadership of the great leaders that the DPRK was able to rise from ashes after the Korean war and dynamically advance the building of socialism despite the U.S. moves against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All successes made in the DPRK are the victory and glory of the Korean people that can not be found in other countries."
