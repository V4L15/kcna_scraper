At that time the ship \"Mangyongbong\" was on stand-by because of bad weather, anchored at Wonsan port. No sooner had it received SOS than it headed for the rough sea without delay about 5 P.M. on November 15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The stormy waves blocked the ship \"Mangyongbong\" from having access to \"Gang Long\". But the only idea in the mind of the Korean crew was to save the Chinese crew from a critical situation come what may. They buffeted the rough waves at the risk of their lives. At last at 06:00 on the morning of Nov. 16  they succeeded in linking rope with the Chinese ship. The rope broke all of a sudden while the two ships were heading for their destination. Koreans succeeded in re-linking the two ships with rope after buffeting the rough waves for four hours. The two ships thus entered Kim Chaek port safely. \r\n\r\n"

Marryshow, political leader of the Maurice Bishop Patriotic Movement of Grenada, released a statement on Nov. 11 saying that the present South Korean authorities are blocking the repatriation of the long-term prisoners under the unreasonable pretext and this is a violation of human rights and a very improper behaviour. In the statement he strongly urged  the South Korean authorities to immediately repatriate them to the DPRK where their families and relatives await them, to meet their demand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   An Indian parliamentarian in his statement on Nov. 12 said the South Korean authorities imprisoned tens of prisoners of war for many years, forcing unlawful \"ideological conversion\" and cruel tortures upon them. They defined them as \"those under supervision for public peace\" after their release and are imposing mercilessly mental and physical sufferings upon them, he said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is the worst inhumanitarian deed ever known in human history, which goes beyond imagination. The South Korean authorities should not use the humanitarian issue for their sinister political purpose but send the unconverted long-term prisoners back to their hometown at once. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He was a famous Buddhist priest of Koryo and founder of Chonthaejong, the main sect of Buddhism in Korea at that time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Ui Chon was born in 1055 as the fourth son  of Mun Jong, the 11th King of Koryo, and died in 1101. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Ui Chon left the royal palace for the temple to take tonsure at the age of 10 in 1065. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He studied Buddhist classics for 35 years as a priest and founded  Chonthaejong in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   When the reconstruction project is completed, the temple will provide a clear testimony to the architectural history of Koryo, the first unified state in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The research group including the archaeological institute of the Academy of Social Sciences and the office for the study of the architectural history of Pyongyang University of Construction and Building Materials finished the design for its reconstruction on the basis of survey of the temple site at the foot of Mt. Ogwan in Ryonghung-ri, Kaesong, and historical data related to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It was designed in such a way as to represent the appearance of the temple in the period before and after 1065, that is the second phase of the history of its culture as it was verified by the relics unearthed there as the best architecture in those times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The temple has a plottage of over 40,000 square metres. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is divided into a main temple, northeastern tomb and northwestern structure.
