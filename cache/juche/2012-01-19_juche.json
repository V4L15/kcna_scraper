            "content": "CPRK Spokesman Blasts Lee Myung Bak's Talk about Dialogue\r\n Pyongyang, January 19 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA Thursday ridiculing the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors for pretending to be interested in improving the north-south relations, talking about \"dialogue\":\n\t\t\t\t\t From the outset of the new year, Lee trumpeted about \"opening the window of opportunity\" and \"defusing mutual distrust.\" While touring a foreign country, he let loose a spate of jargons to give impression that he was interested in improving the north-south relations and dialogue, crying out for \"joint efforts for preserving stability and peace\" on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ryu U Ik, puppet minister of Unification, and other minions are so shameless as to utter that they hope \"the north will come out for dialogue\" and \"the south will work to improve the south-north relations\", talking about \"opening the channel of dialogue\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of traitors rubbed salt into the wounds of the fellow countrymen deeply grieving the untimely demise of the great father and hurled muds at the tears shed during the mourning period. Nevertheless, the group, far from making an apology for its high treason, shamelessly cried out for dialogue. This is an unpardonable mockery and insult to the Korean people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t While paying lip-service to \"dialogue,\" the Lee group more openly revealed its sinister intention to escalate confrontation, asserting \"there is no change in the basic policy toward the north\" and \"it will play a leading role, sticking to the essence of the policy toward the north\". Worse still, it dared preposterously call for someone's \"change\" and \"choice\", persistently peddling the \"Cheonan\" warship case the hypocritical nature of which had already been brought to light.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Despite accusations at home and abroad, Lee did not dismiss Kim Thae Hyo, a vicious anti-reunification and confrontation-minded element of Chongwadae, but promoted him. And he inspected a unit of the puppet army in the area along the Military Demarcation Line, malignantly slandering the DPRK as \"hostile forces\" and fanning up fever of a war of aggression against the north. This indicates that Lee is more viciously challenging the DPRK with a dagger in his belt.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Clear is the aim sought by the group in trumpeting about dialogue at present as it was dead-set against the DPRK's proposal for wide-ranging north-south dialogue and negotiations. It is aimed to calm down the surging resentment of the people of the DPRK and all other fellow countrymen at the group of traitors who committed the high treason, diverse elsewhere the south Korean people's hatred now on the point of eruption, mislead public opinion at home and abroad, tide over the ruling crisis and smoothly hold elections.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group is the gang of traitors without equals as it has driven the inter-Korean relations into an uncontrollable catastrophe by committing all sorts of wrongs in the four years of its office.    Ridiculous, indeed, is the attempt of this group to use the sacred north-south dialogue for attaining its despicable political goal and prolonging its remaining days.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak group would be well advised to make an apology to the whole nation for the high treason committed during the mourning over the great loss to the nation before talking about hypocritical dialogue."

These were the monstrous crimes which could be committed only by those steeped in the consciousness of confrontation with the DPRK to the marrow of their bones. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That was why south Korean people from all walks of life denounced the Lee group, querying \"is there anyone to initiate a war during mourning period and is there any depraved guy issuing an emergency alert to a mourner's house?\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group committed such thrice-cursed crimes as refusing to express condolences, groundlessly shifting the \"final responsibility\" for the sinking of the warship \"Cheonan\" and shelling of Yonphyong Island onto the supreme leadership of the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This compelled the service personnel and people of the DPRK to harden their will not to deal with Lee Myung Bak group for good and force him to pay for all his treasons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What he uttered about \"bellicose nature\" of someone touring the frontline area this time is nothing but sheer sophism to cover up the above-said high treasons. In other words, it is no more than a foolish artifice to evade the responsibility for bedeviling the inter-Korean relations and driving the situation to the brink of war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The service personnel and people of the DPRK will mercilessly punish those warmongers who hurt the great and sacred dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and the noble feelings and determination to protect it to the last and who are keen to destroy Korean style socialism."
