Kim Jong Il gives on-the-spot guidance to Mansudae Art Studio and Moranbong Theatre\r\n  Pyongyang, April 29 (KCNA) -- Secretary Kim Jong Il gave on-the-spot guidance to the Mansudae Art Studio and the Moranbong Theatre on April 27.\r\n   He first went to the Mansudae Art Studio, a Fine Art Production Centre of Korea.\r\n   He went round the monument to the on-the-spot teachings of President Kim Il Sung, the Korean Painting Production, the Mural Painting Production, the Sculpture Production, the Fine Art Exhibition Hall and other units, learned about the fine art production and put forward highly important tasks for the creation of fine arts.\r\n   After going round the magnificent production bases, he expressed great satisfaction over the conversion of the studio into a Fine Art Production Centre. He said the world-famous production centre is a great pride of the Korean people.\r\n   He said the WPK members and working people of the studio who are unfailingly loyal to the party have built up the production bases and produced a large number of famous Korean paintings, sculptures, embroideries, handiworks and other works worthy of national treasure, performing noteworthy feats in the history of fine arts.\r\n   He went on to say that the employees of the studio with fervent loyalty to President Kim Il Sung have done a lot of things for the consecration of the Kumsusan Memorial Palace. \r\nHe sent thanks to the party members and working people for their contributions to it.\r\n   He said as the works of art produced by the studio are worthy of national treasure, it is necessary to build a good exhibition hall so that the people may visit it any time.\r\n   He said the Korean paintings \"covering a long road of bloody struggle\" and \"8 valiant fighters of Phohang\" and other art pieces are masterpieces of great educational significance and such pieces should be produced in large numbers and sent to educational and other institutions so that the new generations may learn the noble revolutionary spirit of the forerunners.\r\n   He said it is important to thoroughly establish Juche in the production of fine arts and maintain the principle of historicism and it is essential to actively develop the Korean painting, jewelry painting and other pieces of art suited to the feelings and emotion of the Korean people and give a truthful representation of the spirit of the then times in all works.\r\n   He said all the works produced by the Mansudae Art Studio are proud, valuable cultural heritage and so it is necessary to pay deep attention to publishing and disseminating them widely at home and abroad.\r\n   He said the pieces of art play a very important role in building the capital into a more beautiful city and that various kinds of sculptures should be produced in large numbers and exhibited at parks and on streets so that Pyongyang wonderfully built by President Kim Il Sung may become more beautiful. \r\n   He said the employees of the studio have kept the studio as clean as a park and that all the units, including domains of science and education, should work hard to follow their example.\r\n   He then visited the Moranbong Theatre.\r\n   With a view to learning about acoustic conditions of the theatre, he heard orchestral music, symphony, vocal solo and instrumental music performed by the National Symphony Orchestra and the Mansudae Art Troupe. And he went round the theatre so as to acquaint himself with improvement and management of the theatre.\r\n   He said the theatre is a historic building in which many party and state functions were held in the presence of President Kim Il Sung and that the theatre associated with the feats of the President should be refurbished and managed better.\r\n   He was accompanied by secretaries of the WPK Central Committee Kye Ung Thae, Choe Thae Bok, Kim Kuk Thae, Kim Ki Nam and Kim Yong Sun and officials concerned. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They recently  let the agents of the \"Agency for National Security Planning\" manipulate the defection of some universities and colleges from the organisation in a bid to divide and disintegrate it from within.\r\n  \"Hanchongryon\" and students will brave the puppets' brutal suppression with a more vigorous struggle to defend the organisation and discharge with credit their mission and duty as befitting the vanguard of the patriotic struggle for reunification.\r\n   Only when the organisation stubbornly continues its already-started struggle in firm unity,  not fearful of sacrificing  for the righteous cause as it has done, will it emerge victorious without fail.\r\n   The organisation has a correct fighting goal and a very realistic method and form of struggle.\r\n   The slogan the organisation should hold high at present is the overthrow of Kim Young Sam.\r\n   The organisation and broad segments of democrats of south Korea demand that  Kim  Young Sam, the very one who caused the retrogressive revision of the fascist laws and the Hanbo loan scandal, be brought to trial and punished by history at once. Their call enjoys full support from the people.\r\n   No force on earth can match the organisation and patriotic-minded students fighting for their just cause. \r\n\r\n"
