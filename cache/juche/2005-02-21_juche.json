Korean Military Authorities Hit for Escalating Tensions \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 20 (KCNA) -- Minju Joson Sunday in a signed commentary denounces the south Korean military authorities for continuously infiltrating battleships into the waters of the north side in the West Sea of Korea to deliberately escalate tensions.\r\n The south Korean battleships' intrusion into the waters of the north side is a premeditated and intentional military provocation and an extremely dangerous move stimulating the north, which may cause an armed clash, the news analyst says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean war-like forces are seeking to trigger off a military clash between the north and the south by making battleships intrude into the waters of the north side and to expand it to a total war with it as an ignition point. Herein lies the purpose of the intrusion of south Korean naval battleships. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean military authorities have let battleships intrude into the waters of the north side under the pretext of defending the bogus \"northern limit line\" to increase military showdown between the north and the south and artificially aggravate the situation so as to chill the mounting desire of all the fellow countrymen for reunification and put the brake on the implementation of the north-south joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the south Korean military authorities keep playing with fire in the West Sea of Korea despite the repeated warnings of the Navy Command of the Korean People's Army, they will be held entirely responsible for all the ensuing problems.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They have joined in the U.S. vicious hostile policy toward the DPRK and its moves to stifle it and, therefore, the situation of the Korean Peninsula has reached the worst phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the Cold War, Japan restored the rights of belligerency and participation in a war under the pretext of \"peace-keeping\" and has dispatched \"Self-Defense Forces\" to dispute-torn areas to actively assist the U.S. military operations. Through this Japan has experienced a modern war and confirmed the principles of military actions. On this basis Japan is set to commit a war of aggression against any country, joining up with the United States or independently. Its first target is the DPRK. This is proved by the new \"defense program outlines\" allegedly to cope with threat from the DPRK and China. In their overseas aggression, they seek to invade the DPRK first and then China and other Asian countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their permission to exercise the \"right to collective self-defense\" is a very dangerous military step for removing a biggest brake lying in the way of realizing their ambition for the \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\" in the new century which they failed in the past.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Assailed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 20 (KCNA) -- Hong Sok Jung, writer of the Central Committee of the Korean Writers Union, when interviewed by media persons in\r\nPyongyang on Sunday said he could hardly repress his indignation at the fact that many novels authored by writers of the DPRK have been openly reprinted without permission.\r\n Reclarifying his stand on this widespread controversy over it, he said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  I have already expressed my opinion last December when I met members of the south side's Council of Writers of National Literature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some south Korean publishers reprinted without permission lengthy novel \"Rim Kkok Jong\" written by my grandfather Hong Myong Hui who was also called Pyok Cho and other literary works written by DPRK writers. This was an immoral and illegal infringement on copyright bereft of elementary ethic as it breaches international law on copyright and publishing practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n My grandfather known as a man of literature of the Korean nation began writing the novel in the 1920s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This work, however, has been reprinted by unconscionable publishers in south Korea without its writer's approval to gain excessive profits for the past more than 20 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n I express deep regret and concern over the open piracy of copyright in south Korea as a bereaved member of the author and as the very one who fell victim to the piracy by some south Korean publishing houses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n I do not think that they have perpetrated such an unimaginable act, unaware of international law and practice concerning the copyright. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The piracy is graver because it was deliberately committed. Being a victim to this crime I can never overlook this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Human rights and right to property are strictly protected in the DPRK under the law on copyright recently adopted at the Supreme People's Assembly as they were in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An infringement upon copyright means stealing other's intellectual creation. Therefore, such act can never evade public rebuff and denunciation for its immorality although \"law\" may connive at it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is for this reason that there is a practice between states that when one uses the copyright of the other, one should get the approval of the author and make an appropriate reward for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is unpardonable to infringe without hesitation upon the literary work done by a compatriot in breach of international practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n I strongly demand once again that the open piracy in south Korea be unconditionally stopped and those responsible for it make a due  apology and compensation for it without delay.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 19 (KCNA) -- It is an unanimous resolution and will of all the Koreans to make this year, 60 years since the U.S. occupation of south Korea, the year of the U.S. forces' withdrawal from south Korea without fail through a vigorous nationwide struggle, says Rodong Sinmun Saturday in a signed article.\r\n This year the Koreans more keenly feel than ever before the national shame imposed upon them by the cursed U.S. forces' occupation of south Korea as they have brought immeasurable disaster and misfortune and untold disgrace and tragedy and harden their will not to allow this history of national tragedy to go on, the article notes, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The occupation of south Korea by the gangster-like U.S. imperialist aggression forces is the root cause of all misfortune and pain inflicted upon the Koreans and a major stumbling block lying in the way of achieving the country's peace and reunification. It is the task assuming significance in the nation's history and an urgent requirement of the times which brooks no further delay to drive the U.S. forces out of south Korea and put an end to the history of national shame and tragedy that have lasted for 60 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite righteous and just for the Koreans to wage a dynamic struggle to force the U.S. forces out of south Korea under slogans calling for disallowing their presence in south Korea to go beyond 60 years and putting an end to the foreign domination over south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The three forms of cooperation -- cooperation for national independence, cooperation for peace against war and cooperation for reunification and patriotism -- can be realized and prove successful only when the struggle to achieve them is accompanied by that to drive the U.S. forces out of south Korea, the article notes, underscoring the need for all the Koreans to be keenly aware of the vital significance and importance of the struggle for the U.S. forces' withdrawal and intensify it this year till they have quit south Korea to the last man.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
