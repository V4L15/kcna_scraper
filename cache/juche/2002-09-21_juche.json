That was the result of the rulers' flunkeyism and submission to big countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBut the Korean people could put an end to the disgraceful history of the nation and fully demonstrate its dignity as they were guided by President Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean-nation-first spirit has been fully displayed in the era of the army-based policy pursued by Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary mettle of the Korean people with the spirit has been clearly manifested in smashing the moves of the imperialists and steadfastly defending the sovereignty of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Armed with the spirit the Korean people have advanced the revolution and construction in their own way as required by the Juche idea, irrespective of what others say. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are also working hard to build a powerful nation in their own revolutionary style, under the slogan \"Let us live our own way\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the Korean people hold Kim Jong Il, brilliant commander of Mt. Paektu, in high esteem, they have become an independent nation with a strong sense of the Korean-nation-first spirit.    \r\n\r\n"
