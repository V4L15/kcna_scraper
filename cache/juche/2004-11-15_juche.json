            "content": "Spokesman for DPRK FM on Prospect of Resumption of Six-party Talks\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 13 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the DPRK gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA Saturday as regards some misinformation about the prospect of the resumption of the six-party talks afloat in the United States after the presidential election:\r\n Some American media recently spread nonsensical stories that the six-party talks could not succeed because the DPRK insisted on the bilateral talks between the DPRK and the U.S. only. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is nothing but sophism making profound confusing of the right and wrong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already known, the six-party talks were realized thanks to the positive initiative of the DPRK and their present deadlock is entirely attributable to the U.S. far-fetched assertion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On various occasions the DPRK clarified that it stands for settling the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. through dialogue and negotiations and it does not stick to the form of the talks aimed to solve it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for the bilateral talks, the DPRK has neither expected nor waited for them as the U.S. has been opposed to that kind of talks. Accordingly, the DPRK does not feel any need to ask the U.S. for the bilateral talks as it is not ready to hold them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Moreover, it does not stand to reason for the DPRK to try to hold any bilateral talks with the party which is hatching plots \"to bring down the DPRK's system.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the U.S. to make its policy switchover is the key to finding a solution to the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. drops its hostile policy aimed at \"bringing down the system\" in the DPRK and opts for co-existing with the latter in practice, it will be quite possible to settle the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will go ahead to attain its desired goal strictly according to its independent judgment and in the state interests.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 14 (KCNA) -- An end should be put to the nearly 60-year-long U.S. imperialist aggression troops' occupation of south Korea which brought a bitter tragedy of division to the Korean nation and blocked the unified development of the country, Roding Sinmun Sunday says in a signed article.\r\n Noting that the U.S. occupation of south Korea is a direct product of the U.S. ambition for aggression on Korea, the author says that the U.S. troops landed on south Korea after the defeat of the Japanese imperialists in a bid to realize the U.S. policy of domination of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. military occupation of south Korea is entirely contrary to the will and interests of the south Korean people as it is an illegal and unjustifiable invasion. The main object of the occupation is to attain its aggressive interests and hold its supremacy in Asia-Pacific region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The occupation is a villainous infringement upon the sovereignty and national dignity of Korea and an anti-reunification and anti-peace behavior against the will and desire of Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is because of the obstructive moves of the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops that the Korean nation has not yet made unified progress since its liberation, the turning phase of reunification provided by the historic July 4 Joint Statement was reversed and the inter-Korean agreement and the joint declaration for denuclearization became wastepaper as soon as they were adopted and effectuated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the fact that the U.S. bellicose forces are now desperately scheming to put the brake on the process of inter-Korean reconciliation, cooperation and reunification, the article states that they are massively forward deploying up-to-date war equipment in and around south Korea under the signboard of the \"cutback and relocation\" of the U.S. troops to escalate the tension and drive the situation of the Korean Peninsula to the brink of a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. reckless war move for aggression is the most dangerous one totally running counter to the historic trend of the nation toward peace and reunification, it says, and stresses: The United States should change its Korea policy to meet the trend of the new century and the demand of the Korean nation and make a decision to immediately withdraw its troops from south Korea.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The situation firmly convinces the Korean people that what the DPRK has done to build a powerful nuclear deterrent force to cope with the U.S. moves for a nuclear war was a just measure to protect the security of the country and the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun Saturday denounces it as a deception and mockery of the south Korean people calling for the abolition of the NSL and a challenge to the fellow countrymen.\r\n The \"bill\" introduced by them going against the trend of the times towards the repeal of the NSL is aimed not to revise it but keep it in force, the news analyst says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their true intention is evidenced by the fact that they are trying to leave Clause 2 of the NSL referring to the charge of \"non-recognition of the government\" as it is. This is a most poisonous article of the NSL and its core as it defines the north as an \"anti-state organization\". To remove some secondary articles of the NSL while leaving this poisonous article as it is, talking about its revision is, in fact, no more than a crafty move to deceive the public calling for the abolition of the NSL and keep the evil law in force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Clear is the aim the ultra-right reactionary conservatives of the GNP sought in vociferating about the revision of the NSL after doggedly opposing its abolition by staking their lot on its maintenance. In a nutshell, it is aimed to stem the strong trend of the times towards the repeal of the NSL and keep it in force at any cost in a bid to save their traitorous party from collapse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the GNP can see and hear something, it should never ignore the trend of the times and the voices of the people calling for the repeal of the NSL. If it persists in its moves to keep it, the leftover of the era of confrontation while going against the people's mindset, it will be thrown into a dumping ground of history together with the NSL.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They are maliciously slandering the DPRK, China, Cuba and other countries under the pretext of \"protection of human rights\" while talking this or that about human rights performance in those countries whenever an opportunity presents itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An aim sought by the U.S. imperialists in this is to tarnish the image of progressive countries and socialist countries over the human rights issue and internationally isolate them. They also seek to instigate counter-revolutionary elements in those countries to create social disturbances and discontent in a bid to realize \"regime changes\" there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. \"human rights offensive\" is mainly targeted against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has already rendered active help, financial and material, to those anti-DPRK plot-breeding organizations in countries around it. It is busy pressurizing some countries to defile the image of the DPRK and create an atmosphere favorable for realizing a \"regime change\" in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the world connives at the human rights offensive staged by the U.S. imperialists under the pretext of \"protection of human rights\" the sovereignty and the interests of the progressive countries will be seriously infringed upon and the world will become noisier. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present situation requires heightened vigilance against the U.S. \"human rights offensive.\" All those countries that respect human rights should pool efforts and overwhelm the U.S. imperialists' unjust human rights offensive with a just and powerful offensive.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
