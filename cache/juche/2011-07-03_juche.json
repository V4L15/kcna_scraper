Korean Warmongers' Provocation\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, July 3 (KCNA) -- The reckless provocative moves, now being made by the south Korean warmongers against the DPRK, remind one of the \"north expedition\" racket traitor Syngman Rhee kicked off just before provoking the past war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Sunday says this in a bylined article.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak group of traitors is working hard to realize the wild ambition Syngman Rhee failed to do, the article says, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet warmongers committed such military provocations as the \"Cheonan\" warship sinking case and the Yonphyong Island shelling incident. In the meantime they have frequently staged large-scale joint military exercises against the DPRK, inviting to south Korea dangerous nuclear offensive means of the U.S. such as nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and submarines.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group is now planning to stage an extremely provocative drill for \"stability in the north and handover of government to civilians there\" by mobilizing riffraffs of the \"five provincial offices of the north\" in the forthcoming Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military exercise.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile the group is indiscriminately cracking down upon non-governmental organizations opposed to the \"government's\" policy of confrontation with the fellow countrymen and its scheme to ignite a war against the DPRK. It stretched out its hand of repression even to the military while launching a sweeping purge campaign against patriotic and conscientious people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What the group seeks in such moves is to unleash a war of aggression on the DPRK and realize \"unification under the system of liberal democracy,\" a treacherous attempt. That is why it is clamoring about \"contingency\" and conducting military rehearsals almost every day after rounding off war scenarios to cope with it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently the group perpetrated again never-to-be-condoned hideous provocation after the incident of target that hurt the dignity of the DPRK's leadership. The facts show that its anti-DPRK war moves have gone far beyond the limit line of danger.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is clear what disaster the entire nation would suffer if this group of traitors is allowed to go wild to do harm to the compatriots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is deserved to dislodge the Lee group, source of national disaster, without delay."

The birth of the CPC put the Chinese revolution on the right course, gave the Chinese people a powerful motivation and created bright prospects for China's future development.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Looking back at China's development and progress over the past 90 years, we have naturally come to this basic conclusion: Success in China hinges on the Party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To make Party building more scientific under the new historical conditions, we must raise the ideological and political awareness of the whole Party, encourage outstanding individuals in all fields to join the cause of the Party and country, maintain close ties between the Party and the people and uphold integrity and combat corruption.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since the very day of its founding, the CPC has heroically shouldered the historic mission of uniting with and leading the people in achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. In pursuing this great cause, we must unswervingly follow the basic line of the Party, promote scientific development, enhance social harmony and make overall progress in the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics from the new historical starting point. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We must firmly follow the line, principles, and policies adopted since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Party Central Committee and apply the spirit of reform and innovation to all aspects of government administration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should properly handle conflicts among the people and other social conflicts. We should reduce and defuse these conflicts by building the material basis, enhancing moral strength, improving policies and measures, and providing a stronger institutional guarantee.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army should fulfill its historic mission in the new stage in the new century. We should intensify efforts to build a revolutionary, modern, and standardized army in an all-around way and strengthen and develop unity between the army and the government and between the army and the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should pursue the general goal of promoting peaceful development of relations across the Taiwan Strait, deepen exchanges and cooperation in all areas and expand interactions across the Strait. We should join hands in opposing and checking separatist activities for \"Taiwan independence\" and work for the happiness of compatriots on both sides of the Strait and the future of the Chinese nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will continue to pursue an independent foreign policy of peace and unswervingly follow the path of peaceful development and the win-win strategy of opening up.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The whole Party must care about young people, listen to what they have to say, encourage their growth, and support their entrepreneurship.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the achievements of the Party over the past 90 years have been made by the Party together with the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the first half of this century, the Party will unite with and lead the people in accomplishing two grand goals: First, to build a moderately prosperous society of a higher level to the benefit of over one billion people by the centennial of the founding of the CPC and, second, to make China a prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced and harmonious modern socialist country by the centennial of the founding of New China.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the comrades in the Party must keep in mind their historic missions. We must unswervingly forge ahead along the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and work even harder to unite with and lead the people of all ethnic groups in China in working for our happy life and the bright future of the Chinese nation."
