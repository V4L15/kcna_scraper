            "content": "Kim Jong Un Publishes Work on Stepping up Construction of Stockbreeding Base\r\n Pyongyang, January 30 (KCNA) -- Marshal Kim Jong Un published work \"Let Us Expedite the Construction of the Livestock Breeding Base in the Sepho Area and Bring about a New Turn in Developing Animal Husbandry\" on Jan. 28.\n\t\t\t\t\t In the work he stressed the need to provide the people, who have overcome all sorts of difficulties and trials together with the party, entrusting everything to it, with an affluent and happy life with no more to desire in the world at an early date.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The most important task facing us today is to rapidly improve the standard of people's living, he said, adding to this end it is imperative to solve the food problem by developing stock-breeding and fishery while doing farming well.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Workers' Party of Korea set forth the policy of reclaiming the Sepho tableland to develop stock-breeding and turning it into a large-scale stock-breeding base, he noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To reclaim the Sepho tableland and turn it into a stock-breeding base is one of the earnest behests of President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il,  he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that though we have made big achievements in the construction of the stock-breeding base in Sepho area, we still have huge tasks to do in the future, he clarified tasks to be fulfilled and ways for doing so.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The most important issue in building Sepho area into the large-scale stock-breeding base is to improve soil quality and create pasture well, he said, and continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As Sepho area is exposed to strong wind all the year round, it is necessary to carry out the work for creating windbreaks in a planned and prospective way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Construction projects such as dwelling houses, sheds for domestic animals and public buildings and roads should be stepped up and be completed qualitatively.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Oil, building materials, manpower and equipment needed for the construction of the stock-breeding base should be provided on a preferential basis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Good preparations should be made for operating the base.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The work of reclaiming the tableland and building a stock-breeding base is a project to be pushed forward with the involvement of all members of the party and the state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is also important to rapidly develop the nation's overall stock-breeding while stepping up the construction of the stock-breeding base in Sepho area.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The party channels efforts into the construction of the base to attain an important objective to bring about a fresh turn in the development of the nation's overall stock-breeding with this construction as a momentum.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is also necessary to put the production at the modern stock-breeding bases that had already been built under the leadership of the party on a regular footing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the duty and moral obligation of we, officials who are soldiers and disciples of Kim Jong Il to put the production at the stock-breeding bases that had already been built on a regular footing and make people realize his loving care and solicitude in their actual life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To put production at the stock-breeding bases on a regular footing is not just a business work but an important political work for preserving and glorifying the leadership exploits of Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The work for boosting the output of livestock products should be pushed forward as an all-people movement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To develop stock-breeding, it is also important to solve the issues of breeds of domestic animals and feed, improve breeding and establish a thorough anti-epizootic measure, he said, elaborating on it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Many domestic animals of good stock should be produced through intensified work for raising domestic animals, he noted, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is also necessary to conduct brisk scientific and technological exchanges with other countries to introduce into the country domestic animals of superior stock and rear them after going through trial stages.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A way of solving the issue of feed for domestic animals is to carry out the party's policy of obtaining meat from grass.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To this end it is imperative to create vast pasture in every place.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Grain feed needed for stock-breeding should be ensured through good farming.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The production of bean cake should be increased by cultivating bean extensively and various protein feed sources including insects rich in protein content be actively explored and put into use.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The way of producing feed additives relying on locally available raw materials should be studied and completed to ensure the supply of feed additives necessary for operating the stock-breeding bases.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The production of feed for domestic animals should be industrialized by dint of modern science and technology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The raising and tending of domestic animals should be done on a scientific and rational way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The role of stock-breeding scientific research institutions should be enhanced in establishing the scientific way of raising and tending.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to put the raising and tending of domestic animals on a scientific basis it is necessary for officials and other working people in the field of stock-breeding to acquire professional scientific and technological knowledge and technical skills.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The anti-epizootic work is what keeps stock-breeding alive.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not a slightest concession should be allowed in issues concerning anti-epizootic work.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un underlined the need for party organizations to increase their roles in carrying out the party's policy on revitalizing the stocking-breeding and improving the standard of people's living."

Korea's Suppression of Pro-Reunification Organizations Assailed\r\n Pyongyang, January 30 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of Korea released a statement on Friday denouncing the conservative group of south Korea for desperately working to revise the \"Security Law\" (SL) for the worse in a sinister bid to forcibly dissolve the pro-reunification patriotic organizations and stamp out progressive and democratic forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Shortly ago, the minister of Justice of south Korea, in his speech on the \"2015 working plan\" blustered that he would set it as a top priority task of this year to \"preserve the nature for defending the value of the constitution\" and modify the SL to forcibly dissolve the \"anti-state organizations\" and \"those benefiting enemy.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In response to it, the chief executive of south Korea encouraged him, saying \"any act of violating laws should be severely punished by a legal action.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the instruction of the chief executive, the conservative group is now going busy with the moves to revise for the worse the SL aimed at stamping out the pro-reunification patriotic organizations and progressive and democratic forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean fascist authorities' suppression of the pro-reunification patriotic forces has reached an extreme pitch since the outset of the year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an unpardonable criminal move to totally stamp out independence, democracy and reunification forces and drive the inter-Korean relations into the worst catastrophe.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean fascist authorities have suppressed the pro-reunification patriotic organizations and personages by invoking the SL which brands compatriots as \"enemy\" after labeling those organizations and personages as \"followers of the north.\" This is, in actuality, an intolerable provocation to the DPRK and a blatant challenge to its patriotic call for achieving the great national unity in the idea of By Our Nation Itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They talk about \"confidence building\" and \"dialogue\" while antagonizing the compatriots in the north and branding the pro-reunification movement as a crime. This is just an insult and mockery of the dialogue partner and no more than a clumsy farce to deceive the public at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t National reconciliation and unity can neither be achieved nor the north-south relations can make any progress as long as such anti-reunification fascist law as the SL remains in force in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The SL should be repealed at once in order to guarantee the democratic freedom and rights of the south Korean people, mend the north-south relations and achieve reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south conservative group is sadly mistaken if it thinks it can tide over its ruling crisis and realize its wild ambition for long-term office by suppressing the progressive forces calling for repairing the north-south relations and achieving national reunification by invoking the SL, an old means for suppression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should not forget the miserable ends of the successive rulers who met shameful ruin while stemming on the strength of the SL the trend of the national history toward the improvement of the north-south relations and reunification."

Korea's Conspiratorial Human Rights against DPRK Released\r\n Pyongyang, January 30 (KCNA) -- The DPRK Measure Council for Human Rights in South Korea on Jan. 30 released an inquiry report disclosing the truth behind the mad-cap anti-DPRK human rights racket being kicked up by the south Korean authorities in collusion with the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t The human rights racket being staged by the south Korean conservative forces hell-bent on confrontation with compatriots in the north is a blatant challenge to the DPRK highly dignified with independence, an unpardonable insult to the Korean people enjoying all blessings under the most advantageous socialist system and impudent deception and mockery of the fair-minded world public, the report said, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present chief executive of south Korea, even before coming to power, had kicked off an anti-DPRK human rights racket aimed at cooking up the non-existent \"human rights issue\" of the DPRK, claiming \"it is a sin to keep mum about the human rights in the north.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After taking office, she set it as an \"important task for enforcing her north policy\" to settle the issue of \"human rights in the north\" and singled out it as a core task of the \"the second principal plan for the development of south-north relations\" which clarified the goal and main orientation of her \"north policy\" to be enforced during the 5 year-long tenure of her office.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At \"state council meetings\", meetings of chief secretaries of Chongwadae, the \"ceremony for marking Aug. 15\", UN General Assembly sessions, etc. she took the lead in the human rights racket. There she pulled up the DPRK over its human rights performance, \"expressing serious concern over starvation and tragic human rights situation.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Ministry of Unification, the Intelligence Service, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, the \"human rights commission\" and other south Korean institutions have been hell-bent on anti-DPRK human rights racket, setting the \"human rights issue of the north \" as an important annual task of their policy. They asserted \"they should feel guilty about their past negligence in dealing with the human rights issue of the north\", crying out for \"making indefatigable efforts to settle the issue.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities, in a bid to make their anti-DPRK human rights racket sound plausible, let die-hard \"defectors from the north\" make false testimonies in a bid to forge the \"human rights issue of the north.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As many people became skeptical about testimonies made by human scum, they produced even videos showing interrogations made inside \"north's concentration camp of political offenders\" for distribution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ultra-right conservative media of south Korea, at the instigation of the authorities, are becoming zealous in hyping the \"human rights issue of the north\" by giving wide publicity to the false testimonies made by bribed betes noires.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those of the \"Saenuri Party\" are getting frantic in their moves to ram the 10-year old \"bill on human rights in the north\" through the \"National Assembly\" at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean conservative forces are running the whole gamut of gimmicks to build a world public opinion about the \"human rights issue in the north\" and realize the international cooperation in the campaign to stifle the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During her trips to 22 countries and her participation in 14 international meetings after taking office, the present chief executive didn't forget to mention the \"human rights issue in the north \" and let loose a whole string of jargons about \"universally accepted value,\" \"concern of the international community\", \"cooperation\" and the like in a bid to garner the cooperation of the international community in the anti-DPRK human rights racket.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities, in collusion with the U.S., are getting frantic in their anti-DPRK human rights racket at the UN to internationalize the \"human rights issue\" of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Last year the conservative forces in south Korea worked with bloodshot eyes to set up \"a commission of inquiry into human rights in the north\" in collusion with the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean authorities allowed the UN office on \"human rights in the north\" to be set up in south Korea, a thrice-cursed act of treachery.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They have been desperate in their human rights racket to impair the dignity of the DPRK and tarnish its image by letting human scum to tell all sorts of lies in foreign countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t While trumpeting about the non-existent \"human rights issue in the north\", they are working hard to prevent south Koreans from knowing about the true human rights performance in the DPRK where the dignity and rights of the people are guaranteed at the highest level.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the first year of the present regime in south Korea 497 websites of various forms were closed or disconnected after being branded as the ones \"following the north\" and \"benefiting enemy.\" This was 23 percent more than those in the previous year.

            "content": "Japan Must Feel Ashamed of Sexual Slavery: KCNA\r\n Pyongyang, January 30 (KCNA) -- 8,749 Japanese politicians and scholars including lawmakers and university professors recklessly denied the sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army a few days ago.\n\t\t\t\t\t They filed a collective suit, claiming that the Asahi Shimbun distributed a groundless article all over the world though there is no evidence that the Japanese army forcefully enlisted comfort women. They went the lengths of demanding compensation of 10,000 yen per person and ad for making apology, asserting that the belated cancellation of the article hurt the honor of Japanese people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The international community cannot but be stunned by this shameless tendency of the Japanese society. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan represents a group of morally depraved guys who are making desperate efforts to cover up their filthy history of aggression and inhumane crimes at any cost. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army is a hideous crime against humanity unprecedented in the history of the imperialists' war of aggression. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese imperialists enforced sexual slavery on the basis of the abnormal military theory under the pretext of \"preserving combat capabilities\" of the army. Then they forcibly drafted, kidnapped and abducted about 200,000 Korean women to use them as sexual slaves and mercilessly killed them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the ultra-right forces of Japan are desperately working to distort and deny the barbarities committed by the Japanese imperialists including sexual slavery which has been already proved by testimonies made by survivors and a lot of documents and instill a military view on history and revanchism into the younger generation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan recently allowed deletion of descriptions about the sexual slavery from senior high school textbooks. As a result, words \"comfort women for the army\" and \"forcible drafting\" disappeared from the textbooks of contemporary society and political economy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In Japan the history textbooks which embellished and justified the aggression in the past increased nearly 10 times as compared with those in the period 10 years ago. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tampering with history is led to the phase of totally distorting and denying the past crimes, after going beyond the practice of hiding and playing down them under the zealous backing and patronage of the Japanese authorities. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japanese politicians unhesitatingly let loose reckless militarist remarks insisting that the decision of the Far Eastern Military Tribunal was not \"one of justice\" and that Japan \"liberated\" Asian countries from domination by the Western powers during the Second World War. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now Japanese politicians, educators and media persons who should speak for justice and conscience desperately deny the past crimes. This is the vulgar morality in Japan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is shame on Japan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The international community is demanding Japan seriously reflect on their history of massacre, destruction and plunder and make sincere apology and reparation this year marking the 70th anniversary of the Japanese imperialists' defeat. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is no future for Japan unless it redeems its inglorious past."

Para ese fin es preciso realizar bien la agricultura y al mismo tiempo solucionar el problema de alimentos al desarrollar la ganaderia y la pesqueria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara desarrollar la ganaderia, el Partido del Trabajo de Corea presento la orientacion de roturar la meseta de Sepho y convertirla en una  gran base ganadera.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRoturarla y convertirla en una base ganadera constituye tambien el legado encarecido del Presidente Kim Il Sung y el Dirigente Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe obtuvieron muchos exitos en la construccion de la base ganadera en la zona de Sepho, pero son tan abundantes las tareas a cumplirse en lo adelante, dijo y aclaro las tareas y los remedios para ese fin.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo mas importante en acondicionar la zona de Sepho en una gran base ganadera es preciso hacer bien el mejoramiento de tierra y la  formacion de herbazales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay que realizar de manera planificada y con vistas al futuro la formacion de bosques cortavientos dado que hace viento fuerte en la zona durante todas las estaciones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHan de impulsar la construccion de viviendas, corrales, edificios publicos y carreteras y terminarlas cualitativamente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay que asegurar con preferencia los combustibles, materiales, manos de obra e instalaciones necesarias a la construccion de la base ganadera.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe debe organizar con escrupulosidad los preparativos para la administracion de la base ganadera  en la zona de Sepho.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRoturar la meseta de Sepho para construir la base ganadera es el trabajo a ser impulsado por  todo el partido y todo el pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay que acelerar la construccion de la base ganadera en la zona de Sepho, y al mismo tiempo desarrollar vertiginosamente la ganaderia en general del pais. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl partido enfoca su fuerza a la construccion de la base ganadera en la zona de Sepho con el objetivo de lograr esta vez nuevo cambio en el desarrollo de la ganaderia en general del pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay que normalizar la produccion en las modernas bases ganaderas ya construidas bajo la guia del partido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHacer que el pueblo experimente en su vida real el amor y la benevolencia del Dirigente al normalizar la produccion en las bases ganaderas ya construidas es el deber y la merecida obligacion moral de los funcionarios, quienes son combatientes y discipulos del Dirigente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa normalizacion de produccion en las bases ganaderas ya preparadas no es un simple trabajo economico-practico sino la importante labor politica para defender y glorificar las hazanas de orientacion del Dirigente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs necesario impulsar vigoroso y masivamente la labor por incrementar la produccion ganadera.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara desarrollar la ganaderia es imprescindible solucionar el problema de reproductores de los animales domesticos y de pienso, mejorar la cria y el cuido y establecer estrictamente las medidas de prevencion veterinaria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe debe obtener muchos animales domesticos de buenos generos al mejorar los trabajos para obtener buenas variedades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor otra parte, es necesario introducir los ganados de buena variedad al activar el intercambio cientifico-tecnico con otros paises y criarlos a prueba.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa llave de la solucion del problema de pienso de los ganados reside en materializar la orientacion del partido de producir la carne con las hierbas.
