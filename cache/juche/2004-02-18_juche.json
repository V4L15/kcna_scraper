This is entirely attributable to the U.S. imperialists' policy of strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As long as the U.S. munition monopolies are keen to gain more profits by steadily expanding their war industry, the U.S. reactionary ruling quarters can never drop their policy of strength.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 17 (KCNA) -- 300 figures from all walks of life under 58 civic and social organizations of south Korea including the People for Achieving Peace and Reunification, the Democratic Workers' Party, the National Alliance for Democracy and Reunification, the Citizens' Solidarity for Democratic Society and the Centre for Peace and Disarmament reportedly called a press conference in Seoul on Feb. 12 in protest against the humiliating transfer of the U.S. military base in Ryongsan.\r\n Jong Uk Sik, representative of the Peace Network, and Chae Han Sok, representative of a district committee of Phyongthaek of the Democratic Workers' Party, in their speeches said that the redeployment of the U.S. forces in south Korea through the transfer of their base will not only result in increasing the defence spending running into astronomical figures and facilitating their preemptive attack on the north but serve the U.S. purpose of mobilizing combat forces when necessary as is the case with the dispatch of troops to Iraq. They stressed the need to wage a powerful struggle against the expansion and transfer of the U.S. military base. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A declaration of 300 figures from all walks of life against the U.S. pressure upon south Korea to cover all the expenses for the transfer of the base running into astronomical figures and its offer of Phyongthaek area for the base was adopted at the press conference. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The declaration said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The authorities decided to bear all expenses for the transfer of the base including not only the area but buildings, lodging quarters, power facilities and even a golf course and expenses for the transfer of employees in the base. Not content with this, they agreed to build structures as requested by the U.S. Department of Defense. This is a humiliating act. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The transfer of the U.S. military base in Ryongsan now pushed forward by the U.S. is aimed to increase the forces for preemptive attacks on the north and turn the U.S. forces in south Korea into a Northeast Asian regional army.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
