            "content": "Kim Jong Un Visits Korean April 26 Cartoon Film Studio\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, November 27 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Un, supreme leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, gave field guidance to the Korean April 26 Cartoon Film Studio. \n\t\t\t\t\t He said he was visiting the studio to bring about a fresh turn in animation and, through it, put the film making in full progress as the movies play an important role in educating the people, establishing the stirring atmosphere in society and propelling the revolution and construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He first went to the room dedicated to the history of the studio. The studio, founded at the initiative of President Kim Il Sung and under his guidance in September 1957, had developed into a leading animation producer under the energetic guidance and meticulous care of leader Kim Jong Il, he noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that the cartoon films produced at the studio are popular among not only children but people from different walks of life while gaining in popularity worldwide. He added that the people regard those films as their close companions in life and work.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the studio produced hundreds of cartoon films, including those adapted from stories told by Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, and ordered and joint cartoons on a worldwide scale, he highly praised its animators for having creditably discharged the noble mission they assumed before the party and revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He set forth important tasks after touring original picture atelier, background workroom, dubbing, recording, cutting and preview rooms and other places of the studio to learn in detail about the cartoon production.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  He urged the studio to make a radical change in cartoon production by channeling big efforts into it true to the intention of the party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is needed to produce interesting cartoons of diverse themes and styles suited to the children's age and mental qualities and the Korean people's thoughts and feelings, he said, stressing that the creators should make a deep study of life and get intent on inquiry and speculation to produce more cartoons favored by the people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed the need to make many cartoons on historical records so as to help youngsters and students and working people know well about the long history, brilliant culture and excellent traditions of the Korean nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"The Boy General\", a cartoon film in 50 parts produced by the studio, had won a great popularity, he said, adding that the children and other people in the country would be very glad to see it develop into a 100-part cartoon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to produce successful cartoons, it is important to pick out right seed and theme, deviating from repetition and formulism, and construct the plot in an interesting way, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He contended that it is necessary to reject in animation such tendency as amusing light and naturalism contrary to the Workers' Party of Korea's policy of literature and art and establish the political standard based on the view of Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Underlining the need to put the modernization, scientization, computerization and digitalization of the studio on a higher level, he took benevolent measures for it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's animation startles the world people for its originality, appeal, high level of depiction and rapid production speed, and its animators advanced into the world animation field from long ago, fully displaying the country's developed cartoon production technology with their distinguished skills, the supreme leader said, calling upon them to turn the DPRK into a leading animation producer of the world with high ambition.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accompanying him in the visit were Secretary Kim Ki Nam, First Vice Department Director Ri Jae Il and vice department directors Kim Yo Jong and Kim Ui Sun of the WPK Central Committee."

            "content": "Russian Figure Accuses U.S. of Abusing Human Rights for Attacking Other Countries\r\n Pyongyang, November 27 (KCNA) -- Posted on 4th Media, internet homepage of China, on November 20 was an article titled \"'Human Rights' as the Number One U.S. Weapon to Attack Any Nation Who Dares to Challenge Its Imperial Aggression\" by Alexander Vorontsov, head of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russia Academy of Sciences.\n\t\t\t\t\t The article said: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and its allies have added systematic attacks on North Korea's human-rights record to their traditional arsenal of tactics for exerting pressure on that country. These attacks have been launched before, but lately they have become more extensive than ever, and the \"human-rights offensive\" itself now looks like a carefully designed, long-term strategy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The first element in this strategy was the North Korean Human Rights Act passed by the U.S. Congress-yet another example of American lawmakers interfering in the internal affairs of another state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then a certain Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, based in the U.S., published its \"Report on Human Rights in North Korea\", which urges the UN Security Council to officially address this issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It also recommends that the UN General Assembly pass a corresponding resolution in order to convince the international community that North Korea is an \"evil regime with no place in the modern world\", a \"land of darkness, where there are no human rights,\" and that correspondingly punitive measures should be taken.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This truly seems like the run-up to an international punitive operation against the North Korean state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pyongyang, in turn, has made a number of strong statements in response to Washington's actions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An English-language statement (\"DPRK Will Mercilessly Shatter U.S. and Its Followers' 'Human Rights' Campaign\") issued by the North Korean National Defence Commission on Oct. 25, 2014, states in part:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"First, Now that the U.S. 'human rights' offensive against the DPRK has reached an extreme phase, the DPRK formally notifies the U.S. that the DPRK will settle accounts with those related to the offensive without the slightest clemency and by every possible means and methods generation after generation.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Second, Now that the U.S. anti-DPRK 'human rights' campaign is leading to a vicious plot to bring down the dignified social system in the DPRK, it declares its new tough counter-action of its own style to frustrate the campaign of the U.S. and its allied forces.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Third, The army and people of the DPRK call upon the world to thoroughly shatter the sinister cooperation for aggression sought by the U.S. and its followers under the pretext of the 'human rights issue' through anti-U.S. cooperation based on justice and truth.\" (From a statement by the North Korean National Defence Commission)\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Despite this deterioration in the state of affairs, Pyongyang has continued to seek out new approaches to starting a dialog with the South. And the northerners have once again shown their ability to do things in a novel way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The first such step, a surprise to most observers, was when a large delegation of North Korean athletes arrived at the international Asian Games in the South Korean city of Incheon (Sept. 19 - Oct. 4, 2014), where they gave an impressive performance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The North Korean competitors won 36 medals - 11 of them gold - and they set four world records. North Korea's women's soccer team took first place at the Asian Games.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the biggest bombshell was still to come. On Oct. 4, politicians and experts were stunned when North Korea's highest officials arrived in the South Korean city of Incheon for the closing ceremony of the international Asian Games.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This was more than just a ceremonial visit - it was an extraordinary mission, personally authorized by supreme leader Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Given the current situation, it would obviously be difficult to imagine a clearer sign of Pyongyang's willingness to resume a substantive inter-Korean dialog. The value of this gesture is even more obvious because shortly before the sensational appearance of the North Korean trio in Incheon, Seoul had proposed that high-level talks be resumed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That happened on Aug. 11, 2014, the day before scheduled U.S.-South Korean military maneuvers, but Seoul understood that the North's answer could only come after these maneuvers had ended.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"North Korean trio's quick spurt\" down South, while raising hopes, confronted Seoul with a number of issues, including, according to some observers, the question of a possible inter-Korean summit. Everyone who follows the twists and turns on the Korean Peninsula was waiting with bated breath to see if perhaps a serious positive shift, if not a breakthrough, would occur in inter-Korean relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Unfortunately, this initiative to bring the two Korean states closer together has run into resistance from those who are committed to old and unproductive political games.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The National Defence Commission of the DPRK felt compelled to remind Seoul that it would not be possible to hold the high-level meetings that had been scheduled for the end of October, 2014, in view of the fact that even on the eve of this important, and previously arranged meeting, balloons stuffed with anti- Pyongyang propaganda continued to be released from the South to be blown into the North.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is not a new problem. For several years now, beginning with the Lee Myung-bak administration in Seoul, the practice of \"firing\" propaganda balloons into North Korea has become a regular event. A few specific NGOs are behind this, and although not numerous, they are quite active and vociferous.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pyongyang's numerous protests and warnings to South Korea are ignored under the pretext that it is a democratic state, and a democracy cannot suppress the actions of nongovernmental organizations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the South Korean democracy seems indifferent to the rights of its own citizens living on the North Korean border (for example, in the South Korean city of Paju), where the local residents adamantly protest the actions of anti-North Korean groups that use their town as a launching pad for the balloons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What conclusions can be drawn from all this?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Until Washington turns away from a paradigm based on regime change in the DPRK as soon as possible and at any cost, the door leading toward an improved relationship between the two Koreas will quickly begin to close.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd yet it is the Koreans themselves who will have the last word in determining the fate of their divided people."
