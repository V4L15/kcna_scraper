            "content": "CPRK Urges S. Korean Authorities to Take Fundamental and Realistic Steps for National Reunification\r\nPyongyang, August 14 (KCNA) -- The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea released a statement on Thursday on the occasion of the 69th anniversary of Korea's reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Many years have passed and old generations have been replaced by new ones since the historic day of liberation of Korea but the complete independence and sovereignty of the country have not yet been achieved though the patriotic forerunners had longed so ardently by unhesitatingly devoting themselves to the sacred anti-Japanese war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As more than four decades of the Japanese imperialists' occupation of Korea have been followed by 70 years of the U.S. imperialists' presence in south Korea, the complete liberation of the nation and its sovereignty have not been achieved nationwide and the Koreans are undergoing unbearable pain and tragedy due to the protracted division of the nation forced by foreign forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the unanimous aspiration and desire of all fellow countrymen to achieve the independent reunification of the country at any cost despite any adversity and obstacle, the statement noted, urging the south Korean authorities as follows:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 1. U.S. domination and interference should be terminated on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialist aggressor forces present in south Korea should be withdrawn and the south Korean authorities should roll back their treacherous policy of depending on foreign forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We urge the south Korean authorities to break with the U.S. and join the sacred ranks of the nation and settle the issue of north-south relations and the reunification question by the concerted efforts of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean authorities truly want peace and detente on the Korean peninsula, they should come out against the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK, the root cause of straining the regional situation, and stop staging the anachronistic \"cooperation in putting pressure on the north\" in collusion with foreign forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 2. The south Korean authorities should take practical steps to implement the already agreed north-south agreements.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean authorities are truly interested in reunification and have the willingness to improve the inter-Korean relations, they should recognize and respect the already concluded north-south agreements and take practical measures for implementing them, not peddling anything frequently whenever the regime is replaced by another.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The humanitarian work, the rejoining of railways and roads and social cooperation called for by the south Korean authorities will be satisfactorily settled if the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration are implemented as they are reflected in those declarations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should show before all fellow countrymen their sincere will to improve the relations with the DPRK through their practical actions, not talking only.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 3. It is necessary to take realistic steps to put an end to the hostile acts between the north and the south and pull down the barriers lying in the way of reconciliation, unity and reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the firm determination and will of the DPRK to boldly terminate harmful hostile acts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For the present, the projected north-targeted Ulji Freedom Guardian war drills should be cancelled unconditionally as they will push the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of a war and increase the danger of a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should remove as soon as possible unreasonable institutional mechanisms blocking the contact, visits, cooperation and exchange between the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should take a substantial measure to pull down the concrete wall, a product of the Cold War and the confrontation with fellow countrymen, before talking about \"confidence\" and \"a peace park\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should join all the fellow countrymen in the nationwide march to greet with splendor the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Korea as a grand festival of national reunification to be specially recorded in the history of the nation in hearty response to the offer of the DPRK."

Las autoridades surcoreanas deben tomar las medidas practicas para implementar los acuerdos Norte-Sur ya logrados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi ellas estan interesadas de verdad en la reunificacion y el mejoramiento de las relaciones intercoreanas, deben reconocer y respetar los acuerdos Norte-Sur ya logrados, en lugar de plantear cosas nuevas cada vez que cambia el \"poder\", y tomar las medidas practicas para ejecutarlos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa labor humanitaria, la union de ferrocarriles y carreteras y los proyectos de cooperacion social, en que insisten ellas, son asuntos reflejados ya en la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio y la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre y por eso, seran resueltos plenamente una vez implementados esos documentos intercoreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas deben demostrar a toda la nacion coreana no con palabras sino con acciones la voluntad sincera de mejorar las relaciones intercoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Hay que parar los actos hostiles entre ambas partes coreanas y tomar las medidas reales para eliminar las barreras que impiden la reconciliacion, la unidad y la reunificacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAcabar valientemente con los inutiles actos hostiles es la firme decision y voluntad de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor ahora, se debe suspender incondicionalmente los ejercicios de guerra anti-RPDC Ulji Freedom Guardian que llevan al umbral de guerra la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana y aumentan el peligro de guerra nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas deben cancelar de inmediato los injustos aparatos institucionales que frenan el contacto, el viaje reciproco, la cooperacion y el intercambio entre ambas partes coreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEllas deben tomar la medida sustancial de desmantelar el muro de hormigon, producto de guerra fria y confrontacion fratricida, antes de hablar de la \"fe\" y el \"parque de paz\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl aceptar la propuesta de la RPDC, ellas deberan incorporarse a la marcha gigantesca de toda la nacion deseosa de celebrar el 70o aniversario de liberacion de la patria como gran festival por la reunificacion de la patria que se registre en letras mayusculas en la historia nacional."

Anteriormente, ya se habia decretado el estado de alerta conjunta en las unidades terrestres, maritimas y aereas del ejercito titere surcoreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos oficiales y soldados del Frente Sudoeste del EPC conocen de sobra la sucia intencion de los gangsteres militares surcoreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon el mencionado acto provocador, esos ultimos tratan de distraer la atencion de la opinion publica centrada ahora en el \"incidente de asesinato a un soldado bisono de apellido Yun\", producto de la vulnerabilidad del ejercito surcoreano, carne de canon para la guerra de agresion de EE.UU., y de la corrupta sociedad surcoreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEllos se encuentran ahora en una situacion tan miserable debido a ese incidente, comparado como \"el hundimiento del ferry Sewol sucedido en el circulo militar\", y a los sucesivos casos de indisciplina y escandalos en las filas del ejercito.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIgualmente pretenden inducir con la imprudente provocacion de canonazos en las aguas mas cadentes la contramedida autodefensiva del EPC con el fin de preparar un pretexto del desarrollo de los agresivos ejercicios militares conjuntos Ulji Freedom Guardian.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa situacion dada va a romper hasta la ultima cuerda tensa de la paciencia de los oficiales y soldados del Frente Sudoeste del EPC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCastigar despiadadamente las islas Paekryong, Yonphyong, Taechong, etc. en que estan escondidos los gangsteres de la capa militar titere para tomar las aguas cadentes del Mar Oeste como punto de combustion de la provocacion belica y sepultar en lo profundo del mar los barcos piratas que frecuentan la intrusion en nuestras aguas territoriales sagradas, esto es la incontenible voluntad de represalia de los oficiales y soldados del Frente Sudoeste del EPC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPrecisamente en estas aguas los enemigos libran con frenesi y frecuencia disparos y canonazos, arrastraron a nuestros pesqueros para cometer la barbaridad bestial contra ellos y suelen cometer el acto de intrusion en las aguas territoriales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo deben olvidar que nuestros canones, apuntando los nidos principales de provocacion, esperan el momento de castigarlos sin piedad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs invariable la voluntad de represalia de los oficiales y soldados del Frente Sudoeste del EPC de convertir los imprudentes canonazos de los provocadores en la salva en honor de difunto que anuncia la muerte final.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos titeres surcoreanos no deben juzgar erroneamente la paciencia de los oficiales y soldados del Frente Sudoeste del EPC."
