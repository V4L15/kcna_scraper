He said that now that a reinvestigation has been launched by \"prosecution\", public distrust and suspicion will be resolved.\r\n   In a commentary the daily says his remarks are a shameless rigmarole deceiving and insulting the south Korean people strongly urging a thorough investigation into the incident and punishment of the chief culprits.\r\n   It notes:\r\n   The puppet prosecution, bowing to public pressure, has begun another round of investigation into the Hanbo loan scandal, but only to hush up irregularities of Kim Young Sam and his son, Kim Hyon Chol.\r\n   The \"special parliamentary committee for inspection of administration\", which was allegedly formed to settle the Hanbo incident, is nothing but a marionette manipulated by the Kims.\r\n   Now the Kim Young Sam group are crying for \"probing the truth\" and \"punishing those responsible for the incident\", while lobbying opposition parties' help in attaining their purpose. They have decided with clandestines of opposition parties to radically decrease the number of witnesses and references to be summoned to a \"parliamentary interpellation session over the Hanbo incident\". They also plan to finish in a single day Kim Hyon Chol's presence at the session. In a word, they want to gloss over the loan scandal by lobbying opposition parties' help, whiling away the time and diverting public attention elsewhere, as they did in the recent reamendment to the \"labour law\". \r\n\r\n"

Charter is being put on the order of the day again at the United Nations.\r\n   In this connection, Rodong Sinmun today comes out with a signed commentary entitled \"Japan cannot shake off 'enemy state' brand\".  The analyst of the paper says:\r\n   In the U.N. Charter, Japan is branded as an \"enemy state\". This  is a due punishment for the aggressive and unethical acts committed by Japan in the past.\r\n   This article will not be outmoded as long as Japan refuses to atone for its past crimes and give assurances that it will not follow in the footsteps of aggression again.\r\n   Japan has implemented none of its obligations as an \"enemy state\". Even today, 50 years after the Japanese imperialists were defeated in the war, the Japanese authorities are justifying and beautifying their past crimes, refusing to break with their militaristic past.\r\n   If Japan is stripped of the \"enemy state\" brand, it will mean encouraging the wild design of the Japanese militarist forces for overseas expansion and giving tacit approval to their moves to become a military power. This will result in creating a source of threats to peace and security of humankind.\r\n   We are opposed to relieving Japan of the \"enemy state\" brand not merely because we have anti-Japanese feelings and resentment but because we feel our responsibility for international justice, the peace and security of the world and aspirations of humankind. \r\n   Of course, we consider it reasonable and necessary to free from the \"enemy state\" brand those countries which have liquidated their past and won confidence from other nations even if they had committed crimes in the past.\r\n   Proceeding from this stand, we hold that the \"enemy state\"-related article must not be crossed out in the U.N. Charter but the charter must be amended so that such a country as Japan, which refuses to liquidate its past, can never clear itself of the \"enemy state\" brand.\r\n   Neither money nor the level of economic development nor financial contributions to the international body can affect this matter. \r\n   Japan cannot wipe off the \"enemy state\"  brand as long as it refuses to liquidate its past. \r\n\r\n"

It is also an inspiring banner of struggle and solidarity that has given a telling blow to the separatists at home and abroad and aroused a greater worldwide support to the Korean people's cause of reunification, he added.\r\n   He said Secretary Kim Jong Il defined the 10-point programme as one of the three mainstays for national reunification, which the Korean nation should adhere to invariably in any case along with the three principles of national reunification--independence, peace and great national unity-- and the proposal for founding a Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo.
