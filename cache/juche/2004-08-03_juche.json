This is the era of independent reunification as they are set to settle the issue of reunification of the country by their concerted efforts, responsible for it.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans should devote their patriotic enthusiasm to the efforts to glorify the era of independent reunification, feeling proud of the fact that the history of confrontation between the north and south of Korea is being replaced by that of reunification and the process of reconciliation is making progress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The most urgent task facing the Korean nation in its efforts to successfully fulfill its responsibility and duty as a driving force in the era of independent reunification is to conduct a vigorous anti-U.S., anti-war struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After listing the DPRK as \"part of an axis of evil\" and a target of its nuclear preemptive attack the U.S. warmongers have massively amassed armed forces of aggression in and around south Korea under the pretext of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. and ceaselessly staged large-scale war exercises under the simulated conditions of a real war against the DPRK, threatening the destiny of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the Koreans to emerge victorious in the struggle against U.S. and war, all of them should overcome difficulties with transparent spirit of national independence and strong awareness that they should in any case defend the peace of the country and the security of the nation in a responsible manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the most fundamental position and stand the era of independent reunification requires all the Koreans responsible for it to have. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans in the north and the south and overseas should turn out as one to achieve national cooperation and build in practice the structure of the Korean nation's confrontation with the U.S. on the Korean peninsula, well aware that only the might of the nation united under the banner of national independence serves as powerful weapon capable of frustrating the U.S. criminal moves to launch a war of aggression against the DPRK, defending national sovereignty and peace and protecting the era of independent reunification. \r\n The article calls for firmly preserving the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and speeding up the work to implement it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north and the south and overseas should turn out as one in the struggle to glorify the era of independent reunification, the era which promises reunification and prosperity of the country, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
