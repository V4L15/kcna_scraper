            "content": "Trite phrase of \"threat\"  = KCNA commentary =\r\nPyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- The U.S. Defense Department in its recently-published annual defense report said that the DPRK is an \"unpredictable threat,\" according to a report.\r\n   The \"threat\" comes because the DPRK has deployed offensive military forces in forward areas and possessed biological and chemical weapons and means of their delivery and because Seoul is located near the demilitarized zone, the report analyses.\r\n   It is the height of shame of the United States, styling itself the only superpower in the world, to brand a sovereign state in Asia as a factor of threat and try to justify its argument.\r\n   What it seeks in its repeated advertisement about \"threat\" is not \"peace.\"\r\n   Historically, Korea has not posed any threat to its neighbouring nations. Moreover, it has never threatened the United States across the ocean.\r\n   The Korean war and the tense relations existing between the north and the south are wholly ascribable to the U.S. troops' occupation of South Korea.\r\n   The problem in stability in the Asia-Pacific region is related to the U.S. military bases in Japan and other countries in this region.\r\n   In the annual defence report, the United States argued again that the presence and deployment of 100,000-strong U.S. Forces in East Asia and the pacific basin are needed. \r\n   It openly declared that it would continue to stage bilateral and multilateral war games with the South Korean puppets, Japan and some countries. \r\n   Their assertion reminds one of a thief crying \"stop thief \"\r\n   The United States also described as \"unpredictable threat\" the self-defensive military strength of the DPRK and the geopolitical condition of the Korean peninsula caused by the military demarcation line drawn by it. \r\n   The phrase can convince no one because it is a foolish sophism aimed at disarming and stifling the DPRK militarily.\r\n   The Korean people have never begged the United States to defend their security, and the Asian people also have not left peace and security of Asia to its mercy.\r\n   The United States must abandon its ambition for world supremacy and stop interfering in the internal affairs of Korea and other Asian nations and withdraw its troops.\r\n   If there exist unpredictable threats in East Asia and the Pacific region, they are none other than the U.S. hegemonistic policy and its offspring, the U.S. military  presence and occupation policy.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

On the contrary, it will add to the indignation and resentment of workers at the puppets and instigate the workers to resistance.\r\n   The people will make the double-faced fascists pay dearly.    \r\n\r\n"
