For its geographical location, sea-birds flock in there all the year round. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn spring over 20  species of Asian indigenous birds under international protection including black-faced spoonbill, yellow-beaked white heron, red-cheek cormorant, herring gull, heron and so on fly to the islet. Their breeding period extends from the end of April to mid-August. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRed-cheek cormorant breeds from early May to mid-June. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Black-faced spoonbills, gathering in pairs early in May, build their nests by mending old ones on the rocks over 60 m high. Two or four eggs are laid in the nest in mid-May and it takes 35 to 37 days to breed. After staying some 40 days there, adults and younglings spend a few months over the surrounding tideland in a family group, and then gradually migrate to far-off places. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Yellow-beaked white heron hatches 2 to 3 or 4 to 5 eggs in mid-May. Those birds which fail to breed, exposed to strong wind, or when their nests are destroyed by crow and magpie, rebuild nests in other places and hatch 2 to 3 eggs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn  such nests younglings are to be found even in mid-August. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At the end of August, when breeding is over, almost all birds move in groups to tidelands, rice fields, seashore and lower reaches of the river to seek for food, and then leave the islet in the middle of September, except some birds including black-tailed seagull.    This islet, favourable for the colony of black-faced spoonbill and yellow-beaked white heron, is now under the government protection as a living monument. \r\n\r\n"
