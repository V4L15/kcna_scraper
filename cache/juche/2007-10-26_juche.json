The proposed new law differs from the present law in that it restricts the SDF's search and support to disaster-stricken people, confines its activities to oil and water supply to warships of other countries and limits the period of the proposed law to one year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Democratic Party, too, is opposed to extension of the \"law on special measures against terrorism\" but stands for the SDF's overseas military operations its own way. This party seeks to expand overseas military operations by letting the SDF join the \"international security forces\" created according to a resolution of the UN Security Council in December 2001, not favoring the SDF's dispatch overseas in line with the above-said law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' loudmouthed \"Japan's contribution to peace\" is, in essence, a slogan for overseas aggression and for a war to conquer the world. They are working hard to let the SDF conduct overseas military operations for aggression unhindered under the pretext of \"contribution to global peace.\" Lurking behind this call is their sinister intention to launch reinvasion. The materialization of this intention would put global peace and security at greater peril. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarists' moves for reinvasion are inching close to a danger line.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Today all the Koreans stake their destiny on this idea, enshrining the truth that they will win when united and suffer a defeat when dispersed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n How ardently one loves the nation shows what strong patriotic will one has to free the nation from misfortune and sufferings.
