            "content": "Minju Joson refuta criticas de Lee Myung Bak a justa medida de RPDC\r\nPyongyang, 4 de diciembre (ATCC) -- Como ya avisado a la parte surcoreana, la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea puso en vigor a partir del primero de diciembre su importante medida de restringir y bloquear rigurosamente todo el transito terrestre por via de la Linea de Demarcacion Militar. \n\t\t\t\t\tAhora, la banda de Lee Myung Bak del Sur de Corea censura esta justa medida como \"chantaje rutinario\" y \"estrategia de resistencia porfiada\" partiendo de su malsana intencion de imputar a la RPDC la responsabilidad del empeoramiento de las relaciones intercoreanas que corren el riesgo de ruptura total. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSenala asi el periodico Minju Joson en un comentario individual publicado este jueves y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas artimanas de toda indole de la horda de Lee nunca podran liberarla de la responsabilidad por la ruptura de las relaciones Norte-Sur. Al contrario, ellas irritan mucho al ejercito y al pueblo de la RPDC porque significan intolerable desafio a esta que se esfuerza por evitar la ruptura total de las relaciones intercoreanas y lograr la reunificacion independiente, la paz y la prosperidad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras existe esa banda de traidores, no se puede esperar la mejora de las relaciones intercoreanas ni la paz ni la reunificacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuanto mas desesperados fueran los esfuerzos de los titeres surcoreanos por eludir su responsabilidad, tanto mas se agrandaran sus crimenes y el castigo nacional al respecto. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda de Lee debe reconocer, antes de que se haga tarde, esa responsabilidad, pedir disculpas a la nacion coreana y renunciar su \"politica sobre el Norte\" de caracter fratricida."
