            "content": "Moves to Perpetuate U.S. Forces' Presence in S. Korea under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, August 7 (KCNA) -- The U.S. and the south Korean military authorities agreed to stipulate the continued presence of the U.S. aggressor forces in south Korea in the so-called \"alliance blueprint\" to be produced by the 38th south Korea-U.S. \"annual security consultative meeting\" slated to take place in upcoming October.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday observes in a signed commentary carried in this regard: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis is little short of a declaration of a war against the DPRK as it is aimed at straining the situation on the Korean Peninsula in a bid to justify the presence of the U.S. forces in south Korea and invade the north and, at the same time, a blatant challenge to the Koreans advancing along the road of independent reunification in the idea of \"By our nation itself.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK cannot but take a serious note of the fact that the U.S. and the south Korean authorities openly revealed their criminal design to perpetuate the presence of the U.S. aggressor forces in south Korea and swallow up the whole of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These forces are neither \"deterrence\" nor a \"protector\" of anybody. The U.S. intention to keep its forces in south Korea even after the reunification of the Korean Peninsula proves that it is set to block the reunification of the peninsula and sacrifice the Korean nation for carrying out its strategy to dominate Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Begging for the permanent presence of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces in south Korea is as servile and mean traitorous an act as selling off the dignity and interests of the nation to the outside forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities have not yet come to themselves though they have suffered all sorts of humiliation for more than six decades, their sovereignty violated by the U.S. imperialists. That is why they are still perpetrating such crimes against the nation as allowing the U.S. forces to stay in south Korea for an indefinite period to serve those aggressor forces even in this June 15 era of independent reunification. They should bear in mind that such servile behavior is nothing but an act of treachery bringing the disaster of a nuclear war to the nation and a foolish act of digging their own graves.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nStrong national self-esteem serves as a powerful mental weapon to be tightly held by the compatriots in the anti-U.S., anti-war struggle, a life-and-death struggle with the aggressors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a proud tradition and one of the characteristic features of the Koreans to ardently love the country and the nation and set store by its dignity more than anything else. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said self-esteem represents the faith and grit based on the conviction of the Korean nation's advantages and might. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Koreans will display their inexhaustible strength when they struggle confident of the justice and certain victory of the anti-U.S., anti-war struggle and full of faith and optimism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans have lived, separated in the north and the south, due to the territorial partition imposed upon them by foreign forces. Yet their spirit of fighting against aggression and defending the country is still alive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is demonstrating its might as an invincible nation under the patriotic banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation has armed forces strong enough to defeat any formidable enemy in the world. No force can match the DPRK's invincible forces, the tremendous deterrent for self-defence which the Korean people have built up under the uplifted banner of Songun with a will not to allow any aggressors to infringe upon the dignity and sovereignty of the nation in the least. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's Songun politics and invincible deterrence for self-defence serve as a source of strength encouraging the Koreans to confidently advance with national self-esteem along the road of the anti-U.S., anti-war struggle.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
