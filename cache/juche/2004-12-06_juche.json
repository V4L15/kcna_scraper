These principles include the issue of firmly abiding by the principle of state planned economic management and strictly observing it, the issue of increasing the responsibility and role of the Cabinet and the issue of letting lower units fully display their initiative, while fully ensuring state centralized and unified guidance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The wise guidance of Kim Jong Il also finds its expression in that he made sure that profitability was fully ensured in the socialist economic management as required by the Songun era and all the problems arising in economic management were solved our own way.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The stalemate was attributable to the fact that the present U.S. administration destroyed the groundwork of the talks, reneging on the agreement reached at the third round of the talks, and ,furthermore, has become extremely undisguised in its hostile acts to bring down our system, completely disregarding the DPRK, its dialogue partner and the main party concerned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There should be necessary conditions and environment for the resumption of the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is essential for this is for the U.S. to drop its hostile policy aimed at bringing down the system in the DPRK, its dialogue partner, and express its willingness to co-exist with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is our consistent stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our analysis of the results of the contact in New York prompts us to judge that the U.S. side showed no willingness to change its policy toward us and intends to use the six-party talks as a leverage for forcing us to dismantle all our nuclear programs including the nuclear development for a peaceful purpose first. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The six-party talks are not meant for maintaining their form but will carry real significance only when the talks produce substantial results.\r\n Under this situation it is clear that the six-party talks will not produce any results.\r\n We are not impatient as regards the issue of the resumption of the talks nor would we like to make a hasty final conclusion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the second Bush administration has not yet emerged, we would like to wait a bit longer to follow with patience what a policy it will shape. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It will be good if the U.S. accepts our demand for a switchover in its Korea policy. If not, that will do, either. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. will be grossly mistaken if it thinks we entertain any expectation for its new administration to be formed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will keep to the road chosen by us on our principle and take a corresponding measure.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Blasts U.S. Argument for \"Establishment of Peace Mechanism after Settlement of Nuclear Issue\"\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 4 (KCNA) -- The United States has recently egged some media to spread misinformation that Washington's assertion of the \"establishment of peace mechanism after the settlement of the nuclear issue\" stands to reason and give impression that it is interested in the settlement of the Korean Peninsula issue.\r\n Lurking behind its assertion is a sinister aim of the Bush administration to bring the system of the DPRK to collapse which would automatically lead to the dismantlement of its nuclear program. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. referred to the argument for the \"establishment of peace mechanism after the settlement of the nuclear issue\" at previous rounds of the six-party talks, but it was not exposed to media at that time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, a Japanese newspaper mentioned the issue for the first time only to make it clear that the U.S. has deliberately worked to build up public opinion as regards the \"establishment of peace mechanism after the settlement of the nuclear issue\" and what is its aim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The participants in the six-party talks manifested their stands that the issue of establishing peace mechanism should be solved in the process of settling the nuclear issue.  Under this condition, in case the armistice state turns into a peace mechanism, the U.S. cannot but recognize the political system of the DPRK and make a switchover in its policy in the direction of co-existing with the DPRK in peace. If such things happen it would be impossible for the U.S. to attain its aim to realize a regime change in the DPRK which would automatically lead to the dismantlement of its nuclear program. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That is why the U.S. felt an urgent need to verify the validity of the argument for the \"establishment of peace mechanism after the settlement of the nuclear issue.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the U.S. seeks a regime change in the DPRK and abandonment of its nuclear program, the Bush administration's assertion of the \"establishment of peace mechanism after the settlement of the nuclear issue\" substantially betrays its true intention not to discuss the issue of establishing the mechanism with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of establishing peace mechanism stands out as a pending issue for the solution of the Korean Peninsula issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The establishment of peace mechanism was envisaged in the Korean Armistice Agreement and a UN resolution supporting it was adopted in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is essential to replace the armistice mechanism by peace mechanism in order to improve the present situation prevailing in the Korean Peninsula, to remove the acute military standoff in particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The establishment of peace mechanism conforms with the interests of those countries around Korea, to say nothing of the north and the south of Korea, which the U.S. is not negating. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only through the establishment of peace mechanism is it possible to create atmosphere favorable for the peaceful co-existence of the DPRK and the U.S. and the accomplishment of the cause of Korea's reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A peace agreement to be reached between the DPRK and the U.S. may include a comprehensive solution to the political and military issues between the DPRK and the U.S. and between the north and the south of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The conclusion of a peace agreement would completely clear all parties concerned of concern about security and this will naturally lead to the settlement of the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The establishment of peace mechanism, therefore, is not a quid pro quo to someone and this can be solved without any loss of honor if parties concerned have willingness to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. assertion that the issue of establishing peace mechanism is an issue to be discussed only after settlement of the nuclear issue reveals its black-hearted intention to avoid its solution as it is an illogical assertion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. avoids the establishment of peace mechanism because it still resorts to its Korea strategy to maintain the relations of confrontation with the DPRK and keep the tense situation and thus fish in the troubled waters, and because it judges that the establishment of the mechanism would be unfavorable for Northeast Asia strategy aimed to contain China and Russia with security alliance with Japan and south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should come out to replace the unstable state of ceasefire with a durable peace mechanism from a stand to co-exist with the DPRK if the bilateral nuclear issue and other security issues are to be fairly solved.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But we cannot but scoff at the newspaper for telling threadbare stories about the Korean issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Early this year, too, U.S. officials busied themselves with staging a Congressional hearing with \"north Korean defectors\" attending and the like in a bid to support their absurd assertion that \"north Korea conducted a chemical weapon test on prisoners.\" Timed to coincide with this, media of the U.S. and other Western countries made much ado about this \"test,\" a fabrication made by renegades and defectors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the U.S. suffered bitter shame before the international community when those who were involved in the false propaganda disclosed at a press conference the truth about how the false documents had been written. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We would like to make it clear once again that the fiction about the above-said test hyped by the U.S. again is part of its malicious psychological operation to defame the dignified DPRK's international authority and force it to change its regime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has left no means untried to stifle the DPRK, seized with inveterate bitterness towards its system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The smear campaign launched by the U.S. against the DPRK on the basis of the fiction about the above-said test is nothing new to us as it cooked up a whole string of lies including misinformation about \"nuclear development, human rights issue and drug trafficking.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is that the U.S. is digging up somebody's \"problems,\" pretending to be unblemished and poking its nose into this or that matter, though it is beset with a lot of problems at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. failed to make the world understand all its crimes such as indiscriminate killing of innocent civilians and abuse of prisoners in Iraq and so on. Its behavior only proved that it is the worst violator of human rights in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already reported, the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by U.S. troops in Iraq put the U.S. into a tight fix and largely sapped its political clout as it was little short of medieval barbarism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is by no means fortuitous that news analysts of different countries commented that the adverse impact the U.S. abuse of prisoners had on it was little short of what the September 11 had on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent U.S. diatribe was prompted by its deliberate attempt to deliver it out of its embarrassing situation and divert the world attention elsewhere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By charging the legitimate sovereign state with the horrible test unimaginable in the 21st century, the U.S. seeks to impair the image of the DPRK and cover up its monstrous crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. renewed smear campaign against the DPRK, a sovereign state, is only heightening its vigilance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"The Washington Post\" would be well advised to come to its senses as it spread sheer misinformation about the fictitious cases without any consideration.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
