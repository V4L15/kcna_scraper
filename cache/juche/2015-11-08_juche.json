Half a year has passed since then but south Korea still has been affected by it. The key contents of the new \"guidelines\" is that Japan's \"Self-Defense Forces\" could stage military operation as they please on the Korean Peninsula in disregard of south Korea under the pretext of the military cooperation with the U.S. forces both in case of contingency and in peace time, pursuant to the U.S. strategy for launching a war of aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In a word, the Japanese reactionaries are trying to officially join a war of aggression on Korea and for world domination at the tacit connivance of the U.S., after getting rid of the restraint of a criminal state. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the south Korean ruling quarters are inviting derision and denunciation from the public at home and abroad for actively supporting their American and Japanese masters while crying out for the \"respect of sovereignty.\" Their cooperation with outsiders against the north and their blind pursuance of the U.S. and Japan will bring them humiliation and disgrace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how often they may stage smear campaign with outsiders to isolate and stifle the DPRK, they would face curse and criticism by the nation and disgrace in the international eyes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities had better be mindful that cooperation with foreign forces would lead them to shameful destruction."
