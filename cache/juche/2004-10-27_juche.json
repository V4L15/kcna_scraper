They are setting in motion media persons and means, spending a fabulous amount of funds for a psychological warfare to infuse their views on ideological and cultural value into other peoples. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To use information means for a psychological war and as a leverage for ideological and cultural poisoning, whether it is large or small in its scale, runs counter to the efforts to build a fair international information order wanted by the world. The UN member nations should make deserved efforts to make information activities serve the purpose of promoting understanding, friendship and cooperation among countries and nations and ensuring a peaceful and stable life and the sustainable development of human being. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If information is to fairly serve whole humankind, it is necessary to narrow down the gap between the developed countries and developing countries in IT and strengthen international cooperation in the efforts to increase the information capacity of developing countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK appreciates the efforts made by the UN Department of Public Information to increase the national information capacity of developing countries as evidenced by a recent international information workshop organized for countries in Northeast Asia and expects that it will continue to make such efforts.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Also present was a delegation of the Korean Committee for Solidarity with the World People. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The participants first looked around photos showing the brutal atrocities committed by the U. S. imperialist aggressors during the period of the last Korean war and then formed an international joint judicial body, an international joint prosecution team and a jury panel to operate the international tribunal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chief judge Alvaro Ramirez Gonzalez, chairman of the Democratic Lawyers Association of Nicaragua for Supporting Korea's Reunification, spoke of the operation of the tribunal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tribunal was organized for the purpose of investigating and examining the U.S. crimes during the Korean war and all other crimes against the Korean people after the war and confirming criminality on the basis of which judgment pertinent to the U.S. government, he said, adding that the tribunal will hear an indictment of a prosecutor, verify the prosecuted fact and judge its criminality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the tribunal the chairman of the Costa Rican Committee for Supporting Korea's Reunification who is a senior prosecutor brought a legal action against the U.S. crimes during the Korean war on behalf of the prosecution team and gave a testimony by video show. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tribunal was addressed by Eric Sirotkin, member of the National Lawyers Guild of the United States, and others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They said that the U. S. should apologize to the DPRK for the provocation of the Korean war and the crimes of the U.S. troops during the war and immediately stop its adventurous moves to ignite another war in Korea  When the U. S. honestly apologizes in the name of the state for all the war crimes and fully compensate, they said, the relations between the two countries may be normal on the basis of trust. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since the Korean people declared all over the world that through the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration they pool their efforts with national cooperation to achieve national reunification, there is no justification for the U.S. to keep its aggression troops in south Korea, they noted, stressing that the U.S. military occupation of south Korea should be terminated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The chief judge read out a written judgment of the Lima International Tribunal on the U.S. crimes during the Korean war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Resumption of Six-Party Talks Entirely Depends on U.S. Attitude \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 26 (KCNA) -- U.S. Secretary of State Powell was reported to have asserted at a press conference held during his visit to Japan on Oct. 24 that there is no change in the U.S. intention to participate in the multi-lateral talks to settle the nuclear crisis of north Korea and the U.S. will never yield to the negotiating strategy of north Korea which waits for the returns of the presidential election.\r\n Earlier, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Armitage let loose a string of balderdash that north Korea seems not to have any concern for opening the six-party talks before the U.S. presidential election, saying the U.S. was ready to hold the six-party talks in the near future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Mandarins of the U.S. State Department vied with one another to assert that the next round of the six-party talks failed to open due to the \"delaying tactics\" of the DPRK watching for the outcome of the U.S. presidential election. This is nothing but a foolish attempt to shift the blame for the stalemate of the talks on to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has already been widely known to the world that the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula was caused by the U.S. and the groundwork of the six-party talks was destroyed by the Bush administration and the talks have not yet been resumed due to the outbreak of the nuclear issue in south Korea, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Explicitly speaking, it is the DPRK that is responsible for the six-party talks as they were initiated and materialized by it to seek a negotiated peaceful solution to the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration is, however, describing the talks as its merit. But the last three rounds of the talks would be unthinkable without the DPRK's sincere attitude and stand toward the negotiated peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue. \r\n The DPRK has made every possible effort to settle the nuclear issue at the talks with utmost flexibility and magnanimity. But the U.S. side came out to the talks from a wrong stand that dialogue is possible but negotiation is impossible. It only read out the scripts written by the White House, deliberately scuttling the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This being a hard fact, it is preposterous for the U.S. to try to lay the blame for the delayed talks at the DPRK's door. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's stand on the six-party talks is quite clear. It approaches them in the state interests and will participate in them if they prove helpful to the solution of the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is grossly mistaken if it thinks the DPRK will respond to the talks under the pressure of others though the DPRK knows well the talks would not be of any help to the settlement of the nuclear issue as the DPRK has strictly adhered to the independent stand in settling all the matters for decades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is clear to everyone that it is impossible to open the talks now that the U.S. is becoming evermore undisguised in its hostile policy toward the DPRK while totally denying its dialogue partner and pressurizing it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula has become a topic of the debate during the election campaign and there is a hot argument about who is to blame for the delay of the six-party talks with the presidential election fast approaching. Under this situation the Bush administration is employing a sleight of hand to mislead the public opinion at home and abroad and garner support from more electors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK would like to question the U.S. whether it has rebuilt the groundwork of the talks as demanded by the DPRK, the talks for which Washington pretends to be so much concerned, whether it is ready to roll back its hostile policy towards the DPRK and participate in \"reward for freeze\", the first-phase step of the package proposal based on the principle of simultaneous actions and discuss the nuclear issue of south Korea for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The resumption of the six-party talks entirely depends on the U.S. attitude.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea's Nuclear Case under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 26 (KCNA) -- The south Korean authorities are getting frantic in their moves for nuclear weaponization to destroy their fellow countrymen while paying lip-service to \"reconciliation\" and \"cooperation.\"\r\nThis is a negation of the era of independent national reunification after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration and an intolerable challenge to the DPRK. Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was disclosed once again by a memorandum recently issued by the National Reunification Institute that the U.S. imperialists were backstage manipulators of the south Korean authorities' treacherous and anti-reunification moves to develop nuclear weapons, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the U.S. has done lording it over south Korea for the past nearly 60 years is nothing but criminal moves to invade the DPRK and exterminate the Korean nation. The U.S. is now employing all sorts of gimmick to cover up the sinister aim sought by it in encouraging, defending and conniving at south Korea's moves for nuclear weaponization. Sometimes its senior officials made appearance in a bid to hush up the controversial case of secret nuclear experiments. Sometimes it set its servant IAEA in motion to do something for the same purpose. The U.S. imperialists are the sworn enemy of the Koreans as they have worked hard to bring a nuclear disaster to the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No one can vouch that a nuclear mushroom would not rise on Korea because the U.S. imperialists keep pursuing their policy of military presence in south Korea and pro-U.S. flunkeyists are still at large. It is clear that both the north and the south will suffer from the nuclear calamity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should disclose the truth behind the experiments and totally nullify the nuclear weapons development program, pondering over the consequences to be entailed by their nuclear weapons development program.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently the south Korean authorities decided to increase the defence budget for the next year by 9.9 percent over this year's. In this regard the south Korean Ministry of National Defence did not hide its intention to accelerate arms race from next year, asserting \"that was a move to bring under control the unfavorable situation\" to be created by the \"reduction\" of the U.S. forces in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This arms race and arms build-up accelerated in south Korea in real earnest are intolerable as they escalate the tensions on the Korean Peninsula and bring the inter-Korean relations back to military confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their arms build-up assumes grave nature as they mean a criminal involvement in the anti-DPRK war moves of the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U. S. imperialists decided to spend more than a ten billion of U.S. dollars for bolstering the U.S. forces in south Korea under the pretext of \"arms reduction\" and their relocation and are putting the decision into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities' talk about \"vacuum\" is nothing but sophism intended to introduce more military hardware into south Korea keeping pace with the arms buildup of the United States to kill Koreans. Even the U.S. military authorities admitted that \"war deterrent\" would grow stronger in quality on the Korean Peninsula even in case of reduction of U.S. forces in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is the fact that the south Korean authorities have pushed forward in top secret the nuclear weapons development in a premeditated manner while echoing their master's hue and cry over the \"nuclear issue of the north\" in a bid to mislead the public opinion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This arms build-up is a blatant perfidy to the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration as it is pushing the inter-Korean relations to a serious phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should clarify their stand on the joint declaration and the inter-Korean relations before the fellow countrymen, urges the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The fodder is made by fermenting green grass with bacteria extracted from animal paunch.\r\n The method makes it possible to fully ensure winter fodder, one of the problems raised in the breeding of domestic animals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The bacteria produce not only vitamin but also an organic acid which sterilizes fodder. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When silage is pickled with bacteria, nutritive elements needed for the growth of animals are made in fodder. The organic acid prevents other miscellaneous germs from infiltrating into fodder and keeps it fresh. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Wastes of autumn vegetables, cultivated plants such as pigweed and all wild plants except poisonous ones can be used as raw materials of fodder. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The result of its application in various farms shows that the fermented green grass fodder can be kept fresh by the next summer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When a goat is fed with the fodder, it is 18.4, 20 and 13 percent higher than other goats in weight, growth and milk production respectively. Its application to ostrich decreases the death rate 20 percent and feed consumption 15 percent.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The indictment said:\r\n The U.S. committed unethical and brutal crimes against the Korean people in the last Korean war in violation of the UN Charter and the publicly recognized norms of international law. Though it was declared guilty at two hearings of the international tribunal, the U.S. has not yet fulfilled its state responsibility and international legal commitment as an assailant. The joint international prosecution team branded this as a double crime against the victim and prosecuted the U.S. for these crimes at the international tribunal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It indicted as war criminals (the accused) those chiefly responsible for working out the plan for the Korean war, making preparations for it, launching and executing it, those who brutally tortured and killed Koreans, actively following the U.S. war policy, those who ordered to savagely destroy Korean national treasures and those who executed it, successive U.S. presidents and other officials who defended such crimes and wrecked peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and evaded the responsibility under international law, holding responsible posts of the U.S. administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The indictment disclosed criminal acts and nature of the U.S. which wantonly violated the publicly recognized norms and practice in war during the Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the three-year long war, the flying corps of the U.S. air force made at least 800,000 sorties and planes of the U.S. marines and navy over 250,000 sorties. 85 per cent of these sorties were to bomb and strafe the peaceful objects. Nearly 600,000 tons of napalm and other bombs were used against civilians. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The brutal indiscriminate air raids of the U.S. forces destroyed at least 8,700 buildings of factories, works and other productive facilities in the industrial domain and damaged 370,000 ha of farmland, reducing the area of the cultivated land by 90,000 ha. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They bombed and bombarded Yongmyong Temple and Pubyok Pavilion in Pyongyang, Puyong Temple in Haeju, Pohyon Temple in Mt. Myohyang, Sokwang Temple in Anbyon and Jangan Temple in Mt. Kumgang and almost all other cultural relics, completely destroying them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During their temporary occupation of many parts of the north U.S. troops mercilessly massacred 15,000 civilians in Pyongyang, 35,838 in Sinchon, 19,072 in Anak and at least 13,000 in Unryul. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They raped at least 1,000 women in Pyongyang and abused many Korean women in various other parts of the north under their temporary occupation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They organized the so-called \"group of comfort women for GIs\" with women aged 15-35 they had forcibly taken from various cities under their temporary occupation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They took away so many civilians from Sok Islet (Sokdo-ri, Kwail County), Songhwa County, Hwanghae Province with a population of over 1,700 that it was reduced to an uninhabited islet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the U.S. plan to occupy the whole area of the north went bust in December 1950, the U.S. forces command issued an order to take civilians in the U.S.-held area to the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. forces used a variety of germ bombs, germ-dropping parachutes and germ-containing oil boxes. They used at least 20 types of germ weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They dropped more than 15 million napalm bombs over the forefrontal positions of the Korean People's Army and peaceful cities, farms and fishing villages in the rear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They gave inhumane treatment to the POWs of the Korean People's Army in violation of the legal commitment to provide POWs with all sanitary and health conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They brutally killed over 150 POWs desirous of going back to the north in Camp No. 91 on Koje Islet on April 10, 1952. On June 10 they used POWs of Camp No. 76 on the same islet as guinea pigs for testing chemical bombs, killing 227 and seriously wounding 572. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The indictment stressed that all these barbarous acts committed by the U.S. forces during the Korean war were by no means accidental but the U.S. government-planned and sponsored crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Subject to the convention on not applying the statute of limitations to the war crimes and crimes against humankind (November 26, 1968) the statute is not applicable to the U.S. crimes committed during the Korean war, the indictment concluded.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
