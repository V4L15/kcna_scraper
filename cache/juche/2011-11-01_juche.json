The unit became notorious for experimenting germ weapons on guinea pigs during the Second World War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson Tuesday says this in a by-lined commentary.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese imperialists massively spread fleas carrying pest germ to meet their criminal purpose, thereby infecting 26,000 with the pathogen, according to the document.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is something abnormal from every aspect that such hideous crime against humanity committed by Japan remained shrouded in history, a crime that should have been sternly punished by justice and the conscience of mankind, says the news analyst of the commentary.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese imperialists destroyed and burned all the evidence and relevant data at a time of their defeat in the war, for fear that their crimes might open to public. But it was more attributable to the improper stand and attitude by the Japanese authorities for their past crimes, says the commentary, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries are now refusing to admit, apologize and make reparation for the germ warfare and other hideous crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Japanese imperialists against people in Korea and other Asian countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The wrath and hatred of those people for Japan are mounting, adversely affecting the relations between Japan and those Asian countries that fell victim to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is mentality common to the victimized people who underwent sufferings and pain at the hands of the Japanese imperialists that they can not get along on good terms with Japan unless it apologizes and redeems its past and they must settle accounts with it to the last. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's brazen-faced behavior to gloss over its past crimes by which it imposed acute pain on others can never be pardoned.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan should admit its crime-woven past history of aggression and seek ways to live as a full-fledged member of the international community."
