This shows that their scheme of aggression is invariable.\r\n   Theirs is an anachronistic design.\r\n   The United States would be well advised to look straight at the trend of the times and get its troops out of South Korea and other Asian region as early as possible.    \r\n\r\n"

It, therefore, is not qualified to get a permanent seat on the UN Security Council by nature. In addition to this, it still remains an \"enemy state\" in the UN Charter.\r\n   Japan's insistence on permanent membership of the UN Security Council, is a mockery of and challenge to justice and conscience of humankind.\r\n   To become a permanent member of the UN Security Council is not the kind of issue which can be settled as desired by Japan itself.\r\n   If Japan truly values international justice and conscience and is interested in world peace, it should clear off the past before anything else.    \r\n\r\n"

But, there is no such a statesman or great man in the world as Kim Jong Il who  raised it as the fundamental question of political philosophy to believe in people as in heaven.\r\n  It is thanks to his worship and leadership for the people that  the Korean people have become dignified and happy people and the DPRK has served the people.\r\n   The DPRK, taking it as the supreme principle of state activities to improve the welfare of the people, devotes all social wealth to the happiness of the people, with the result that all of them live a happy life under systems of free education and free medical treatment services without any worry about food, clothing and housing.\r\n   Whatever others may say or no matter how the situation may change, the Korean people are performing fresh achievements in production and construction to further consolidate the anthropocentric socialist system whose advantages they have keenly felt through their experience in life.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Therefore, the entire nation should turn out in the struggle to remove the main obstacles in the way of working out the destiny of the nation.\r\n   It is also important to solve all the problems in keeping with the interests and aspiration of one's nation and in accordance with the view and faith of one's nation.\r\n   National interests should be judged correctly in view of the requirement of the nation for independence, and the independent interests of the nation should be defended and all things opposed to them be thoroughly rejected in settling all the problems. It should not be allowed to neglect and encroach upon the right of one's nation to independence.\r\n   In order to hew out the destiny of the nation with one's own view and faith, one should have the will to settle one's problem with one's own efforts in a responsible manner. And one should always set in motion independent thinking power to judge by oneself, establish independent view and carry it through.\r\n   What is important in hewing out the destiny of the nation creatively is first of all to oppose dogmatism and settle all the problems in keeping with the specific conditions of the country and the nation. To this end, one should support and carry out the new theories, principles, lines and policies that give a clear exposition of the theoretical and practical problems arising in hewing out the destiny of the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
