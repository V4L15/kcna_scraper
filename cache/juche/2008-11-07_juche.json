That is why temples hold a considerable part in the architectural heritages of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t The temple consists of a building for the Buddhist idol and worship and a building for the daily and religious life of priests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t The former is called puljon (the house of the Buddhist idol), typical of which is Taeung Hall (the building containing idol of Sakyamuni), Kukrak Hall or Muryangsu Hall (the building for the idol of Amitabha) and so on.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Hanging on walls of the buildings were Buddhist paintings commensurate with the names of the houses and character of the Buddhist idols.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t From the period of the three kingdoms to the end of later Silla, buildings were arranged symmetrically on both sides of the gate, the pagoda and the main Buddhist hall.
