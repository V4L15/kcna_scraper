Korean military urged to halt war exercise \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 31 (KCNA) - The South Korean military is staging a war exercise when the 6th ministerial-level talks between the north and the south is high on the agenda.\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary denounces it as a deliberate action to torpedo the atmosphere of dialogue and make it more complicated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The dialogue can not proceed amidst the powder-reeking atmosphere of gunshot. And no success can be expected from any dialogue between the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We repeatedly offered constructive proposals to the south side to save the north-south dialogue from a deadlock and continue cooperation and exchange between the north and the south, and have made sincere efforts to realize them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But regrettably, the South Korean military authorities answered our sincere efforts with a provocative war exercise. This is a clear evidence that the south side has no will to resume the north-south dialogue and relax the tensions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such moves of the South Korean military authorities arouse our precaution. We cannot but believe that they do not want the improved relations between the north and the south but take the road of confrontation and war in league with foreign forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dialogue can never be realized by the efforts of a dialogue partner alone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean military authorities are well advised to immediately stop worsening the atmosphere of the inter-Korean dialogue and laying a stumbling block to it.    \r\n\r\n"

This is of weighty significance in constantly developing in depth and glorifying the Juche idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The work is, indeed, a precious ideological pabulum that instills the unwavering faith in socialism into the revolutionary people and a powerful ideological and theoretical instrument which guarantees the invincibility of the socialist cause in our era, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n"

He asked a worker for a meal-ticket and gave it to a cook to acquaint himself in detail with the meal. He took a seat beside a worker and personally tasted the meal before telling officials to make the meal more palatable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In March Juche 60 (1971) he heard from an official a plan for building more fish refrigeration plants at a meeting of the political committee of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea. It was specified in the plan that fish would be refrigerated after head, tail and entrails were removed. This way could be done by less investment than scheduled. The president asked the official whether he heard public opinion and whether people said they would take such fish. The president instructed him to correct the plan, saying that better refrigeration plants should be built for people however much it may cost. So, the meeting went into recession.  The meeting held next day adopted a decision on building large refrigeration plants at major fishing ports. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the evening of one spring day, President Kim Il Sung was blowing a harmonica in the garden. Captivated by his good blowing, the aide and nurse asked him to blow other tunes. He said that if he had not been the state president or general secretary of the party he would have held a concert every evening at his home and invited them.  Seeing an official standing some distance away, he said with smile that the official came to make him \"do some work,\" and made his way to his office.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
