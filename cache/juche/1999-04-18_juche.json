            "content": "Five-point policy for great national unity\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, April 18 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today dedicates a by-lined article to the 1st anniversary of the publication of the great leader Kim Jong Il's work \"Let Us Reunify the Country Independently and Peacefully through the Great Unity of the Entire Nation\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The article says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kim Jong Il in the historic work advanced the five-point policy for the great national unity which comprehensively expounds the idea of the great leader President Kim Il Sung on great national unity and the precious experience and exploits he achieved in carrying the idea into effect and which indicates a clear-cut way of accomplishing the unity of the nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The five-point policy  calls for achieving the unity of the entire nation on the principle of national independence under the banner of patriotism and national reunification, improving the relations between the north and the south, rejecting the domination by outside forces and anti-reunification forces,  realizing travels and contacts between all fellow countrymen in the north, south and overseas and  promoting dialogues between them and strengthening their solidarity and unity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Over the last one year the policy has  given great impetus to the Korean people's struggle for national reunification amid warm support and sympathy from all compatriots in the north, south and overseas and proved its undisputed validity, vitality and invincible might in practice.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the invariable stand and policy of the DPRK to embrace all people who love the country and the nation and get all of them united.   It is our invariable stand not to ask about the past of those  who are now willing to make a contribution to national reunification after sincerely repenting of their past wrongdoings, but  leniently treat them and work together with them for reunification.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities should stop \"cooperation\" with outside forces against the fellow countrymen, do away with such fascist and anti-reunification laws and institutions as the \"National Security Law\"  which antagonizes the fellow countrymen  and hinders the nation's  reconciliation and unity and pull down all sorts of political barriers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All the fellow countrymen in the north, south and overseas should launch a nationwide struggle against the outsider's domination and interference, the crafty moves for alienation and destabilization and anti-north confrontation and war moves by the separatist forces at home and abroad so as to root out the source of hindering the unity and reunification of the nation.   All political parties, organizations and Koreans of all social standings at home and abroad should  carry on a joint action, supporting each other and taking common steps in the struggle for national reunification.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Since the respected Kim Jong Il is leading the grand march of the entire nation for reunification, the prospect of national reunification remains bright, the article stresses, appealing to all Koreans in the north, south and overseas to turn out to realize their historical wish for reunification under the banner of the five-point policy for the great national unity. \r\n\r\n"

All the moves are intended to step up the preparations for carrying the anti-DPRK war plan into practice.The war hawks inside and outside South Korea are now staging large-scale war exercises allegedly to cope with \"possible crisis\" in the Korean peninsula. This evidently proves that they seek to provoke a war against the north at any cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We will never tolerate but  deal a merciless blow to any provokers.    They should not act rashly but stop such reckless war gamble, clearly knowing  who is their opponent. \r\n\r\n  \r\n"
