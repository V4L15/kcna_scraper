The sphere of the SDF's military operation is now covering Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean and extending to other parts of the world, going far beyond the boundary of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are making desperate efforts to turn Japan into a military giant and launch overseas aggression come what may in a few years to come in order to realize the old dream of \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\" it failed to do in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan claims that the international community wants it to make what it called \"international contribution\", but this is a nonsensical talk made by it, unaware of where it stands. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionary ruling forces should understand that the international community including the Asian people remains vigilant against the \"international contribution\" on their lips. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The Japanese reactionaries had better behave themselves, mindful that their moves to turn Japan into a military power and launch overseas expansion only precipitate their self-destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S. has systematically escalated its moves to threaten and invade the DPRK with its forces of aggression present in south Korea as a shock force, illegally keeping them there for more than six decades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even at this hour the U.S. is staging the provocative Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military exercises to invade the DPRK in south Korea with huge forces and ultra-modern war hardware involved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said policy constitutes a main factor of hamstringing the efforts to achieve the independent reunification of the Korean nation and develop the inter-Korean ties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is instigating the anti-reunification forces in south Korea keen on flunkeyism and dependence on foreign forces to stir up the atmosphere of confrontation with fellow countrymen in a desperate bid to bar the cause of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The emergence of the pro-U.S. conservative Lee Myung Bak \"government\" in south Korea was a product of the plot and scenario of the U.S. to hold in check the Korean nation's reconciliation and unity and independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is now driving the Lee group to the political and military confrontation with the DPRK under the slogans of \"security\" and \"alliance\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality proves that it is impossible to ensure peace and security on the Korean Peninsula nor is it possible to achieve national independence and reunification unless an end is put to the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article urges the U.S. to roll back at the earliest possible date its hostile policy toward the DPRK, a leftover of the old era of confrontation that runs counter to the trend of the times toward independent reunification and peace and prosperity.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
