His outbursts are intended to shackle all the countries to the fetter of \"anti-terrorism alliance\" and freely control those countries making a stand against the U.S., he added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. invades the DPRK as it did other countries, it will face death, he said, declaring that the Guinean people will always be on the side of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n K.M. Khan, member of the parliament and chairman of the Indian Association for Friendship and Culture with Foreign Countries, said in a statement on the same day that there is no ground for the U.S. to describe the DPRK as part of the \"axis of evil\". The statement urged the U.S. government to stop its reckless moves to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n I.N. Ikpahindi, curator of the Abuja state library in Nigeria, in a press statement on Feb. 27 said that bush made remarks against the DPRK without any study or estimation during his tour of Asia, so that he revealed his political vulgarity concentrically, disgraced the United States and made it an object of worldwide protest and derision. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n G. Debarajan, international secretary of the c.c., the All-India Forward Bloc, in a press statement on Feb. 25 condemned Bush for having called for \"change\" of the system chosen by the Korean people themselves during his recent Asia visit even after his remarks about \"axis of evil\" were rejected at home and abroad.    \r\n\r\n"

There existed such ancient states as ancient Korea, Puyo, Jinguk, Kuryo, etc. In Korea but costumes of their people were basically similar to each other and this became a main fashion of the Korean national costume. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Of course, there was a clear distinction in the use of clothing material, ornament, belt and shoes according to social status. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Historical facts go to clearly prove that Koreans wore one and the same clothes from the early period of their state.    \r\n\r\n"
