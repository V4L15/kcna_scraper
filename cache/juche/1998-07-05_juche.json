And the 2nd army corps command is to be reformed into a logistic command while the command rooms of the first, second and third army corps in the puppet army headquarters will be unified into a headquarters command room.\r\n   The puppets also decided to integrate intelligence units allegedly for \"effective support\" to joint operations, transform the transport  operation system and reduce the present 38-stage \"decision-making process\" to 24-stage one.\r\n   Never should it go unnoticed that the puppets' steps for unifying the army commanding system have been  taken to keep pace with the U.S. imperialists, their master, in the moves to ignite a war against the north.    \r\n\r\n"
