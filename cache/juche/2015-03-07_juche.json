Korean Regime for Anti-DPRK Campaign over Attack on U.S. Ambassador\r\nPyongyang, March 7 (KCNA) -- Lippert, U.S. ambassador to south Korea, was reportedly attacked by a south Korean resident in the heart of Seoul on March 5.\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea witnessed fierce anti-U.S. actions in the past, but it is the first time that the American ambassador, governor-general of the U.S. colony, suffered a knife-wielding attack.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this regard, the Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) issued its information bulletin No. 1085 Saturday.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The attack is a reflection of the south Korean people's mindset against the U.S. fanning up a war crisis on the Korean Peninsula through dangerous joint military drills in south Korea, and an expression of their resistance to it, the bulletin says, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters is that the south Korean puppet regime is branding the attack as an \"act by the forces following the north\" in a desperate attempt to link the case with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK reported about the case, regarding it as a punishment to the U.S. by justice and an expression of the people's mindset against it. However, the puppet regime criticized this report as \"support for terrorism,\" \"distortion of the truth about the case\" and \"senseless remarks self-admitting that it is a group of terrorists and human rights violators.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even the police and conservative media of south Korea joined the regime in attempting to link the case with the DPRK. They claimed that the attacker visited the DPRK in the past and that it welcomed him when he made a brick attack on the Japanese ambassador. Meanwhile, the regime let old ultra-right conservatives defame the dignity of the DPRK supreme leadership and its flag, creating a terror-ridden atmosphere.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such moves are prompted by a vicious intention to save itself from the present awkward position and eliminate the pro-reunification patriotic forces with the case as a momentum and intensify an anti-DPRK smear campaign worldwide.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In particular the south Korean regime's ulterior intention is to egg its American master on to re-list the DPRK as a \"sponsor of terrorism\" and strengthen the collusion with the U.S. and the international cooperation against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To incriminate its resident protesting the U.S. keen on war exercises will only show the true colors of the south Korean regime as the special-class sycophant and traitor more clearly."
