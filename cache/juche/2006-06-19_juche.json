If the enemies ignite a war eventually, the Korean army and people will mercilessly wipe out the aggressors and give vent to the deep-rooted grudge of the nation, the reporter stressed.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Thus, the historic Pyongyang Declaration \"Let Us Defend and Advance the Socialist Cause\" was made public on April 20, 1992. At that time it was signed by 70 political parties. But the number of its signatories has reached at least 260 since then. It is now being signed by more political parties of different countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The declaration has served as a banner of encouragement, banner of victory arousing the revolutionary political parties and people of the world desirous of socialism to the struggle for defending and advancing the cause of socialism. Under this banner progressive political parties of different countries have rallied all their domestic independent forces and strengthened international solidarity to wage a struggle to advance the cause of socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the days go by, the declaration proves that socialism is invincible. It is verified by the reality of Korea. Korean-style socialism centering on the popular masses is an ideal society humankind has so ardently aspired after for thousands of years, the social system under which independence of people has been totally realized. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the firm faith of the Korean army and people that socialism is sure to win in any turns and twists, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
