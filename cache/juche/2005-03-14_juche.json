This call was made in a statement issued by a spokesman for the committee on March 11.\r\n The statement said: Japan is now kicking up a frantic campaign against the DPRK over the issue of \"Japanese abductees.\" But with no crafty and shameless method can Japan ever evade its state responsibility for apologizing and compensating for the aggression and hideous crimes committed by it against Korea in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Laying bare the crimes committed by Japan against the Korean people in the past, the statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is the most grave of the state-sponsored crimes committed by Japan against the Korean people in the past is that Japan occupied Korea by force of arms, encroaching upon its sovereignty and territory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan committed unprecedentedly hideous crimes against humanity. It arrested, punished and killed Koreans, forcibly drafted at least 8.4 million people and drove them to slave labor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It forced 200,000 Korean women into sexual slavery for the aggression troops. Japan's vandalism and plunder of precious cultural treasures of Korea are also a grave international crime as they challenged human civilization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such crimes perpetrated by the Japanese imperialists in Korea are monstrous international crimes which can neither be erased nor concealed as they can be clearly proved according to paragraphs a. b. c. d. of Article 13 of the act of the Far Eastern Military Tribunal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The base behavior of Japan to keep its past crimes buried in oblivion will only add to its past crimes as it is an act of going against the trend of the times when even victor nations, to say nothing of defeated nations, in the Second World War are frankly recognizing their past mistakes and making a sincere apology and compensation to the victims. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans will keep a strict tab on all the crimes committed by Japan against the Korean nation in the past and surely force it to pay for them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun Saturday says this in a signed commentary.\r\n The U.S. is not in a position to talk about \"drug issue\" of other countries, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the U.S. which is plagued with most serious drug issue in the world and it is again the U.S. which is censured and disgraced for its drug problem. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The drug issue in the U.S. is so deeply rooted in its social life that it is not too much to say this is part of the long-standing American style culture. That was why the successive U.S. presidents never let opportunities pass by without mentioning the drug issue whenever elections and discussions on domestic and foreign policies took place. This goes to clearly prove what serious social evil is caused by the drug issue in the U.S. and how deeply the American society is addicted to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not a problem related to individuals but a social and state problem and its root cause is the U.S. reactionary national policy, corrupt social life of American style.\r\n It is a laughing stock of all people that the call for \"international control over drug\" is heard from the U.S., the den of drug addicts and a cesspool of drug-related crimes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is also a criminal move to realize its ambition to dominate the whole of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its continued military occupation of south Korea despite the opposition and denunciation by all Koreans is also aimed to obstruct the independent and peaceful reunification of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The real intention of the U.S. is to bar Korea from being reunified independently by the concerted efforts of the Koreans and put the Korean Peninsula under its domination.  Recently the heavyweights of the U.S. administration considered it as its foremost task to \"end tyranny\", malignantly slandering the dignified DPRK as an \"outpost of tyranny\". This clearly suggested its intention to leave no stone unturned to spread American style \"freedom\" and \"democracy\" to the whole of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year the Korean nation should force the U.S. forces to get out of south Korea at any cost and shatter the U.S. aggressive ambition to dominate Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

At\r\nthe meeting they confirmed and agreed upon the \"joint strategic targets\" which would serve as a foundation for the strengthening of Japan-U.S. military alliance and comprehensively discussed technical matters in attaining those targets.\r\n They listed the DPRK as a principal threat to East Asia and decided to jointly cope with it by strengthening the bilateral military alliance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard Minju Joson Saturday in a signed commentary observes that the strengthening of the Japan-U.S. military alliance constitutes a basic factor of disturbing global peace and stability and creating instability as it obviously reveals a wild ambition to invade and dominate other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seeks to elevate the level of its military cooperation with Japan and expand its scope in a bid to occupy an unchallenged position in Northeast Asia and establish a military control over it and, furthermore, secure a military guarantee for its world domination. Meanwhile, Japan seeks to emerge a military giant with the U.S. backing in order to step up its policy of overseas expansion in every way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and Japan are busy underscoring the need to strengthen the Japan-U.S. alliance, making much ado about the military threat from someone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThey are describing this alliance as a \"cornerstone for global peace and stability\" in a bid to mislead the public opinion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is, however, nothing but a clumsy subterfuge to cover up the reactionary nature of their criminal collusion and nexus and legally justify them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK can never remain a passive on-looker to the U.S. and Japan that have become more undisguised in their dangerous moves to directly hurt the former and disturb the peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will strongly react to the evermore pronounced attempts of the U.S. and Japan to launch a military invasion against it as they pose a real danger.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Flailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 12 (KCNA) -- Descendents of pro-Japanese traitors including the five traitors of 1905 are now staking a claim to the ownership of the land of ancestors in south Korea. A signed commentary of Rodong Sinmun Saturday denounces this as an outright challenge and insult to the Korean nation who is determined to force Japan to redeem the past history interwoven with crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists and apologize and compensate to Koreans as it is a gangster-like act aimed at openly justifying the treacheries of those traitors.\r\n The issue of liquidating the pro-Japanese history in south Korea has not yet been solved. This has encouraged the descendents of those traitors to do a rash act intended to retake the land of ancestors in a bid to lead a gay life on their bounty, instead of feeling ashamed, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities, talking about a \"year of friendship\" with Japan, rendered support to the Japanese reactionaries who are dreaming of a comeback to Korea, far from admitting their past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There can never be any friendship with Japan as long as it has not redeemed the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists in the past. Such shilly-shally attitude of the south Korean authorities will only fan up the ambition of reinvasion of the ultra-right forces of Japan who are going arrogant, claiming a dominium over Tok Islet and repeatedly distorting history textbooks. The south Korean authorities should bear this deep in mind and behave with discretion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The rash act of the descendents of pro-Japanese forces is a product of the U.S. imperialists' colonial rule, the commentary notes, revealing that the U.S. has blocked the liquidation of pro-Japanese forces and converted pro-Japanese traitors into pro-U.S. forces to use them as a political ground for their colonial rule ever since its occupation of south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people from all walks of life in south Korea should wage more vigorous struggle against the U.S. and Japan to make Japan liquidate the past history of crimes of the Japanese imperialists at an early date, confiscate all properties of pro-Japanese traitors and force the U.S. forces out of south Korea that block their struggle to achieve dignity and sovereignty of the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Vigilance Must Be Heightened against U.S. Abuse of International Law: KCNA\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 12 (KCNA) -- The United States is getting more outspoken in its interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states and its schemes of military intervention against them under the cloak of \"anti-terrorism\", \"non-proliferation of mass-destruction weapons\", \"freedom and democracy\" and \"protection of human rights\".\r\n The U.S. abuses the lever of the international law for its political and military intervention. For example, it misuses the existing international humanitarian law and human rights convention to justify its intrigues to launch military intervention and topple the systems of anti-U.S. independent states. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The international humanitarian law defines massacre, crime against humanity, use of biochemical and lethal weapons in a war time as war crimes and calls to account under the criminal law with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is none other than the U.S. which invaded Afghanistan for its purpose and interests under the mottos of \"anti-terrorism\" to reduce its cities and villages to ruins, thus causing the worst calamities from the humanitarian point of view. It is also the U.S. which encroached upon the sovereignty of Iraq by armed forces by faking up false information and dropped hails of bombs without hesitation even on the heads of defenseless peaceable citizens and children. As many as 25,000 peaceable citizens have already died tragic deaths in the Iraqi war ignited by the U.S. with the massive mobilization of latest weapons of mass destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In utter disregard of the international law, the U.S. forces dropped bombs at random on civilian residential quarters and vehicles and made no bones about using about 1,700 tons of depleted uranium bombs in Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Owing to over decade-long economic sanctions, Iraq suffered an economic loss to the tune of at least 200 billion US dollars and over 1,732,000 Iraqis died of the lack of medicines and insufficient nutrition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the height of sarcasm that the U.S., a rude violator of the international law, is going to bring heads of state of countries under its military occupation to court, branding them as \"criminals of racial purge and massacre\" and issues an \"annual report on human rights\" every year to accuse countries falling out of its favor of the \"breach\" of the international humanitarian law and human rights convention. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And the U.S. is now seeking to cook up new norms of international law favorable for the disorganization of anti-U.S. countries, crying for placing human rights above state sovereignty and for \"non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is working to lay before the UN General Assembly the institution of a \"law on humanitarian interference\" to secure a lever of interference in other countries' internal affairs by taking issue with them over their \"human rights record\". It is also scheming to trump up a so-called convention on the responsibility of states as a legal leverage to \"legalize\" its interference in the internal affairs and use of armed forces against any sovereign state falling out of favor with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has rigged up the \"PSI\" and the \"RMSI\" aimed at naval blockade against the DPRK and other independent states under the pretext of \"non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\" and is seeking to elevate them to an international regulation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is running about day in and day out to establish a \"legal order\" for legalizing a preemptive attack and collective armed intervention against the so-called \"states of human rights abuses\" and \"sponsors of terrorism\", riding on the crest of the tide of \"UN reform\" on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of its founding this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. resorts to extraterritorial acts, disregarding the UN Charter and other international laws which regard the respect for state sovereignty as their fundamental principle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is throwing its weight about outside the framework of the international law, denying the function of the International Criminal Court and refusing to join major international treaties such as the universal nuclear test ban treaty, the UN convention on maritime law, the convention on ban on anti-personnel landmines and the Kyoto protocol on preventing global warming and unilaterally breaching the anti-ballistic missile treaty concluded with Russia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The abuses of the lever of the international law by the U.S. today under the cloak of \"anti-terrorism\", \"spread of democracy\" and \"protection of human rights\" are plainly designed to attain its strategic aim of world supremacy. \r\n Its indiscreet arbitrariness toward the international law is the root cause of the possible second and third Afghanistan and Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The international community should heighten vigilance against the shameless abuses of the international law by the U.S.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is contrary to the basic mission of the UN for Japan to become a permanent member of the UNSC and it will be troublesome to the world people desirous of peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should take this year on which the 60th anniversary of the defeat of Japanese imperialism falls as a good opportunity to redress its past crimes, remove the stigma of an \"enemy state\" and gain trust from the international community. And it should discard the harmful sense of national superiority and chauvinism and candidly join hands with Asian countries with a clear understanding that it is a member nation of Asia.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea under Fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 13 (KCNA) -- Descendents of pro-Japanese traitors in south Korea are staking a claim to the land of their ancestors, which is a shameless act intended to openly justify and  legalize the treacheries of those traitors who sold out the country and the nation without hesitation to lead an easy and comfortable life, says  a signed commentary of Minju Joson Sunday\r\n The commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their claim is unpardonable as it is an open mockery and insult to the Korean nation who has deep-seated enmity against the Japanese imperialists and a vicious challenge to the anti-Japanese struggle of the Korean people to force Japan to redress for its past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is more intolerable is the treacherous act of the south Korean judicial authorities who are permitting their shameless claim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their rash act is an inevitable product of the U.S. imperialists' colonial rule over south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their claim is unthinkable without the U.S. patronage and manipulation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nGenuine independence and democratization of south Korean society cannot be spoken of without putting an end to the domination and interference of the U.S. seeking to further strengthen colonial rule over south Korea with sycophantic traitors as a political ground. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people of all social strata should frustrate the vicious moves of the pro-American and pro-Japanese flunkeyists, make all their properties those of the country and the nation and drive the U.S. imperialist aggression troops, the root cause of all social evils, out of this land at an early date.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
