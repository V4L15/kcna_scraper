Korean trade unions vow to go on general strike \r\n Pyongyang, July 4 (KCNA) -- Trade unions in South Korea are fighting against the lay-off of workers by the puppet clique and businesses, according to a radio report from Seoul.\r\n   The federation of metal industrial unions called a press conference on July 1 and declared  that it would go on a general strike on the 14th, charging that the puppet \"government\" has violated an agreement with trade unions.\r\n   The organization declared that if the \"government\" refuses to keep the agreement it will launch a general strike in unity with the federation of financial trade unions and  other industrial unions  and to this end, stage overnight sit-ins for an indefinite period in Seoul and other areas from July 6.  It also decided to ask the South Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) to negotiate with \"Chongwadae\".\r\n   Meanwhile, the Federation of Democratic Financial Trade Unions under KCTU and the National Federation of Financial Trade Unions under the federation of Korean trade unions warned that they will start a general strike on July 15 unless the authorities withdraw the lockout of banks which will bring about lay-off of workers.    \r\n \r\n"

They are also raising \"withdrawal\" as condition,  which will go down with nobody.\r\n   His disgusting remarks about \"withdrawal\" reveal once again his dirty colors as sworn enemy of reunification and as a thorough-paced separatist.    \r\n\r\n"

If a third party is inveigled into the issue, it will only make  the issue more complex.\r\n   If the United States truly wants to settle the issue, it should not cry for \"cooperation\" with  someone but accept the DPRK's proposal for building a new peace-keeping mechanism and take a practical step for the withdrawal of its troops from South Korea.\r\n   We regard independence as our life and soul and decide and settle all the matters according to our independent judgement and view.\r\n   If a new peace-keeping mechanism is built between the DPRK and the U.S. and the U.S. troops withdraw from South Korea, a decisive phase will be opened in the solution to the Korean peninsula issue.\r\n   The United States should accept our proposal without delay    \r\n\r\n"
