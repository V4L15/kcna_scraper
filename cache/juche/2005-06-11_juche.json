            "content": "U.S. Urged to Drop Its Hostile Policy toward DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 10 (KCNA) -- The solution of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. is still delayed due to the deadlock of the six-party talks. The latter is working hard to shift the blame for this on to the former by creating impression that it is not the U.S. but the DPRK that is accountable for this situation.\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun Friday says in a signed article: This is a wicked act of falsifying truth and profound confusing of right and wrong.\r\n The U.S. is chiefly to blame for the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S., the article observes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK is a stumbling block lying in the way of settling the nuclear issue. If the U.S. truly wants to settle the issue, it should make a switchover from its hostile policy toward the DPRK to a policy of peaceful co-existence between them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has so far left no means untried to escalate its hostile moves toward the DPRK but it has got the former nowhere. It has only resulted in deteriorating the situation, fully revealing the U.S. shameless and aggressive nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the aspiration of the two peoples and the demand of the new century to put an end to the hostile relations between the DPRK and the U.S. and establish instead the relations of peaceful co-existence between them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has claimed that it has \"no intention to invade\" the DPRK. If it is true, there is no reason for the U.S. to refuse to make a switchover from its hostile policy toward the DPRK to a policy of peaceful co-existence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is high time the U.S. made a switchover from its anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK to a policy of peaceful co-existence in view of the present international environment and the trend of the development of international relations. The U.S. would be well advised to make a right option, judging the nature of the situation and the reality with a cool head. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. earliest possible political decision to make the above-said policy switchover would also do it good.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They created a terror-ridden atmosphere threatening members of foreign missions and Japanese figures entering the hotel to attend the reception. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Gangsters belonging to the \"Society for Defending Human Rights\" thronged as far as the hotel entrance and distributed leaflets critical of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEarlier, they called a press conference in Tokyo where they issued a statement titled \"We Protest Golden Jubilee of Chongryon.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From  the morning of May 29, the date of the grand festival of Koreans in Japan to mark the anniversary, eleven right-wing organizations parked 15 loudspeaker vans around the Tokyo Korea Middle and High School, the venue of the festival, to let loose anti-DPRK and anti-Chongryon outbursts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the celebration period right-wing organizations and reactionary forces including the Dietmen's League, the Society of Abductees' Families and the Society for Rescue put ceaseless undisguised pressure upon the Ministry of National Land and Communication not to issue portcall certificate to \"Mangyongbong-92\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From May 18 to June 4 right-wing gangsters kicked up a frantic row in Niigata whenever the ship made its entry. \r\n Right-wing elements including Niigata Prefectural Assemblymen from the Liberal Democratic Party, Secretary General of the Society of Abductees' Families Teruaki Masumoto and President of the Society for Rescue Katsumi Sato thronged to the Niigata Port and blustered that they would impose sanctions against the DPRK and resolutely oppose the portcall of the ship.    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n"

They helped deepen the DPRK-Japan friendly ties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Receptions were arranged in different parts of Japan on the occasion.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It was a massive anti-U.S., anti-fascist popular resistance of the south Korean people which dealt a telling blow to the military fascist dictatorship that lasted for nearly three decades and shook the colonial rule of the U.S. imperialists to its very foundation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The June resistance left in history the precious truth that no force on earth can block the struggle of the popular masses for independence and they are sure to win when they fight in close unity for the cause of justice, Rodong Sinmun Friday declares in a signed article. It continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. rule over and occupation of south Korea is the root cause of all the misfortunes and sufferings of the south Korean people and the main obstacle to national reunification. Had the south Korean people rejected the deceptive \"June 29 declaration\" and won the final victory in the anti-U.S., anti-fascist resistance during the June popular resistance, south Korea would have already been made independent and democratic. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The June popular resistance awakened the south Korean people to the truth that they should completely ostracize the pro-U.S. forces standing against reunification in south Korea, if they are to realize their desire for independence, democracy and reunification.\r\n The south Korean people of all social strata should wage a more daring fight against the U.S. and the Grand National Party in the spirit and with the mettle displayed by the resistance fighters 18 years ago and thus remove the roadblocks in the era of \"By our nation itself\" and build earlier an independent new land.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The socialist principle is the life and soul of the socialist economic management and profitability is the main objective of socialist economic activities.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Friday says this in a signed article, a summary of which reads: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There can be no socialist economy away from the socialist principle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAdherence to the socialist principle in economic management stands out with greater urgency under the present condition where the U.S. imperialists are stooping to any infamy in their desperate bid to destroy the socialist economic system of the DPRK and the objective circumstances of economic construction have changed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The basic socialist principle is collectivism. The Party's leadership of the economic work should be firmly guaranteed and all the economic activities should be conducted under the unified plan of the state unlike the market economy based on the blind application of the law of value. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The socialist ownership of the means of production should be steadfastly maintained and the position and role of the popular masses as the master in production be firmly ensured and, furthermore, the principle of socialist distribution be strictly observed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is very important likewise in preserving the socialist principle in economic management is to invariably pursue such state policies as the systems of free medical care and free education clearly proving the advantages of Korea's socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The main point on which a tight grip should be kept in socialist economic management is to ensure the biggest profitability in economic work. To this end, it is required to reduce the production cost and expenditure, increase the efficiency of investment and guide the officials, producers and technicians in all fields and units to actively explore methods of economic management suitable to ensuring economic profitability in economy and correct regulations to meet the need of profitability, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
