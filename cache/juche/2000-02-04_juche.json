            "content": "Letter to KCTU \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 4 (KCNA) -- The central committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea on Feb. 3 sent a letter to the South Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) calling upon the 10 million South Korean workers to actively join in the work to form a \"nationwide ad hoc committee for probing the truth behind the GIs' mass killings.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The letter said: The massacres of innocent civilians by the U.S. aggression troops during the Korean War were a wanton violation of the international treaties and wartime laws and regulations which ban targeting non-combatants. Such an unheard-of criminal act can be committed only by the American cannibals whose mode of existence is aggression, plunder and killings.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States is paying lip-service to \"investigation\" into the mass killings in a bid to flee from its responsibility for them till now when the truth behind them has been probed clearly by testimonies of victims and the declassified secret documents of the U.S. military, far from admitting them. This is an unpardonable mockery and insult to the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Noting that the reality calls on the people to turn out in a nationwide struggle to defend the national dignity, the letter expressed the belief that the KCTU would respond to the appeal of the political parties and organizations in the DPRK and actively join in the work of the north and south to form a \"nationwide ad hoc committee for probing the truth behind the GIs' mass killings\" by pooling the will of the 10 million workers of South Korea. \r\n\r\n"

This is last-ditch efforts to bridge over serious ruling crisis caused by the policy failure and prolong his remaining days, he noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They should immediately stop the criminal moves to provoke a war against the north which only escalate south-north confrontation and tensions and increase the danger of war, and step down as unanimously demanded by the people. \r\n\r\n"

They never complained about their hard conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   An appeal to the workers and other working people across the country was adopted on behalf of the workers of North Phyongan Province at the meeting to light the torch of the Rakwon Machine Plant by displaying the same spirit of devotedly defending the leader as was done by the 10 party members of the Rakwon Machine Factory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The appeal underscored the need for all the workers and other working people across the country to display to the full the spirit of devotedly defending the leader, the spirit of devotedly implementing the decisions and instructions of the party and the leader and the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance like the 10 party members of the Rakwon Machine Factory and become human rifles and bombs in devotedly defending Kim Jong Il and the standard-bearers and vanguard fighters in the present-day canter march to implement his noble intention without fail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It called upon all the workers and other working people across the country to glorify the 55th anniversary of the party foundation, to be greeted at a turning point of the century, as a grand festival of victors and thus demonstrate once again the might of Juche Korea to the whole world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Present at the meeting were Kim Ki Nam, secretary of the WPK Central Committee, Kwak Pom Gi, vice-premier of the cabinet, and others. \r\n\r\n"

But all the \"elections\" turned out to be unfair and fraudulent ones under the influence of money and power. The \"national assemblymen\" elected were pro-U.S., pro-Japanese traitors and corrupt and incompetent ones. They were keen on their own interests, betraying the country and the nation in utter disregard of the people's interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"National Assembly\" turned into a scene of scuffles. There was a strong opinion in South Korea that the \"National Assembly\" should be the target of \"reform.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It was against this backdrop that the \"Citizens' Solidarity for General Elections\" (CSGE) was inaugurated on January 12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It groups more than 420 organizations. Its first target is to defeat a group of 67 candidates. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The CSGE made public another list of 48 disqualified candidates on Feb. 2. The Citizens' Federation for Economic Justice also declared a list of 167 political quacks and high-ranking officials who are not qualified to be candidates. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Recorded in the list are their past careers including their involvement in irregularities and corruption and their scrambles for power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Council of the Citizens' Movement for Fair Election grouping 48 organizations and the Young Men's Christian Association, professors' organizations, the South Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and the Federation of South Korean Trade Unions, etc are joining in and solidarizing with the anti-candidate campaign of the CSGE. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation observed that \"inspiring calls, aid funds and elated enthusiasm of citizens to participate in the anti-candidate campaign and the people's desire for new politics represent tremendous strength to put an end to the outdated politics that has lasted for over 50 years.\"  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This campaign is dealing a telling blow to the ruling and opposition politicians and those in power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is an opinion gaining ground in the South Korean society that due to this unprecedented anti-candidate campaign the \"election\" is \"likely to be carried out in a way quite different from earlier elections.\"\r\n\r\n"
