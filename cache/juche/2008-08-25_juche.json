            "content": "National Meeting Held to Mark 48th Anniversary of Kim Jong Il's Start of Songun Revolutionary Leadership \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, August 24 (KCNA) -- A national meeting took place at the April 25 House of Culture Sunday to mark the 48th anniversary of General Secretary Kim Jong Il's start of the Songun revolutionary leadership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present there were cadres of the Party, army and state, chairpersons of friendly parties, officials of the Party and armed forces and power bodies, public organizations, ministries and national institutions, officers and men of the Korean People's Army, officials of the fields of science, education, culture and art, public health and media, heroes, men of merits and working people in the city. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n KPA General Kim Jong Gak, first vice director of the General Political Department of the KPA, made a report at the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On August 25, Juche 49 (1960) Kim Jong Il left the noble footprint of on-the-spot guidance to Guard Seoul Ryu Kyong Su Tank Division 105 of the KPA. This was the striking manifestation of his steadfast faith and will to accomplish with arms the revolutionary cause of Juche pioneered by President Kim Il Sung with arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il's start of the Songun revolutionary leadership helped start the history of the great succession successfully carrying forward the Songun idea and leadership of the President and bring about a new turning-point in strengthening and developing the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK and accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Out of the original view and standpoint on the issues of the position and role of the revolutionary army he advanced the idea of putting the army before the working class for the first time in the history of the revolutionary movement, put forward the People's Army as the main force of the revolution and made sure that the Songun policy is comprehensively applied in all fields of the revolution and construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With the Songun policy established as the basic political mode of socialism, the original way was opened to facilitate the balance of the revolutionary forces in our times and realize the socialist politics. It also helped the army and people of the DPRK confidently advance the revolutionary cause of Juche despite international political upheavals and the DPRK shed its rays over the world as the country of the great Songun idea and policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He visited anywhere soldiers are despite the biting cold in midwinter and the sweltering weather in the hottest period of summer to take deep care of the soldiers of the People's Army ranging from the political and ideological education of the servicepersons and the combat and political training to the economic, cultural and entertainment life of units. His fatherly love and trust were the basic motive force which helped firmly arm the People's Army with the Juche idea and the Songun idea and strengthen it into the strong revolutionary army of Mt. Paektu with the transparent spirit of devotedly defending the headquarters of the revolution, the peculiar strategy and tactics of our style and the invincible combat capability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il established new state system of our own style with the National Defence Commission as a pivot as required by the developing revolution in the Songun era and strengthened the single-minded unity of the revolutionary ranks with the army as its core in every way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was thanks to the Songun policy of the Workers' Party of Korea consistent with the spirit of genuine patriotism and staunch idea of independence against imperialism that the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and the October 4 declaration, the programme for its implementation, were provided, the desire of all the fellow countrymen to achieve the national reunification by their concerted efforts has become an irresistible trend and the prestige, position, influence and attraction of the DPRK has risen exceptionally high in the international arena and the international solidarity with the Korean revolution has grown stronger. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Shining victories and changes made in the fields of politics, military affairs, economy and culture and national reunification and the external relations despite all challenges of history vividly prove that the Songun revolutionary leadership and Songun politics of the Workers' Party of Korea serve as an ever-victorious banner of ushering in a new great era of the Juche revolution and an all-powerful treasured sword helping powerfully step up the revolution and construction and successfully transform all fabrics of social life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter underlined the need to stage an all-out offensive on all fronts of socialist construction based on the historic victory of Songun revolution and its achievements and thus fling open the gate of a great prosperous powerful nation, accelerate national reunification and accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK will never remain an onlooker to the U.S. military and the south Korean bellicose forces staging frantic anti-DPRK war moves swimming against the trend of the times. Should the U.S. imperialists and their following forces misjudge the DPRK's will and act rashly, they will mercilessly wipe out the aggressors to the last man and certainly achieve the historic cause of national reunification by dint of the might of Songun they have built up century after century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will exert positive efforts to reject the imperialists' domination, interference and war moves and protect peace and security of Asia and the rest of world in firm unity with peoples of all countries advocating independence in the idea of independence, peace and friendship.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Among them is the Ukishima-maru incident, which was known as a horrible tragedy in history.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe Japanese imperialists intentionally blew up and sank the Ukishima-maru, a naval transport ship of old Japan, in the sea off Maizuru Port, Kyoto Prefecture, on August 24, 1945, to kill thousands of innocent Korean people who were on the way of returning home aboard the ship with the joy of national liberation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAs for the Koreans aboard the ship, they were survivors of the battlefields for aggression and backbreaking working sites. Having been deprived of their country by the Japanese imperialists, they were taken to alien lands where they were subjected to all sorts of national contempt and imposed upon slave labor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe Japanese murderers committed the atrocity in a foolish attempt to revenge on Koreans for their defeat, the failure in achieving the wild ambition \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\" and at the same time, to bury all their criminal acts forever.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBut the then Japanese government described it as an \"unavoidable incident\" to conceal it in the dark of history.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn an effort to keep the criminal inside of the incident in secret once and for all, the Japanese government did not try to confirm the addresses and names of the dead and even to make public the correct death toll.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBy so doing, Japan attempted to dwarf the casualties of Koreans as much as possible, evade the obligation of apology and compensation to the victims and the bereaved families for the crime as assailant and to dodge the responsibility for the incident.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEven today, the Japanese government fails to solve the Ukishima-maru incident correctly and tries to evade the responsibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nJapan must admit its responsibility for the Ukishima-maru incident, a deliberate massacre committed entirely in accordance with the Japanese government's plan to slay Koreans, and apologize and compensate to the bereaved families of the victims.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The spirit of devotedly defending the leader was the source of the inexhaustible strength that brought about such shining victories and miracles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the most precious truth taught by the history of the Korean revolution that there is no formidable enemy in the world which cannot be defeated and there is no fortress unconquerable when the army and people have a great leader and they are replete with the transparent spirit of devotedly defending the leader.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said spirit which was highly displayed in the annals of the Korean revolution has been given the fullest play in the era of Songun steered by Kim Jong Il.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This spirit serves as life-giving water which helps prepare the army and people of the DPRK as those strong in faith, will and mental power and as the main source of augmenting the might of the single-minded unity in the Songun era in every way and a main engine for bringing about great leaping advances in the building of a great prosperous powerful socialist nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ours is invincible socialism under which all the servicepersons and people are single-mindedly united around the headquarters of the revolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No force on earth can shake their absolute trust in the leader and their faith in devotedly defending the leader.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They even publicized that the war exercises are \"defensive ones to cope with the transfer of the rights to command the wartime operations.\" This is, however, nothing but nonsense.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a serious attention is that they provocatively launched the north-targeted joint military exercises at a time when the U.S. threw obstacles in the progress of the six-party talks and in the implementation of agreements of the talks, raising such an irrelevant issue as \"human rights\" of the DPRK. The U.S. can never evade the responsibility for the crimes of deliberately straining the tension on the Korean Peninsula and checking the trend of the times for dialogue and peace by staging the madcap exercises.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military exercises were an inevitable product of the treacherous and bellicose policy for inter-Korean confrontation pursued by the Lee Myung Bak group zealously following the U.S. reckless policy of aggression against the DPRK and its war hysteria for the aggression on the north.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Absolutely intolerable are the U.S. and the south Korean bellicose forces' war provocation for aggression against the north as they escalate confrontation and tension and spoil the atmosphere of dialogue and peace, blatantly challenging the trend of the times.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will bolster the war deterrent for self-defence under the uplifted banner of Songun to cope with the vicious north-targeted moves for a war of aggression getting ever-more undisguised on the part of the bellicose forces at home and abroad and resolutely foil any provocation with strong countermeasures.
