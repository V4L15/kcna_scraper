Korean Foreign Ministry under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 17 (KCNA) -- The South Headquarters of the National Alliance of Youth and Students for the Country's Reunification in a statement on May 12 reportedly demanded the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of south Korea properly see through the nature of the situation, though belatedly, and drop its pro-U.S. diplomacy without delay.\r\n The north successfully unloaded the spent fuel rods from the pilot nuclear plant and clarified its stand that it would take further necessary steps to increase its nuclear arsenal for the defensive purpose of coping with the prevailing situation, with a main emphasis on developing the self-reliant nuclear power industry, the statement said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As soon as this position was made public, the ministry lost no time to release a commentary in which it let loose such balderdash as \"it was a measure to strain the situation in contravention of the process to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula\" and \"the north should return to the six-country talks without delay\". This is nothing but a rash act of the diplomatic authorities of this land diametrically running counter to the common interests of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whenever the situation got strained over the north's nuclear issue, the ministry asked the U.S. chiefly accountable for it to have \"negotiation\" and \"consultation\" but pointed an accusing finger at the north where compatriots live.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They called for defending peace in Northeast Asia by inheriting the spirit of May 18 symbolic of democracy and human rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A lot of people visited the cemetery in Mangwol-dong, Kwangju, where the souls of those who fell in the uprising were resting in peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the same day, a big rally for the withdrawal of the U.S. forces and against war was held in Kwangju to mark the anniversary.

Ridiculing the U.S. scheme to \"disarm\" the DPRK and \"overthrow\" its system as a foolish dream, a Rodong Sinmun analyst Tuesday says:\r\n The outcry of the Bush group for a solution to the nuclear issue through \"talks\" is a link in the chain of a beguiling psychological  warfare to divert the sharp eyes of the DPRK from the U.S. and disintegrate its army and people ideologically and mentally, having rounded off all necessary military preparations according to their war scenario against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is keen on creating a chance to spark the second Korean war, after designating the DPRK as the principal enemy and an object of a preemptive nuclear attack, not as a dialogue partner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Up till now the Bush administration regarded the six-party talks as a leverage to gain time for the completion of preparations for the second Korean war. This is proved by the fact that its pressure upon and blackmail to the DPRK have increased and the situation of the Korean Peninsula raced faster to the brink of war with each round of talks. The U.S. only seeks to \"disarm\" the DPRK and \"overthrow\" its system. The reality makes the DPRK note with pride how correct and judicious it was for it to have fortified the defenses and built nuclear deterrent in the past, tightening the belt. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our nuclear weapons are a reliable shield to defend the country's sovereignty and peace and a guarantee for victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These days the U.S. warlike forces, with every nerve on the alert, are raising a terrific hue and cry over \"nuclear test scheme\" of the DPRK. This is nothing but a scream of those who are scared by its formidable military power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Fully prepared to cope with any option of the enemy, the DPRK will go straight its own way, without the slightest vacillation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And it must not go unnoticed that it has persistently sought an  absolute edge in strategic attack weaponry over other big powers, regarding the increase and modernization of nuclear forces as the key point of its strategy for global domination  The U.S. is the very one which has not only increased nuclear weaponization and threatened other countries but also fostered worldwide nuclear proliferation. Now a strong demand for the abolition of U.S.-made tactical nukes, a product of the Cold War era, is being voiced in Germany, but the U.S. is turning a deaf ear to it. Its stand is the same with the more than 1,000 nuclear weapons deployed on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But this is not the whole story. It has directly supported the nuclear weaponization of Israel and tacitly connived at and fostered the bid of Japan for nuclear armament. Having stockpiled plutonium more than necessary, Japan is contemplating to operate a plant extracting enough plutonium to make 1,000 odd nuclear warheads a year. This is creating quite a stir worldwide, but the U.S. is feigning ignorance of this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As shown above, the U.S. is not only the ringleader of nuclear proliferation but also the real nuclear criminal who gives rise to a nuclear arms race destroying the worldwide nuclear non-proliferation system itself and the danger of a nuclear war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

S.-led world domination order to cope with the changed world situation and the relations of forces.\r\n The danger of the moves lies in that through them the U.S. imperialists seek to expand the sphere of operation of their troops in south Korea to the Asia-Pacific region as required by the aggressive doctrine of preemptive attack and mount preemptive attacks on the countries in this region. This brings to light the criminal intention of the U.S. warhawks to retain their hold on the Korean Peninsula as a strategic vantage point and establish military supremacy in this region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. loudmouthed \"reduction\" and \"relocation\" of its troops in south Korea is nothing but a ruse to deceive the world community.    \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"
