In my country, too, under the coordinated leadership of the state, peaceful development of outer space is actively conducted in accordance with the 2016-2020 plan for national outer space development. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In accordance with the 5-year plan for national outer space development, the DPRK will launch many more practical satellites that can contribute to the economic development and improvement of the people's living including geostationary satellite.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK government is making active efforts to achieve peaceful development of outer space while paying deep attention to the international exchanges and cooperation in the field of outer space on the basis of equality and mutual benefits. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a party to several space treaties, the DPRK's outer space development activities are completely on legal basis in all aspects. However, the U.S. going frantic to illegalize our development of outer space, claiming that it is against the anti-DPRK \"sanctions resolutions\" of the UNSC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those \"sanctions resolution\" cooked by the U.S. are no more than illegal documents that denounced peaceful launch of satellites as a \"threat to international peace and security\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is the country that launched the largest number of satellites and yet it claims that our launch of satellites is a \"threat to international peace and security\". This is a preposterous allegation and extreme double standards.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Space Treaty clearly states that the outer space is a common asset of humankind and all countries can develop outer space without any discrimination. There is no article in the treaty that has mentioned the launch of satellites constitutes a threat to international peace and security nor is there any article stipulating that one cannot use ballistic rocket technology in launching a satellite. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is relying on illegal \"resolutions\" to make an issue of our righteous and legitimate launch of satellites. This is clearly a violation of international laws and outrageous infringement upon our sovereignty and rights to existence and development. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our peaceful development of outer space is a legitimate right of a sovereign state acknowledged by the international laws that no one could deny, and the status of the DPRK as a satellite manufacturing and launching state will never be changed though the U.S. denies it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will continue its peaceful development of space conquering greater part of space and strengthen international cooperation and exchanges in the field of artificial satellites."

That's why the latter and its followers' talk about \"threat\" from the former and call for \"sanctions\" and \"pressure\" on the former have been rejected as sophism that can never work even on primary schoolchildren.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t So, the DPRK's option is just and it can never be an object of criticism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The essence of the \"theory of north Korea's nuclear threat\" persistently touted by the U.S. and its vassal forces is to make the DPRK's access to nukes \"illegal\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is now persistently spreading the \"theory of north Korea's nuclear threat\". It was motivated by a wicked and cunning intention to turn the unpromising DPRK-U.S. confrontation structure into that between the DPRK and the international community and forcefully set big or small countries in the campaign of sanctions and pressure on the DPRK and thus topple it at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's nuclear force is only for justice against aggression and tyranny, and herein lies the validity and reason of its access to nukes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's option to protect the dignity, security and interests of tens of millions of people and open up the road for their independent development is quite right, and nobody should fault its bolstering of state nuclear force as \"threat\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On the \"best way to remove threats\", the commentary says:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sanctions and pressure on the DPRK are a never-to-be-condoned inhumane and brutal crime that should be settled with any time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is no reason for the innocent children, women, old persons and all other people of the DPRK to be subject to monstrous sanctions and economic blockade in peace time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From the very day of the birth of the DPRK, its people have experienced sanctions and pressure, a war without gunfire, and advanced with self-reliance and self-development as the dynamic force for their existence and development. They will never give up their treasured nuclear sword for justice which has been sharpened to defeat the U.S. imperialist aggressors, even if one of them remains alive on this land. The army and people of the DPRK are now burning their hearts with the will to win the final victory and force the U.S. to pay very high price for their blood.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A merchant of the White House, ignorant of the military affairs, dares talk about \"the calm before the storm,\" \"decapitation operation\" and \"immense nuclear preemptive attack\". But, he is advised to properly roll his tongue after pondering over the consequences to be entailed by such balderdash.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The rabid man in the White House should be mindful that he will first face the immense volley of nuclear fire if he hopes to settle the DPRK-U.S. confrontation with nukes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Referring to the way for settlement of the DPRK-U.S. problem, someone said that \"a bell should be taken off by who put it\", which should be appraised.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nukes of the DPRK will open up a new chapter of history with its just victory in the turning point of world politics deciding independence or supremacy."

            "content": "Representante coreano insiste en su legitimo derecho al desarrollo de cosmos\r\nPyongyang, 19 de octubre (ACNC) -- El representante coreano intervino el dia 17 durante el debate de la agenda \"Cooperacion internacional en el uso pacifico del cosmos\" en la reunion del cuarto comite (Politica especial y Descolonizacion) de la 72a sesion de la Asamblea General de la ONU.\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy dia, impulsar el desarrollo economico a traves de la explotacion del espacio constituye una tendencia internacional, dijo y anadio que la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea tambien lleva adelante esa labor con fines pacificos segun el plan quinquenal estatal de desarrollo aeroespacial y bajo el control integral del Estado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe acuerdo con ese plan quinquenal, la RPDC lanzara al espacio mucho mas satelites de uso practico, incluso el geoestacionario, que contribuiran al desarrollo economico y al mejoramiento de las condiciones de vida del pueblo, apunto y prosiguio:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl gobierno de la RPDC impulsa el uso pacifico de las actividades espaciales y por otra parte, tiene mucha atencion en el intercambio y la cooperacion internacionales en el sector sobre la base de igualdad y beneficio mutuo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi bien las actividades espaciales de la RPDC, pais signatario de varios tratados referentes al cosmos, tienen el caracter legitimo, Estados Unidos las acusa de violar las \"resoluciones de sancion\" anti-RPDC adoptadas en el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsas \"resoluciones de sancion\" inventadas por EE.UU. no pasan de ser documentos ilegales que describen el lanzamiento de satelite por la RPDC con fines pacificos como \"amenaza a la paz y seguridad internacionales\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU., lanzador del mayor numero de satelites en el mundo, califica de \"amenaza a la paz y seguridad internacionales\" el lanzamiento de satelite por parte de la RPDC, lo cual es absurdo y el climax de la pauta de doble rasero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El Tratado del Espacio estipula claramente que el espacio es la propiedad comun de la humanidad y todos los paises pueden desarrollarlo sin discriminacion alguna.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ningun articulo de dicho tratado senala que el lanzamiento de satelite constituye la \"amenaza a la paz y seguridad internacionales\" ni define la prohibicion del uso de la tecnologia de cohete balistico en el lanzamiento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El mismo hecho de que EE.UU. cuestiona nuestro justo y legitimo lanzamiento de satelite alegando esas \"resoluciones\" nominales deviene una violacion flagrante de la ley internacional y de nuestra soberania y derechos a existencia y desarrollo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Nuestro desarrollo aeroespacial de caracter pacifico es el digno derecho independiente del Estado soberano reconocido por la ley internacional, el cual no puede impedir nadie.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY la posicion de la RPDC, pais fabricador y lanzador del satelite artificial de la Tierra, no se cambia nunca aunque la niegue un pais llamado EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La RPDC acelerara en el futuro tambien el desarrollo aeroespacial con fines pacificos para conquistar el extenso universo e intensificara la cooperacion e intercambio internacionales en el lanzamiento de satelite."

            "content": "Vocero de CPME advierte a los agresores\r\nPyongyang, 19 de octubre (ACNC) -- Desde el dia 16, EE.UU. y la banda titere del Sur de Corea iniciaron en los Mares Este y Oeste de Corea los ejercicios conjuntos maritimos mas grandes en la historia, llevando asi la actual situacion tirante al umbral de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\tYa se desplegaron alli el colectivo de golpe de portaaviones nucleares Ronald Reagan, los 3 submarinos nucleares inclusive Michigan, mas de 40 buques de guerra incluyendo el destructor Aegis y los aviones de caza.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. y su lacayo surcoreano intentan dejar las propiedades estrategicas nucleares en el Sur de Corea y las aguas de su contorno, aunque terminaron los ejercicios, para introducirlas junto con el colectivo de ataque de portaaviones nucleares Theodore Roosevelt en el otro simulacro conjunto de ataque maritimo de gran envergadura a desarrollarse a fines del mes en curso.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY desde el 23 tratan de realizar los \"ejercicios NEO\" (operacion de transporte de las personas no combatientes\" para evacuar al ultramar a los estadounidenses en el Sur de Corea, planeando asi crear de modo intencional la tension en visperas de la guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto demuestra que los enemigos tomaron por un hecho consumado el \"ataque preventivo contra la RPDC\" y acechan la oportunidad para estallar sin falta una guerra en la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi subrayo el vocero del Comite Pannacional de Medidas Emergentes contra los Ejercicios de Guerra Nuclear anti-Norte en su declaracion fechada 18 y continuo:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos enemigos insisten en que los presentes ejercicios serviran de una muestra de las acciones de ataque real a asestarse contra nosotros. Pero ellos deben tener bien presente que tenemos la contramedida superintransigente de nuestro estilo tan suficiente que pueda aniquilarlos de un golpe.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU., que ubico ante nuestra nariz los objetos de primer blanco de nuestro golpe, debe saber que sufrira un ataque inimaginable en un tiempo inesperado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTampoco saldran vivos los titeres surcoreanos que convirtieron toda la extension surcoreana en un campo de guerra nuclear al introducir en su casa propia las propiedades estrategicas nucleares de EE.UU. sin percibir las futuras calamidades catastroficas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa peligrosa situacion de la Peninsula Coreana, que se lleva cada momento mas a la fase imprevisible e inadmisible, demuestra claramente que el autor que amenaza la subsistencia y el desarrollo de nuestra nacion y la causa raigal de la guerra nuclear son EE.UU. y los belicistas surcoreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tToda la nacion coreana en el Norte, el Sur y el ultramar frustrara con la fuerza unida la demencia belica de EE.UU. y los maniacos surcoreanos que intentan salir del abismo de destruccion mediante la provocacion de guerra, y asestara golpe mas duro a los agresores y los provocadores que acarrean el nubarron de la guerra nuclear."
