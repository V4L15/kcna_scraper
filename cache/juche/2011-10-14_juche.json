It is set to decide its type within this year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ministry already finished the collection of proposals for prototype fighters from manufacturing companies on Sept. 26.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is mulling the fifth generation fighter F-35 out of three proposed types.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to an Oct. 2 report, F-35 Lightning 2 is highly likely to be selected following the ease of conditions on the part of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lockheed Martin Company, the biggest U.S. military monopoly, opened to the Japanese media the production process of Stealth F-35 Lightning 2 in mid August.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is wide-spread contention over the skyrocketing price of the fighter but Japan still attempts purchasing dozens of it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This shows that it attaches importance to the replacement of the prototype fighter, a reflection of the island country's militarist ambition for reinvasion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is Japan's calculation that introduction of multi-purpose Stealth fighter like F-35 can provide favorable conditions for realizing its ambition for aggression with air superiority. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan seeks to secure capability of carrying out any combat action independently in the Asia-Pacific region by renewing prototype fighters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some time ago, the chairman of the Political Council of the Democratic Party of Japan called for extended scope of use of weapons by the \"Self-Defense Forces\" in its overseas operation. Meanwhile the defense minister openly demanded the reexamination of the three principles of arms export. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is purchasing various types of combat technical equipment from the U.S. out of its ambition to step up the modernization of military equipment necessary for realizing its bid for a military power and launch in real earnest a war for overseas aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the same time, it is pushing ahead with the drive to put the military equipment on a modern and high-performance basis. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is steadily increasing overseas operation capacity through replacing military equipment with long-range one. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now Japan is vying with the world's military giants in production of arms and the level of SDF's military equipment is very high. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On this basis the SDF's operation sphere is expanding more and more in the areas surrounding Japan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All these are a precondition for overseas aggression. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's bid for reinvasion will leads to its destruction."
