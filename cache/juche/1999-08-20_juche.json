here on Thursday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Present there were delegates of international organizations and solidarity organizations from different regions and countries and press officials of different embassies here. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Also present there were overseas compatriots who attended the '99 Grand Pro-Reunification Festival for Independence and Great Unity of the Nation and the 10th pan-national rally. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Choe Thae Bok, secretary of the c.c. of the Worker's Party of Korea and chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly of the DPRK, was among those present there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Mun Jae Chol, chairman of the Korean Committee for Solidarity with the World People, said in his speech that it was the unshakable will and faith of the DPRK government and people to clear all difficulties and obstacles from the way of national reunification with the united strength of the entire nation and accomplish the cause of national reunification in the present generation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He said that the struggle of the Korean people for national reunification is accompanied by a struggle to prevent an aggression and war and defend the peace on the Korean peninsula and in the rest of  Asia and the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He emphasized that the DPRK government and people would exert all their efforts for national reunification, invariably upholding the three charters of national reunification and the five-point policy of great national unity amid the support and encouragement from progressive humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The floor was also taken by delegates of international organizations and solidarity organizations from different regions and countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Amar Bentoumi, honorary chairman of the International Liaison Committee for Reunification and Peace in Korea and president of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, in his speech at the meeting pointed out that the main obstacle to the Korean reunification was the presence in South Korea of over 40,000 U.S. forces equipped with nuclear weapons and other sophisticated weapons and it was the main source of the escalating tensions on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Andy Brooks, delegate of the Britain-Korea friendship and solidarity movement and general secretary of the c.c. of the New Communist Party of Great Britain, said that it was the only way of achieving Korea's reunification to establish the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo on the basis of the conception of one nation, one state and two systems and two governments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Robert Williams, vice-chairman of the Latin American and Caribbean Regional Committee to support the reunification of Korea and general secretary of the Good Green Guyana, said that Korea should be reunified in accordance with the three charters of national reunification and the five-point policy of the great national unity advanced by the President Kim Il Sung and Marshal Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Gennady Berdyshev, vice-chairman of the Ukraine-DPRK Association, expressed the firm belief that the Korean people would surely emerge victorious in their struggle to build a rich, powerful and prospering nation under the guidance of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Several documents were adopted there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A resolution as regards the tense situation on the Korean peninsula vehemently denounced the  undisguised aggressive maneuvers of the U.S. To ignite a new war in Korea as a grave challenge to the human cause of peace.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe resolution strongly urged the United States to immediately halt the arms buildup and military provocations which can lead the situation on the Korean peninsula to a catastrophic crisis, mindful of the consequences to be entailed by a Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A protest letter to the government of the United States of America urged the U.S. to ponder over the serious implications of its aggressive policy towards the DPRK, warning that if a war breaks out in Korea it will rapidly spread beyond the boundary of the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the U.S. is really concerned about the peace and reunification of Korea it should honestly fulfil its promise and commitment and positively respond to the proposal on signing a peace agreement between the DPRK and U.S., it stressed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A protest letter to the Japanese government noted that it has failed to frankly repent of and liquidate the crimes committed against  the Korean people in the past although the 20th century is nearing its end and pursued a hostile policy towards the DPRK, following the anti-DPRK policy of confrontation pursued by the U.S. and the South Korean authorities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The letter lodged a strong protest against the present Japanese authorities' anti-DPRK hostile policy, considering it to be a very dangerous aggressive and militarist move to meddle in the Korean issue again and thus pave the way for overseas aggression, forgetting their inglorious past. \r\n\r\n"
