            "content": "Lee Myung Bak Regime Accused of Disturbing Peace and Security in Northeast Asia\r\n Pyongyang, January 20 (KCNA) -- The Disarmament and Peace Institute of the DPRK Foreign Ministry Friday released a report accusing the Lee Myung Bak regime of seriously disturbing the peace and security in Northeast Asia. \n\t\t\t\t\t The report said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During 4 years of office the Lee Myung Bak regime has put the north-south relations at the lowest ebb, placing peace and security in Northeast Asia at serious peril and throwing a stumbling block in the process of denuclearization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was none other than the Lee regime that plays the role of an advance party to ignite a fuse for starting a war in the Korean Peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee Myung Bak, obsessed with the pipedream of \"achieving unification through absorption\", talked about \"unification tax,\" inciting confrontation. Finally, he pushed the situation on the peninsula to a touch-and-go one where the north and the south fired shells at each other for the first time since the war that broke out on June 25, 1950. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hundreds of thousands of south Korean troops deployed in areas south of the Military Demarcation Line have already been put into a de facto state of war as they are ready to \"mount a preemptive attack and strike enemies' bases\" in case of emergency.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The report cited detailed facts that the Lee regime is a disturber of peace and security in Northeast Asia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Northeast Asia is the most sensitive area where the military powers and nuclear weapons states of the world are located close to each other or stand in military confrontation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean navy's warship \"Cheonan\" sank in south Korea in March, 2010. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee regime, however, blamed the DPRK for its sinking as if it had been waiting for it to happen. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. deployed a carrier flotilla deep in the West Sea of Korea under the pretext of fulfilling its commitment to protecting south Korea as if an opportunity had presented itself for it, thus making an important strategic breakthrough for militarily containing China. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee regime doggedly refused to accept the DPRK's request for receiving an inspection group of its National Defence Commission for fair probe into the truth behind the sinking case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was against this backdrop that the U.S. reinforced its military forces forward-deployed in Northeast Asia under the signboard of taking countermeasures and staging joint military drills to be capable of seizing and containing its rivals and satisfactorily undertaking mobile strike duty in a matter of a few months. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This led to dangerous military confrontation between China and the U.S. and more acute military conflict between Russia and the U.S. over the issue of building a missile shield.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At a time when Japan was busy launching spy satellites, the existence of the undeclared plutonium was discovered to give rise to serious concern of the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The number of U.S.-south Korea joint military maneuvers and drills sharply increased and a triangular military alliance consisting of the U.S., south Korea and Japan took a clear shape, arousing distrust of neighboring countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the unanimous judgment of many military experts at home and abroad that the construction of a large naval base on Jeju Island farthest from the Military Demarcation Line is not targeted against the DPRK but aimed at meeting the strategic purpose of the U.S. to put under control the operational theatres of the naval and air forces of China and Russia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee regime is a war servant who plays the role as a guide and a springboard for the U.S. keen to return to Asia so as to realize its dream of dominating the world at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The report brought to light the true colors of the Lee regime as a disturber of the process for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the desire of not only the Korean people but the neighboring countries and the peace-loving people of the world to denuclearize the peninsula as well as the rest of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK and other participating countries are making efforts to resume the six-party talks. But it is only the south Korean authorities that are pursuing a very ulterior aim. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee regime has resorted to all sorts of tricks and plots to politicize even the issue of the U.S. humanitarian food aid to the DPRK in a bid to bar confidence from being built between the DPRK and the U.S. for a solution to the nuclear issue. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For instance, the chief executive of Chongwadae presumptuously claimed a few days ago that \"it was not the U.S. but the north that changed its negotiating stance,\" though he was unaware of how the discussion was made on the food aid between the DPRK and the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a matter of fact, the six-party talks are an uncomfortable forum for the Lee regime as it is contrary to its \"policy towards the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The resumption of the talks would naturally help promote the implementation of the September 19 Joint Statement that calls for the normalization of relations among all participating countries for a solution to the nuclear issue and provision of aid to the DPRK including economic compensation. This would amount to such developments that may frustrate the moves of the hostile forces which begged their masters to follow \"waiting strategy\" and \"policy of strategic patience,\" hoping the DPRK would waver or yield to economic difficulties. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In case the opportunity for resuming the talks is completely missed, its blame will go to the Lee regime which played sleight of hand on the basis of a wrong policy and judgment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The anti-DPRK confrontation maniacs in south Korea have already been sidelined or have become politically dead amid world people's criticism as they were insensitive to the times and lacked vision as was the case with the Neo cons in the U.S., and the Lee regime will also be compelled to quit eventually, the report said, and continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the parties concerned in the region interested in peace, stability and denuclearization are called upon to take proactive steps to minimize the consequences caused by the Lee regime."

Therefore, it can never be a plaything of outside forces for aggression under any circumstances. \n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Friday says this in a bylined article. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the issue of national reunification is to be solved according to the will and wishes of the Korean nation, it is necessary to view and approach everything from an independent stand and resolutely reject interference by outside forces, the article says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is important to give priority to the nation. The destiny of an individual depends on the fate of the nation. Adhering to the stand of national independence alone can ensure the dignity and sovereignty of all members of the nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the bounden duty and obligation of all members of the nation to attach importance to the nation and place the common interests of the nation above anything else in the present era when it is advancing under the banner of June 15 joint declaration. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The master key to improving the inter-Korean relations and bringing a rosy future of national reunification and prosperity lies in firmly maintaining the stand of national independence and placing the nation above anything else as required by the north-south declarations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The struggle to uphold and implement the declarations is accompanied by a struggle to meet all the anti-reunification challenges. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All Koreans at home and abroad should resolutely maintain the above-said stands called for by the joint New Year editorial and thus brilliantly decorate this year as a year of victory for bringing about a landmark phase of national reunification."

            "content": "Instituto de MINREX revela crimenes del \"poder\" de Lee Myung Bak\r\nPyongyang, 20 de enero (ACNC) -- El Instituto de Desarme y Paz del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea publico el dia 19 un informe de estudio que revela los crimenes del \"poder\" de Lee Myung Bak que ha perturbado gravemente la paz y la seguridad de la region del Nordeste Asiatico.\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante 4 anos de su mandato, el \"poder\" de Lee llevo las relaciones intercoreanas a la peor coyuntura, puso en serio peligro la paz y la seguridad del Nordeste Asiatico y genero grandes obstaculos para el proceso de desnuclearizacion, comienza el texto y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl \"poder\" de Lee sirve de mecha de guerra en la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEnloquecido por su ambicion de la \"reunificacion a modo de absorcion\", Lee se dedico a la campana conflictiva con el Norte (de Corea) planteando hasta el \"impuesto de reunificacion\" y empeoro la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana a tal punto que el Norte y el Sur intercambiaron los obuses de artilleria por primera vez despues de la guerra coreana del 25 de junio de 1950.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora, cientos de miles de efectivos surcoreanos desplegados en la parte sur de la linea de demarcacion militar estan pasando practicamente al estado de guerra como el de \"ataque preventivo, el de punto de origen\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl \"poder\" de Lee es el perturbador de la paz y la seguridad de la region del Nordeste Asiatico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta region es la mas delicada donde las potencias militares y los paises poseedores de armas nucleares del mundo estan colindados o se enfrentan militarmente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn marzo de 2010, ocurrio en el Sur de Corea el hundimiento de la corbeta \"Cheonan\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo si hubiera esperado ese caso, el \"poder\" de Lee lo relaciono injustamente con la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAprovechandolo, EE.UU. dio una importante coyuntura estrategica capaz de impedir en lo militar China a su favor al mandar su flotilla de portaaviones al Mar Oeste de Corea en funcion de su compromiso a la defensa del Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras que el \"poder\" de Lee rechazaba hasta el final la demanda del grupo de inspeccion del Comite de Defensa Nacional de la RPDC sobre el esclarecimiento imparcial de lo ocurrido realmente en ese incidente, EE.UU. termino en unos meses bajo el cartel de \"contramedidas\" y ejercicios militares conjuntos la preparacion de sus fuerzas militares distribuidas en las zonas avanzadas del Nordeste Asiatico para cumplir las misiones de cercar, disuadir y atacar con movilidad a sus rivales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo resultado, se crea entre China y EE.UU. el peligroso estado de confrontacion militar y se agudizan las contradicciones militares entre Rusia y EE.UU. en torno al establecimiento del sistema antimisiles. Mientras tanto, en Japon toma auge el lanzamiento de satelites artificiales de espionaje y se descubrio una reserva de plutonio no declarada, lo cual causa seria preocupacion del mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe realizan con mas frecuencia los ejercicios miliares conjuntos EE.UU.-Sur de Corea y esta tomando el perfil la alianza militar tripartita que incluye ademas a Japon. Este hecho esta centrando la mirada de desconfianza de los paises vecinos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor otra parte, muchos expertos militares nacionales y extranjeros reconocen unanimemente que la construccion de una base naval de gran dimension en la isla Jeju, muy lejana de la Linea de Demarcacion Militar, no es una medida frente a la RPDC sino la que conviene a la estrategia de EE.UU. de restringir el teatro operacional de las fuerzas navales y aereas de China y Rusia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn fin de cuentas, el \"poder\" de Lee es el lacayo de guerra que actua como guia y puente de EE.UU. que persigue el \"retorno a Asia\" para realizar su antano sueno de tomar la heguemonia mundial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl \"poder\" de Lee es el que estropea la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa desnuclearizacion de esta region es un eslabon de la del mundo entero y constituye la aspiracion unanime del pueblo coreano y sus vecinos y la humanidad pacifista del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Las autoridades surcoreanas son las unicas que no se suman a los esfuerzos de los demas participantes en las conversaciones a 6 bandas, inclusive la RPDC, por reanudar esta cita.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA decir la verdad, este dialogo es un espacio incomodo para el \"poder\" de Lee porque no conviene a su \"politica sobre el Norte\". Si se reanuda la cita, se impulsara de modo automatico la implementacion de la Declaracion Conjunta del 19 de Septiembre que preve normalizar las relaciones entre todos los paises participantes y asegurar a la RPDC la recompensacion economica y otras cooperaciones para solucionar el problema nuclear. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTal evolucion de la situacion puede frustrar el designio de las autoridades surcoreanas que suplicaron a sus amos mantener la \"estrategia de espera\" y la politica de \"paciencia estrategica\", deseando que la RPDC se desplome o se rinda por sus dificultades economicas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi se pierde para siempre la oportunidad de reanudar las conversaciones a 6 bandas, la responsabilidad recaera sobre el \"poder\" de Lee que se dedica a las artimanas por sus intereses faltos de vision y egoistas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo sucedio en el caso de neoconservadores de EE.UU., los elementos de confrontacion anti-RPDC surcoreanos, insensibles a la corriente de la epoca y cortos de vision, tuvieron que retirarse ya en medio de condenacion de todo el mundo. Asi sera el destino del \"poder\" de Lee Myung Bak.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los paises de la region interesados en la paz, la estabilidad y la desnuclearizacion deberan tomar buenas medidas para minimizar las consecuencias de lo que ha cometido el \"poder\" de Lee."
