Nakayama, a former mandarin of the Japanese Cabinet, addressing a meeting of the Liberal Democratic Party, uttered that it is important to get U.S. cooperation for the solution to the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As if it were not enough with the noisy anti-DPRK racket kicked up by the Japanese reactionaries after faking up the story about \"false remains\", they are becoming so foolish as to work hard to \"internationalize the abduction issue\". This indicates that they are seeking to tarnish the image of the DPRK in the international arena and use the \"abduction issue\" as a \"card\" for attaining their political aim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Explicitly speaking once again, Japan's loud-mouthed \"abduction issue\" occurred in the past against the background of their hostile relationship and it had already been fully settled. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK government took a broad-minded and good will measure to meet the request of Japanese side for the settlement of the issue with the Japanese prime minister's two visits to Pyongyang as a momentum. As a result, abductees and all their children went back to Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At working-level contacts between the governments of the two countries the DPRK side delivered all materials and documents related to the reinvestigation conducted into the Japanese dead as requested by the Japanese side. And it also took such utmost humanitarian step as handing over the remains of a Japanese woman which have been kept by her husband to the Japanese side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This being a hard reality, those who claim to be Japanese politicians are seriously desecrating the idea of humanitarianism of the DPRK and complicating the situation over the already-settled \"issue\" in a bid to dramatize it among  the international community. This clearly indicates what deplorable phase their shamelessness and moral vulgarity, trite and inveterate bad habit peculiar to Japan, have reached. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Just as the justice of the world and progressive mankind declared 60 years ago, Japan is the biggest war criminal and abductor in history. As far as the abduction issue is concerned, Japan is an assailant and the DPRK a victim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Early in the 20th century Japan occupied Korea by force of arms and left no means untried in kidnapping and drafting young and middle-aged Koreans and drove them to battle sites and places where mediaeval slave labor was done as it escalated its war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During its occupation of Korea Japan abducted and drafted at least 8.4 million Koreans, taking the lives of more than one million of them and forcing at least 200,000 Korean women into sexual slavery for the imperial Japanese army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan, which had committed the thrice-cursed crimes by abducting Koreans, should have honestly repented of its crime-woven past and settled it right after its defeat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even after its defeat Japan took direct part in the Korean war of aggression ignited by the U.S. It has since hampered by hook or by crook the development of the DPRK and the reunification of Korea, applying sanctions against the DPRK and putting pressure on it in a bid to isolate and stifle it. Japan has never ceased its national discrimination and suppression of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan and Koreans in Japan, adding to its past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's much talk about \"internationalizing the abduction issue\" is nothing but a foolish attempt to cover up its crimes and completely evade the responsibility to liquidate its past by painting the ferocious  assailant as a \"pitiful victim.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's liquidation of the past is not a simple humanitarian issue left to it to decide but a political issue that should be settled without fail, a de facto international issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n History can neither be negated nor altered. The statute of limitation is not applicable to the crimes against humanity that remain unredeemed  Japan's intention to justify its crime-woven past and evade its responsibility for the settlement of the past is an intolerable insult and challenge to the Korean people and a mockery of human conscience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people in the DPRK keep a full tab on Japan's 100-odd-year long history of crimes against Korea and will use every means and method to force it to pay for them to the end.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
