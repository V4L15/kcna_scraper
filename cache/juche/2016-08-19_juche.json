Korea\r\n Pyongyang, August 19 (KCNA) -- The Switzerland-Korea Committee and the Swiss Group for the Study of the Juche Idea on August 13 made public a joint statement in denunciation of the Park Geun Hye group for persistently finding fault with the DPRK to evade the blame for the decision on THAAD deployment in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Hye describes THAAD deployment as one to cope with the \"threat\" from the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She dares try to compare THAAD with the nuclear deterrence of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nuclear deterrence of the DPRK can never be a bargaining one.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Threat of a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula comes from the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea will reduce to the advanced base of the U.S. for aggression as long as Park Geun Hye, top-class pro-U.S. lackey, remains in power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is necessary to decisively throw overboard the Park Geun Hye group to achieve peace on the Korean peninsula as it is a disgrace to the Korean nation and trouble-maker of the international community."

            "content": "Cineastas coreanos condenan la fabricacion de peliculas anti-RPDC en Sur de Corea\r\nPyongyang, 19 de agosto (ACNC) -- Desde cuando tomo el mandato del Sur de Corea la camarilla de Park Geun-hye vino produciendo y proyectando muchas peliculas que difaman injustamente el regimen de la RPDC y fomentan la confrontacion fratricida, malgastando fabulosos impuestos de la poblacion surcoreana.\n\t\t\t\t\tUltimamente, fabrico sin titubeo los filmes como \"Batalla maritima de Yonphyong\" y \"Operacion de desembarco de Inchon\", justificando las imprudentes provocaciones armadas de agresion al Norte y los actos agresivos de Estados Unidos y los titeres surcoreanos, inculcando el ambiente belico y tergiversando atrevida y absurdamente el sistema politico y la vida dichosa del pueblo de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHace poco, la traidora Park participo en el llamado \"preestreno de pelicula\" junto con sus lacayos y orquesto unas payasadas como la \"campana de recaudacion de dinero\" y la \"ceremonia de premiacion\" a fin de elevar la atencion social a la fabricacion de filmes anti-RPDC. Y obligo a proyectarlos en todos los cines.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn su declaracion fechada 19, el vocero del Comite Central de la Union de Cineastas de Corea lo califica de una imprudencia antinacional y anti-reunificacion para fomentar entre los jovenes y estudiantes y los habitantes surcoreanos la enemistad a su connacional y llevar a la fase catastrofica las relaciones intercoreanas en el peor estado conflictivo, y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas tentativas de la horda traidora de Park de fabricar los filmes anti-RPDC navegando a contrapelo de la demanda de la epoca, persiguen la malsana intencion de justificar su politica conflictiva al fomentar entre la poblacion surcoreana la hostilidad y la desconfianza a su connacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark debe saber correctamente que con cualesquier ardides no podra impedir jamas la aspiracion de los habitantes surcoreanos a la reunificacion y su deseo vehemente por la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos cineastas surcoreanos deben distinguir correctamente la naturaleza traidora de los compinches traidores en vez de adherirse a la campana de Park de producir los filmes de caracter conflictivo. Y deben desarrollar las actividades creativas favorables para la reconciliacion y la unidad de la nacion, cumpliendo asi con su mision y deber asumidos ante la epoca y la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta farsa anacronica de la traidora Park adelantara solo el momento de su fin tragico."
