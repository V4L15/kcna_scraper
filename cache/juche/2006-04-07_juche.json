            "content": "KCNA Blasts U.S. Economic Aggression \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 6 (KCNA) -- In the new century the United States revealed its unlimited ambition to put under its control areas rich in oil, gas, diamond and ferrous and nonferrous mineral in the world. This economic aggression sparked ceaseless fratricidal wars in different countries and led to the seizure of territories of other countries and plunder of their people.\r\n The U.S. is a country which advocates war as it cannot exist without aggression and plunder. \r\n One may say the U.S. made its appearance on this earth to swallow up the whole world. That is why it seeks economic profits in the most avaricious and brigandish manner in history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Big American monopolies are exercising a great influence on shaping national policies and implementing them in quest of concessions as all economic arteries including industry, transport, post and telecommunications, finance and trade are under their control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The national mechanisms are executing the policies reflecting the interests of these big monopolies, which control both economic arteries and state power, orienting the political situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. considers war and \"aid\" as two levers for economic plunder.\r\n Whenever these big monopolies find themselves in an unavoidable chronic economic crisis, they seek a way out of it in the militarization of the economy and arms race.\r\n U.S. economic \"aid\" for other countries is another form of aggression under the signboard of \"humanitarianism\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the past, multinational corporations of the U.S. made their ways into those developing countries which were suffering economic difficulties under the signboard of \"aid.\" But they reaped profits four or five times and even more than 10 times for every U.S. dollar invested. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the 6th ministerial meeting of the WTO held in late last year the U.S. announced its plan to raise its annual financial assistance to developing countries in trade to 2.7 billion dollars from 1.3 billion dollars by 2010. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the world public put it, this is nothing but \"a relief fund with strings attached.\" \r\n The true aim sought by the U.S. is to realize an unlimited overseas expansion of its monopoly capital and put the world economy under its control. \r\n The \"national security strategy report\" formally made public by the U.S. in 2000 called on the U.S. to guide the world and lay groundwork for its security and prosperity in the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At that time the U.S. economy was in the grip of an uncontrollable economic crisis caused by serious economic stagnation, sluggish export and increased unemployment, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Much upset by this, the U.S. tried hard to find a way out of the socio-political and economic crisis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the September 11 incident broke out just at the right moment in 2001 the U.S. lost no time to put up the signboard of \"anti-terrorism.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It chose Afghanistan and Iraq as the primary targets to implement its scheme.\r\n The wars proceeded just as it expected. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Munitions companies across the U.S. including four big American munitions corporations: Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Raytheon and T.R.W. operated in full capacity thanks to these new wars. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. oil companies, in the meantime, were free to extract oil from the war-torn countries and oil markets in Mid-east came to be monopolized by big American oil companies such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron-Texaco. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is stretching out its tentacles of economic aggression to all countries and regions of the world to bring greater benefits to its big monopolies.\r\n The U.S. world strategy is now focused on Asia-Pacific. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. deems it very important for carrying out its strategy to dominate the world to put Asia-Pacific, especially Northeast Asia, which is of great strategic importance and rich in natural resources, under its control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It considers the Korean Peninsula as an important forward strategic strongpoint given the fact that its strategy to dominate the world in the 21st century is to include Northeast Asia in sphere of its influence and put world politics and economy under its control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the major reason why the U.S. is hyping the \"nuclear issue\", seeking to internationalize \"economic sanctions\" against the DPRK and escalating tension on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. \"war on terrorism\" helped it expand the sphere of its military domination in Asia and secure launching bases in different areas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It built military bases in several union republics of the former Soviet Union and even in areas bordering China. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. stoked mistrust among countries of the former Soviet Union and sparked civil wars there in a bid to grab oil and gas resources in the region.\r\n The \"war against terrorism\" fought by the U.S. forces in the Trans-Caucasian areas and the Black Sea littoral countries is also aimed at grabbing oil in Caspian Sea.\r\n By intensifying its military inroads into the Black Sea littoral countries the U.S. seeks to draw a line of confrontation from the Black Sea to Central Asia across the Caucasia and thus contain Russia over the issue of strategic resources. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has also expanded its military domination and interference in Africa.\r\n It has laid springboards from which to perpetrate economic pillage in Asia, Europe, Latin-America, Africa and almost all other areas of the world. \r\n What has the U.S. economic aggression brought to the world?\r\n All those countries and regions that suffered from the U.S. military intervention and its economic plunder are ridden, without exception, with fratricidal wars, domestic conflicts, murder, arson, plunder and all forms of other crimes and social evils.\r\n The world can never be peaceful as long as the U.S. is allowed to pursue its unlimited ambition to establish an \"empire\" dominated by its own view on value in the world at the sacrifice of world people and seek its own pleasure and prosperity.\r\n  The world should heighten vigilance against the U.S. economic aggression.\r\n The U.S.-imposed war crisis and politico-economic chaos is not what humankind is fated to undergo in the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. unilateral and arrogant domestic and foreign policies defying the international community are only aggravating its self-contradictions and hastening its self-destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the countries and people desirous of peace and progress should take joint actions against the U.S. economic aggression.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "DPRK Foreign Ministry's Spokesman Slams Japan's Claim to Tok Islet\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 6 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry in a statement issued on April 6 accused the Japanese authorities of recently allowing the description of Tok Islet as part of Japan's territory in the history textbooks for high schools after instructing the same thing as regards textbooks for middle schools last year.\r\n Branding such behavior as an unpardonable shameless act peculiar to Japan, the statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It admits of no argument that the islet belongs to Korea's territory from the historical point of view and in the light of international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the Japanese authorities have obstinately insisted that the islet belongs to Japan's territory. Obviously this is prompted by their wild ambition for aggression and territorial expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is keen to realize its wild ambition of reinvasion, oblivious of the historical lesson drawn from the bitter defeat it suffered after setting out on overseas aggression under the slogan of \"The Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\" in the past. \r\n Japan keeps tampering with its history and its chief executive continues visiting the \"Yasukuni Shrine\" despite the unanimous curses and denunciations of the international community including its neighboring countries. All this is mainly attributable to the U.S. backing and patronage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is now under strong fire by its neighboring countries for its claims that not only Tok Islet but Diaoyu Islands and the Southern Kurils belong to its territory.\r\n The historical lesson requires the countries in the region never to allow Japan's wild ambition for territorial expansion but heighten the vigilance against it and jointly react to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality today when there exist close to the DPRK the dangerous bellicose forces getting frantic in their wild ambition for territorial expansion clearly proves once again that Pyongyang was entirely just when it took measures to steadily bolster the military capability for self-defence including nuclear deterrent to defend the peace and security in the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries would be well advised to stop their moves for territorial expansion and racket against the DPRK and the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan that may result in their self-destruction, and behave with discretion, drawing a lesson from history.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
