Earlier, on October 19 he cried for arms buildup under the pretext of \"security\", taking issue with the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His call for confrontation with the north is a total challenge to the June 15 north-south joint declaration and an unpardonable insult to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has made all sincerity and efforts to implement the declaration to meet the great expectation and desire of the nation. Its active efforts have led to unprecedented successes in inter-Korean relations, which is well known to the South Korean military authority. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If he had an iota of national conscience, he should refrain from turning back the trend of the times oriented towards reconciliation, cooperation, peace and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The stance of confrontation makes it impossible to achieve reconciliation, cooperation, peace and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His recent argument about \"provocation\" by the north and \"military threat\" betrayed the position of confrontation with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His anti-DPRK diatribe proves that the South Korean authorities still regard the north as their \"arch enemy.\" It is a deliberate and premeditated provocation to reverse the declaration and bring inter-Korean relations back to the relations of confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean authorities should have a correct understanding of the trend of the times and act with discretion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they truly want to implement the declaration, they should do away with such advocates of inter-Korean confrontation as jo song Thae and immediately give up war exercises and arms buildup that pose threat to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is limit to the patience of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will watch the future action of the South Korean authorities. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
