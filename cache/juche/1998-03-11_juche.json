Then a new history of nature-remaking drive for planting trees on mountains and hills was started in Korea and that day has been commemorated as day of tree planting in the country.\r\n   It was emphasized at the meetings that all the working people, youth and schoolchildren should turn out as one in the tree-planting campaign for the prosperity of the country in hearty response to the Workers' Party of Korea's far-reaching plan on land development.\r\n   The meetings called for planting trees in an intensive and effective way on the day and in the month of tree planting. It was also stressed that a large number of persimmon, cryptomeria, Pyongyang poplar and other trees should be planted so as to create timber forests, forests of economic value, reserved forests and ornamental forests in a far-sighted way and turn towns, the countryside, streets, villages and workplaces into gardens and parks.     \r\n\r\n"

He held that the South Korean authorities should discard the policy of dependence on outside forces and turn to a pro-north reconciliation policy.\r\n   Samuel Warker, Chairman of the Guyanese Labour Union, said in a press statement that the South Korean authorities should remove the institutional and physical obstacles blocking the improvement of inter-Korean relations to express bona fides to open a phase favorable to Korea's reunification. It is a prerequisite for the peace and peaceful reunification of Korea to pull down the concrete wall, abolish the \"National Security Law\" and dissolve the \"Agency for National Security Planning\", he said.    \r\n \r\n\r\n"

The call for the \"sustained nuclear retaliation threat\" is just motivated by this view of theirs.\r\n   The U.S. nuclear weapons are levelled at the developing countries, revolutionary and independent countries in particular. It cannot be overlooked that the United States regards the DPRK as the main target of its nuclear strategy.\r\n   The DPRK's \"possible attack on the U.S.\" advertized by the U.S. bellicose elements is a fiction invented to justify their nuclear strategy. It is the United States that is seeking military threat, blackmail and attack. It is the height of shamelessness that the United States is trying to attack other countries with the nuclear stick while branding them as attackers.\r\n   The U.S. nuclear threat to other countries cannot be justified in any case.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
