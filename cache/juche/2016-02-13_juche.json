In fact, they were acute politico-military confrontations between the DPRK and the U.S.-led multi-national forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At that time, the U.S. exerted unprecedented political isolation, economic blockade and military pressure on the DPRK for the latter's disobedience to the former's policy of aggression and attempted to bring a nuclear disaster to the Korean Peninsula. The U.S. and its followers concentrated the spearhead of attack on the DPRK holding fast to socialism, with collapse of socialism in some countries as a momentum.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and some dishonest forces of the IAEA compelled the DPRK to accept an ad-hoc inspection, pulling it up over its peaceful nuclear program. In another development, the U.S. declared the resumption of the temporarily-suspended Team Spirit joint military exercises, kicking off the movement of its huge armed forces toward the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under such grave situation, Kim Jong Il issued an order of the Supreme Commander on declaring a state of semi-war to the whole country, all the people and the entire army on March 8, Juche 82 (1993). Then, a statement of the DPRK government was announced on March 12 on its withdrawal from NPT.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After all, the U.S. could not but sign the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework, the keynote of which is to offer light water reactors to the DPRK, and send the president's letter of assurance to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In early 2000s, the U.S. again sought to suffocate the DPRK over its peaceful nuclear facilities, announcing the OPLAN 5027, a scenario of nuclear preemptive attack on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To cope with such challenge, the DPRK made clear its determination to possess nuclear deterrent and conducted a nuclear test successfully.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the long run, the DPRK emerged a politico-military giant and a full-fledged nuclear-weapons state, reducing the arrogant U.S. to submission.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Today the great historic feats Kim Jong Il performed to display the tremendous power of the DPRK are shining more brilliantly under the guidance of supreme leader Kim Jong Un."

Whenever an opportunity presents itself, the U.S. claims that the DPRK had access to nuclear weapons illegally and that is disturbing peace in the Korean Peninsula and the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Saturday in a commentary terms this a deliberate act to misrepresent the situation in disregard of the reality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The commentary goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Every happening has reason and consequences. The DPRK had access to nuclear weapons entirely because of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. designated the DPRK as its enemy from the moment it was born and ignited a war against it and has posed a nuclear threat to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Neither international organization nor international treaty has helped ward off the U.S. undisguised nuclear threat to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Access to nuclear weapons was the only option to cope with it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK was compelled to defend the sovereignty of the country and the security of the nation from the U.S. ever-escalating nuclear threat. In the long run, the U.S. pushed the DPRK to having access to nuclear weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No one is allowed to take issue with the DPRK's access to nuclear weapons as it is legitimate and justifiable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If peace is to be ensured in the Korean Peninsula, the U.S. should roll back its hostile policy toward the DPRK and opt for concluding a peace treaty with it, to begin with.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK, therefore, has long proposed the U.S. to replace the fragile Armistice Agreement by a peace treaty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whether a peaceful climate is created in the peninsula or not entirely depends how the U.S. responds to the DPRK's proposal, the commentary concludes."

Libya soon surrendered as it had not been used to sanctions but North Korea has been exposed to decades of sanctions and, therefore, sanctions would not work on it, it added. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It also held that the U.S. government should understand that the way of stopping North Korea from expanding its capabilities for nuclear development is to conclude a peace treaty with it and normalize relations with it, urging the U.S. to face up to the reality and create conditions for North Korea to respond to the demands of the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The January issue of the U.S. Bulletin of Atomic Scientists in its story underscored the need for the world to engage North Korea in order to defuse the nuclear danger, not just reeling off a spate of rhetoric. Now is the time to have a sincere dialogue with North Korea, not to further isolation, the story noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The media were unanimous in their assertion that the U.S. administration has to behave to swim with the trend of the times, not clinging to the old anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Decades of the U.S. moves to stifle the DPRK only heightened the anti-Americanism among the service personnel and people of the DPRK and only pushed the DPRK-U.S. relations to the point of explosion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Sanctions and pressure will never work on the DPRK which has been exposed to all kinds of sanctions and blockade for decades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Despite the enemies' ever-increasing threats and sanctions the foundation of the Juche-oriented self-supporting economy of the DPRK has been further consolidated and its nuclear deterrence for defending the sovereignty has also been bolstered on a daily basis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. external policy for aggression has rendered the situation constantly tense in the Korean Peninsula which is situated in the center of Northeast Asia, a very sensitive area beset with lots of socio-historical and political and military problems.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The fundamental and best way of defusing such tension and preventing such a serious situation is to put a definite end to the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK and to establish durable and lasting peace-keeping mechanism in the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. administration would be well advised to roll back its anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK and face up to the trend of the times and the development of situation and behave with a proper outlook."
