            "content": "S. Korea's plan to purchase plutonium assailed\r\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 20 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today comes out with a signed commentary flailing the South Korean authorities' plan to purchase plutonium. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Federation of Environmental Movement Organisations in South Korea and Green Peace at a joint press conference said that a nuclear fuel stock company of Britain and a nuclear fuel company of France have already opened their agencies in Seoul to implement contracts with the South Korean authorities on the supply of plutonium, the news analyst of the paper says, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such move of the South Korean authorities is a serious behaviour aimed at nullifying the \"joint declaration on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The joint declaration clearly underlines the fact that the north and the south of Korea should neither produce nor introduce nuclear weapons but use nuclear energy only for a peaceful purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Nevertheless, the South Korean authorities plan to purchase plutonium to make preparations for a nuclear war, not for a peaceful purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Some forces are covertly instigating the South Korean authorities to purchase plutonium, conniving at their misbehaviour. This is as good as a war crime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If a thermo-nuclear war breaks out on the Korean peninsula, it will soon spread all over the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Then, the South Korean authorities and the forces who have encouraged their misbehaviour will be accountable for this alike. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Revolutionary song and lifeguard\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, September 20 (KCNA) -- The indomitable communist revolutionary fighter Kim Jong Suk of Korea was a model of lifeguards who was single-heartedly loyal to the President Kim Il Sung. She was born on December 24, 1917 and passed away on September 22, 1949. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It was thanks to her tireless efforts and dedication that the immortal revolutionary song \"Song of General Kim Il Sung\" was produced and is loved by people all over the world as a song of struggle and a song of revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In Juche 35 (1946) the people from all walks of life across Korea sincerely wished to have a song of President Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   That was also her lifelong desire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Since then she had paid deep attention to the composition of the song of Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   She met the poet, who had proposed to write words of the song, and explained to him the undying exploits the President performed by liberating Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   She said that the steep ranges of Mt. Paektu, every bend of the River Amnok and the River Tuman and flower gardens of liberated Korea were marked with the sacred footsteps of the President, who devoted his all to the independence of the country and the people's happiness. Noting that she firmly believed the day would come when people would talk like a legend about the great love of the President, a hero for all ages and a peerless patriot, and the immortal exploits performed by him on behalf of the fatherland and the nation, she stressed that his august name, indeed, would be cherished in the hearts of the Korean people for all ages. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What she said became the idea and solemn rhythm of the revolutionary song for which the poet searched with great pains. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The poet completed the words of the song reflecting the idea and passion she had instilled into him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This was how the song saw the light in July 1946. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This was the first paean the Korean people presented to the President in the liberated country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"Song of General Kim Il Sung\" was not created by any poet or any composer but it was possible entirely thanks to her teachings and leadership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Her immortal exploit associated with the song will remain shining forever with this enduring song.  \r\n\r\n"
