This is an unwavering determination of Kim Jong Il and the will of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The situation remains tense on the Korean peninsula as it is beset with more acute issues than the gulf region and the Balkans. But, the enemies dare not invade the DPRK. This is because of his special qualities characterized by correct judgement, firm resolution and merciless strike. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He put forward the original idea that the army precisely means the people, the state and the party, and has energetically led the work to strengthen the army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Over the last five years, he has inspected more than 430 units. He has covered at least 48,000 km to visit units of the three services and military academies at all levels.   The KPA servicemen have demonstrated the spirit of annihilating the enemy, singing the song \"We Will Emerge Victorious Flying Flag of Supreme Commander.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Only victory is in store for the DPRK flying the flag of the Supreme Commander. \r\n\r\n"

Its ulterior aim is to exercise the right of military action, unhindered and unrestricted, to ignite another war in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. warmongers, talking about an \"emergency\" on the Korean peninsula these days, are strengthening the \"quick reaction posture\" of their forces in and around South Korea and hastening preparations to rapidly hurl their forces in the U.S. mainland into the Korean front. This indicates that outbreak of the second Korean war is imminent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   For the United States to abandon its persistent hostile policy toward the DPRK and conclude a peace accord with the DPRK is a prerequisite for defusing the tense situation prevailing on the Korean peninsula and preventing a war there. \r\n\r\n"

Peace, therefore, is the noose around the imperialists. They, far from making a present of peace to the people, leave no stone unturned to wreck it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Now international reactionaries and renegades of socialism cry for living on good terms and cooperating with them rather than fighting. Their allegation is meant to give in to imperialists and serve them as slaves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The renegades of socialism cry for compromise with imperialism because they fail to see through the aggressive, predatory and crafty nature of imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Imperialism still remains unchanged. Only its method of aggression and plunder has changed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The popular desire for living in peace can come true only in the world minus imperialism. It can be realised only when the people fight up against imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   One of the important matters in the anti-imperialist struggle for the present is to foil the imperialists' regional strategy and divide-and-destroy-one-by-one strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   No matter how formidable they may be, they become powerless, when confronted with the people united in one mind. Only when the people adhere to the principled stand on imperialism anytime and anywhere and fight against it, can they realize desire for peace without fail. \r\n\r\n"
