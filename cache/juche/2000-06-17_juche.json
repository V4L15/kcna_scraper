Korean Red Cross president \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 17 (KCNA) -- Chairman Jang Jae On of the central committee of the Red Cross Society of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  today sent to president Jong Won Sik of the South Korean Red Cross a telephone message proposing to have Red Cross talks of the north and south of Korea at an early date. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The message says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As already known, in the historic north-south joint declaration adopted in Pyongyang on June 15 both sides agreed to solve as soon as possible humanitarian issues including exchange of visiting groups of separated families and relatives and repatriation of unconverted long-term prisoners, on the occasion of august 15 this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In this regard the north side proposes to the south side to have talks between Red Cross organisations of the north and south at an early date. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is reasonable to have as an agenda of the talks \"on measure to solve humanitarian issues laid down in the north-south joint declaration\" and form a delegation of each side with the deputy chief of Red Cross organisation as the head, two delegates and two or three suite members. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is our desire to have panmunjom as the venue of the talks and hold the talks in June. We request your side to fix a date you think convenient. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Looking forward to your side's positive response. \r\n\r\n"

This development brought the inter-Korean relations back to those before the adoption of the agreements. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. took every opportunity to say the improvement of the inter-Korean relations was welcome. If that is true, it should closely follow the positive development on the Korean peninsula and change its stand and position, though belatedly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The withdrawal of the U.S. forces from South Korea should be the first step to be taken by the U.S. to help the Koreans achieve the reunification of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Unshakable is the will of the Korean nation to reunify the country by its own efforts without interference of outside forces under any circumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   No force on earth can quell the ardent desire of the 70 million fellow countrymen in the north, south and overseas for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the U.S. again disturbs or interferes in the Korean nation's efforts for reunification, failing to properly judge its will for it, the U.S. will be certainly censured and condemned by the Korean nation and the peace-loving people of the world as the sworn enemy of reunification, arch criminal responsible for the growing tensions and chieftain of aggression and war. \r\n\r\n"

This is the most reasonable and fair and aboveboard method of reunification that neither allows any side's upper hand and pursuit of interests nor hurts either side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Any Korean who loves the country and the nation and values peace should make all efforts for the independent and peaceful reunification of the country. \r\n\r\n"
