The U.S. has massively beefed up its nuclear forces since it developed and produced its first A-bombs in the 1940s, pursuant to the nuclear doctrine that \"those who have nukes dominate the world.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat matters is that due to the U.S. nuclear policy the world is heading for a nuclear arms race whether it likes or not.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is clear that the U.S. has not developed nukes just to exhibit them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMany people of the world began feeling the urgent need to build nuclear forces, greatly angered by the ferocious nature of the U.S. which posed nuclear threat to its hostile states after dropping A-bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This brought an era of nuclear arms race to the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe same can be said of the reason why the DPRK had access to nuclear weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK was compelled to take an option for nuclear development which required huge funds, manpower and a lot of time. This was an inevitable security measure for self-defence taken to cope with the situation where the U.S. singled out the DPRK as a target of the former's preemptive nuclear attack and pursued ceaseless moves to start a nuclear war against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Frankly speaking, it was none other than the U.S. that drove the DPRK to nuclear weaponization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There are now nuclear weapons huge enough to destroy the earth hundreds of times. They are adversely affecting peace and development of humankind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is entirely to blame for this grave situation, concludes the commentary."

The group is, however, sadly mistaken if it thinks it can evade the responsibility for having bedeviled the inter-Korean relations with such a poor trick.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The traitor has pushed the inter-Korean relations to so serious and dangerous phase that such poor word-mongering would not help mislead public opinion at home and abroad or evade the responsibility.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter what rhetoric the group of traitors may let loose, it can never evade the blame for having driven the north-south relations to an uncontrollable phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group is working hard to divert elsewhere the criticism of it and justify its criminal \"policy toward the north\" with an eye to keep pursuing it. It is crystal clear to everybody that this is prompted by its criminal intention to further deteriorate the inter-Korean relations and provoke a war of aggression against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t While striving to solve the national issue, the DPRK can never deal with such traitors as they are steeped in the traitorous way of thinking not to allow any switchover in their confrontational stand, utterly indifferent to the fate of the inter-Korean relations, and they do not feel guilty of the hideous crimes they have committed against the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the unshakable will of the army and people of the DPRK to settle accounts with the Lee group to the last as it is desperately trying to do harm to the DPRK with daggers under its belt. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of traitors will certainly be forced to pay a dear price for the unpardonable acts of treachery they have committed, going against the trend of the times."
