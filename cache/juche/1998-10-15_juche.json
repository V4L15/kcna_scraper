They will be attended by six warships, including aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk, missile cruiser vincennes and amphibious assault ship belleau wood of the U.S. forces in Japan and the third expedition of the U.S. marine corps based in Okinawa.\r\n   The projected unprecedented-in-scope manoeuvres are perilous in that they are all-round war exercises against the DPRK for examination of \"preparations for a new war in the 21st century.\"\r\n   The \"emergency\" on the Korean peninsula on the lips of the U.S. is, in essence, another Korean War. Accordingly, the \"preparations for a new war in the 21st century\" means those for another Korean War.\r\n   The U.S., in league with the South Korean authorities, seeks in the manoeuvres to examine \"preparations for a new war,\" \"round them off\" and open a decisive phase for the outbreak of another Korean War, bringing  the situation on the Korean peninsula to the extreme pitch of strain.\r\n   The war gamble designed to consolidate the new \"U.S.-Japan guidelines for defence cooperation\" on which the two countries agreed  last year and to carry into practice a \"theatre missile defense\" programme is advertised as the U.S.-South Korea joint manoeuvres. In actuality, the manoeuvres are an all-out war gamble of the U.S., Japan and South Korea to stifle the DPRK by \"force of arms.\" the manoeuvres, therefore, deserve curses and denunciation from the Korean people.\r\n   It must not go unnoticed that the adventurous manoeuvres will be staged three days after the third round of the \"four-way talks.\"\r\n   This adds to the suspicion that the \"four-way talks\" that the U.S. describes as peace talks are a subterfuge to conceal its war preparations against the DPRK.\r\n   The soon-to-be-staged manoeuvres will again escalate the tensions on the Korean peninsula.\r\n   More than once we declared that we are ready for both dialogue and war.\r\n   If the U.S. persistently takes the line of war behind the curtain of dialogue, we will have to take coutermeasures. \r\n\r\n"

As for its \"apology\", it is the same with formal apologies Japan had made to the preceding South Korean authorities.\r\n   This notwithstanding, the South Korean rulers are loudly crying as if Japan had made adequate \"apology.\" They allege that South Korea obtained apology from Japan in document for the first time.\r\n   Their invitation of the Japanese king to South Korea is the height of their shamelessness.\r\n   There is no one in Korea who does not grind his teeth to hear the word Japanese king, the symbol and manipulator of crimes. So, the preceding South Korean rulers had never thought of inviting the Japanese king to South Korea although they were crazy with pro-Japanese flunkeyism.\r\n   However, the present chief executive of South Korea kept Mum about the past history of Japan in a bid to show his politeness to the Japanese king. He went the length of saying that if the Japanese king visits South Korea, he would try to make people welcome him.\"\r\n   Worse still, he begged the Japanese masters for \"cooperation system\" intended to hurt and stifle the fellow countrymen in the north.\r\n   He prattled that, in order to prevent \"missile threats from the north,\"  South Korea and Japan must \"work together\"  and hold a \"security consultative meeting.\"\r\n   His acts are indeed disgusting.\r\n   All facts show that the South Korean authorities' loud advertisement about \"successful visit to Japan\" is a lie to cover up their dirty colors as pro-Japanese flunkeyists  and traitors without an equal in history. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
