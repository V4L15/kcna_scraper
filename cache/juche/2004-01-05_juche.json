Korea Flailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 4 (KCNA) -- The United States is massively shipping various type sophisticated combat equipment into south Korea. This proves that though the U.S. is talking a lot about dialogue and negotiation it is seeking an ulterior motive behind the scene. Minju Joson Sunday says this in a signed commentary.\r\n It continues:\r\n It is the U.S. ulterior intention to seek a military solution to the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. as it did in Afghanistan and Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After making the outbreak of a war on the Korean peninsula a fait accompli, the U.S. is now relocating its main forces for aggression in south Korea including its 2nd Infantry Division to areas south of the River Han and working hard to turn all its forces present in S. Korea into a \"Northeast Asian regional force\" targeted against the DPRK and countries around the Korean peninsula in the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. loud-mouthed \"resumption of the six-way talks\" is nothing but hypocrisy and trick to cover up its intention to swallow up the DPRK by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This being a hard reality, the DPRK feels no need to hesitate but will take all possible measures for its self-defence.  The U.S. policy to stifle the DPRK based on its military pressure or threat would only push the situation to a catastrophic phase it warns.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This was his fourth visit to the shrine since his assumption of office in April 2001.\r\n This indicates that he is persistently pursuing his invariable reactionary and ultra-right militarist policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already known, entombed in the shrine are millions of those who died in the aggressive wars from the time before the sino-Japanese war to the Second World War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Interred on the altar of the shrine are remains of special-class war criminals including Hideki Tojo, the boss of Japanese militarism who ignited and commanded the Pacific war. Displayed in its court are artillery pieces, torpedoes and other weapons used by Japanese imperialists during the aggressive wars. Exhibitions are taking place in the hall one after another to agitate a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not hard to guess what is sought by visits to the shrine aimed to embellish the blood-stained past history of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The chief executive of Japan at a press conference held on October 8 last year disclosed his intention to continue to visit the shrine, saying that it was not for the sake of militarism but it was quite natural. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His visit to the shrine on the New Year's day was a revelation of Japan's reckless attempt to step up in real earnest the moves for its conversion into a military power and overseas expansion this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By putting visits to the shrine on a legitimate and regular basis the Japanese reactionaries seek to lay an ideological foundation for Japan's militarization and create an atmosphere more favorable for overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are rushing headlong into reinvasion, far from honestly redeeming Japan's past wrongdoings. This is a challenge to the justice and conscience of the Korean and other people of the world and a grave perfidy to the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will never remain a passive onlooker to the criminal moves escalated by the Japanese reactionaries to revive militarism and realize overseas expansion, refusing to liquidate Japan's past, quite contrary to the spirit of the Pyongyang declaration.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This also serves as unshakable guidelines in powerfully encouraging all the members of the nation in the sacred patriotic struggle for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il set forth the five-point policy of the great national unity true to President Kim Il Sung's idea and line of great national unity, thus providing the nation with the most important guidelines for achieving the cause of the great national unity to meet the requirements of the changing times and the specific conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Policies pursued by Kim Jong Il in realising the great national unity are the all-embracing and benevolent ones as he embraces and unites all those who value the soul of the nation and love the country and the nation irrespective of ideology, system, class, and social strata. Kim Jong Il leniently treats those who went amiss, betraying the nation in the past, if they, sincerely remorseful of their past wrongdoings, are willing to contribute to the cause of national reunification, and lets them join in the march for national reunification on the principle of not digging into their past. This warm humanity and patriotism of his serve as magnetic power encouraging all the Koreans to join the ranks of the great national unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il's idea and leadership serve as an inexhaustible source of guaranteeing the victory of the cause of great national unity, the cause of national reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
