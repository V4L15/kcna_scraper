He heard a report on the situation from the commander of the unit and learned about the performance of the unit's duty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was greatly satisfied to see that the servicemen of the unit have successfully carried out the self-defensive military line of the party, thus turning it into an invincible combat contingent stalwartly standing guard over the defence line of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He visited the servicemen's hall where he saw the combat records of the unit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the servicemen of the unit are displaying their might in the sacred service for the defence of the country as heirs to the glorious tradition of the unit, he urged them to earnestly learn from the revolutionary spirit of the forerunners who dedicated their youth and lives to the fight for the party, the leader, the country and the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After seeing soldiers in training, he was satisfied to see that all the servicemen have grown up to be indomitable soldiers resolutely struggling for the security of the country and people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He set forth tasks which would serve as a guideline in further increasing the combat capability of the unit and had a photograph taken with the servicemen of the unit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The next leg of his inspection was its small unit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After getting familiar with the training of soldiers, he took warm care of their living with paternal love, looking round entertainment and logistic facilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that our soldiers are tenaciously and assiduously managing their economic life at every unit he visits, he said this proud feature can be found only in the heroic KPA, the army of the leader and the party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He spared time to see an art performance given by its servicemen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Greatly pleased to see that its servicemen are conducting training, studying and living as the anti-Japanese guerrillas did, he highly praised the successes made by them in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He gave the servicemen a pair of binoculars, a machine-gun and an automatic rifle as gifts and had a photograph taken with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by generals of the KPA Ri Myong Su, Hyon Chol Hae and Pak Jae Gyong and Ri Yong Chol, first vice department director of the c.c., WPK.    \r\n\r\n"

This clearly indicates what a dangerous phase the U.S. design to stifle socialist Korea has reached. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to properly judge the will of the people's army and people of Korea to mercilessly wipe out those who try to infringe upon their dignity and drop its reckless design to stifle it by force of arms.    \r\n\r\n"

Korea assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 6 (KCNA) -- The South Korean public is becoming increasingly critical of Bush's forthcoming trip to Seoul. This is an eruption of the pent-up wrath and resentment at the U.S. imperialists. Not content with having infringed upon the dignity and sovereignty of the Korean nation by keeping half of the country under their military occupation for over half a century, they are now keen to keep the nation permanently divided and bring a holocaust of a nuclear war to the Koreans, Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists who look upbeat over what they call \"victory\" in the \"war against terrorism\" are getting more frantic in their moves to invade independent countries and nations and interfere in their internal affairs. They have singled out the DPRK as their main target. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They do not hesitate to make other countries and nations fall victim to nuclear disasters in order to achieve their aggressive aims. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unable to tolerate this any longer, the South Korean people are turning out in an anti-U.S., anti-Bush struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Righteous is the South Korean people's struggle against bush's projected trip to South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people can never pardon bush's reckless remarks and behavior and his scheduled visit to South Korea aimed to bar the Korean nation from achieving reunification and threaten and stifle the DPRK by force of arms.    \r\n\r\n"

It is the U.S. and its forces in South Korea that have been chiefly responsible for the tense situation on the Korean peninsula for more than half a century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-U.S. sentiment is now mounting higher in South Korea than ever before. The U.S. conservative hard-liners are keen to calm down anti-U.S. sentiment mounting among the South Korean people by peddling the fiction of \"threat\" and keep its troops in South Korea in a bid to put it under U.S. military control for an indefinite period. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula, it will immediately spill over into all other parts of the world and entail very serious consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Therefore, ensuring peace on the Korean peninsula is a key to guaranteeing durable peace in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It would be a wise measure for the u.s. to withdraw its forces from South Korea.    If the U.S. does not take its hands off the peninsula, keeping its covetous eyes on the peninsula it will have to pay dearly for its behaviour.    \r\n\r\n"

He told the president that it would be built from Juche 50 (1961) owing to shortage of funds. The president knew it before asking it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He earnestly said that though we were undergoing difficulties, we should speed up the construction of Taedong bridge no. 2 for the convenience of citizens in traffics and step up the preparations to start its construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And he personally chose the bridge site, formed the building forces and named the bridge.
