It is suitable place for horse riding, he added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If this training ground which was visited by Kim Jong Il several times is rebuilt into a modern ground for horse riding, this will mean better preservation and consolidation of the precious legacy left by him, Kim Jong Un said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He proposed to name it Mirim Horse Riding Club as it is situated in Mirim area.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He called for renovating horse-riding club at an early date and presenting it to the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Horse-riding is a very good exercise helpful for nurturing bravery, he said, adding it will help strengthen healthy spirit and physical body conducive to labor and defence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Regular horse-riding exercises from early years based on education will develop muscles and prevent back ache even after becoming adults, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Horse-riding has caught worldwide interest, he said, stressing that Koreans have been fond of riding horses from the olden times and frequently held competitions on horseback, thus training their body and mind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When renovated, the horse-riding club will attract lots of working people, youth and students, he said, adding that the horse-riding will help them train their body and mind and give them pride and joy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Roller skating wind is raging after the creation of skate parks in different parts of Pyongyang, he said, noting that same thing will happen after the creation of horse-riding club.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To promote horse-riding, it is necessary to provide necessary conditions, he stressed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is necessary to arrange horse-riding club and, at the same time, create horse-riding school and teach not only horse-riding but horse breeding and taming, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Breeding healthy horses is important for the well operation of horse-riding club, he said, calling for solving in time problems arising in breeding horses including the provision of fodder.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also called for timely producing horse-riding gears including riding suit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed the need to successfully renovate the club as required by the era of Songun and provide the Koreans who are the best in the world with the highly civilized living conditions and environment. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Choe Ryong Hae, Kim Kyong Hui, Jang Song Thaek, Hyon Yong Chol, Kim Ki Nam, Kim Kyok Sik, Kim Yang Gon, Kim Phyong Hae, Mun Kyong Dok, Pak Pong Ju, Han Kwang Sang, Kim Kyong Ok, Ri Ryong Ha, Hwang Pyong So, Kim Pyong Ho, Choe Pu Il, Son Chol Ju, Pak Jae Gyong, Pak Jong Chon, Kim Yong Chol, Jon Chang Bok and other senior officials of the party and the army."
