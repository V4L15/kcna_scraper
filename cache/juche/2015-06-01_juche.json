He underlined the need for the farm to steadily take the lead in implementing the Party's policy for bringing about a radical turn in seed selection in order to effect a signal success in the development of agriculture, a major thrust in the drive for defending socialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Underlining the need to increase state investment in the farm, further consolidate its material and technical foundation and build a modern greenhouse based on cutting-edge technology on it as it is a combined seed research and development base, he promised that the party would make sure that the project for the construction of the greenhouse is undertaken.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting the work for producing new seeds is by no means an easy one, he said it is quite possible to obtain high-yielding seeds if other farms determinedly buckle down to the work and make persevering efforts like this farm.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Praising the officials, scientists, researchers and employees of the farm as patriots as they are working hard with sweat of their brow and enthusiasm, regardless of whether they are known or not and recognized or not, he said the Party Central Committee would always remember their feats.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He reposed the deepest trust in KPA General Pak Tong Gyu, who looks after the work at units under KPA Unit 810, praising him as an officer with strong sense of responsibility and desire to work as he carries out anything at any cost by giving play to the mental power of masses if it is desired by the Party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then he had a photo session with the party members and other workers of the farm.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accompanying him were Hwang Pyong So, Jo Nam Jin, Ri Jae Il and Jo Yong Won."
