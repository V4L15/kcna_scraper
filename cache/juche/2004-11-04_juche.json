It was an anti-Japanese, patriotic resistance of Korean youths and students against the Japanese imperialists' brutal colonial rule, slave education and national insult.\r\n A Japanese middle school boy insulted a Korean middle school girl in a Kwangju-Raju commuter train on October 30, 1929. It let loose the long pent-up wrath and hatred of the Korean youth and students against the Japanese imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The uprising spread to Seoul, Pyongyang, Sinuiju, Hamhung, Kaesong, Taegu, Pusan and other parts of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Korean students courageously held demonstrations defying the harsh suppression by the Japanese imperialist police. They shouted \"Down with Japanese imperialism!\", \"Abolish colonial, slave education!\", \"Long live the independence of Korea!\" and other slogans, scattered leaflets and made speeches in streets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists set all the riot police in motion to crack down upon the uprising in cold blood and maintain and intensify their colonial rule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During their colonial rule over Korea, the Japanese imperialists brutally suppressed all the struggles of the Korean people for the freedom and independence of the country including the Kwangju Students Uprising, the March First Uprising and anti-Japanese volunteer army units. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No one can distort or erase history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the present Japanese ultra-right conservatives are trying to veil the crimes Japan committed in the past and evade its responsibility for compensation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people have never forgotten the inhuman crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists though many years have passed.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

It demanded that the public employees guaranteed three rights of labor and the market opening of the public field halted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The participants in the rally threatened to call a general strike from November 15 unless the \"government\" meets their demands before marching as far as the building of the Uri Party.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They are busying themselves to replace the pacifist constitution by a war constitution and adopt overseas expansion as their state policy, as if they had been waiting for the opportunity to occur, in a bid to start a crusade for reinvading Asia and conquering the world.\r\n  Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says in a signed commentary carried in this regard: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Some time ago 79 Japanese dietmen visited the Yasukuni Shrine. Japan is actively conducting with the U.S. the joint technological research into the missile defense system and contemplating extending the term for the operation of the fleet of the \"Self-Defence Forces\" in the Indian Ocean. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries who had supported the U.S. invasion of Iraq before any others are going to extend the presence of the \"SDF\" in Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThrough this they seek to make their overseas military operation an established fact and pave the way for their overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have already put two spy satellites on the orbit and decided to develop four other spy satellites by the year 2005 through the allocation of hundreds of millions of dollars under the pretext of \"intensifying the watch over\" the DPRK's missile base and nuclear facilities. They are speeding up the development and introduction of ultra-modern Aegis destroyers, refueling tankers, battleships of aircraft carrier type, etc. while actively pushing forward the moves to put combat equipment on a modern, large-sized and long-distance basis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Japan's moves to convert itself into a military power and realize overseas expansion are no longer a hypothesis but are becoming a reality. It is becoming clearer that the Japanese militarist forces colluding with the U.S. imperialists more closely than ever before are emerging dangerous war forces  disturbing world peace and stability and a wicked enemy of independence and progress as they are working hard to stamp out the cause of independence of the popular masses, the cause of global independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their desperate moves to turn Japan into a military power and realize overseas expansion are as foolish an act as digging their own graves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries would be well advised to swim with the trend of the times and drop their foolish ambition.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"

They have been preserved in their original state for hundred of decades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Among the national treasures are the Kaesong fort, Nam Gate showing the developed architecture in the period of Koryo, the ruined royal palace on Manwol Hill, an old residential quarter, Sungyang Auditorium, Koryo Songgyungwan, which was the first college of Korea, Sonjuk Bridge and Phyochung Monument, the wall on Mt. Taehung, Kwanum Temple, King Wang Kon's Mausoleum and King Kong Min's Mausoleum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historic relics, giving a glimpse of the civilization and culture of Koryo, are of great significance in studying the inheritance of culture before and after Koryo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The mausoleums of the Koryo kings were built in the period between 10th and 14th centuries. They are characterized by rich contents of mural paintings, and wonderful architecture and formative arts inherent to the period. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such mural paintings as a blue dragon, white tiger, pine tree and bamboo in Wang Kon's Mausoleum, and 12 sagacious subjects and constellations in Kong Min's Mausoleum reflect well the features of mural tombs belonging to the Koryo period. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The mausoleums have terraced compounds and are surrounded by trees and stone handrails. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Especially, Kong Min's Mausoleum is very large and its decoration and sculpture are excellent. It is the first twin tombs in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historic relics and remains in Kaesong have been well kept as they were thanks to the policy of the DPRK government for the preservation of the national cultural heritages.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
