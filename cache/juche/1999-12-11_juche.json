            "content": "Japanese \"SDF's\" evacuation drill \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, December 11 (KCNA) -- The Japanese ground \"Self-Defence Force\" reportedly staged a drill of \"evacuating Japanese overseas\" on December 8 in Chiba Prefecture under the simulated conditions of an \"emergency\" abroad.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At least 350 troops were involved in the drill. It simulated an operation of \"rescuing\" by helicopters  Japanese overseas from the airfields of other countries where they \"took refuge.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Yomiuri Shimbun December 9 said that this drill was aimed to keep the \"SDF\" ready for action in the wake of the revision of the \"law on Self-Defence Forces\" in May this year which provided a legal guarantee for the overseas dispatch of warships and warplanes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is well known that \"evacuation of Japanese overseas\" is nothing but a camouflage to justify the \"SDF's\" dispatch of warships and warplanes abroad  for a war of aggression overseas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The drill carried out by the Japanese reactionaries this time reminds one of the eve of June 25, 1950  when the U.S. evacuated their families to Japan and other areas from South Korea under the pretext of \"protection\"  before provoking a war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such moves for overseas aggression escalated under the deceptive signboard clearly indicate that the Japanese reactionaries' wild design for overseas expansion has reached a dangerous phase. \r\n\r\n"

It is not for its defence but is aimed to guarantee Japan's overseas aggrandizement with nuclear weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Judging from the historic lesson, it is as clear as noonday that Japan's moves for overseas expansion through nuclear arming will bring unimaginably monstrous disasters to mankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If Japan craftily seeks a sinister aim, it will be ridiculed and put to shame by the international community. \r\n\r\n"

This is an intolerable crime against humanity in the light of the requirements of the international law on human rights and from a humanitarian point of view. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The central committee of the DPRK Red Cross  Society sent letters to the South Korean Red Cross three times this year denouncing the South Korean side for blocking their repatriation and strongly demanding it take humanitarian measures for their unconditional repatriation before the end of this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The central committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland, the Council for National Reconciliation and  other organizations, different human rights organizations and families and relatives of such unconverted long-term prisoners in South Korea as Kim In So, Kim Yong Thae and Ham De Hwan issued statements and letters pushing for their repatriation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Meanwhile, human rights organizations including the Committee for the Promotion of the Repatriation of Unconverted Long-Term Prisoners, religious organizations and people from all walks of life in South Korea formed a liaison council for the promotion of the repatriation of unconverted long-term prisoners, held press conferences, sent letters and staged a pan-national signature campaign and other protest movements. A positive struggle was also waged by the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This year's campaign for their repatriation was participated in by many political parties, organizations, and individual figures of many countries in the world including Ukraine, Japan, Nigeria and Peru, regional organizations, international organizations including the International Democratic Lawyers Association, major newspapers and radios and magazines in different countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThey condemned the South Korean authorities for their inhumane attitude and strongly demanded the repatriation of unconverted long-term prisoners. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Warning the South Korean rulers that if something deplorable happens to the unconverted long-term prisoners, they will be wholly responsible for its serious consequences, the information strongly urged them to unconditionally repatriate Kim In So, Kim Yong Thae, Ham Se Hwan and all other unconverted long-term prisoners to their families and relatives in the north before the end of the year, as unanimously demanded by the people at home and abroad. \r\n\r\n"

He asserted that the United States and Europe would be exposed to \"grave threat\" if the DPRK and some other countries continue to \"develop or introduce long-range missile.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun today says it is nonsense that the DPRK poses a missile threat to the U.S.   The \"national and theatre missile defense\" systems are of offensive nature from A to Z and they are aimed at having a decisive military edge, the daily notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States is scheming to deploy the \"Theatre Missile Defense\" system in South Korea and Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Its \"missile defense\" system is not only intended to contain the DPRK. Through establishment of such system the U.S. seeks to lead big powers and some countries, which it considers as potential opponents, to arms race and thus put them in an economic crisis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It also intends to include all areas of the earth in its \"missile defense\" network, take a military edge and dominate the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If such moves are allowed the U.S. will become more high-handed and arbitrary, the danger of war will grow and the global peace and security will be seriously threatened.   We cannot but take countermeasure now that the U.S. is speeding up the establishment of \"missile defense\" system against the DPRK. \r\n\r\n"

This is an unprecedented physical barrier which severed the blood ties of the Korean nation and bisected its territory into two parts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This concrete wall cut off 122 villages of 8 counties, 3 railways, 3 main roads and over 220 minor roads on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The over 240 km long-heavily fortified wall is 5-8 m high, 10-19 m wide at its bottom and 3-7 m wide on its top. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSouth Korea built it as a bridgehead to invade the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It has many pillboxes and artillery emplacements. Its over 4 m wide automatic iron gates make it possible for tanks and armored vehicles and other armored forces to promptly go into action in case of \"emergency\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the nation's disgrace and greatest tragedy that such a wall of division, which can hardly be found in other countries and regions of the world still exists in South Korea though a new millennium is near at hand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK branded the wall as a symbol of division for it split Korea, which has remained one and the same land for thousands of years, into the north and south and put forward many proposals demanding its immediate removal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Well known to the world are the DPRK offers including the appeal sent by the DPRK government, political parties and organizations to the governments, political parties and organizations in all countries of the world on Dec. 3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   An international fact-finding group identified the wall on the spot in May, Juche 79 (1990) and urged the UN Secretary-General and the international community to make efforts for the removal of the wall. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"international forum demanding the removal of the concrete wall\" held in Pyongyang last August recognized the wall as a cursed artificial barrier dividing the nation in the 20th century and appealed to the world peace-loving people to join in the campaign for its removal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the unanimous opinion of the world's progressives  that they cannot greet a new millennium with the concrete wall, the last leftover of the cold war, remaining on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The concrete wall should be pulled down unconditionally and immediately. \r\n\r\n"
