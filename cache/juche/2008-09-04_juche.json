            "title": "\"Woman Spy Case\" Touted by Lee Myung Bak Group Dismissed",

            "content": "\"Woman Spy Case\" Touted by Lee Myung Bak Group Dismissed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 3 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland issued a statement Tuesday slamming the Lee Myung Bak group for frantically kicking up a confrontational racket against the DPRK after cooking up what it called \"woman spy case\" in recent days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The case does not deserve even a passing note as it is a threadbare charade disclosing the true aim sought by the group from the outset, but we can not but reveal the falsity of the case before the world as its orchestrator has gone far beyond the tolerance limit in a bid to hurt the dignity of the DPRK and tarnish its international image. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the \"woman spy\" at issue is concerned, she is a criminal who fled after committing crimes against the state and the people, and human scum crazy for money, vanity and swindling. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She finished middle school education, enjoying free education and free medical care in the DPRK but after school she was engrossed in fraud, swindling and theft to meet even legal punishment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She did not reform herself even in the subsequent period but continued swindling. She defected to the south long ago, evading punishment by law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the DPRK she not only did enormous damage to properties of the state and society but caused huge damage to private properties on several occasions. For these crimes she was sentenced to six years of forced labor and prison terms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for her step-father whom the group claims was put under custody, he is also human scum who betrayed the homeland and the people. He idled away time while changing his jobs dozens of times when he was in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The puppets painted such swindlers and idlers as \"spies dispatched by a certain institution of the north\". This is ridiculous enough to make even a cat laugh. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The information about the activities allegedly conducted by the \"woman spy\" released by the puppet security authorities, is also a sheer lie.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They said they hired the \"woman spy\" as a \"security lecturer\" at a unit of the puppet army despite the fact that they found something \"questionable\" in her from three years ago. This proves that the puppet army and the security authorities of the south side must be made up of blind and deaf people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A lot of \"spy cases\" were cooked up in the south in the past, too, to spark off public furor, but this is the first time that such a clumsy \"spy case\" was fabricated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The farce orchestrated by the Lee group, not feeling ashamed of itself, only to become a laughing stock of the world is aimed to divert elsewhere the people's criticism of it due to its domestic and foreign policy failures and mislead the public opinion in a bid to get rid of the tight corner at which it is now finding itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also aimed to rally conservative forces, suppress progressive forces, evade the responsibility for bedeviling the north-south relations and pursue confrontational policy towards fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The group of traitors has gone the lengths of painting such human scum little different to psychopath who has been engrossed in swindling, brokerage and prostitution as a \"spy\" and using her for the anti-DPRK confrontational racket. This clearly proves in what deplorable position the group is now finding itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fabrication of the case is another grave provocation to the DPRK in the wake of the incident of the south Korean tourist that took place in the area of Mt. Kumgang in July. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The group even tried to build up public opinion, groundlessly linking the \"spy case\" with the sacred institution in charge of the state security defence in the DPRK. This is an insult and mockery of the dignity and system of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will never remain an on-looker to the smear campaign against it launched by the group of traitors in a bid to do harm to the system in the DPRK after fabricating the above-said case, not content with deteriorating the inter-Korean relations while letting loose a spate of provocative outbursts inciting confrontation with fellow countrymen and crying out for \"regime change\" and \"preemptive attack\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent incident more clearly proves that the Lee Myung Bak group is made up of philistines and anti-reunification confrontational maniacs putting the preceding military fascist dictators into the shade. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Traitor Lee Myung Bak seems to try to use the trite methods used by the preceding dictators in the past, not knowing how much the world has changed over the past decade. He should bear in mind that this is little short of following in the footsteps of the predecessors who met deaths. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This rash act can be perpetrated only by the ferocious gang of fascists bereft of elementary human rights and ethics and morality and utterly indifferent to national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lee group's suppression of Yun clearly revealed once again that they are fascist dictators and the group of anti-reunification elements who have not an iota of will to implement the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fascist suppression is not an all-powerful means for staying in power but a shortcut to destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Traitor Lee Myung Bak should behave himself, facing up to the trend of the history of the nation in which the Koreans are advancing to achieve unity and reunification by their concerted efforts under the banner of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The puppet authorities should stop at once the suppression of the reunification movement organizations and immediately set free the unreasonably detained youth and students and figures including Yun. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It ensured by law the plunder of mining resources in a more extensive way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAs a result, the national mining industry of Korea was trampled underfoot utterly and the Japanese monopoly capitalists boomed, favored by it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHaving built smelteries in various places including Hungnam and Haeju, the Japanese imperialists resorted to every conceivable means to take away large amounts of nonferrous metals. During their occupation, they brought away nearly 400 tons of gold according to an extremely curtailed data. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTo fill the steel needed for the production of various kinds of weapons along with the escalation of the war of aggression, the Japanese imperialists developed iron ore mines in a big way and carried away iron ores. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nMost of the iron works in Japan turned out iron with the iron ore which they carried away from Korea. Particularly, the iron works in Kyushu and Hokkaido were fed every year respectively with 200,000 tons and 40,000 tons of iron ore produced in Jaeryong, Unryul, Kaechon and other areas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBesides, they robbed Korea of precious mineral ores including zinc, nickel and magnesite. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe human history has witnessed lots of aggression and predatory acts. But it has not seen such an instance as the Japanese imperialist aggressors who plundered other country of underground resources in the most brigandish and vicious way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nJapan is obliged to apologize and compensate for them. �@\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They are, at the same time, persisting in their moves to destabilize and bring down socialism through capitalist ideological and cultural poisoning. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The practical experience of the people of the DPRK and the historic review of the Korean revolution prove that the Songun politics is the life and soul and future of the country and the nation and to advance under the uplifted banner of Songun provides a sure guarantee for winning victory in the popular masses' cause of independence, the socialist cause despite any storm and stress and hardships of history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The developing countries and small countries should direct bigger efforts to boosting their military capabilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should not have any slightest illusion about imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should never be taken in by the imperialists' policy of \"appeasement\" but bolster up their defense capabilities as long as the imperialists exist. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The master key to frustrating the imperialists' policy of strength and achieving victory in the human cause of independence, the cause of peace lies in always holding fast to the Songun politics, the most effective and all-mighty treasured sword in the present era. \r\n\r\n"

Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 3 (KCNA) -- The Action Headquarters of the 16th-term south Korean Federation of University Student Councils on August 29 issued a statement demanding the abolition of the \"National Security Law (NSL)\", a fascist law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement recalled the fact that the Seoul Central District Court on August 27 held a trial at which it sentenced the chairman of the South Headquarters of the National Alliance of Youth and Students for the Country's Reunification to a prison term on the charge of \"violence of the NSL\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It noted that the court, justifying the NSL in the course of the trial, totally denied the progress made in the development of the inter-Korean relations since the publication of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement charged that since Lee Myung Bak came to power the number of victims of the NSL has increased at an exponential rate and his brutal crackdown upon the progressive forces is getting more undisguised than ever before. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that all the south Koreans are calling for the repeal of the NSL, the statement warned that the Lee group's intensified crackdown upon the progressive forces would touch off stronger resistance. �@\r\n\r\n"

Pero, dado que con esta farsa la banda de Lee dana la dignidad de la RPDC y denigra hasta su imagen exterior, nos vimos obligados a aclarar la falsedad del caso, senala el documento y continua: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La \"espia\" en cuestion es la delincuente que se fugo por su crimen cometido ante el Estado y el pueblo y es una escoria humana enloquecida por el dinero, deformacion y fraudes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Bajo el sistema de educacion gratuita y asistencia medica gratuita de la RPDC, ella recibio la ensenanza media y se incorporo a la sociedad. Pero,  al cabo de ocuparse de fraudes, estafas y robos recibio debidamente la sancion legal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Sin embargo, en vez de arrepentirse de su proceder, no ceso de cometer actos fraudulentos y hace mucho tiempo paso ilegalmente la frontera y despues, paso al Sur de Corea evadiendo la sentencia legal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nCuando vivia en la RPDC, robo en varias ocasiones la enorme suma de los bienes estatales, sociales e individuales, debido a lo cual fue condenada a 6 anos de trabajos reeducativos y debio sufrir la vida carcelaria. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEl llamado padrastro de la \"espia\", que fue detenido junto con ella, es tambien un holgazan que cambio decenas veces de sus empleos sin tener la profesion fija y se huyo al Sur de Corea al traicionar la patria y el pueblo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEs muy ridiculo que los titeres surcoreanos  hicieron de tales tipejos los \"espias enviados por un organo correspondiente del Norte\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSon mentirosos los datos de actividades de la \"espia\" publicados por las autoridades titeres de seguridad publica. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEn particular, dicen que emplearon a esta \"espia\" como \"conferenciante de seguridad\" de una unidad del ejercito titere, aunque desde hace 3 anos captaron algunos \"puntos dudosos\". Esto significa que el ejercito titere y las autoridades de seguridad publica del Sur de Corea son ciegos y sordos. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEn el pasado tambien en el Sur de Corea se armaban escandalos por numerosos \"casos de espia\", pero, es primero el caso tan pueril como el presente.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nLa banda de Lee invento tal farsa ridicula sin sentir verguenza con el fin de desviar la vista dirigida a si misma por el fracaso de su politica interna y externa, liberarse de su situacion muy desesperada, agrupar a las fuerzas conservadoras y reprimir a las fuerzas progresistas, eludir la responsabilidad por la agravacion de las relaciones Norte-Sur y aplicar su politica de enfrentamiento con los connacionales. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nLa banda traidora presenta ante la escena de confrontacion contra la RPDC a tal mujerzuela loca que se entregaba a los actos fraudulentos y al servicio sexual, tras disfrazarla como la \"espia\". Esto demuestra claramente que ahora la banda de Lee se encuentra en una situacion muy lamentable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEl presente caso es una nueva provocacion grave contra la RPDC seguida al incidente de turista del monte Kumgang ocurrido en julio pasado. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEn particular, la intencion de la banda de Lee de relacionar absurdamente el presente caso con el sagrado organismo de defensa de seguridad de la RPDC y presentarlo a la opinion publica es un insulto y una burla a nuestra dignidad y regimen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nNo pasaremos por alto jamas que la banda traidora lanza los disparates provocativos que fomentan la confrontacion con los connacionales, perora de la teoria de \"cambio de regimen\" y de \"ataque preventivo\", agrava las relaciones con el Norte, y no satisfecho con eso, arma el alboroto intrigante anti-RPDC calumniando nuestro regimen mediante la invencion del \"caso de espia\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEl presente caso demuestra fehacientemente que la banda de Lee es la de conspiradores que superan a los dictadores fascistas militares del pasado y fanaticos de confrontacion anti-reunificacion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEl traidor Lee intenta repetir caducos metodos de ex dictadores sin saber que durante 10 anos pasados cambio mucho el mundo, pero debe darse clara cuenta de que esto le lleva a la tumba. �@\r\n\r\n\r\n"
