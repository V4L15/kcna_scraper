These weapons, however, failed to play a decisive role.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. forces are serving in the army to have their individual selfish desires realized. This is one of their ideological and moral weak points. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are operating hundreds of military bases in many countries and regions, having too many military targets and too long a front.

This warning is served by papers Thursday in signed commentaries. \n\t\t\t\t\tRodong Sinmun observes: The south Korean military authorities are now making much fuss in a bid to mislead the public opinion, describing the proper measure for self-defence taken by the north against a group of warships of the south Korean forces as \"the third skirmish in the West Sea.\" This is like a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe latest armed clash in the West Sea was not a simple accidental incident but a deliberate and premeditated provocation perpetrated by the south Korean military in an effort to escalate the tension on the Korean Peninsula, the daily notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is a trite method of the south Korean warmongers to perpetrate a shocking provocation to derail any process for improving the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNobody can deny the fact that the armed provocation perpetrated by them again in the West Sea is nothing but a deliberate and vicious move for increasing the tension and a dangerous war action of those much upset by the trend of the situation on the peninsula. This is a clear indictment meted out to the south Korean warmongers hell bent on the treacherous acts to disturb the peace on the peninsula and do harm to fellow countrymen by force of arms in collusion with outside forces while hamstringing the efforts to improve the inter-Korean relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe artillery pieces of the KPA convinced of justice and afire with hatred are now leveled at the provokers. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean military had better face up to the trend of the times and behave itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMinju Joson urges the south Korean military authorities to stop digging their own graves, make an apology to the nation for the armed provocation and take a responsible measure against the recurrence of the similar case."
