            "content": "KCNA on U.S. Dangerous Military Moves \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 26 (KCNA) -- The Bush administration is now deploying ultra-modern weapons it tested in Iraq and Afghanistan in the demilitarized zone south of the Military Demarcation Line (MDL), according to Los Angeles Times.\r\n This is a wanton violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and a very dangerous political and military provocation that harasses peace and threatens stability on the Korean peninsula and areas around it and escalates the danger of the outbreak of a new war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already known, the U.S. is talking much about dialogue, holding forth about a diplomatic and peaceful solution to the nuclear issue between it and the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The master key to the peaceful settlement of the issue is the U.S. renunciation of its hostile policy toward the DPRK and its removal of threat of military aggression, nuclear threat in particular. That is why the DPRK has consistently demanded the U.S. drop its hostile policy toward the DPRK, attaching primary significance to it at talks with the U.S. The Bush administration, however, has turned down the justifiable and reasonable proposals of the DPRK, persistently asserting that it should scrap its nuclear program first. This, in essence, is a brigandish demand that the DPRK unilaterally abandon its self-defensive deterrent it has built up to cope with the U.S. military provocation and threat of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK proposed to solve the nuclear issue on the principle of simultaneous actions and a package solution. But the U.S. negated them. The true aim sought by it is to launch the second Korean war. This is clearly proved by the fact that it is introducing into south Korea ultra-modern weapons it tested in wars of aggression launched under the pretext of \"war on terrorism\" and destruction of \"weapons of mass destruction\" and deploying them in forefront areas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and the people of the DPRK will never remain passive on-lookers to the military moves in areas along the MDL against the backdrop of the U.S. resumption of the development of smaller nukes for its strategy of a preemptive attack and its arms buildup and full-scale relocation of its troops.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Nearly 60 year-long U.S. occupation policy in south Korea has served for taking independent dignity away from the south Korean people and trampling upon their freedom and right of life. When we peruse the agreements and treaties signed between south Korea and the U.S., there is not a word respecting south Korea and guaranteeing the interests of its people. They are all for ensuring the U.S. interests at the sacrifice of everything of south Korea. The independent rights of the south Korean people have been completely ignored by those agreements and treaties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Enormous are the misfortunes and pains the south Korean people have suffered with their independence violated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-U.S. struggle for independence is vital to the flesh and blood and independent life of the south Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is impossible to think of the dignity and happiness of the people in a land as south Korea destitute of independence, where outside forces boss it around. The history of the occupation of south Korea by U.S. forces for approximately 60 years is marred by such crimes against the south Korean people as killing, plunder, murder and rape. And innumerable are the damages inflicted on the south Korean people's lives and properties by the U.S. imperialists' moves to provoke a new war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With the aggressors left in the land, the south Korean people cannot defend their lives and properties, let alone their freedom and happiness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-U.S. struggle for independence is the way out for the south Korean people.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
