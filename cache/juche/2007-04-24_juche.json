Rodong Sinmun Monday observes this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Citing facts to prove that the political contradictions and bickering have become more pronounced between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party and between the Bush administration and the Democratic Party in the U.S. over the Iraqi issue, the commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Democratic Party which has a majority in Congress succeeded in making it pass a resolution indicating even a timetable for the withdrawal of the U.S. forces from Iraq, considering the failure of the Iraqi war an established fact, whereas Bush threatened to exercise a veto on the resolution, terming it a \"surrender and retreat\" in Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. Congress warned that in case the president exercises a veto on the resolution, he himself would be to blame for having barred the allocation of funds whereas the Bush group intends to shift the responsibility for it onto Congress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While in office Bush exercised a veto only on one bill but he is poised to veto 16 motions that have already passed through the Senate three months after the Democratic Party began dominating Congress. Heavyweights of the Democratic Party are becoming increasingly assertive that the party should go in the direction of settling the issues by meeting head-on the stance of the Republican Party in Congress, not avoiding confrontation with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was a blatant challenge to the White House that the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives from the Democratic Party visited Syria recently despite the repeated opposition from it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is revealing its vulnerability not only in the political and military aspects but in the economic field due to the policy of strength pursued by the Bush group. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The wrangling between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party over the Iraqi issue, the sinking popularity rate of Bush and the worldwide condemnation of his high-handed practices and policy of strength, etc. indicate total bankruptcy of the U.S. domestic and foreign policies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality eloquently proves that those clinging to the policy of strength despite the unanimous opposition and protest of the international community are bound to meet a miserable lot. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to draw a serious lesson from this and abandon its foolish dream of realizing its ambition for world domination.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is little short of what was committed by the military fascist regimes in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and pro-American conservative forces are standing behind the south Korean judicial authorities who suppress any movement for reunification and patriotism, insult and mock the nation, swimming against the trend of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and the pro-American conservative forces including the Grand National Party of south Korea are using the judicial authorities for intensifying their fascist plot-breeding operations in a bid to chill the ardent desire of the south Korean people to achieve reunification through alliance with the north, block national reconciliation and unity and set off a false alarm that \"security would be threatened\" by progressive forces for reform with the \"presidential elections\" at hand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The south Korean authorities should properly understand the desire of the nation and face up to the trend of the times, abolish the \"National Security Law,\" an anti-reunification fascist law, as early as possible and acquit and set free all those related to the \"case of the Single-minded Association.\"    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Today they are ushering in the dawn for building a great, prosperous and powerful nation, courageously overcoming unprecedented ordeals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is none other than President Kim Il Sung who had made the ever-victorious history of the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He had regarded the issue of carrying forward the cause of army building as the vital question of the revolution and directed a deep attention to the inheritance of the idea of attaching importance to arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He handed over a pistol associated with the patriotic spirit of the Mangyongdae family to Kim Jong Il in the operation room of the Supreme Command in July Juche 41 (1952), saying that the arms guarantee the victory of revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n True to the intention of the President, Kim Jong Il has made a long drive of Songun since he inspected the KPA Guard Seoul Ryu Kyong Su 105 Tank Division in August 1960, making a new history for building the revolutionary army as an army of the Party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In particular, the President had taken important measures to establish Kim Jong Il's command system in the KPA thoroughly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il cultivated the pluck and commanding art as an illustrious commander in the flames of the Fatherland Liberation War and has conducted revolutionary activities by dint of arms.  The President transferred the KPA supreme commandership to him on December 24, 1991 to lay an eternal foundation for the victory of Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President earnestly instructed the commanding members of the KPA to accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche under the command of Kim Jong Il, awarding to them pistols inscribed with the letters \"Paektusan\" on April 25, 1994.
