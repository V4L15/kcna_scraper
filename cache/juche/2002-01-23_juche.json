It was captured by navy men of the Korean People's Army on Jan. 23, Juche 57 (1968) when it intruded illegally into the territorial waters of the DPRK.\r\n An endless stream of people are now visiting it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Foreigners looked round the ship and were deeply moved to see the heroic struggle of the Korean people who are smashing all the U.S. moves for aggression and war and glorifying the dignity and honour of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Omar Lopez Perez, chairman of the Venezuelan National Society for the Study of the Juche Idea, said that \"Pueblo\" is a historical evidence that shows aggressive nature, brutality and craftiness of the U.S. imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists were defeated in the Korean War ignited by themselves and surrendered to the heroic Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They suffered a disgraceful defeat, the first of its kind in history, which started them on the downhill. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are now watching for a chance to invade the DPRK, far from drawing the lesson from the defeat in the Korean War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their provocative moves are frustrated by the heroic Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Guy Dupre, secretary general of the International Liaison Committee for Reunification and Peace in Korea, said that the U.S. should neither forget the lesson from \"Pueblo\" incident nor act rashly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Marwan Sudah, a member of the friendship delegation of political parties of Jordan, noted that in the \"Pueblo\" incident, the large spy plane ec-121 incident and the \"Panmunjom\" incident which caused the hair-raising danger of war on the Korean peninsula and drew the world's attention, the Korean people humbled the pride of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No one on earth can match the servicemen of the heroic Korean people's army who are ready to lay down their lives to defend their leader, ideology and political system, he stressed, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the vortex of history the Korean people could achieve a great victory and work miracles of success thanks to the peculiar army-based policy of supreme commander Kim Jong Il.    \r\n\r\n"

Since the U.S. designated the DPRK as the \"arch enemy\" it has escalated the military pressure, threat and blackmail against the DPRK while threatening to take a military option, against the DPRK if it refuses to yield to the U.S. strong-arm demand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the meantime, the U.S. is rounding off its preparations for a war while beefing up its aggressor forces in South Korea and its surroundings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. armed forces present in South Korea are the main factor of aggravating the situation on the Korean peninsula and a source of war.

Poison-gas bombs were dropped over Nampho city and other areas on May 6, 1951. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These atrocities were objectively proved on the spot by the fact-finding group of the then international democratic lawyers association, the international scientific and other international investigation groups and confirmed by the testimonies made by POWs of the U.S. forces who participated in this warfare. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This notwithstanding, the U.S. has not yet admitted the crimes committed by it. It tries to bring again untold misfortune to the peoples in Korea and the rest of the world after massively stockpiling all types of biological and chemical weapons enough to exterminate humankind tens of times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is clearly evidenced by the recent \"bacillus anthracis incident\" that occurred in the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to officially admit its biological and chemical warfare committed in Korea and make an apology to the Korean people and immediately eliminate all nuclear and biological and chemical weapons and other weapons of mass destruction stockpiled in its country and South Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
