It is typical of state-sponsored terrorism to unreasonably use armed forces against those countries which do not take its fancy. The U.S. is, indeed, a rogue state running amuck in the international community, taking no account of laws and morality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. talking about the \"use of armed forces\" and \"forestalling attack\" against the DPRK for no reason is an intolerable challenge to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We neither want nor avoid war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will wipe out all the invaders on our sacred fatherland with thousand-fold retaliatory strikes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose forces are well advised to cool down their war fever and discontinue the blackmail at once, facing up to the opponent.     \r\n\r\n"
