Korean Group of Conservatives Indicted\r\n Pyongyang, April 17 (KCNA) -- The DPRK Measure Council for Human Rights in South Korea released a detailed report Monday to indict traitor Park Geun Hye and the puppet group of conservatives in south Korea for their despicable and sordid nature and moral vulgarity on the occasion of the 3rd anniversary of ferry Sewol sinking disaster.\n\t\t\t\t\t The Sewol disaster was a hideous disaster produced by Park and the group of conservatives who had resorted to all sorts of evil doings, the detailed report said, citing facts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Utterly shocking was the despicable act of the puppet group after the occurrence of the disaster and so disorderly was its counteraction, it said, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even though she was reported about the sinking of the ferry, Park called a hairdresser to Chongwadae as scheduled and was so composed as to have her hair dressed in a back room. Only instruction she gave was to present a video footage covering the sinking so that she could size up the situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the families of victims were wailing, the puppet group had a \"souvenir\" photo taken with the list of those missing in the background. They giggled, dining and wining at a restaurant and even recited a poem related to ferry \"Sewol\", tapping the table with chopsticks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ferry disaster was neither an accidental one nor natural disaster.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Disclosing the despicable act committed by Park and her group of conservatives to cover up the truth behind the murder, the detailed report said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They brandished the bayonet of suppression, making every possible effort to prevent public opinion critical of their immoral and depraved acts from going afloat.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group let the paid media report about Park's \"visit to scene\" and \"encouragement to rescue operation\" and \"consolation to families of those missing\", to support her. They even painted an old lady as a family member of victim and took a photo of Park visiting an incense-burning center and \"consoling\" the lady before releasing it to the public.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park made public a \"talk to the people\" in which she promised a probe into the truth behind the sinking, punishment of those responsible and institution of a special law for the ferry Sewol disaster. But she made such sophistic words that \"judgment for state affairs is also necessary even though business clarification is important\", thus categorically denying the demand of the different public circle for the enactment of the special law related to the ferry Sewol disaster.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a result, the special law was enacted after the lapse of six months since the disaster. But the nominal law could not properly probe the truth, to say nothing of doing anything for the punishment of those responsible for the disaster.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is all the more shocking is that the puppet group set in motion the Association of Love for Park Geun Hye, the Oboi Association and other right-wing conservative gangsters to hold a rally insulting the families of victims demanding the probe into the truth as \"traders of dead bodies\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even today when she was thrown into a prison after being ousted from Chongwadae, Park is trying to find a way out, flatly denying all the crimes including the Sewol sinking.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t How desperately Park tried to bury into oblivion her acts during the seven hour absence at the time of ferry sinking can be known clearly from the farce she staged by presenting a letter of contradictory answers by putting forward proxy lawyers even when her fate was at a stake following the disclosure of the hideous political scandal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative group is hampering the investigation into the truth by making the Ministry of Maritime and Fisheries carry out independent investigation into the Sewol that had been salvaged, while setting aside the Measure Committee for Victims, Missing Persons and Survivals from Sewol, thereby revealing their sinister intention to hamstring the efforts to probe the truth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now the conservative forces are setting afloat the rumor that credit for the salvage of the hull of Sewol goes to them and trumpeting about making public a white paper on it. But it decided not to specify the causes of the accident, sparking off the public denunciation that \"half a white paper is not worth doing\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If thrice-cursed traitor Park and, her accomplice, the group of conservatives are left intact, more disasters like the Sewol will occur, killing south Koreans en masse.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how desperately Park and her group of conservatives may try, they can never get rid of the responsibility for Sewol, and the matchless murderers behind the hideous disaster can never escape a stern punishment."

            "content": "Sociedad de Medidas de DDHH publica informacion sobre tragedia de \"Sewol\"\r\nPyongyang, 17 de abril (ACNC) -- Con motivo del 3o aniversario de la tragedia del ferry \"Sewol\", la Sociedad de Medidas de DDHH en el Sur de Corea publico el dia 17 una informacion detallada para revelar la bajeza moral de la traidora Park Geun-hye y sus complices conservadores del Sur de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\tEl hundimiento del ferry \"Sewol\" fue causado por la traidora Park y la banda conservadora surcoreana que se dedicaban a las maldades de todo tipo, adelanta la nota y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFue muy chapucera la reaccion de las autoridades surcoreanas al incidente del ferry.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA sabiendas del accidente, Park Geun-hye no altero la hora reservada para traer a una peluquera a Chongwadae y se limito a dar la orden de enviarle un video sobre el hundimiento. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando los familiares de victimas derramaban lagrimas de tristeza, los compinches conservadores de ella cometieron actos repugnantes como tomar \"foto de recuerdo\" teniendo en el trasfondo la lista de desaparecidos y organizar orgias en los restaurantes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo se ve, la tragedia del ferry \"Sewol\" no fue un accidente casual ni desastre natural.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark Geun-hye y sus complices actuaron con bajeza para ocultar la verdad de sus actos criminales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIntensificaron la represion fascista haciendo todo lo posible para evitar la expansion de la opinion publica critica a sus actos corruptos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos medios de prensa venales, instigados por los titeres surcoreanos, defendieron a Park informando que ella \"visita al lugar del incidente\", \"estimula las actividades de socorro\" y \"expresa condolencias a los familiares de desaparecidos\" y orquestaron hasta una farsa de que en un altar de incensacion, Park \"da consuelo\" a una anciana disfrazada de familiar de victima. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa traidora publico una \"declaracion al pueblo\" prometiendo esclarecer la verdad de la tragedia, castigar a los culpables e instituir la ley especial sobre el \"ferry Sewol\", pero de hecho, desprecio la demanda de los habitantes de diferentes sectores sobre la institucion de esa ley especial con el sofisma de que \"es importante el esclarecimiento practico, pero hace falta tambien el juicio politico\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe esta manera, 6 meses despues del incidente, quedo instituida a duras penas la ley especial que no estipula el castigo a los culpables ni permite esclarecer la verdad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo mas intolerable es que los titeres surcoreanos lanzaron a los gangsteres conservadores y derechistas como \"Oboi Yonhap\" a organizar un mitin para ofender como \"traficantes de cadaveres\" a los familiares de victimas que demandaban el esclarecimiento de la verdad de lo ocurrido. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark, expulsada de Chongwadae y encarcelada ahora, busca todavia la salida negando todos sus crimenes, incluso la tragedia del ferry \"Sewol\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara dejar en el secreto su comportamiento en 7 horas de la tragedia, presento hasta en el momento de juicio a si misma la respuesta escrita de contenido contradictorio, por conducto del panel de abogados. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos conservadores surcoreanos mostraron su mala intencion de obstaculizar la investigacion de la verdad del caso al autorizar al Ministerio de Pesca Maritima abrir a solas la investigacion en el terreno sobre el ferry sacado a flote, excluyendo el comite de medidas de familiares de muertos, desaparecidos y sobrevivientes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora los conservadores surcoreanos difunden el rumor de que el saque a flore del casco del barco es el merito de si mismos e insisten en publicar una carta blanca sobre el respecto sin aclarar la causa del accidente, lo cual provoca una avalancha de criticas tales como \"es inutil esa carta blanca a medias\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras existan Park y sus seguidores conservadores, no se dejara de repetir la tragedia del \"Sewol\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark y sus compinches seran sometidos al castigo severo sin poder eludir la responsabilidad del accidente de gran dimension."
