As a result, a fresh upswing has been effected in ideological and moral qualities of the Korean people, the daily says, and continues:\r\n   The Korean people know no other ideas but the Juche idea. \r\nOnly when the popular masses' cause of independence is guided by the Juche idea, can it emerge victorious without fail. The Korean people have such a faith and will.\r\n   They are persistently preserving the Juche character and the national character in the revolution and construction and maintaining independence in relations with foreign countries.\r\n   In recent years the imperialist allied forces have intensified vicious anti-socialist campaign to isolate and stifle the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  The political, economic and military positions of Korean socialism have been built up, though. Such  great achievements are attributable to the wise guidance of Kim Jong Il, who is leading the party members and other working people to imbue themselves with the Juche idea more firmly and maintain the revolutionary line of the Workers' Party of Korea in the revolution and construction, a line which is the embodiment of the Juche idea. \r\n\r\n"

In an article the daily says:\r\n   Many countries and nations have honestly repented of even sins they committed against their will. But Japan, which perpetrated unheard-of crimes intentionally under the sponsorship of the state, has persistently refused to assume responsibility for the crimes and make an official apology and compensation for them.\r\n   Japan's monstrous crimes against Korea and the immeasurable losses it inflicted on the Korean people have been proved by historical facts.\r\n   Ignoring the stark facts, however, Japan is willfully beautifying and justifying the crimes.\r\n   It is really brigands and shameless for Japan to describe the aggression on Korea and colonial rule over it as \"lawful\" and \"legal.\" \r\n   In the hope of evading its responsibility for the crimes against Korea and compensation for them, Japan has alleged that it did \"good things\" for Korea in the past.\r\n   The allegation is a brazen-faced lie and a militaristic logic.\r\n   Japan should clearly see the present situation, public demand and the trend of the time, take a proper attitude towards the history and atone for the crimes as soon as possible. \r\n\r\n"
