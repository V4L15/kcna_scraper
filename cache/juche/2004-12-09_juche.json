Korea Supported \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 8 (KCNA) -- Korea will surely be reunified true to the last instructions of President Kim Il Sung. The Organization of Solidarity of the Peoples of Africa, Asia and Latin America (OSPAAL) will fully support the struggle of the Korean people to force the U.S. troops from south Korea and remove their military bases there.\r\n Humberto Hernandez, general secretary of the OSPAAL in Cuba, said this on Dec. 1 when meeting with Pak Kyong Son, vice department director of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea who was leading the WPK delegation on a visit to Cuba. The organization will conduct a widespread solidarity movement in support of the peoples of the DPRK and other countries struggling for world peace against domination and subjugation, he noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Both Cuba and the DPRK have advanced despite the U.S. protracted blockade. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis blockade of the present Bush administration is bound to go bust thanks to the wise leadership of Fidel Castro and Kim Jong Il.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

But, only Japan has not yet shown any change in its attitude toward the settlement of the past, doggedly evading it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The militaristic view of thinking and mode of action have persisted in Japan century after century. This clearly indicates that it still seeks to repeat the history of aggression, oblivious of a lesson taught by the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Citing facts to disclose Japan's full-dressed moves to emerge a military giant for expansion overseas, the article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans and other Asian people are well aware of the reactionary and dangerous nature of those moves of the Japanese militarist forces and are closely following them with high vigilance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Asia and the rest of the world today are no longer what they used to be in the past when the Japanese imperialists had made a mockery of the destinies of other countries and nations and trampled down upon them as they pleased, going on the rampage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's overseas aggression will lead it to another defeat and that will make its resurrection quite impossible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The only way out for Japan in the new century is to fully redeem its crime-woven past, its historical commitment, at an early date and head for peace to get confidence of the international community.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"

This decade witnessed ever-growing worldwide concern for the Songun idea and politics and widespread diverse activities to disseminate and study them in Asia, Africa, Latin America and Europe and other parts of the world, says Rodong Sinmun Wednesday in a signed article.\r\n It took more than a hundred years for the socialist idea to be disseminated throughout the world after its emergence. But the great Songun idea was spread worldwide in a short time and has become a common idea of a large number of progressive political parties and organizations. This is something remarkable in the history of world politics, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun idea and politics have gripped the hearts of hundreds of millions of people today because they are the most viable idea and political mode that fully guarantee the sovereignty of the country and the nation and their prosperity in the era of independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The past decade was years of victories when leader  Kim Jong Il's great Songun idea and politics resolutely foiled the U.S. imperialists' strategy for a preemptive attack for aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He provided the world progressives with the invincible Songun idea and politics, an all-powerful treasured sword effective enough to contain and defeat the U.S. imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ours is the Songun era which requires not only the revolutionaries but progressive humankind to attach importance to military affairs and learn from Kim Jong Il's Songun idea and politics for global independence, the article says, adding that this is a new era of Juche-oriented revolution and a new higher stage for the accomplishment of the human cause of independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The great Songun idea and politics are shedding their rays all over the world and the movement for global independence is now making a victorious advance along the road of Songun, concludes the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He also took every possible step to save all the wounded. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Inspired by this, servicemen and people turned out as one and constructed modern dwelling houses and public buildings in the county seat in months. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unity, in which the leader shapes policies for the people and they remain faithful to him, is the source of inexhaustible strength with which the Korean people have wrought world-startling miracles despite economic difficulties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has fully demonstrated its political and military might in the international arena defying the persistent moves of the imperialists to isolate and stifle it. It has also produced such unassuming heroes, merited persons and hero mothers as worker An Jong Min, farmer Kim Tae Song, researcher Kim Sa Myong, teacher Kim Kyong Su and house-wife So Hye Suk. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThey have devoted their all to the leader, Party, fatherland and people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, monumental edifices have been built in different parts of the country to adorn the Songun era. Among them there are a large oxygen plant built and put into operation at the Songjin Steel Complex, the extra-large underground duct of the Paekma-Cholsan waterway, Kunmin (army and people) Power Station No. 410 and the Myongrye Kunmin Reservoir. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Scientists have achieved a number of scientific successes including scanning tunnel microscope and artificial bone.
