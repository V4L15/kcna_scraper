And it reactivated round-the-clock emergency sortie system of nuclear capable strategic bomber B-52, which existed during the Cold War era, and is maintaining a surprise strike posture with frequent flight of B-1B and B-2 formations to the air space of south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recalling the facts, the letter said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. flung the words of \"total destruction\" of a sovereign state at the UN General Assembly, the world largest official forum of diplomacy, and is now running amok for war exercises by introducing nuclear war equipment in and around the Korean peninsula. This goes to prove that the U.S. itself is a chief offender of the escalation of tension and undermining of peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The large scale nuclear war exercises and blackmails, which the U.S. have staged for a whole year without a break in collaboration with its followers to stifle the DPRK, make one conclude that the option we have taken was quite right and that we should go along the way to the last.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Despite this fact, the UN Security Council, whose mission is to ensure the world peace and security, keeps turning a blind eye to the nuclear war exercises of the U.S. which is hell-bent on bringing a catastrophic disaster to humanity, thereby giving rise to a serious concern on the double standard of the UNSC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this regard, in view of the world justice and impartiality, we kindly request the secretary-general to give your viewpoints as to the following questions:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Question 1; Do the nuclear war exercises in and around the Korean peninsula being undertaken by the U.S. for a whole year without a break at all targeting a sovereign state conform to the purpose of the UN Charter, which is to maintain peace and security？\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Question 2; Since the DPRK and the U.S. are legally in a state of armistice as belligerent parties as yet, does the questioning in the UNSC of the self-defensive measures of one belligerent party, the DPRK only as a \"threat\", ignoring the nuclear war provocative acts of the other belligerent party, the U.S., conform to the principle of sovereign equality of the UN Charter？\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We would like to politely request the secretary-general to give right answers to the questions raised in conformity with the requirement of the UN Charter and the mission of the UN Secretariat who is holding the impartiality and independence as its lifeline. At the same time we ask the secretary-general to bring to the attention of the UNSC under Article 99 of the UN Charter, regarding the danger being posed by the U.S. nuclear war exercises which are clearly threats to international peace and security."

Y le demandan al premier poner en claro su posicion de no participar en las provocativas maniobras militares de EE.UU. y entregar al Parlamento Federal el derecho al uso de las fuerzas armadas en la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHasta los paises regionales burlan que el premier australiano estaria disgusto si lo ponen en el segundo lugar en la adulancia a Trump, describiendolo como \"gato de papel ocultado detras de Trump, tigre de papel\", \"trompetero de Trump\" y \"ciudadano de segunda clase del Occidente\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El premier australiano debe liberarse de la absurda ilusion de detener con la supuesta \"unidad\" y \"presion\" el camino del pueblo coreano que avanza apoyandose en la idea de dar prioridad al autofortalecimiento y hacer con prudencia sus pronunciaciones y actos viendo correctamente la realidad hermosa y el gran poderio de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara el seria mejor abandonar su papel del titere de EE.UU. y cuidarse solo de los trabajos de su casa."
