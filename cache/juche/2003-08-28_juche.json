            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on Six-way Talks \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 27 (KCNA) -- The six-way talks to be held in Beijing will provide an occasion of showing to the times and history whether the U.S. has a will to drop its hostile policy toward the DPRK or not, says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary.\r\n It can be said that the six-way talks are the results of the initiative, a bold measure of good-will, the broadest magnanimity and the positive peace efforts of the DPRK, the commentary notes, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The parties concerned are, therefore, requested to make a good use of the hard-won opportunity to make the discussion successful and help the talks produce substantial results. The principle of equality and impartiality should be strictly observed and no prejudice, one-sided and unilateral attitude should be allowed at the talks. The parties concerned should pay particular attention to and guard against any attempt to use the talks as a leverage of international pressure intended to disarm somebody and handle the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. on an unequal and partial basis not by a measure of simultaneous action but talking only instead of action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The success or failure and fate of the six-way talks may depend on the stand and will of the U.S., the main party concerned responsible for the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should refrain from putting up unreasonable conditions and opting for meeting its unilateral demands and interests at the talks. The talks must follow the way of \"giving and taking\" under any circumstances. The U.S. should not attempt to force the DPRK to dismantle its nuclear deterrent force by making an empty promise or giving written \"security assurances\" without any legal binding force, but clarify its will to make a switchover in its hostile policy toward the DPRK and conclude a non-aggression treaty with it. This would be a key to the success of the six-way talks. Without this, it would be impossible to expect any substantial results from the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is good for the U.S. and other parties concerned to work hard to prevent such an undesirable thing as betraying the expectation of the international community and disappointing it from happening at the talks.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The GNP group, however, is turning its back on the exciting reality and persisting in the \"principle enemy\" doctrine, while letting loose an ugly torrent of rigmarole shunning the fellow countrymen and currying favor with outside forces. This makes it plain that the GNP intends to remain in confrontation with the north and continue to follow the road of flunkeyism and treachery in league with outside forces, standing against the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP is a group of evil piling up crimes against the country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation will never pardon the group of traitors who is committing only crimes, far from doing something beneficial to the nation.    \r\n \r\n\r\n"

These were premeditated and deliberate hostile acts seriously threatening the security of Chongryon and the safety and properties of Koreans in Japan, says Minju Joson today in a signed commentary.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is that the anti-Chongryon moves of the right-wing gangsters of Japan have become all the more undisguised, timed to coincide with the restart of the service of Mangyongbong-92 whose operation had been temporarily suspended. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese public safety authorities created a terror-ridden atmosphere and took an unusual alert posture, talking about \"strict counteraction\" as regards the entry of Mangyongbong-92 into Niigata Port. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The serious provocative acts were perpetrated against the Fukuoka Prefectural Headquarters of Chongryon and the Fukuoka Branch of the Nishi Credit Association of the Korean Bank just before the entry of the ship into the port and the criminal in the so-called \"statement claiming responsibility\" openly asserted that he took action to block the entry of the ship into Niigata Port. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This goes to prove that the Japanese authorities are encouraging the right-wing reactionaries in their moves against the DPRK and Chongryon. \r\n The commentary urges the Japanese authorities to thoroughly probe the truth behind the criminal acts committed by the right-wing gangsters, severely punish those responsible for the crimes and take responsible measure to prevent the recurrence of such anti-DPRK and anti-Chongryon actions.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n"
