            "content": "U.S. Human Rights Offensive against DPRK Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 28 (KCNA) -- It is said that the United States, having worked out the \"North Korean Human Rights Act\" aimed at \"overthrow of the political system\" of the DPRK, is now planning to appoint \"a special envoy in charge of north Korean human rights issue\" and looking for a suitable person.\r\n Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says it is the hackneyed method of the U.S. to politicize the \"human rights problem\" and, resorting to practices of option and double standard, exploit it in justifying its aggression, war, overthrow of political systems and change of regimes in anti-U.S. independent countries. This can be said of the \"North Korean Human Rights Act\" it cooked up recently, notes the analyst, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Sensing it hopeless to realize its scheme and stratagem to totally disarm the DPRK by forcing it to \"renounce its nuclear program first,\" the U.S. is now going to try its luck in \"overthrowing the regime\" of the DPRK and \"destroying its political system\" with \"human rights\" and \"democracy\" as the expedient. The \"North Korean Human Rights Act\" coined by it as it pleased under the cloak of \"improving human rights in north Korea\" is an offspring of this move. This is another undisguised political provocation against the DPRK to drive the socialist system, the life and soul of the Korean people,\r\nto a collapse at any cost with the \"human rights problem\" as well as the \"nuclear issue\" as its two-pronged javelin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unshakable is the principled stand of the DPRK to answer the reactionary human rights offensive of the U.S. with a revolutionary one, and its \"strength\" with strength. Today when the U.S. stand and policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK, refusing the Korean style idea and system and peaceful co-existence with it, is getting all the clearer, the confidence and will of the Korean People's Army and people to firmly defend the country's sovereignty and socialism with a mighty self-defensive deterrent force is becoming stronger and their hatred for the U.S. is burning fiercer a thousand fold. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to formulate a stand for a policy change, dropping its fantastic dream of stifling the DPRK with the \"nuclear issue\" and the \"human rights problem\" as its two-pronged javelin.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Anti-Reunification Acts of S. Korean \"Government for People\" Reviewed \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 28 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland Monday published a document reviewing the two-year course of the anti-reunification acts of the south Korean authorities that have endangered the foundation of the inter-Korean relations.\r\n The present south Korean authorities, the document says, in the first days after they took office, put forward what they called \"policy of peace and prosperity\", the keynote of which was the promotion of \"nation's security and prosperity,\" declaring they would inherit and develop all the achievements gained after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration.\r\nBut their acts over the last two years are quite the contrary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Truth to tell, they have done nothing helpful to the implementation of the declaration and improvement of the inter-Korean relations but have systematically all along done grave harm to this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Playing into the hands of the United States and the Grand National Party, the south Korean \"government for people\", shortly after it came to power, accepted the treacherous \"law on special inspection\" and brought to trials and punished one after another those who had contributed to the declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities barred the Pyongyang trip of a south Korean delegation for paying homage to President  Kim Il Sung on the 10th anniversary of his demise. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hand in glove with the U.S. and its satellites, they seduced and abducted civilians of the DPRK abroad and took them to south Korea in groups under the cloak of \"defectors from the north,\" thus leading the inter-Korean relations to a worse phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No sooner had it taken office than the \"government for people\" staged anti-north joint military exercises under various codenames such as \"Foal Eagle\", \"Reception, Staging, Onward-movement and Integration\" and \"Ulji Focus Lens\" in the land, sky and waters of south Korea almost every day in league with war maniac Bush. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And they let the U.S. ship into south Korea in a wholesale manner mass destruction weapons including ultra modern military equipment tested in the real wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to strike at fellow countrymen and have worked out war scenarios for a preemptive attack on the north such as OPLAN 5030 and OPLAN 5027-04 with the United States and put spurs to their implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities have pursued the collapse of the political system of the north, systematically renewing the \"emergency plan to cope with a fast changing situation of the north\". They mapped out in secrecy such \"emergency plans\" as Chungmu 3300 and Chungmu 9000 and have renewed them all along. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In November, they listed at least 30 Internet homepages such as \"Our Nation's Auditorium\" and \"By Our Nation Itself\" as \"pro-north sites\" and took a step of cutting off all their connections. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If south Korea which is subordinate to the United States possesses nuclear weapons, they would be nuke of aggression to strike at fellow countrymen jointly with foreign forces and nuke of crime to destroy the Korean nation and reduce the Korean Peninsula to ruins. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They forced additional troop dispatch to Iraq with outcries for \"alliance\" with the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"government for people\" gave up \"reforms\" half way, coming to terms with the ultra-right conservatives and failing to scrap the \"National Security Law\" harmful to the inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The whole course of its acts over the past two years is a course of anti-reunification acts in which it has put the brake on the implementation of the June 15 joint declaration and brought to a deadlock the favorably developing inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Due to all the wrong acts of the south Korean authorities, multi-channel dialogues and contacts including the ministerial talks have stopped and the inter-Korean relations frozen, and the situation of the Korean Peninsula is rushing headlong to an acute confrontation and strain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Stating that the above-said review involves questions of principle concerning the dignity and system of the DPRK and the reunification of the country and the destiny of the nation, the document urges the south Korean \"government for people\" to admit its two-year course of acts against reunification and apologize to the nation at an early date in whatever form and way considered suitable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The future of the inter-Korean relations entirely depends on the south Korean authorities' attitude, concludes the document. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This stirring reality eloquently proves that the Songun policy of Kim Jong Il serves as a banner of national independence as it makes it possible for the people to build a rich and powerful country on their own, believing in their own strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to his Songun leadership the people of the DPRK are proud to be a revolutionary people who preserve and glorify the national identity in all fabrics of social life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are preserving and exalting the Juche character and national identity in all domains of the revolution and construction under his wise guidance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is under his Songun leadership that the fine tradition of the Korean nation is now in full bloom and a sound and revolutionary way of socialist cultural and emotional life is prevailing throughout the country. As a result, there is no room for any form of ideological and cultural poisoning by the U.S. imperialists. This is the true picture of the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They dared not make such assertion for some time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This ill-boding assertion helps us guess what a Korea policy the Bush administration will shape for its second term. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their assertion means, in the final analysis, that the DPRK should lay down its arms and abandon its system, yielding to the U.S. It is an unacceptable demand that can never be met. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has already clarified more than once the stand that the DPRK-U.S. nuclear issue is an offspring of the present U.S. administration's extremely hostile policy towards the DPRK and, accordingly, the issue can be settled only when the U.S. drops its hostile policy aimed at the \"overthrow of the system\" in the DPRK and opts for co-existence with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is nonsensical for the U.S. to assert that the DPRK, which has been in the hostile relationship and technically at war with the former for over half a century, should accept the unilateral demand for \"disarmament\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It will be something unimaginable that the DPRK will accept such coercive and brigandish demand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is grossly mistaken if it calculates that the DPRK will lay down its arms of its own accord under any pressure from somebody. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Self-defensive power is our life and soul and the core of our Songun policy is to attach importance to arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to stay calm and do its own business, if it has no will to co-exist with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no reason for the DPRK to make haste.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
