            "content": "CPRF Issues Indictment \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, March 7 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland issued a lengthy indictment on March 6, denouncing the transfer of the U.S. military bases in south Korea pursuant to the U.S. policy to launch a war of aggression against the DPRK as a very dangerous move to reinforce those bases to meet its strategic and greedy interests. The indictment, which was released at a time when the U.S. is placing on the order of the day the issue of transferring the U.S.\r\nmilitary bases in south Korea under the pretext of the \"relocation\" of the U.S. troops, asserted that there is neither reason nor pretext for the U.S. to keep those bases in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It roundly exposed the true essence and the purpose of the bases of the U.S. troops who have brought unspeakable misfortune and sufferings to the Korean nation, remaining in the south side of the Korean peninsula like poisonous thorns for nearly 60 years under the signboards of \"security\" and \"peace\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the indictment, the U.S. military bases in south Korea are densest in the world and a military centre involving the three services. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The indictment continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has at least 90 military bases of all sorts throughout south Korea from the joint security area of Panmunjom to the Mosulpho air force base in Jeju Island. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bases are the principal place of Yankees whose essential attributes are murder, arson, plunder and destruction and the rendezvous of mercenary soldiers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have brought immeasurable material and economic damage to south Korea. They have not only inflicted human and material damage on south Korea but served as a center widely disseminating corrupt Yankee culture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those bases are the inviolable entities that the U.S. occupation forces are given absolute privilege. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. forced south Korea to sign \"agreements\" which legally allow it to use south Korean land for an indefinite period free of charge and furthermore, makes south Korea pay directly or indirectly tens of billions of U.S. dollars a year for the upkeep of those bases and facilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These bases are considered \"kingdoms of darkness\" where all the crimes of U.S. troops are covered and backed and the security of criminals is guaranteed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All sorts of crimes committed by the U.S. troops in south Korea number 5 cases on a daily average and the number of those reported so far stands at more than 270,000 cases. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. military bases in south Korea are bases for aggression and war wearing the veil of \"peace.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those bases serve as local tools implementing the U.S. policy for the war of aggression against the DPRK and vantage points of military strategic importance for attacking and invading the DPRK any moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They also serve as forward bases of war supplies for the war of aggression against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Deployed in those bases are nuclear weapons, depleted uranium shells, N-bombs and other weapons of mass destruction that gravely threaten human lives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. forces bases in south Korea also play a role of a scout unit for the aggression of the DPRK including espionage and military provocation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. frantic moves to transfer its military bases in south Korea are aimed to step up and finally round off its preparations for the aggression of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those bases are look-out posts for the perpetuation of national division which militarily back the U.S. policy of perpetuating the division of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a strong trend for reconciliation, unity and reunification between the north and the south of Korea has come after the publication of the historic June 15 joint declaration, the U.S. has overtly and covertly worked to check it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bases in south Korea are the biggest powder magazines in Far East that have been deployed according to the U.S. strategy to put Asia under its domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Stockpiled in those bases are all types of military equipment including thousands of tactical nuclear weapons, many depleted uranium shells, all types of aircraft including F-16 and F-15 fighters, means for carrying nukes, and hundreds of Lance, Patriot and other missiles and atomic artillery pieces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those are aimed to invade not only north Korea but other parts of Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As long as the U.S. military bases, powder magazines in the East, continue to exist in south Korea, a war by the U.S. to loot Asia is unavoidable in the new century. A war is the matter of time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is neither reason nor pretext for the U.S. to keep its military bases in south Korea. Their presence in south Korea is illegal and unlawful.  Their presence diametrically runs counter to the resolution of the UN General Assembly on withdrawing the U.S. troops from south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. will never escape a shameful fate of being driven out south Korea, if it persistently seeks to keep its troops there.    \r\n\r\n"
