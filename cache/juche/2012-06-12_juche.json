            "content": "Kim Jong Un Makes Public Treatise to Mark Centenary of Birth of Kim Il Sung\r\n Pyongyang, June 12 (KCNA) -- The dear respected Kim Jong Un made public treatise titled \"The Great Comrade Kim Il Sung Is the Eternal Leader of Our Party and People\" on April 20 to mark the centenary of the birth of President Kim Il Sung. \n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un said in his treatise:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The celebrations of the centenary of the President's birth were the Korean people's expression of boundless reverence and noble sense of moral obligation towards him and a grand political festival of all people praising the 100-year-long history of Juche Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the greatest honor and pride of the Korean people and happiness of posterity to hold the President in high esteem as an  eternal leader as he is revered by the entire Korean nation and the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Comrade Kim Il Sung was the most prominent leader and peerlessly great man in the 20th century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world does not know such a prominent leader, peerless patriot and great revolutionary as Kim Il Sung who glorified the 20th century as the century of victory in the cause of independence against imperialism, the cause of socialism while enjoying absolute support and confidence of the people from his teens to the 80s with his outstanding idea, leadership ability and noble virtues. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His whole life was the noble life of a popular leader who regarded believing in people as in Heaven as his maxim and embodied it in his ideas and leadership, translating it into a reality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was thanks to the leadership of the President that the new historical era, there came the  Juche era in which the popular masses once sidelined in history hew out their own destiny by their own efforts in the center of the times and history. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was a historic event to be specially recorded in the history of human thinking and the revolutionary struggle of the popular masses that the President held aloft the banner of independence and formulated it as the principle and way for making a revolution and put it into practice. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The President steadily developed the relations with foreign parties and states on the principle of independence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was an invincible and iron-willed commander and military genius who started the Korean revolution and led it to victory with arms. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was highly praised and deeply trusted by the world people as an iron-willed commander, outstanding strategist and a symbol of victory in the anti-imperialist struggle as he defeated the formidable enemies, the Japanese and U.S. imperialists who were superior in numerical strength and military technique with politico-ideological, strategic and tactical superiority in the last anti-Japanese revolutionary war and the Fatherland Liberation War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was the greatest man whom no one could match in the revolutionary traits and personality. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For a long period since he embarked upon the road of the revolution, he suffered bitterest grief and agony, but he always thought of the revolution only and devoted his all to its victory. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the course of the protracted revolution, the President protected in a responsible manner the destiny and future of those whom he once made comrades. He took care of tens of thousands of revolutionary soldiers and deeply trusted them and showed every possible loving care for them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With warm humanity and exceptionally simple and unassuming personality, he took deep care of the people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He trusted all those who loved the country and the nation and put them forward as eternal companions in the way of working for them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He, possessed of broad and deep humanity, forged close friendship with many foreign party and state leaders as well as famous political, social and academic figures who aspired after independence. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had the biggest number of comrades and friends in the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The President was the eternal leader of the Workers' Party of Korea and the Korean people and the sun of Juche who laid the eternal foundation for the victorious advance and completion of the revolutionary cause of Juche. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The President founded the great Juche idea, ushering in a new era of the Juche revolution and leading the social revolution at various stages to a shining victory by applying the Juche idea and  performing undying feats in all fields of the revolution and construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean revolution is making a dynamic advance while working historic miracles in all domains of socialist construction despite unimaginable difficulties and ordeals. This is thanks to the WPK, a revolutionary party of Juche-type, the DPRK, a genuine people's government, and the matchless People's Army which were founded and developed by the President, and the people whom he reared to be strong in thinking and faith. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The single-minded unity of the party, army and people around the leader firmly assures the political stability and solidity of the state and society and it serves as a powerful engine for defending the socialist country and vigorously pushing forward the revolution and construction. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He successfully solved the issue of succession to the revolutionary cause, providing a sure guarantee for the steadfast succession and victorious completion of the revolutionary cause of Juche century after century and generation after generation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He, regarding the country's reunification as the most important patriotic cause of the nation, worked heart and soul for the development of the movement of the country's reunification and performed precious feats in the efforts to realize the cherished desire of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He checked and foiled the moves of the imperialist reactionaries for domination and worked hard for the development of the world socialist movement, the victory of independent cause against imperialism, the establishment of independent and fair international relations and global peace and security under the uplifted banner of independence and international justice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The President is alive as the sun of Juche and the 100-year-long history of Juche Korea shines with his august name because leader Kim Jong Il firmly defended the idea and cause of the President and wisely led the drive for carrying out them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il was the closest revolutionary comrade and the most faithful comrade-in-arms of the President as he upheld the President, regarding it as his lifelong mission to adhere to his idea and cause and glorify them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il formulated the revolutionary idea of the President as Kimilsungism and put forth the modeling of whole society on Kimilsungism as the supreme programme for the party and the revolution, bringing about an epochal turn in carrying out the revolutionary cause of Juche. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He made sure that the President was held in high esteem as the eternal leader of the party and people and the eternal President of the DPRK and aroused the whole party and army and all the people to the drive to carry out his behests, taking them as a programme of the party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the banner of Songun, Kim Jong Il protected the dignity and supreme interests of the country and the nation in reliance on powerful arms and glorified the socialist country of Juche as an invincible socialist power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il ushered in the June 15 era of reunification and brought about a new phase in developing foreign relations with his energetic leadership true to the behests of the President.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The history of Kim Il Sung's nation, Kim Jong Il's Korea, is a glorious course in which the Korean revolution started in Mt. Paektu and has recorded victories. This is a path of eternal victory to be followed by the Korean people for final victory and a path of prosperity of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the revolutionary duty and noble moral obligation of the party and people of the DPRK to hold Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il in high esteem for all ages and successfully carry forward and accomplish generation after generation the revolutionary cause of Juche bequeathed by them, Kim Jong Un said in his treatise, putting forth the tasks for carrying them out.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un called for firmly preserving and glorifying the idea and exploits of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il for all ages, cherishing the unshakable conviction that they are with the Korean people forever.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underlined the need to take Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism as the unique guiding idea and permanent guidelines of the Korean revolution and advance the revolution and construction as required by Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also called for carrying forward the idea and exploits of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il in the building of party, state and revolutionary armed forces and underscored the need to build the party, state and army in the way they did.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the sectors and units should glorify the records of leadership provided by Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il to them and carry through their behests to bring the intentions and desire in their lifetime into reality, Kim Jong Un said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also called for successfully carrying forward the Juche-oriented ideas of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il on cultural construction and the feats performed by them in it and giving full play to the advantages and vitality of Korean-style socialist culture.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed the need to accomplish the historic cause of national reunification without fail true to the noble patriotic intentions and last instructions of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, boost foreign relations of the DPRK in the idea of independence, peace and friendship and make positive contributions to global independence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed that the WPK and the army and people of the DPRK would faithfully carry forward the idea and cause of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il and accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche under the uplifted banner of Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism."

entero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El camarada Kim Il Sung es el mas destacado lider y Gran Hombre sin par del siglo XX.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No hubo otro lider, patriota y revolucionario tan extraordinario como el que corono el siglo XX como el de victoria de la causa de independencia antiimperialista y la socialista bajo el apoyo y la confianza absoluta del pueblo que ganaba como reconocimiento a su idea y direccion extraordinarias y nobles virtudes durante largo tiempo desde a la edad tierna de diez y tantos anos hasta a la edad avanzada de 80 anos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Toda su vida fue la noble de lider popular que tomo como maxima de vida el ideario Iminwichon (el pueblo es cielo) y lo hizo realidad materializandolo en sus pensamientos y direccion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Cuando el camarada Kim Il Sung fue enaltecido como lider, comenzo la nueva epoca de la historia, la del Juche, en que las masas populares, que antes estuvieron al margen de la historia, forjan su destino por cuenta propia poniendose en el centro de la epoca y la historia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Constituye un evento historico digno de registrarse en letras mayusculas en la historia de pensamientos de la humanidad y de lucha revolucionaria de las masas populares el hecho de que el haya levantado por primera vez la bandera de independencia y la haya definido como principio y modo de la revolucion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Desarrollo sin cesar en el principio de independencia tambien las relaciones con los partidos y Estados de otros paises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El fue invencible general de acero y genio militar que allano el camino de la revolucion coreana y la condujo a la victoria con las fuerzas

pueda sufrir el hombre.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Durante su larga carrera de revolucionario, se responsabilizaba y protegia hasta el final el destino y el futuro de todos que se hicieron sus

cordialmente al pueblo dando pruebas de su humanidad, modestia y franqueza.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Abrazaba en su regazo y depositaba confianza en cualesquiera que amaran el pais y la nacion presentandolos como companeros eternos en la causa por la patria y la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Presidente Kim Il Sung, que tenia profunda y amplia humanidad, trabo estrecha amistad con los

nombre gracias al Dirigente           Kim Jong Il quien defendio con firmeza la ideologia y la causa del primero y condujo sabiamente la lucha por cumplirlas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Jong Il fue el

legado del Presidente, el Dirigente abrio con su energica guia la era de reunificacion del 15 de Junio y una nueva coyuntura en el desarrollo de las relaciones exteriores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa historia de la nacion de Kim Il Sung y la Corea de Kim Jong Il es la trayectoria gloriosa en que la revolucion coreana dio su primer paso en el Paektu y vino triunfando hasta la fecha, y la senda de victoria eterna y prosperidad de la patria que debemos seguir emprendiendo por la victoria final.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLe corresponden al partido y al pueblo el deber revolucionario y la noble obligacion moral de enaltecer siempre al camarada Kim Il Sung y al camarada Kim Jong Il y continuar generacion tras generacion la causa revolucionaria del Juche, legada por ellos, hasta su feliz

como unica y eterna idea directiva de la revolucion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs preciso continuar integramente la idea y las hazanas del Presidente y el Dirigente en la construccion del partido, el Estado y las fuerzas armadas revolucionarias y cumplir esta tarea a la manera de ellos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn todas las ramas y unidades, deben llevar a la realidad lo que se proponian y deseaban en su vida el Presidente y el Dirigente, al conservar y transmitir bien sus huellas de direccion registradas en sus centros de trabajo y cumplir cabalmente sus legados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn
