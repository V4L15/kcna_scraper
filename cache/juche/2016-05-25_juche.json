And a litany of such provocative invectives that \"a switchover in the U.S. government's policy towards north Korea entirely hinges on its changes\" is reeled off.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The warmongers of the Pentagon are openly talking about their plan to stage the U.S.-Japan-south Korea joint drills under the simulated conditions of an actual war for coping with the \"threat\" from the DPRK's ballistic missiles for the first time in history as part of the scheduled large-scale RIMPAC exercises. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The cunning U.S. is taking such double-dealing attitude as hurling the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops present in south Korea under the mask of \"UN force\" into the Military Demarcation Line in Panmunjom for the farce of \"informing\" over loudspeaker the KPA side of its wish to restore the severed DPRK-U.S. military hotline and resume contact, afraid of punishment in case it turns down the DPRK's principled demand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement clarified once again that the hostile policy persistently pursued by the U.S. towards the DPRK is a product of its anachronistic and unreasonable one lacking understanding and self-ruinous policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The first reason is that the above-said policy is a product of the anachronistic dream as it is insisting on its unilateral brigandish demand, disregarding the changed reality and the trend of the times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Early in the 1950s, the U.S. invaded the north, brandishing A-bomb against rifle but it is standing against the irresistible entity possessed of even tremendous H-bomb called \"absolute weapon\" on our planet at present.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tragedy is that the U.S. is ignoring not only the changed reality but the trend of the times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The longer the U.S. is carried away by the hallucination of aggression and war, disregarding the worldwide trend, and the more reckless moves it pursues to isolate and stifle the DPRK, the bitterer disgrace it will suffer and the dearer price it will have to pay.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The second reason is that the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK is a product of ignorance based on the theory of the jungle law bereft of any elementary understanding of its rival.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK-U.S. confrontation has lasted for 71 years amid an extreme hostility.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK remains unchanged as it has been consistently pursued by the most hostile and outrageous methods. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S would be well advised to realize that it is the best way of escaping the nightmare and misfortune to properly understand who its rival is, though belatedly, recognize the reality, though painful, and reshape its foolish Korea policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The third reason is that the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK is a product of a self-ruinous policy as it only precipitates its most miserable final doom by itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The history of the DPRK-U.S. confrontation clearly records the immutable law that certain victory is the tradition of Songun Korea and the brigandish U.S. is fated to sustain a defeat. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should foresee what the DPRK-U.S. relations will be in future in case it insists on its hostile policy toward the DPRK in the light of the past and present realities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For the U.S. to roll back its anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK as early as possible, though belatedly, would only offer it an opportunity of escaping a miserable fate."

The Japanese aggressors plundered Korea of resources running into astronomical figures. Not content with this, they even deprived the Koreans of their names and the standard time of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The evidence proving their shuddering crimes has been fully backed up by the testimonies made by the victims and the academic circle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the Japs have a shred of conscience and morality, they should admit the past crimes and apologize to the Korean nation and the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries are, however, blatantly challenging the justice of mankind by denying the past crimes and embellishing them, instead of making an apology and reparation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From the outset of the year the prime minister, foreign minister and members of House of Representatives from the Liberal Party of Japan spat out a string of rigmaroles one after another that Japan remains unchanged in its stand that there is no evidence proving the involvement of the army and government authorities in forcible drafting and victims of sexual slavery were prostitutes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan became so immoral and shameless in its bid to evade the responsibility for the hideous crimes against humanity as to publish the textbooks which openly denied and embellished its past crimes on the ridiculous premise that post-war generations should not be obliged to make apology.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Militarism is stirred up among the Japanese people due to the government and ultra-right forces' vicious distortion of history and unethical discrimination and suppression of the Koreans in Japan, victims of the past crimes, are getting ever more pronounced. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Moreover, the Japanese reactionaries are desperately resorting to militarist moves for territory expansion, groundlessly making a \"claim to Tok Islets.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This reveals Japan's sinister scenario to realize its old dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The international community is following with high vigilance the Japanese reactionaries' moves for revival of militarism and reinvasion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should properly understand the watchful stand and attitude of the international community towards Japan and the changed balance of forces in Asia, in particular, drop their day dream and make an apology and reparation for their past crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan will have a rosy future only when it makes a sincere apology and honest reparation."
