            "content": "S. Korean Puppet FM Rebuked for Inciting Confrontation\r\n Pyongyang, August 1 (KCNA) -- Some days ago, Ryu Myong Hwan, puppet minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade of south Korea, appeared in a press conference at the end of a meeting held overseas to talk rubbish over the June \"elections to local self-governing bodies\" in south Korea. Complaining that young people of south Korea were taken in by the assertion that voting for the \"Grand National Party\" would bring about a war, he said that they may go to the north if they like. \n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on this fact, Rodong Sinmun Sunday says:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His remarks are not only an expression of his extreme hostility toward the south Korean people struggling for independence, democracy and reunification but also an unpardonable provocation to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Traitor Ryu made such reckless remarks, even in a foreign country, over the matter which is none of his business as a diplomat. This fully reveals not only his moral vulgarity but the fascist and treacherous scheme to suppress the south Korean progressive forces of different strata by linking them with the DPRK and persist in showdown with it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ryu is a person accustomed to sycophancy and treachery and confrontation with fellow countrymen. He is a diehard confrontation maniac and a rare-to-be-seen traitor as he is mad about anti-DPRK smear campaign and keen on doing harm to the fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such traitor as Ryu had better find his place in an alien land to lead a poor life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His remarks were a revelation of awareness of crisis caused by shame and defeat they suffered from the campaign for confrontation with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He will have to pay dearly for his remarks."

Korean Naval Exercises\r\nPyongyang, August 1 (KCNA) -- Leading newspapers here on Sunday run signed commentaries branding the large-scale joint naval exercises staged by the south Korean puppet warmongers and the U.S. in the East Sea of Korea as an undisguised military provocation to the DPRK and an unpardonable treacherous crime that brings the situation of the Korean Peninsula to the phase of a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t  The exercises are actual maneuvers and test war intended to ignite a war for aggression on the DPRK from A to Z, Rodong Sinmun points out, and says:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The provocative nature of the said saber-rattling is well illustrated by the armed forces and up-to-date war equipment involved in it and its contents. It was a very reckless and dangerous war gamble beyond comparison with the past war exercises in contents, form, scale, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The joint naval exercises are only the first step rather than coming to a close. Through them, the warmongers at home and abroad have further perfected their operational ability to put the war scenarios for aggression on the DPRK by preemptive attack into practice. The puppet forces are planning to stage 10 odd kinds of war games, including Ulji Freedom Guardian and anti-submarine drill, with the U.S. in succession in across south Korea till the end of this year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak group should not run amuck at random, mindful that it will get nothing but disgraceful defeat and death from such military confrontation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson says that if the warmongers unleash a war against the DPRK, they will get to see what is a true war.
