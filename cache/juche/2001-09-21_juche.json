He has identified three kinds of Saponin: Koryo Insam Saponin R1, R2 and R3, and revealed their structures.\r\n Whether these ingredients are peculiar to Koryo Insam under soil conditions of Korea and what part they play in the special medicinal effect of the herb have yet to be discovered. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After separating the Saponins and studying their structures, the researchers have produced a dozen standard products of Insam Saponin, a quality criterion of Insam products. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have also developed techniques for making anti-cancer Saponin from Koryo Insam. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Koryo Insam contains Saponin which is potentially anti-cancerous, but too inadequate in quantity to be effective. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By chemical and microbiological methods, the researchers have changed the structure of the Saponin so that it is contained in relatively greater proportion in the ginseng, enough to prove beneficial against cancer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This achievement adds greatly to the popularity of Koryo Insam.    \r\n\r\n"

In this regard Minju Joson today says in a signed commentary:\r\n This is a foolish trick which can be dreamed up only by the Japanese reactionaries accustomed to exploiting other's misfortune for attaining their foul aim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is nothing but a clumsy drama orchestrated by the Japanese reactionaries to take advantage of the international situation getting daily complicated in the wake of the large-scale terrorist attacks on the united states for attaining their foolish aim to tarnish the DPRK's prestige and calm down international protest and condemnation of their wartime atrocities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's prestige is rising in the international area as the days go by. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This cannot but be a telling blow to the Japanese reactionaries because they regard the anti-DPRK hostile policy as their state policy and are desperately pursuing it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are keen to undercut the DPRK's prestige at any cost and justify their policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will not pardon them for getting feverish in their anti-DPRK campaign, groundlessly pulling it up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their desperate moves to infringe upon the DPRK's dignity and sovereignty compel it to strongly react to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are well advised to give up at once such a foolish farce as inviting disasters and beg the DPRK to pardon them.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on guiding idea in era of independence \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 21 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article titled \"founding of guiding idea in era of independence\" says that President Kim Il Sung founded the Juche idea, the guiding idea in our era, and leader Kim Jong Il has steadily developed and enriched it. \r\n The president was the most outstanding thinker and theoretician in the era of independence, it says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The president founded the Juche idea with a deep insight into the requirements of the new era in which the popular masses, once oppressed and humiliated, emerged as the master of their destinies. He thus put the people's struggle for independence on a new higher stage and ushered in a new era, the era of independence in the development of human history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Juche idea has been embodied in the Korean revolution to bring about a fundamental turn in the destiny of the country and the nation. The great epoch-making role played by the Juche idea for the country and the revolution and in the cause of global independence in the 20th century cannot stand comparison with any revolutionary idea of the working class. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The president's revolutionary idea and theory are not only of encyclopedic significance but completely original ideas and theories as they are new discoveries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The new ideas and theories comprehensively propounded by him include the theory on the anti-imperialist, anti-feudal democratic revolution, the original theory of the socialist revolution on transforming relations of production on socialist lines prior to technical reconstruction and the theory on the three revolutions, ideological, technical and cultural. All this could not be found in the preceding revolutionary ideas and theories of the working class. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The socialist construction has made a victorious advance along the unique road of development in Korea entirely because he advanced the original revolutionary ideas and theories and led the work to apply them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When people uphold his revolutionary ideas and theories they can solve any problem arising in revolutionary practice in the era of independence. This is the truth proven in the revolutionary struggle of the 20th century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His famous works, a library of the Juche idea, have been published in over 60 languages in more than 100 countries and disseminated there. This clearly shows how outstanding his ideological and theoretical exploits are. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These immortal ideological and theoretical wealth created by the president, the wealth no other man could ever do, would have been unthinkable without his natural gift and outstanding activities as a thinker and theoretician. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il has always exerted his utmost efforts to defend and exalt the revolutionary ideas of the president in the whole course of his revolutionary activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the president's demise, Kim Jong Il put up the slogan \"Let us thoroughly arm ourselves with the revolutionary idea of the great leader comrade Kim Il Sung\" and has since worked heart and soul to exalt the idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ideological and theoretical activities conducted by Kim Jong Il in the 90s are so outstanding that they can hardly be found in the biography of any great man.     \r\n\r\n"

Saying that always busy with the building of a new homeland after the liberation of the country followed by war and rehabilitation, his life never allowed him to relax even a moment, he told him that probably he would not be able to drop the habit of rising early in the morning all his life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was one day in November, Juche 44 (1955), 2 years after the war ceased, officials visited him and showed blueprints of his residence. The president, turning them one by one, instructed them to build a small and simple house of Korean-style instead of building a big luxury one with imported materials, reproaching them for going to separate him from the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A revised design shown to him a few days later was also rejected as he was not pleased with too large space of some parts of the house. He, with a smile on his face, told officials to build as large and magnificent a building as they please when building a schoolchildren's palace in the future. The design was thus revised three times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is another anecdote about him. On May 1, Juche 49 (1960) there was a state banquet in celebration of the holiday of the working class in the presence of the president. After a while he asked the officials to permit him to leave the hall as dear guests were awaiting him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They were none other than Choe Yong Ok and her sisters who ran to greet him when he arrived at his residence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They were orphans whom he knew only a few days ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Worried that they might spend the holiday lonesomely, the president called them to his residence.    \r\n\r\n"
