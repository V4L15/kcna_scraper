Paektu has recently found mysterious \"snow-ice caves\" in some deep valleys of Mt. Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMembers of the corps say the \"snow-ice caves\" are products of natural phenomenon peculiar to Mt. Paektu where winter lasts over 200 days with heavy snows, summer is short, temperature is low and wind is strong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWith the advent of warm spring, thaw begins in the deep valleys of Mt. Paektu. The surface is heated by sunshine in daytime allowing the snow melt at the bottom and it freezes at night with the temperature falling below zero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe ice is different from the ordinary ice. It is a mixture of water from melted snow and pumice grain carried by wind blowing over snow.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWith the repetition of this process, the upper layer becomes hard \"snow-ice\" while streams are created at the bottom of the valleys by water from melted snow flowing down from the upper part and gathering from mountain ridges. By this water course the holes are steadily widened to bring caves into shape.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the meantime, the pumice grains carried by wind create a thick layer on the surface, which reduces the effect of solar radiation. This can be said to be the start of the formation of \"snow-ice caves\" in Mt. Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen summer comes, with the rise of temperature, the snow piled up in valleys melts and flows down in earnest. With the repetition of this process, the width, height and depth of the caves increase to take on the full looks of caves. But, when the short summer passes and autumn comes, the ceilings of the caves, soaked in water during summer, get frozen again to become \"snow-ice.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen snow falls and temperature drops below zero in Mt. Paektu, the flow of water at the bottom completely stops and the snow-ice of ceilings gets harder to present grotesque patterns. The process is repeated every year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe steeper and the deeper the valley is, the faster the \"snow-ice caves\" take shape.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThose caves look fantastic for the icicles from the ceilings, the ice columns standing up to the ceilings from the bottoms, the wonderful grooves on the bottoms and wavy patterns on the ceilings."

Esto deviene un acto absurdo igual que agotar el oceano con cucharon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  Asi senala el periodico Rodong Sinmun en un articulo individual del dia 10 y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  Pese a las persistentes sanciones de ese pais isleno la RPDC ha echado sin vacilacion la firme base de la economia nacional independiente y, a base de esta, ha impulsado exitosamente la construccion socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  Es muy ridiculo y absurdo el comportamiento de Japon que piensa como si Corea no pudiera vivir sin su \"asistencia\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  La RPDC no atribuye ningun significado a la presion y la sancion de Japon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  Ella tiene el modo de vida a la manera suya y el metodo de subsistencia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   La presion y sancion no surtiran ningun efecto para la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  Los reaccionarios japoneses hablan del \"fortalecimiento de presion\" y la \"sancion adicional\" contra la RPDC para inculcar mas la hostilidad a la RPDC entre sus habitantes y satisfacer asi su ambicion de tomar el poder, por una parte y por la otra, tratan de interceptar el contacto y las negociaciones intergubernamentales entre Corea y Japon e impedir a toda costa la ejecucion de la Declaracion Corea-Japon de Pyongyang y el acuerdo de las conversaciones a 6 bandas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  Japon, cautivado del modo de pensamiento del politiquero, sigue recurriendo a tales viles metodos y actua tan absurdamente para atentar a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   La RPDC respondera con la sobredureza al fortalecimiento de la presion y sancion de Japon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  Este pais isleno debe actuar con prudencia reflexionando de las graves consecuencias que emanen de tal alboroto anti-RPDC."
