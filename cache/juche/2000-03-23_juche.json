            "content": "KPA navy command's important communique \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Pyongyang, March 23 (KCNA) -- The navy command of the Korean People's Army today issued an important communique \"on declaring 'order of navigating to and from five islands' as a follow-up measure related to the fixing of Military Demarcation Line at the West Sea of Korea .\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The communique reads: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe general staff of the Korean People's Army, prompted by the desire to ensure territorial stability and peace, fixed the MDL at the West Sea of Korea  and declared it to the world on September 2, Juche 88 (1999). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe MDL at the West Sea of Korea   is the most reasonable, realistic and fair and aboveboard one that is in full accord not only with the Korean armistice agreement but with the international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe world people and even political, public and academic circles of South Korea admit the illegality of the \"Northern Limit Line\" and the legal validity of the new MDL at the west sea, saying that the new MDL at the west sea is based on a strong logic. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"silent recognition\" and \"maintenance\" of the \"Northern Limit Line\" on the lips of the U.S. forces side are thinly-veiled excuses designed to get rid of the inextricable position into which it was thrown by the just and fair and aboveboard MDL fixed by us at the West Sea of Korea . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Taking into consideration the fact that Paekryong, Taechong, Sochong, Yonphyong and U islands are under the U.S. forces side's control under the Korean Armistice Agreement but inside our territorial waters, we have made every possible effort to settle through negotiations navigation to and from those islands and other issues that may be raised between the two sides. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. forces side, however, has insisted on the \"Northern Limit Line\" it unilaterally fixed without any legal ground. It is clamoring about \"victory\" in the last armed conflicts at the West Sea of Korea  in a bid to mislead public opinion while ceaselessly infiltrating its warships into territorial waters under our military control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such moves cannot be construed otherwise than a premeditated action intended to trigger off another shocking incident at the West Sea of Korea  and bring the situation to the brink of war by instigating the South Korean authorities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We have been ready to settle through negotiations those issues that may be raised while observing the extension of the MDL at the west sea. Now that the U.S. forces side finally refused to discuss them, we cannot wait any longer for its response to our offer for a technical discussion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Therefore, the KPA navy command was authorized to  confirm and declare the following \"order of navigating to and from five islands\" situated in the territorial waters north of the extension of the MDL at the West Sea of Korea : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   1. Of the five islands under the U.S. forces side's control but inside our territorial waters, waters surrounding Paekryong, Taechong and Sochong islands shall be defined as first zone, waters around Yonphyong Island  second zone and waters around U Island third zone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A) The northern line of the first zone shall be 38 degrees N. and the eastern, southern and western lines shall be lines drawn 2 km wide in parallel with the base lines of Paekryong, Taechong and Sochong islands. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   B) The northern line of the second zone shall  be 37 degrees, 41 minutes, 24 seconds N. And the eastern, southern and western lines be lines drawn 2 km wide in parallel with the base line of Yonphyong Island. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   C) The line of the third zone shall be a line drawn 2 km wide in parallel with the base line of U Island. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   D) Military and civilian vessels of the U.S. forces side shall be free to navigate in the first, second and third zones unless it is hostile to our side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   2. All military and civilian vessels of the U.S. forces side should use the first waterway for navigating to and from the first zone and the second waterway for sailing to and from the second zone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A) The first waterway shall be one mile wide on both sides with the line linked by the point 37 degrees, 10 minutes, 3 seconds north latitude and 125 degrees, 13 minutes, 19 seconds east longitude on the extension of the MDL at the west sea and the summit of the highest height on Sochong Island as an axis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   B) The second waterway shall be one mile wide on both sides with the line linked by the point 37 degrees, 31 minutes, 25 seconds north latitude and 125 degrees, 50 minutes, 38 seconds east longitude on the extension of the MDL at the west sea and the summit of the highest height on Taeyonphyong Island as an axis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   C) Planes are not allowed to fly in the sky above the U.S.forces-controlled islands in the territorial waters of our side in principle and all planes are permitted to fly only in the sky above these waterways in an unavoidable case. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   3. Warships and civilian ships of the U.S. Forces side should strictly abide by the recognized international navigation rules in the first, second and third zones and the first and second waterways. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   4. If warships and civilian ships and planes of the U.S. forces side go beyond the designated zones and waterways, it will be an outright intrusion into the territorial waters of our side and waters and airspace under our military control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   5. Neither threat nor hindrance to our side's movements are allowed during the stipulated transit, and these waterways and navigation zones shall not be used in blocking our warships and civilian ships from sailing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   6. The navigation zones and waterways have been designated this time in any aspect in consideration of the fact that the islands under the control of the U.S. forces side are inside the territorial waters of our side, and these zones and waterways shall not be waters of the U.S. forces side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Our proclamation of the \"order of navigating to and from five islands\" is an expression of the strongest magnanimity to prevent conflicts at the west sea and afford convenience in islanders' life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. forces side should respect the MDL at the west sea and strictly observe the instituted order of navigation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   No one can predict where and when anything will happen if the order of navigation is not observed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Our revolutionary armed forces solemnly declare they will retaliate against the U.S. forces side without warnings  if it dares challenge our sincere efforts to prevent conflicts at the west sea and ensure peace and security, dancing to the tune of the South Korean authorities who are vociferating about the so-called \"victory in the Yonphyong naval battle.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                 \r\n                  March 23, Juche 89 (2000)\r\n\r\n"

He regarded the idea of \"Jiwon\" (aim high) as his maxim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It was a secret organization the objective of which was to achieve national independence and build a truly civilized state through the concerted efforts of the Korean nation. It was the biggest anti-Japanese underground revolutionary organization active at home and abroad before and after the March 1st Popular Uprising. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The formation of the KNA was a historic event that marked a significant occasion in the development of the anti-Japanese national liberation movement in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This enabled the Korean people to have a revolutionary organization capable of giving uniform guidance to the national liberation movement throughout the country  and confidently advance the movement through the efforts of the nation itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   After its formation, Kim Hyong Jik put his heart and soul into the activities to expand its organizations across the country and abroad and rally broad masses of people around it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As a result, its affiliated organizations were active in vast areas of Korea and abroad and a well-knit work system was established to unite people from all walks of life around it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A revolutionary monument stands in Hakdanggol situated in the center of Pyongyang to convey the unforgettable story about how Kim Hyong Jik created the KNA more than 80 years ago. \r\n\r\n"

Involved there are prominent figures of Buddhist, Christian, catholic and other religious circles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The committee held a seminar for their repatriation in Seoul on February 23 with the attendance of many officials of religious, human rights, civil, press and academic circles. Such demand for their repatriation reflects public sentiment in South Korea. This is clearly proved by the fact that an opinion poll recently conducted by a public organisation in South Korea showed that more than 78 percent of those polled supported the repatriation of unconverted long-term prisoners. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities must abandon their wrong attitude toward the issue of the unconverted long-term prisoners and send them back to the North Korea as soon as possible where their families and relatives are waiting for them, as demanded all the people at home and abroad. \r\n\r\n"

Counterrevolutionary forces were trying to win middle-of-the-road forces over to their forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Under the situation the President Kim Il Sung put forward an idea of conducting a united front movement in the form of open united front of democratic political parties and public organisations calling for a democratic, sovereign and independent state and gave a wise guidance over the efforts to put the idea into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He led political parties to take the road of democracy, while encouraging them to conduct their independent activities in conformity with their characters. The WPK under his guidance led political parties to join in the efforts for the establishment of a democratic provisional government, agrarian reform, nationalization of major industries and other democratic reforms in the society and, in that process, achieved cooperation and unity. It steered the work for a united front in such a way as to isolate and liquidate reactionary political parties and public organisations that grouped pro-Japanese elements and traitors to the nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Basing itself on this, the WPK inaugurated a standing organisation such as the Democratic National United Front at a meeting of representatives of four political parties and 13 public organisations in July, Juche 35 (1946). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In June 1949 it inaugurated the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland involving all democratic forces in the north and south of Korea and abroad to foil the moves of the U.S. and pro-American authorities to perpetuate the division of the country. The DFRF grouped at least 70 political parties and public organisations in the north, south and abroad except the political parties under the direct control of the then pro-American authorities. The WPK maintained independence in its activities and work for the united front, while playing its leading part and, at the same time, adhered to the principle of concentrating upon a united front of rank and file and achieving, on this basis, a united front of the upper strata. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The successes and experience of the WPK in the work for the united front serve as precious wealth in the struggle of all political parties, public organisations and people from all walks of life in the north and south and abroad to achieve the independent, peaceful reunification of the country in firm unity. \r\n\r\n"
