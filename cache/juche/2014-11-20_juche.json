This clearly proves that the \"resolution\" was a political fraud.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Some countries of the EU and Japan acted servants for adopting the \"resolution,\" disclosing themselves that their much touted \"efforts for human rights\" were not for a genuine improvement of human rights but for the pursuance of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK and sycophancy towards it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This time the DPRK clarified its will to have wide-ranging cooperation in the field of human rights and readiness to actively promote human rights dialogue and exchange. However, the hostile forces finally denied cooperation and chose the way of confrontation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This behavior revealed that the call of the followers of the U.S. for human rights dialogue was hypocritical and closed themselves the door of not only human rights dialogue but other dialogues and exchange and cooperation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. kicked off its \"human rights\" offensive against the DPRK in real earnest in a bid to invent a pretext for armed intervention by terming the DPRK a \"tundra of human rights abuses\" in the international arena. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  History vividly remembers the Yugoslav War unleashed by the U.S. in 1999 under the pretext of \"protecting human rights and a minority\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A dangerous precedent is in the making to politicize and internationalize the human rights issue of an individual country and use it for toppling its social system. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prevailing serious situation in which international law is violated by high-handed practices goes to more clearly prove the DPRK's constant view that human rights precisely mean national sovereignty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK bitterly denounces and categorically rejects the railroading of the recent \"resolution\" manipulated by the U.S. in an attempt to topple the socialist system centered on the popular masses, the system chosen by the Korean people and which they regard as dearer than their own lives, as the most striking manifestation of the hostile policy towards the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK compels the latter not to exercise restraint any longer  in conducting a new nuclear test, its war deterrence will grow stronger unlimitedly to cope with the armed intervention of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The principal architect of the above-said \"resolution\" and its servants will be held wholly responsible for all the consequences to be entailed by its adoption."

This goes to clearly prove that the drill is not the defensive one but an offensive exercise and war maneuver for invading the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All war exercises are being staged in south Korea every year pursuant to the U.S. strategy for stifling the DPRK and dominating Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If a war breaks out on the Korean Peninsula, the biggest hotspot in Asia, it will spill over to a world thermonuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet forces are compelled to get involved in such nuclear war as a shock brigade of the U.S., their master, whether they like it or not, as they are dependent on it in the political, economic and military aspects.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Shortly ago, the south Korean authorities, taken in by crafty gimmicks of the U.S., abandoned their military sovereignty in fact and agreed with the U.S. to purchase cutting-edge war hardware including Global Hawk.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As seen above, it is none other than the U.S. and the puppet forces, its henchmen, who are threatening peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such being the hard fact, the south Korean authorities, the trouble makers, dare trumpet about \"peace and security in Northeast Asia\" and even the \"north's abandonment of nukes\". This is the height of shamelessness.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are working hard to mislead public opinion at any cost to conceal their confrontational nature and, at the same time, ignite a war for aggression against the DPRK by pushing the situation to an extreme pitch together with the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are, indeed, top-class confrontational maniacs and warmongers who deserve curse and denunciation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter what desperate moves they resort to, this will get them nowhere.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They would be well advised to stop daring mock at all Koreans and the world community and halt at once their reckless war moves."
