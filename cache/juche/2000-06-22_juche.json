            "content": "Kochujang \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, June 22 (KCNA) -- \"I crave some Kochujang,\" write Koreans on overseas trip to their families.\r\n   Kochujang, a paste made from red hot pepper, is no less than Kimchi (pickled vegetables), a native typical Korean staple food. With its hot taste and peculiar flavour and smell, the red-coloured kochujang follows Koreans at home or others living abroad.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   When eating fatty dishes, Koreans crave hot and delicious dishes. Kimchi and Kochujang are typically hot and appetizing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kochujang is too hot to be eaten by a spoonful at a time and therefore it is eaten sparingly. \r\n   It is eaten as a seasoning. Its outstanding taste is brought out when it is eaten with sliced raw fish, or lettuce and boiled rice. It also serves as a major component of soup. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Without any other seasoning, Kochujang can be eaten, mixed with boiled hot barley or rice. Kochujang with boiled hot barley can conjure up the Korean pastoral life in the mind of the eaters. this habit of eating Kochujang is enjoyed in the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This is usually done in the season when the barley has just been harvested and the farmers are again busy raising rice. When Kochujang is eaten under a cloudless sky with lettuce and rice, it is especially pleasant to the taste. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   To add its own flavour and to make it last longer without spoiling, Kochujang is boiled with sugar, sesame oil, and sesame seeds. sometimes ground beef can be added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There are re-processed Kochujang, such as sesame Kochujang, meat Kochujang, flavour Kochujang, oil Kochujang and yak-Kochujang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At present, Kochujang is massproduced by food processors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But some Korean housewives prefer to making Kochujang themselves, instead of ready-made one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   According to local areas, each housewife uses a slightly different recipe for making Kochujang, thereby she is able to show off her individual culinary talents.    \r\n\r\n"

Its beautiful feathers are used for ornamentals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   With a world conference on birds slated for 2002, the DPRK natural conservation union is intensifying dissemination of know-how on Korean pheasants and their protection and propagation.    \r\n\r\n"

He highlighted the need to direct big efforts to the production of silk and bring about a new turn in the settlement of the issue of clothing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    He said for remarkable increase in the production of silk it is necessary to realise comprehensive mechanisation and automation of production processes and for the producers to have high technique and skill to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  In order to supply silk with beautiful and attractive patterns to the people it is necessary to significantly improve the quality of silk, the speciality of Korea, he stressed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Underscoring the importance of supplying a sufficient quantity of silk yarn and other raw materials in time, he called on all the provinces, cities and counties to extensively raise silkworms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He earnestly appealed to the officials, workers and technicians in the field of light industry to boost the production of silk of better quality by displaying creative ingenuity and patriotic devotion and thus enable the best korean people to live as happily as others.    \r\n\r\n"
