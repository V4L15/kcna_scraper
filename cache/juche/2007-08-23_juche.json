This is a jargon that can be uttered only by those seized with mental disorder who are bereft of reason, to say nothing of morality and human conscience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter how much water may flow under the bridge and whatever sophism may be uttered by the Japanese reactionaries, the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists against Korea and its nation can never be covered up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Minju Joson also carries a signed article urging Japan to make an apology and full compensation for having imposed unspeakable misfortunes and pain upon the Korean people in the past.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This marked a historic event of epochal significance in developing the revolutionary armed forces and carrying out the Juche revolutionary cause in the DPRK. This ushered in an era of successfully carrying forward the Songun revolutionary cause that started in Mt. Paektu under the banner of the Juche idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is under the dynamic Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il that the DPRK is demonstrating its might as a political and ideological power and an invincible military power which no one dares to provoke or attack and Kim Il Sung's nation enjoys the highest dignity and position. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il has given steady continuity to the tradition of the Korean revolution which has advanced with arms and followed the Songun political mode, an effective socialist political mode in our times, and brought about a great surge in building a rich and powerful country by dint of Songun. This is the greatest feats performed by him in his Songun leadership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His Songun leadership exploits serve as an encyclopedic treasure of revolution as they help perfectly solve all the problems arising in carrying out the socialist cause and achieving the prosperity of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This fully represents the great Juche idea and Songun idea, comprehensively deals with the line, strategy and tactics and an example of the times to be held fast to in the anti-imperialist confrontation and the building of a rich and powerful country and includes the firm revolutionary spirit and noble experience of struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He has performed these leadership feats by achieving the most brilliant victory in the hardest struggle. Herein lies the tremendous vitality of the above-said exploits. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun leadership exploits of the Party serve as a life line making it possible to always advance the Korean revolution along the road of independence without an inch of deflection, a cornerstone whereby to consolidate the single-minded unity of the Korean revolutionary ranks in every way and a weapon for creation and change as it ushered in an era of eternal prosperity of Kim Il Sung's Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In hearty response to the order, more than 1,500,000 young people volunteered to return to or join the army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In 1994, too, when the U.S. imperialists worked out \"OPLAN 5027\", the second Korean war scenario and were going to ignite the fuse of war, millions of youths demonstrated their firm will to take arms and make a total showdown with the aggressors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The parents regarded it as the greatest pleasure and family tradition to send their children to the army even during the difficult \"Arduous March\" and forced march. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Women bring up orphans to guard the posts of national defense and girls in towns get married to officers of frontline army units. Such beautiful stories are heard in different parts of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ranks of servicepersons' families are growing in number. Among them are Om Pok Sun's family and Pak Yong Chol's family. Om has let her daughters stand on the post where she had guarded and all her family members put on the military uniform. Pak and his seven brothers stoutly take rifles in their hands. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea of attaching importance to arms is manifested in heroic deeds. Hero Kil Yong Jo defended the revolutionary headquarters at the cost of his life. The heroes of Mujae Peak saved the revolutionary slogan-bearing trees, the eternal treasure of the Korean revolution with their lives. The fishermen of angle fishing net boat 1286 of the Onchon Fishing Company kept the portraits of the great men of Mt. Paektu to the last moment of their lives in the rough storm and tribulations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Let us defend the revolutionary headquarters headed by the great Comrade Kim Jong Il at the cost of our lives!\" This slogan represents the firm oath of the Korean people to take the idea of attaching importance to arms as the faith.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
