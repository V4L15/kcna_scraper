He was addressing the meeting of the Third Committee of the 58th UN General Assembly on Oct. 16 when it was discussing the agenda items 110 \"Progress for Women\" and 111 \"On the Implementation of the Results of the 4th World Women's Conference and of the 23rd U.N. Special Meeting on the Women's Issue\".\r\n For the solution of the women's problem, above all, the rights of women should be regulated by law and all conditions and circumstances should be provided so that they could hold their legitimate place in the activities of all fields including politics and economy, irrespective of differences in nationality, race, language and religion, he said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Next, all the U.N. member states should increase joint efforts for the equality of women and nondiscrimination against them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Discriminations against women rife in the world, in many cases, are attributable to the lack of actions to thoroughly redeem the past crimes. It would conform to the state interests of Japan itself to sincerely repent of and thoroughly redress past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that the DPRK government has consistently maintained the stand of attaching importance to international cooperation in solving the women's problem, he expressed thanks to international organizations for their sincere material and technical aids in the work for women's health and their welfare in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will in the future, too, positively contribute to the efforts of the international community to completely solve the women's problem, he concluded.    \r\n.    \r\n\r\n"

This is, in essence, little short of forcing the DPRK to completely disarm itself and remain bare-handed and yield to the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Concession\" on their lips is no more than their intention to make public a statement in which some countries would declare that they have no intention to attack and invade north Korea and they respect its borderline. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is building up public opinion to create such impression that the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. is an issue to be dealt between the DPRK and the countries around it. This is a very impudent artifice to sidestep the issue and evade its responsibility for its settlement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has such a bad precedent whereby it adopted a joint statement and an agreed framework with the DPRK and sent its president's letter of assurances to the DPRK but threw away them like a pair of old shoes after a new president took office. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. demand that the DPRK scrap its nuclear program irreversibly and verifiably is aimed to force the DPRK to disarm itself and remain bare-fisted and then achieve its ambition for aggression with ease. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This can not but be an unreasonable way of thinking unacceptable to anyone for a belligerent party to force the other party to come out first with its hands up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No peaceful solution to the nuclear issue is thinkable apart from the U.S. switchover in its hostile policy toward the DPRK and the adoption of a non-aggression treaty between the two countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is employing delaying tactics, making a mockery of the international community with lip-service to the peaceful solution to the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a great mistake for the U.S. to expect the DPRK to disarm itself, while delaying the settlement of the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK once again states explicitly that it is not interested in any talks where the U.S. refuses to make a switchover in its hostile policy toward the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"

The additional troop dispatch to Iraq will bring no other results than making south Korean army shed blood and lose lives for the U.S. forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To talk about \"economic benefits\" when no one has promised economic interests with regard to additional dispatch of south Korean troops is an act of putting the cart before the horse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No less absurd is the noisy propaganda that the additional troop dispatch to Iraq is to strengthen \"alliance\" with the U.S. and add to \"security.\" South Korea is forced into dependence and submission and the people are exposed to disasters, not \"security\", by \"alliance\" with the U.S.    \r\n\r\n"

At least 350 civic and public organizations staged demonstrations in various parts of Seoul on Oct. 21 in protest against the troop dispatch against the backdrop of mounting protests against the troop dispatch. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Despite the situation at home and abroad the pro-U.S. treacherous forces are working hard to meet the U.S. brigandish demand for troop dispatch, asserting that the troop dispatch is in the \"interests of the state\", a mockery of the fellow countrymen. How can the nation tolerate this? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Given the fact that Choe Pyong Ryol and other ultra right conservative forces of the Grand National Party have been clamorous for the additional troop dispatch to Iraq, it would be just a simple procedure to pass the motion through the \"National Assembly\" dominated by the GNP. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ultra right conservative forces of the GNP can never shirk their blame for having taken the lead in wresting the decision to additionally dispatch troops to Iraq under the pretexts of \"division of public opinion\" and the \"interests of the state.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should immediately withdraw the perfidious decision and apologize to the nation for it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
