They are nothing but a history of murder and other crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This party committed such thrice-cursed acts of sycophancy and treachery as turning south Korea into a colony of the U.S. imperialists, rubbing salt into the wounds of the Koreans suffering from the territorial division by building the cursed concrete wall, a challenge to their desire for reunification, and letting the U.S. convert south Korea into the biggest nuclear arsenal in the Far East and an advance base for aggression against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This party of traitors should have been eliminated from the arena of history as it is forsaken by the people for having perpetrated such hideous crimes. Nevertheless, these pro-U.S. traitors tried hard to calm down the anger of the south Korean people by changing the name of their party into the \"New Korea Party.\" But it ceased to exist before being two years old as it failed to discard its inveterate sycophantic, fascist and anti-reunification nature. There grew from its roots a new poisonous plant called the GNP whose mission was to pursue acts of treachery with bloodshot eyes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP, a group of imbeciles who lack political sense and ignorant of the law governing the development of history, is making desperate efforts to revive the past dark era going against the desire of the nation and the times. This party is now getting so impudent as to become evermore undisguised in sycophancy towards the U.S., fascist suppression and moves against reunification in a bid to come to power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The memorandum helps the Korean nation draw one more lesson. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A mad dog should be knocked down with a stick and the root cause of disaster completely removed, the commentary concludes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It has neither justification to demand other countries to scrap their nuclear programs nor the qualification to \"judge\" others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan, with the patronage and connivance of the U.S., has stockpiled plutonium enough to manufacture thousands of nuclear weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Israel has also produced and stockpiled many nuclear weapons by stepping up its nuclear armament in secrecy with the patronage, connivance and cooperation of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should have taken issue with Israel's access to nukes. However, it has not put any pressure on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. undisguised application of the double standards is evidenced by the fact that it has promised cooperation in nuclear technology to countries remaining outside the NPT and is revealing its intention to conditionally allow peaceful nuclear activities of some countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While shutting eyes to and supporting the development and possession of nuclear weapons by pro-U.S. forces and its allies from the stand of unilateralism and prejudice, it styles itself a \"nuclear judge\", kicking up a row of pressure on those countries incurring its displeasure by pulling them up over their \"nuclear issues\". This is really the height of sarcasm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. attitude over the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula clearly shows how far the U.S. has gone in its application of the double standards.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The next leg of his guidance was the Jangyonho Fish Farm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He learned in detail how fishes are bred on the farm, going round fish ponds, spawning rooms and various other places of the farm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He set forth highly important tasks which would serve as guidelines for conducting fish breeding as a widespread mass movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While providing field guidance to North Hamgyong Province, he advanced tasks to be undertaken by the province to put its economic work on a new higher stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n North Hamgyong Province occupies an important position in ensuring the nation's economic development as it has lots of enterprises in the fields of metal industry and extractive industry and other pilot domains of the national economy, he said, calling on it to play a pioneer's role in the building of an economic power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by Hong Sok Hyong, chief secretary of the North Hamgyong Provincial Committee of the WPK, Kim Ki Nam, secretary of the C.C., WPK, and Pak Nam Gi, department director of the same.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
