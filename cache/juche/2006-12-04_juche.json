He was pleased to learn that the commanding officers of the unit have been trained as able officers who have acquired high operation commanding capability to successfully carry out the WPK's Juche-oriented military strategy by putting the training on a scientific and regular basis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He mounted an observation platform to watch soldiers' training.\r\n He expressed great satisfaction over the fact that all the commanding officers and soldiers have been fully prepared as a-match-for-a hundred fighters.

Rodong Sinmun Sunday says this in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n People should never be deceived by the imperialists' offensive for \"peace\" and \"human rights\" but maintain a high degree of vigilance against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists' loud-mouthed \"peace\" and \"human rights\" are bound to be accompanied by military intervention and war. This is a serious lesson taught by history. \r\n The global peace and genuine human rights can be guaranteed only when a firm anti-imperialist independent stand is held fast to. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is important to see through the reactionary nature and danger of the imperialists' moves for \"globalization\". Their loudmouthed \"globalization\" is nothing but a figleaf for covering up their strategy for dominating a unipolar world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to settle problems by preserving the Juche character and the national character in the revolution and construction and building up one's own strength and strengthening the unity and cooperation among the progressive countries.\r\n No country should yield to the high-handed practices and military pressure of the imperialists. Imperialism is by no means strong. It is dregs of history as it is fated to go to ruin. All countries should have staunch anti-imperialist spirit and build military muscle if they are to emerge victorious in the stand-off with the imperialists.\r\n It is an important requirement for winning victory in the anti-imperialist struggle and pushing forward the human cause of independence to achieve the unity of the anti-imperialist independent forces. It is necessary to counter the imperialists' tactics of destroying these forces one by one with the strategy of unity. The imperialists are most afraid of the unity of the anti-imperialist independent forces. They should jointly deal blows at the imperialists in the international arena.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun Sunday says this in a signed article.\r\n The article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Single-minded unity serves as a treasured sword which helps consolidate the political and ideological position of the DPRK as firm as a rock in any challenges of the imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists and hostile forces are becoming all the more vicious in their ideological and cultural poisoning and psychological warfare in a bid to undermine Korean-style socialism. But no force on earth can break the single-minded unity of the whole army and all the people of the DPRK around the headquarters of the revolution.\r\n The might of the single-minded unity has been tremendously strengthened thanks to the Songun policy of leader Kim Jong Il. The transparent outlook on life that one lives for the leader even a moment and that one devotes one's youth and life to upholding the leader all one's life, the transparent revolutionary spirit that one deems death as glory in putting into practice the idea and intention of the leader and fulfilling obligation as soldier, this is the noble ideological and mental world of the Korean army and people on the basis of which they are single-mindedly united. Herein lies the true feature of our society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The single-minded unity serves as a motive force which helps the army and the people create centuries-old feats and miracles in building a great prosperous powerful socialist nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The great spirit that the leader believes in the people and the people absolutely trust and follow the leader is the fundamental source of ceaseless miracles and feats in the building of a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The line of economic construction in the era of Songun, the policy on reconstructing and modernizing the national economy, the policy on keeping a great surge in agriculture and other lines and policies of the Workers' Party of Korea have been successfully implemented, so that the national power of the country has been strengthened in every way and the economy put on the track of invigoration and the foundation for fresh leaping progress laid. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The single-minded unity of the whole army and all the people around the leader is, indeed, the most precious wealth of the Korean revolution and a treasured sword of invincible victory more powerful than nuclear weapons.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
