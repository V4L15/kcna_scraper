He, referring to the visit to the Yasukuni Shrine, said that he regards it as very regretful that he failed to pay visit to the shrine during the first Abe cabinet period.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAbe made the election commitments to rename the Japan \"Self-Defence Forces\" the \"national defence forces\" and reorganize them and revise the pacifist constitution to secure the exercise of the right to collective self-defense. He is spurring the preparations for putting them into force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMeanwhile, the ultra-right forces of Japan have been keen on making the visit to the shrine an official and regular event by building up the public opinion for the visit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis made Japan to lurch more to the right and militaristic.

This proves the political and moral vulgarity of Japan that has reached the height.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe childish country, Japan is increasingly turning to the right, unhindered, while desperately denying its past history of crimes. Japan's militarist foreign policy will naturally spark off bigger censure and political isolation from the international community including Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGloomier is the prospect of the island country, Japan, which is isolated even politically as well as geographically."

Al frente de esta campana esta el premier Abe. \n\t\t\t\t\tEl pasado dia 2, Abe insinuo abiertamente la posibilidad de revisar la declaracion de Murayama de 1995 en que expreso la disculpa y la reflexion sobre la dominacion colonial del tiempo pasado por el imperialismo japones. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY el dia 7, mostro la voluntad de reexaminar la declaracion de Kono de 1993 en que reconocio el caracter forzoso del caso de esclavas sexuales para el viejo ejercito japones. Y en cuanto a la visita al santuario Yasukuni, dijo que \"considero muy lamentable el que no lo visite en el primer periodo del gabinete de Abe\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAbe presento como su promesa electoral la reorganizacion de las \"Fuerzas de Autodefensa\" como \"ejercito de defensa nacional\" y la modificacion de la constitucion pacifista a favor del ejercicio del derecho de autodefensa colectiva y da acicate a los preparativos para llevarla a cabo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl mismo tiempo, las fuerzas ultraderechistas de Japon se desesperan por formalizar y regularizar la visita al santuario Yasukuni.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe esta manera, la derechizacion y la militarizacion de la sociedad japonesa han llegado a la etapa muy aventurera y se ha hecho realidad la nueva agresion del pais isleno a Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 7 de enero pasado por la manana, comenzo su trabajo del nuevo gobierno para el Ano Nuevo cantando \"Kimigayo\" y declaro oficialmente que \"esto es el primer paso para 'rescatar a Japon'\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEntonces, ?cual es Japon que Abe quiere rescatar? \"Kimigayo\" insinua que Abe quiere no un Estado normal en la sociedad internacional, sino un Estado agresor derechizado y militarizado y el renacimiento de Japon imperialista y militarista del siglo  pasado en que agredia a Corea y otros paises asiaticos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante varios decenios despues de la segunda guerra mundial Japon ha venido promoviendo sistematica y globalmente el rearmamento  politico y militar. Y con la toma del poder por Abe, representante de las fuerzas ultraderechistas, se ha evidenciado la ruta de Japon enloquecido en fiebre militarista. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa realidad demuestra que la politica exterior del actual gobierno japones no sirve para asegurar las relaciones de amistad y de buena vecindad con los paises vecinos, sino para resucitar el sistema de dominacion colonial de la epoca antes de su derrota y agredir otra vez a Corea y otros paises asiaticos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, Japon esta equivocado. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo que Japon obtuvo en la guerra de agresion a Corea y otros paises asiaticos Japon sonando con el \"dueno de Asia oriental\" fue la derrota  vergonzosa y la mala fama de un pais enemigo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl pais isleno no se libera del aislamiento y rechazo de la sociedad internacional incluso los paises asiaticos por negar y eludir la reflexion, la disculpa y la indemnizacion por sus crimenes del pasado. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa bajeza politica y moral de Japon es tan pesima  que  hasta el circulo politico de su amo EE.UU. critica los crimenes del pasado de este pais isleno insistiendo en darle el castigo mas severo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa politica exterior militarista de Japon, pais pueril que niega obstinadamente su historia criminal y se dirige a la derechizacion, provocara mas el gran repudio y aislamiento politico de la sociedad internacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSera mas oscura la perspectiva de Japon, \"pais isleno\" aislado tanto en lo geografico como en lo politico."
