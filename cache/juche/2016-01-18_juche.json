These facts showed the vitality of the three charters common to the nation, both in name and in reality. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should respect the three charters for national reunification, which were confirmed to be a programme common to the nation at north-south agreements, and respond to the nationwide discussion of the way of realizing them."
