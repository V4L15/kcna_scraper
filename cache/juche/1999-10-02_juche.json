It is illogical for one side to call for \"dialogue\" and \"cooperation\" with the other side, its partner,  while denying its existence itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The past history of the north-south dialogue gives a serious lesson that  with the \"security law \"  left alone, it is impossible to have reunification-oriented and fruitful dialogue and contact and promote national reconciliation and unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities are now talking about the \"revision\" of this evil law. That means rewriting its some provisions. It is a mockery and challenge to public opinion at home and abroad  calling for complete abrogation of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The anti-reunification and anti-national \"security law\" should be completely and totally abolished, as demanded by the times and the nation. It is meaningless to rewrite a few provisions or terminology's of the \"law,\"  which incriminates the people's movement for independence, democracy and reunification, leaving its main framework untouched.  Poisonous herb should be rooted out. \r\n\r\n"
