But it has not yet been realized because the South Korean authorities have pursued an anti-north confrontation policy depending on outsiders.\r\n   We believe that the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea will surely be realized according to the proposal for reunification by means of confederacy put forward by the President Kim Il Sung and the five-point policy of great national unity set forth by Kim Jong Il, the statement said.\r\n   It extended full support and solidarity to the struggle of the Korean people to achieve the reunification of the country by confederacy and called upon the progressive political parties and people of the world to express solidarity more loudly with them.    \r\n \r\n"

It is now negotiating with the DPRK.\r\n   All this, however, is a trick to camouflage its war policy and lead us to relax our vigilance against the U.S.\r\n   The U.S. bellicose elements are staging U.S.-South Korea, U.S.-Japan joint military manoeuvres one after another in and around South Korea, claiming that the \"most unstable area of Asia is North Korea\" and that the U.S. should \"make full military preparations.\" This is a revelation of their attempt to make a preemptive attack on us.\r\n   They are slandering the DPRK, describing its launch of artificial satellite as \"ballistic missile launching test.\" \r\n   The slander is designed to provide a justification for their reckless war game and find a pretext for the provocation of war. The recent maneuvers in the waters around the Korean peninsula attest that the U.S. is carrying its Korean war scenario into practice.\r\n   Now that the U.S. war mongers want to break the DPRK-U.S. framework agreement and unleash a war against us, we cannot but take a tough countermeasure, warns the commentary.    \r\n\r\n"

They are employing every conceivable technique to attain their sinister intention.\r\n   It must not go unnoticed that they in the grip of the worst economic crisis are squandering more money on arms buildup.\r\n   A dangerous situation in which a war may break out any time is prevailing in the country due to their frantic arms buildup and new war provocation moves.\r\n   Their war mongers of the self-styled \"government for the people\" are zealously joining in the anti-DPRK war preparations of their imperialist master, gathering the dark clouds of war. We cannot remain a passive onlooker to their reckless moves.\r\n   Authorities of South Korea should stop acting rashly.

Korea is source of all misfortunes, pains and disasters\r\n   Pyongyang, November 22 (KCNA) -- The Korean nation has undergone immeasurable mistortunes, pains and disasters and a great deal of sufferings from the U.S.  aggressors' occupation of South Korea for more than half a century. Rodong Sinmun stresses this in an article today.\r\n   It goes on:\r\n   As a result of the U.S. military occupation of South Korea remained a colony and the Korean nation which has boasted of 5000-year-long history has been forced to suffer from the tragedy of division.\r\n   The history of the U.S. occapation of South Korea is a history of the most ferocious and shameless aggression and conquest.\r\n   The U.S. army who landed in South Korea was occupation and  aggression forces in the guise of \"liberators and protectors.\" It was an army for the maintenance of colonial rule.\r\n   The U.S. turned South Korea into a colonial military base and accelerated war preparations against North Korea from the first days of their occupation of South Korea for the purpose of conquering the whole of Korea and dominating Asia and the rest of the world with South Korea as the springboard. They unleashed a war of aggression against the Korean people on June 25, 1950.\r\n   The United States should have drawned a serious lesson from the defeat in the Korean war and withdrawn from South Korea.\r\n   After the war, while keeping their forces in South Korea, the U.S. have not abandoned their design of aggression on North Korea, but engaged themselves in new war provocation moves, wantonly violating and destroying the armistice agreement.\r\n   The Korean peninsula has become a most tense and sensitive hotspot in the world as a result of the U.S. reckless war provocation moves. The Korean people, therefore, always live exposed to the danger of a nuclear war.\r\n   It is the basic strategy of the U.S. Korea policy to impede  the reunification of Korea for conversion of South Korea into its permanent colonial military base.\r\n   As long as the U.S. continue  occupying South Korea,  the Korean nation can not get rid of the misfortunes, pains  and disasters caused by the division. \r\n   Nor can the South Korean people's desire for independence, democracy and reunification be realized.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"
