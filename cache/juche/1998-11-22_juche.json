But it has not yet been realized because the South Korean authorities have pursued an anti-north confrontation policy depending on outsiders.\r\n   We believe that the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea will surely be realized according to the proposal for reunification by means of confederacy put forward by the President Kim Il Sung and the five-point policy of great national unity set forth by Kim Jong Il, the statement said.\r\n   It extended full support and solidarity to the struggle of the Korean people to achieve the reunification of the country by confederacy and called upon the progressive political parties and people of the world to express solidarity more loudly with them.    \r\n \r\n"

It is now negotiating with the DPRK.\r\n   All this, however, is a trick to camouflage its war policy and lead us to relax our vigilance against the U.S.\r\n   The U.S. bellicose elements are staging U.S.-South Korea, U.S.-Japan joint military manoeuvres one after another in and around South Korea, claiming that the \"most unstable area of Asia is North Korea\" and that the U.S. should \"make full military preparations.\" This is a revelation of their attempt to make a preemptive attack on us.\r\n   They are slandering the DPRK, describing its launch of artificial satellite as \"ballistic missile launching test.\" \r\n   The slander is designed to provide a justification for their reckless war game and find a pretext for the provocation of war. The recent maneuvers in the waters around the Korean peninsula attest that the U.S. is carrying its Korean war scenario into practice.\r\n   Now that the U.S. war mongers want to break the DPRK-U.S. framework agreement and unleash a war against us, we cannot but take a tough countermeasure, warns the commentary.    \r\n\r\n"

The \"expenditure for improved defence capacity\" to be squandered on arms buildup rose by 60,100 million won as compared with this year.\r\n   Rodong Sinmun today charges that the \"bill of defence budget\" fully betrays the authorities criminal intention to provoke a war against the north, in conspiracy with outsiders.\r\n   The news analyst says:\r\n   The authorities seek only confrontation with the north and a fratricidal war. They are employing every conceivable technique to attain their sinister intention.\r\n   It must not go unnoticed that they in the grip of the worst economic crisis are squandering more money on arms buildup.\r\n   A dangerous situation in which a war may break out any time is prevailing in the country due to their frantic arms buildup and new war provocation moves.\r\n   Their war mongers of the self-styled \"government for the people\" are zealously joining in the anti-DPRK war preparations of their imperialist master, gathering the dark clouds of war. We cannot remain a passive onlooker to their reckless moves.\r\n   Authorities of South Korea should stop acting rashly. Time will show what a miserable doom of the provokers is like.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n"
