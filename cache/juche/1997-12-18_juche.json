            "content": "Concrete wall, symbol of division and confrontation\r\n  Pyongyang, December 18 (KCNA) -- World publics are crying out for the demolition of the concrete wall which divides Korea into the north and south.\r\n   The peaceloving people of the world express deep concern over the fact that the U.S. and the South Korean authorities are bringing the situation on the Korean Peninsula to the extreme pitch of strain by engaging themselves in aggressive military manoeuvres at a time when the Cold War has come to an end and peace and disarmament are the trend of the time. They are calling for an early pulldown of the concrete wall which is symbolic of confrontation.\r\n   The wall stands in the area south of the Military Demarcation Line, stretching more than 240 kilometres across mountains, fields and rivers. The South Korean authorities built it for years with connivance of the U.S. The wall whose construction began in 1977 is the largest one in the world.  It which was built with some 800,000 tons of cement, about 200,000 tons of steel and more than 3,500,000 cubic metres of gravel and sand is  5 to 8 metres in height, 10 to 19 metres wide in the lower part and 3 to 7 metres in the upper part.\r\n   The wall stretches across 122 villages, 8 counties, 3 railways, 4 big rivers, some 220 roads, big and small.\r\n   With a view to keeping one country, one land and one nation divided into two parts, the South Korean regime built the wall, added to the MDL. Their thrice-cursed treachery is irrevocable.\r\n   The MDL and wall  divided into two the people of the same blood which had lived in harmony on the same land for thousands of years. The separated people are suffering from it, not knowing each other's living and death.\r\n   With the 21st century drawing nearer, all the Koreans in the north, south and abroad work hard for the reunification of the divided country with a single heart to pull down the crime-woven wall, a source of territorial and national division, at an early date and realise the cherished desire of the nation.    \r\n \r\n"

This is the will of the Korean people ideologically prepared to cope with the ideological and cultural poisoning.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
