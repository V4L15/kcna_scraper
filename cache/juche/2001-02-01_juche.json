It is, therefore, necessary to put up an uncompromising struggle against them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One should wage a life-and-death fight against them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the imperialists who become coward before the strong and more ferocious before the weak. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They fear most those who are ready to die. Therefore, one should not show any slightest weakness nor take even a step for concession to imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when the people wage a life-and-death struggle against imperialists can they protect the sovereignty and dignity of the nation. This is a bitter lesson taught by the Persian Gulf War and the developments over the last decade since it. \r\n\r\n"

In the new century the armies of the two sides should provide a sure military guarantee for the implementation of the joint declaration, he stressed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He recalled that all the people in the north and the south are firmly determined to pool their energies and wisdom so as to terminate the nation's distress-torn history of national ruin, division, confrontation and war imposed upon it in the 20th century and make the first year of the new century as a significant year of opening up a radical phase of the nation's independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the fellow countrymen are showing great interest in the current talks because they are the first talks between the armies of the north and the south in the 21st century, intended to realize the historic cause of rejoining the blood ties of the nation that have remained severed for over half a century, he said, adding: In this sense we have heavy responsibility for the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then, he clarified the north side's view and stand toward the issues of designating areas to be placed under the control of the north and the south  and militarily ensuring the project of relinking railways and road between the two sides. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He further said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is most important for the successful talks is to have a correct viewpoint and attitude toward dialogue partner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From this point of view, it is essential for the south side to renounce the old conception and psychology of confrontation in the 20th century which regards the north as \"principal enemy\" and have genuine compatriotism which regards the people in the north as fellow countrymen who join hands for reunification and prosperity. on the basis of this conception, it should strive to make the first talks in the 21st century produce good results and thus meet the desire and expectation of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was agreed to have the next talks at the Thongil House in the north side's portion of Panmunjom and the north side promised to inform the south side of the date of the talks in the near future.    \r\n\r\n"
