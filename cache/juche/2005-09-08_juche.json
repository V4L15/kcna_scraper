            "content": "Appeal to All Koreans and World Peace-loving People \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 7 (KCNA) -- The north, south and overseas headquarters of the Nationwide Special Committee for Probing the Truth behind the GIs' Massacres Wednesday released a joint appeal to the 70 million Koreans and the peace-loving people of the world, 60 years since the U.S. military occupation of south Korea.\r\n The appeal says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On Sept. 8, 60 years ago the disgraceful history of the occupation of a half of Korea by the U.S. forces began and it brought the tragedy of territorial division and national split to the Koreans. The past six decades of the U.S. forces' occupation of south Korea were a bitter history woven with the forces' crimes against humanity and killings of Koreans as they imposed the whole gamut of misfortune and pain upon them.\r\n The U.S. forces are still lording it over south Korea, hell-bent on aggression, interference and division. We can never overlook the abnormal situation in south Korea where the U.S. forces are perpetrating high-handed and arbitrary practices while enjoying privilege as an empire for more than half a century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The appeal called on the Koreans not to allow the U.S. forces' cursed presence in south Korea to go beyond 60 years but put an end to the foreign domination of south Korea that has lasted for a century and achieve national sovereignty.\r\n The history and the present reality urge all the Koreans to resolutely put an end to the U.S. occupation, high-handed practices, domination and interference and turn out in anti-U.S. resistance to uproot the root cause of all sorts of misfortune, sufferings, aggression and war, it says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ours is the era in which the Koreans work together in the spirit of \"By our nation itself\", the era after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration.\r\n Let us put an end to south Korea-U.S. alliance and defend peace on this land through national cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Korea-U.S. cooperation will lead to war while national cooperation will lead to peace and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now is the time for all the Koreans to turn out to preserve the time-honored history of the nation and carry forward the proud patriotic spirit so as to protect the sovereignty and the dignity of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Let all Koreans turn out in resistance for independence against the U.S. to terminate its military presence in south Korea and bring the second August 15 to this land, united closer in one mind in the idea of \"By our nation itself\", just as our predecessors waged a bloody struggle under the uplifted banner of the national liberation, putting an end to the brigandish Japanese imperialists' colonial rule! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is impossible to preserve peace not only in the Korean Peninsula but in the rest of Asia and the world as long as there remain in south Korea the U.S. troops, the root cause of evil and the disturber of justice and peace, the appeal notes, and goes on:\r\n The U.S. troops' continued presence in south Korea is the leftover of the Cold War era the eradication of which brooks no moment's delay. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year marks the 30th anniversary of the adoption of the resolution demanding the withdrawal of the U.S. troops from south Korea at the 30th UN General Assembly, a document reflecting the desire and aspiration of the world peace-loving people.\r\n The U.S. forces should stop the move for \"their relocation\" aimed at perpetuating their presence in south Korea and their strategy to dominate Asia and the rest of the world and go back to their den without delay, taking all lethal equipment with them as demanded by the UN resolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whoever truly loves justice and peace should bitterly condemn the U.S. forces' presence in south Korea and their crimes and more strongly demand their withdrawal from there in order to relieve the Koreans of all disasters and misfortune and ensure peace and security on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No statute of limitations is applicable to the crimes committed by GIs in Korea as they are crimes against humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Let us launch a campaign to bring to justice all the crimes perpetrated by the U.S. on the peninsula and an international mass movement for the withdrawal of the U.S. forces from south Korea! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We earnestly call upon the world progressive organizations and peace-loving people who value justice, truth, peace and security to strongly denounce all the crimes perpetrated by the U.S. against the Korean nation for more than half a century and voice full support and firm solidarity with the Korean people in their just struggle to put an end to the U.S. military presence in south Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It was none other than the U.S. imperialist aggression troops that have blocked the south Korean people's anti-U.S. struggle for independence and arrested their actions for national reunification at the point of bayonet. Whenever an atmosphere of reconciliation and unity between the north and the south grew strong, they staged various forms of war exercises, rendering the situation extremely tense and chilling it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The struggle for the withdrawal of the U.S. imperialist aggression troops from south Korea is presenting itself as a more urgent task in the light of the present trend of the history of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nation-wide struggle involving all Koreans in the north and the south and overseas alone can put an end to the U.S. imperialists' criminal policy of occupation of south Korea and defend the dignity and sovereignty of the nation and achieve the historic cause of national reunification. This is the firm will of all the Koreans to intensify their anti-U.S. struggle to put an end to the 60 year-long disgraceful and tragic history of the U.S. imperialist aggression troops' presence in south Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Synchronizing with this, the Ehime Prefectural Education Committee of Japan decided to introduce the new history textbook distorting and beautifying Japan's history of aggression into schools including the prefectural middle schools.\r\n Earlier, the Japanese Foreign Ministry announced that the distorted history textbook for middle schools would be translated into Chinese and Korean and made public in homepage from August 24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A Rodong Sinmun analyst Wednesday lambastes such act as an intolerable insult and challenge to the Korean people and other Asian peoples who suffered unspeakable pains, misfortunes and disasters at the hand of the Japanese imperialist aggressors and a manifestation of the shamelessness peculiar to Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The analyst continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists' crimes related to sex slavery were explicitly state and international crimes committed by them in an organized way by setting in motion government and military power. Accordingly, the Japanese government must bear responsibility for them both in name and reality in view of international law and human morality and fulfill it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Abusing the noble educational work, the Japanese reactionaries are working to arm the rising generations with the militarist idea through distorted history education and thus drive them to overseas aggression. This is a very dangerous move.\r\n If one committed a crime, he should tell the truth and honestly assume the responsibility for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The mode of thinking of the people and their act are changing in conformity with the requirements of the new century oriented to concord, peace and progress.\r\n Japan would be well advised to clearly see the trend of the people's mindset and stop the acts of insulting and mocking the world's conscience and distorting the history of aggression to repeat it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Ever since the very day of their landing, they have enforced an unprecedentedly harsh colonial fascist rule, savagely trampling down upon the elementary freedom and democracy of the south Korean people and desperately pursuing the policy of colonial subjugation and the moves to perpetuate the division of the Korean nation, he noted, adding: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists have persistently blocked Korea's reunification despite the Koreans' desire for reunification. They have obstructed the struggle of the Korean people for the country's reunification in every way while staying in south Korea. They are now hell-bent on the anachronistic hostile moves against the DPRK, disturbing every form of inter-Korean cooperation now under way under the banner of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter on behalf of all Pyongyangites and all other Koreans bitterly condemned the U.S. imperialist aggressors, the sworn enemy, for having imposed colonial slavery upon the south Korean people and desperately disturbing the cause of independent reunification of the Korean nation with ceaseless moves for aggression and war, keeping south Korea under their occupation for 60 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went on: All the Korean people will put an early end to the 60-year-long presence of the U.S. imperialists in south Korea and surely achieve the cause of national reunification by the concerted efforts of the Koreans under the banner of the June 15 joint declaration without fail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists should face up to the trend of the times and drop their policy of domination over south Korea and national division and the moves for a war. They should quit south Korea without delay, taking with them their aggression troops and all the lethal weapons including nukes as unanimously demanded by all the Korean people and the resolution of the U.N. General Assembly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Speakers from all walks of life at the rally called upon all the people of the country to wage a more dynamic patriotic struggle against the U.S., single-mindedly upholding the Songun politics of the Party, a treasured sword for defending the country and a banner for winning certain victory, in order to put an end to the 60-year-long history of the cursed U.S. imperialists' presence in south Korea and usher in a new era of national prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present at the rally were Secretary Kim Jung Rin of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, Chairman Kim Yong Dae of the C.
