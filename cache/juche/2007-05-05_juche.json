For this very purpose, they are scheming to bring ultra-modern missiles and fighter planes into south Korea and Japan after deciding to massively deploy more than half of their nuclear-powered carriers and 16 Aegis destroyers loaded with interceptor missiles in the Asia-Pacific region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the U.S. imperialists' strategic design to secure the upperhand in strength in the Asia-Pacific region with south Korea and Japan as the military stronghold, put military pressure upon the DPRK and its neighboring countries and provoke a new war on the Korean Peninsula at any cost. The U.S. bellicose forces are trying to justify their criminal intention, raising terrific outcries over the \"military threat\" from the DPRK and China. But this can never work on anybody. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to abandon its scheme to provoke another war, looking straight into the grave and dangerous nature of the present situation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is the precious truth proven in the protracted revolutionary struggle that the army and people can display inexhaustible strength only when they are united. Their unity provides an engine for defending socialism and a driving force for achieving the prosperity of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean revolution is a great one which was pioneered with the might of the army-people unity and which has made progress thanks to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unity has a long history. Regarding it as a fundamental problem of building a powerful driving force for the revolution to achieve the army-people unity in his early years, President Kim Il Sung created heroic epic of this unity in the crucible of the arduous anti-Japanese revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tradition of army-people unity established in the early period of the Korean revolution has been carried forward and developed on a new higher stage in the Songun era led by Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The great unity between the army and people serves as an invulnerable fortress defending the headquarters of the revolution, a source which makes it possible for Korean-style socialism to emerge victorious on the most solid foundation and a driving force for ensuring the greatest prosperity of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This great unity is mighty revolutionary unity as it grows stronger and displays tremendous vitality despite manifold difficulties and hardships. Korean-style socialism will make a victorious advance in any storm and stress as long as there is the great unity of the army and people around the headquarters of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No force on earth can break this great unity in the DPRK. The solidity and might of the unity can be found in that there is oneness in ideology and fighting spirit of the army and people and they are united close thanks to the bonds of kinship whereby they help and lead each other forward and they have formed a community linked with the same destiny who would share the life and death to the end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The great traits in which the army and people think, move and struggle, guided by the Songun revolutionary idea of Kim Jong Il prevails throughout the country. Thanks to this great unity the Korean people have strong pluck and nothing to fear in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The great unity between the army and people serves as an eternal banner of victory, the article says, calling for giving fuller play to the might of the single-minded unity in the general advance for building a great prosperous powerful nation, the unity which was demonstrated on the occasions of the 95th birth anniversary of Kim Il Sung and the 75th anniversary of the KPA this significant year in the history of building the Juche-oriented revolutionary armed forces and the history of the army-people unity.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

However, it still touches the heartstrings of all people for its profound philosophical content. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The poem raises the true amity as an ethological question and expounds that it is worthless apart from the motherland but worthwhile only for the collective and it is the loyalty to the sacred cause, thus giving a philosophical answer to the revolutionary comradeship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The lyric leads its readers deep into the emotional world of amity as if they were kindly conversing with others. The poem, along with other famous works written by Kim Jong Il, reflects his unswerving confidence and lofty will to attend President Kim Il Sung with loyalty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Reciting the lyric, the Korean people keenly realize the undying feats performed by the leader who incarnates ardent revolutionary comradeship and has brought it into full bloom in this land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He has advanced long ago the profound idea of revolutionary comradeship based on thoughts of the President and established the precious tradition of single-minded unity based on the love and trust between comrades and revolutionary comradeship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are full of firm resolution to remain forever as comrades of the leader on the road of the Songun revolution as the lyric tells.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Periodicos abogan por la gran unidad entre el ejercito y el pueblo\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, 4 de mayo (ATCC) -- La gran unidad entre el ejercito y el pueblo de Corea es la unidad consanguinea de estos que tiene por su nucleo la Direccion de la Revolucion y que esta basada en el rol rector del ejercito popular. Todos los oficiales y soldados del Ejercito Popular y los habitantes deben tomar por bandera invencible de tal gran unidad en la epoca de Songun (priorizacion militar) preparada por el Dirigente Kim Jong Il y avanzar energicamente hacia la cumbre de la gran potencia del Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Asi subraya el articulo conjunto de los periodicos Rodong Sinmun y Joson Inmingun y continua: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La gran unidad del ejercito y el pueblo es lo mas importante en la revolucion del Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El ejercito revolucionario es el pilar de la revolucion y las masas populares son encargadas de esta. El ejercito y el pueblo unidos despliegan la fuerza inagotable. Esto es la valiosa verdad comprobada en la larga lucha revolucionaria. La fuerza motriz de la defensa del socialismo y la fuerza impulsora de la prosperidad de la patria residen en la unidad del ejercito y el pueblo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La revolucion coreana es la gran revolucion que se allano y se llevo adelante con la unidad del ejercito y el pueblo. La gran unidad del ejercito y el pueblo tiene profunda raiz historica. El Presidente Kim Il Sung presento la realizacion de dicha unidad como un problema fundamental para fortalecer el sujeto de la revolucion y creo la heroica epopeya de la unidad del ejercito y el pueblo en la ardua lucha de la revolucion antijaponesa. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La tradicion de esta unidad creada en la alborada de la revolucion coreana entro en una nueva etapa mas alta en la epoca del Songun guiada por el Dirigente Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La gran unidad del ejercito y el pueblo es una invencible fortaleza protectora de la direccion de la revolucion, una fuente que permite llevar adelante el socialismo coreano sobre la mas solida base, y una fuerza motriz que permite adelantar la epoca de la gran prosperidad de la patria. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Tambien, es la poderosa unidad revolucionaria que va floreciendose y surtiendo fuerza inagotable pese a multiples pruebas y obstaculos. Mientras existe la ferrea unidad del gran contingente de militares y civiles aglutinado en torno a la direccion de la revolucion, el socialismo coreano avanzara triunfando pese a todas las vicisitudes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  No hay tal fuerza capaz de romper la gran unidad del ejercito y el pueblo. La solidez y el poderio de esta unidad descansa en la identidad de la idea y el estilo de lucha de estos quienes estan unidos firmemente con un caluroso sentimiento fraternal de ayudarse y conducirse, y forman un cuerpo del destino identico que comparte hasta el fin la vida y la muerte. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Hoy dia en Corea el ejercito y el pueblo piensan, actuan y luchan segun la idea revolucionaria de Songun del Dirigente. Gracias a este gran rasgo de que dan pruebas el ejercito y el pueblo tenemos la firme fe en la victoria y no tenemos nada que temer en el mundo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La gran unidad del ejercito y el pueblo es la eterna bandera de victoria. Este ano de gran significado en la historia de fundacion de las fuerzas armadas revolucionarias autoctonas y de tal unidad, debemos poner de pleno manifiesto en la marcha general para la construccion de la gran potencia prospera el poderio de la unidad monolitica demostrado patentemente con motivo del 95o aniversario del nacimiento del Presidente Kim Il Sung y del 75o aniversario de la fundacion del EPC.      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
