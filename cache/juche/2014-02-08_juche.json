The U.S. is, however, taking an attitude quite contrary to this trend, claiming that it is interested in the \"issue of north Korea's nuclear issue\" only and will persistently push for its fulfillment of \"promise of denuclearization\" and \"fulfillment of the international commitment.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Saturday observes in a commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such behavior of the U.S. is not only an undisguised interference in the issue of the north-south relations, a matter of the Korean nation, but also a disgusting and foolish act against reunification as it eggs the south Korean authorities to react to the crucial proposal and open letter of compatriots by insisting on the nuclear issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The successive U.S. administrations have been displeased with any process of the north and the south to achieve reconciliation and unity and hamstrung their efforts to improve their relations by hook or by crook.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whenever the dialogue and cooperation between the north and the south made progress thanks to the DPRK's positive efforts the U.S. moves against reunification reached their height.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A typical example of this is that the U.S. is now chilling the climate for mending the north-south relations by building up public opinion about the nuclear issue again.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Obama administration is paying lip-service to \"its support\" to the improvement of the north-south relations.

Rodong Sinmun Saturday says this in an article.\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is the aggressor bringing the danger of a war, not peace to this land, a shameless occupier seeking permanent division and domination over the whole of Korea, not reunification desired by the Korean nation, and the sworn enemy who made the Koreans shake with towering grudge, the article notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. Korea policy is aimed at permanent division and aggression against the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the ulterior intention of the U.S. to fish in troubled waters by escalating distrust and antagonism between fellow countrymen, keeping the Korean nation splitted into two. Hence, the U.S. has ceaselessly egged the south Korean authorities onto the confrontation with fellow countrymen for decades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The tragic history of national division clearly proves what catastrophic consequences worship and flunkeyism towards America and the idea of fearing and submitting to America have brought to the efforts to reunify the country and hew out the independent destiny of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the Koreans in the north and the south and abroad have made every possible effort for the reunification of the country and national unity for nearly 70 years but they have failed to yield desired results.
