It is also necessary to further develop the local industry and, at the same time, steadily step up the production of consumer goods in a massive movement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the validity and vitality of the Workers' Party of Korea's policy for improving the standard of people's living are being displayed through commercial service networks, the light industrial factories and other relevant units should produce and send goods to Pyongyang Department Store No. 1 and other department stores and shops on a regular basis with no goods out of stock, he said. Only when shop networks are stacked with quality goods of diverse varieties, our officials can claim they have successfully discharged their mission and duty as the servants of the people, he added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underlined the need to further improve the commercial service to meet the intrinsic demand of socialist commerce.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the firm determination and will of the Workers' Party of Korea to bring about an epochal turn in improving the standard of people's living and building a thriving country in 2012, the centenary of birth of President Kim Il Sung, he said, earnestly calling upon all the Party members and other working people to dynamically effect a great surge to proudly enter the grand April festival with labor gifts of loyalty to the country and the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Mun Kyong Dok, alternate member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the C.C., the WPK and chief secretary of the Pyongyang City Committee of the WPK, Kim Ki Nam, member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the C.C., the WPK, Jang Song Thaek, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the C.C., the WPK and vice-chairman of the NDC, Thae Jong Su and Choe Ryong Hae, alternate members of the Political Bureau and secretaries of the C.C., the WPK, and Pak Pong Ju, first vice department director of the C.C., the WPK."
