Some days ago, it seriously threatened our soldiers on routine guard duty over the front line radio near the joint security area in Panmunjom, saying \"We will use arms unless KPA soldiers are withdrawn.\" And they behaved themselves disgracefully in front of our soldiers in the joint security area. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. Forces side seems to be forgetful that the merciless arms of our security officers in the area are always fully ready to fire as they are on highest alert. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It stoops to such infamy to provoke our side as displaying the flags of Denmark and Norway, which did not participate in the Korean War, in the conference room of the \"military armistice commission\" jointly used by both sides. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Not only our army and people but the foreigners visiting Panmunjom are angered at the base acts of the U.S. Forces side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. Forces side should immediately stop the political and military provocations against our servicemen in Panmunjom, bearing in mind what a high price the aggressors, provocateurs were forced to pay by our army.    \r\n\r\n"
