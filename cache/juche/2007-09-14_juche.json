This reality is a shining fruition of Songun politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should drop the hegemonic foreign policy going against history veiled with \"human rights\" and \"democracy,\" clearly seeing the mindset of the world people and the flow of history.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The idea of \"By our nation itself\" enshrined in the June 15 joint declaration is a milestone for achieving national cooperation involving all classes and strata. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Thursday observes this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea of \"By our nation itself\" serves as a spiritual weapon as it arouses all Koreans who love the country and nation to a sacred patriotic struggle for national cooperation and helps them perform their responsibilities and roles in accomplishing the cause of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea of \"By our nation itself\" reflects the desire and resolution of all Koreans to beat the foreign forces which have done tremendous harm to the Korean nation and preserve the Juche character and national character and thus fully demonstrate the national dignity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the June 15 era of reunification, all Koreans in the north and the south and overseas are waging a dynamic movement for reunification in concord and unity, aware of their mission and sense of responsibility as a driving force for national reunification. This reality indicates that the above-said idea is serving as a spiritual weapon for achieving national cooperation, rejecting foreign forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said idea serves, at the same time, as a banner ensuring peace and security of the country and promoting peace and reunification by dint of national cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The destiny of the Korean nation and the future of the cause of national reunification depend on whether the Koreans frustrate the sinister plots of the United States to start a new war, defend peace of the country and promote the cause of peaceful reunification or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea of \"By our nation itself\" encourages all Koreans at home and abroad in the struggle to achieve cooperation for peace by their concerted efforts against cooperation with foreign forces for war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An attitude toward the idea of \"By our nation itself,\" therefore, serves as a touchstone distinguishing patriotism from treachery and reunification from division, concludes the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
