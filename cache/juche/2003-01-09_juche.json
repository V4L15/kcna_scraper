The NDFSK and patriotic people of all strata will escalate the anti-U.S. resistance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The NDFSK will fully support the army-based policy and strive together with the whole nation to pave the way for independent national reunification with the concerted efforts of our nation under the banner of the joint declaration.    \r\n\r\n"

It is impossible to carry out the urgent task of the nation to avert a war and defend peace on the Korean Peninsula unless the moves of the U.S. to perpetuate Korean division and sow the seeds of discord among the Koreans are thoroughly frustrated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An atmosphere of reconciliation, unity and reunification between the north and the south is now running higher than ever before in the wake of the publication of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. Therefore, there is neither a reason nor conditions for the Koreans to stand in confrontation, escalate the tensions and harass peace on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Joint New Year Editorial issued on the occasion of the New Year, 2003 said that there exists only confrontation between the Korean nation in the north and the south and the U.S. at present. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"nuclear issue\" that renders the situation on the Korean Peninsula strained is a product of the U.S. strategy to dominate the world whereby it is working hard to bring a holocaust of a nuclear war to the Korean nation, calling for a preemptive nuclear strike after deploying lots of nuclear weapons in and around South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is plain to everyone that if a nuclear war breaks out in Korea it will bring catastrophic disasters to the Koreans in both parts of Korea. They should, therefore, pool their efforts and condemn and frustrate the U.S. nuclear policy for aggression and its racket of a nuclear threat so as to find a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north and the south and abroad should have a correct understanding of the structure of confrontation on the Korean Peninsula, remain vigilant against the U.S. imperialists' reckless moves for a war and deal deadly blows at Yankees by their concerted efforts.    \r\n\r\n"
