The North Headquarters of the Nationwide Special Committee for Probing the Truth behind the GIs' Crimes in a statement issued Thursday in this regard expressed great indignation at the GIs who committed such monstrous crimes as making sport of south Korean women and robbing south Koreans of their properties and vehemently denounced them in the name of the whole nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Shortly ago, two GIs belonging to the second division of the U.S. forces in south Korea were arrested for sexually abusing a woman in her thirties but no sooner had they been set free than perpetrated a similar crime against a woman police officer in her twenties at a lavatory only to be caught red-handed again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n GIs' unceasing hideous crimes in south Korea clearly prove the U.S. imperialist aggressors' insult and arbitrary practices against south Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They can never be free from murder, rape, plunder and all other misfortune and disasters as long as the U.S. forces stay in their land, the statement said, calling on the south Koreans from all walks of life to turn out more valiantly in the struggle to have the shackling south Korea-U.S. \"Status of Forces Agreement\" abolished and the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces withdrawn from south Korea as early as possible.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
