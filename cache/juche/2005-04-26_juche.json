            "content": "Spokesman for DPRK Foreign Ministry Assails Rice's Reckless Remarks \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 25 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry answered a question put by KCNA Monday as regards the fact that the United States threatened the DPRK again over the nuclear issue.\r\n On April 21, U.S. State Secretary Rice in an interview with the U.S. FOX TV let loose the threatening remarks against the DPRK that the U.S. would go to the UN Security Council and it would not wait with folded arms for the north Koreans to return to the six-way talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The spokesman said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAs we have already declared time and again, it is our consistent ultimate goal to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula and there is no change in our principled stand to attain it through negotiation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is that there are still no conditions and justification for the DPRK to participate in the six-way talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the United States is really interested in the resumption of the six-way talks, it should provide the DPRK with conditions and justification to return to the talks. The U.S. may know too well what conditions and justification it means. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, far from showing elementary respect and sincerity to the dialogue partner, it is seriously getting on the nerves of the DPRK, making official figures of its administration blare that the U.S. will dash north Korea's ambitious nuclear program under the eyes of the international community and it has the right and possibility to bring the issue to the UNSC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The  Bush administration's behaviour is nothing but coercion. It is not interested at all in providing the DPRK with the justification to participate in the talks, which it had deprived of the latter, but intends to bring the issue to the UNSC in a bid to resolve it through sanctions if the latter disobeys. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those countries participating in the six-way talks are disillusioned with such insincere and irresponsible actions. For the resumption of the six-way talks, the U.S. should withdraw its remarks about \"an outpost of tyranny\" at an early date. It is no more than a robber-like demand for the U.S. to unilaterally urge the DPRK to trust the empty word \"sovereign state\" uttered by the U.S. without retracting the above remarks and come to the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We can never return to the talks nor can we have any form of dealing with the U.S. unless the ill fame of an \"outpost of tyranny\" is shaken off. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is threatening that it will refer the nuclear issue to the UNSC, strengthen the PSI and take sanctions against the DPRK. But, these are nothing new to the DPRK.\r\n The stand of the DPRK is that the U.S. may bring the nuclear issue to the UNSC, if it wants that so much. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But, we make one thing clear: The DPRK will regard the sanctions as a declaration of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We are fully ready to cope with everything in a do-or-die spirit and have already prepared all countermeasures against the sanctions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We have built the nuclear deterrent force with so much effort despite enormous difficulties in order to effectively cope with the arrogant, outrageous and brigandish method of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Therefore, we remain undeterred by reckless remarks of Rice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We know what we should do at the decisive moment and will react to the hardline action of the U.S. with the toughest action.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is a brilliant fruition of the President's line of attaching primary importance to military affairs that the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK could work military miracles which will shine through centuries by defeating two formidable imperialist enemies, the U.S. and Japan, and display its pride as a powerful mainstay defending the Workers' Party of Korea, the state, the ideology and system of the DPRK on the forefront of the bloody class struggle and socialist construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history of the President's leadership over the army building has been steadfastly carried forward by Kim Jong Il. The Songun revolutionary leadership of Kim Jong Il is an experienced and tested leadership whereby he leads all the work of the political, economic, ideological and cultural fields on the basis of firmly maintaining the principle of giving priority to the military affairs under any difficult and complicated situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAnd it is an ever-victorious leadership to successfully solve all the problems arising in defending the country and building socialism in reliance upon the political and military power of the KPA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA, resembling Kim Jong Il possessed of gifted military intelligence and wisdom and unrivaled grit and pluck, is fighting dauntlessly with a tight grip on the arms of justice and patriotism which are merciless to the enemies who dare encroach upon the dignity of the socialist country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The faith of the KPA in socialism is and will be unshakable. The socialist system of the DPRK will be further fortified as an impregnable fortress as there are the KPA, which has grown to be a-match-for-a hundred armed forces through all hardships and tribulations in the centuries-long confrontation with the enemies, and the powerful defense industry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il is the lifeline of the socialism of Korean style. The greatest mission of the KPA is to devotedly defend the headquarters of revolution.\r\n The KPA will never pardon aggressors who dare provoke the sovereignty of the nation and the socialist system, the cradle of the worthy life of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun revolutionary cause of the WPK will surely emerge victorious as the KPA prepared and tempered in politico-ideological and military technical aspects in the 70 odd year-long arduous struggle is standing in the van. The final victory is in store for the army and people of the DPRK with the treasured sword of great Songun in their hands.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
