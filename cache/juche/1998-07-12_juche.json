            "content": "Kim Jong Il sends open letter to voters \r\n Pyongyang, July 12 (KCNA) - Genereal Secretary Kim Jong Il today sent an open letter to all voters throughout the country.\r\n   The letter reads in full:\r\n\r\n                         Open letter to all voters throughout the country\r\n\r\n   I was nominated as candidate for the DPRK Supreme People's Assembly (SPA) at the meetings of voters which were held recently at all constituencies throughout the country to nominate their SPA candidates. I think this is an expression of deep trust of all voters in our Party and a manifestation of the unshakable faith and will of our people and People's Army soldiers to make our socialist country more prosperous and carry forward the Juche revolution generation after generation under the Party's leadership.\r\n   I extend warm thanks to all voters for expressing deep trust in me.\r\n   For a revolutionary, there is no greater honor and happiness than to enjoy the people's trust and serve them. \r\nTrue to President Kim Il Sung's noble idea of loving the country and the people, I will devotedly work for the country and the people and live up to the people's deep trust and expectation.\r\n   I have agreed to be registered as SPA candidate at constituency No. 666 for the 10th Supreme People's Assembly \r\nElection because the DPRK law on the election to People's Assemblies at different levels stipulates that one constituency shall register one candidate.\r\n   Our DPRK Government is a genuine people's government built by our people under President  Kim Il Sung's leaderships It is also a powerful weapon in the cause of socialism.\r\n   The 10th SPA election is an important political event that is of historic significance in strengthening the people's government and consolidating the socialist system as required by the new stage of our revolution that is characterized by inheritance to the cause of President Kim Il sung.\r\n   All voters should take part in the election with the high honor and pride of DPRK citizenship and elect those who serve the people faithfully as deputies to the SPA so that the superiority of our socialism and the powerful wholehearted unity of our society can be demonstrated and our revolutionary government be consolidated.\r\n   I believe our people and People's Army soldiers will vigorously fight under the banner of the Juche Idea, rallied close behind the party, and win a new victory in the effort to strengthen our republic and defend and exalt Juche socialism.\r\n\r\n                         Kim Jong Il\r\n                   July 12, Juche 87 (1998)\r\n\r\n \r\n"

He is the great leader of the nation who has led socialism with a strong sense of Patriotism.\r\n   The history of his revolutionary activities is a patriotic history in which he has led the revolution and construction, guided by the idea of attaching importance to the nation. It is a history of devoted services in which he has made tireless efforts for the sovereignty of the country and its prosperity and development.\r\n   His idea of attaching importance to the nation serves as the basic idea of party and state building and guidelines for all affairs and livelihood of the Korean people. It is thanks to his patriotic devoted services that the dignity of the country has firmly been defended, though it has been confronted with such difficulties that other countries should have given in to.\r\n   With Kim Jong Il, who is possessed of the noblest patriotism, leading socialism it is possible to defend the sovereignty of the country and nation generation after generation, give full play to the advantages of the nation in all aspects of the revolution and construction and to lay solid foundations for the prosperity of the country.\r\n   Korea has already turned into a country strong in ideology, politics and military affairs thanks to his patriotic idea and guidance. Korea is crowned with an invincible Party, monolithic unity, matchless defence capacity and superior socialist system built by him. Such solid foundations of the building of the country surely guarantee the future of a prosperous country, more dignified and stronger.\r\n    In the new century the world will see Juche Korea which demonstrates the potentials and spirit of a strong country in all aspects of social life. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
