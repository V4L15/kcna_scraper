En tales circunstancias, se presenta a la RPDC la prioridad vital de consolidar aun mas la capacidad de autodefensa nacional centrada en las fuerzas armadas nucleares. Por esta razon, la RPDC se vio obligada a considerar con seriedad la participacion en el Congreso de la ONU y tomo la decision de no asistir.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, nuestro pais seguira apoyando en el futuro tambien el ideal del MNOAL y los esfuerzos mundiales por la eliminacion total de armas nucleares y cumplira con su responsabilidad del pais poseedor de armas nucleares hasta que se logre la desnuclearizacion del mundo entero."
