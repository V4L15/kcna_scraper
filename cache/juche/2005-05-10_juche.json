The biggest event is the adoption of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration thanks to the bold decision and the greatest magnanimity of Kim Jong Il, leader of the DPRK. The declaration is making a sizable contribution to the process of reconciliation, cooperation and reunification of the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes against not only the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration but also the desire of the entire Korean nation to achieve national unity independently and peacefully that the south Korean authorities refuse to demolish the concrete wall.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Japan, however, is not qualified to sit on the SC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has neither honestly reflected on the most hideous crimes the Japanese imperialists committed against humanity in the last century nor settled them though nearly 60 years have passed since their defeat. On the contrary, it is more rapidly veering to the Right and heading for militarism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By sitting on the SC the Japanese reactionaries seek to behave as a political power by abusing its authority and realize its wild ambition to dominate Asia and conquer the world, which they failed to do so in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To allow Japan to become a permanent member of the SC is as dangerous a move as splitting the UN and inviting a new militarist war to the international arena. For this reason, many countries of the world including Asian countries are strongly opposed to Japan's bid for permanent membership of the SC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite ridiculous and laughable for Japan to go hectic with shuttle entreaty and bribing diplomacy in a bid to realize its militarist ambition and hold a responsible position at the UN, swimming against the trend of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan can never win the trust of the international community as long as it is seeking militarization and overseas expansion without redeeming its past crimes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
