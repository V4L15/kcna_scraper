And it makes it possible to widen the scope of heat treatment more than 30 mm each time by utilizing electric property of plasma. \r\n It is not restricted by sizes of products and its heat treatment speed is quick. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The products treated by the device do not need reprocessing. The device is available for not only steel but also cast iron. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The device consumes less electricity and saves a lot of manpower. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has been widely introduced into railway transportation, machine-building industry and rolling stock production. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Kim Jong Thae Electric Locomotive Plant has already applied the device into production, with the result that it has extended the serviceable life of engine wheels 1.5 times that of the wheels treated by other methods. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The production cost of the device is lower than other devices including the high-frequency induction furnace. And it does not cause air pollution.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Revolutionary Martyr Kim Chaek\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 28 (KCNA) -- Kim Chaek is a paragon of many revolutionaries of Korea who enjoy immortality in the minds of the leader and the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\r\n He was born into a poor peasant family in Kim Chaek City of North Hamgyong Province on August 14, 1903. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He, together with his family, crossed the Tuman River and moved to northeastern area of China after the occupation of Korea by the Japanese imperialists. He, who experienced the miserable lot of the ruined nation, started the anti-Japanese struggle in his early years with a burning hatred for the invaders.\r\n President Kim Il Sung pioneered the revolutionary cause of Juche and indicated the true way to the national resurrection. The historic event marked an epochal turning point in the life and struggle of Kim Chaek, who was thirsty for the appearance of the leader that could save the destiny of the country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the guidance of the President he, as an able commanding officer of the guerrilla army, organized well military and political activities, thus making a great contribution to the struggle for defeating the Japanese imperialists and achieving the liberation of the country.\r\n After the country's liberation he was active as the first director of Pyongyang Institute, vice-chairman of the People's Committee of North Korea and vice-premier and minister of Industry of the Cabinet. During those days he devoted all his wisdom and energy to the efforts for implementing the policies on building the Party, people's power and regular revolutionary armed forces and on achieving national reunification set forth by the President.\r\n During the hard-fought Fatherland Liberation War he, assuming the heavy responsibility of a member of the Military Commission and the commander of the Front Headquarters, dedicated himself to the struggle for carrying the unique strategies and tactics of the President into practice. He passed away on January 31, Juche 40 (1951). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the years of the anti-Japanese armed struggle, he stood in the van in holding the President as the center of guidance over and unity of the Korean revolution. In his lifetime he distinguished himself in ensuring the safety of the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After national liberation he saw to it to set up the slogan \"Long live General Kim Il Sung!\" in all streets of Hamhung and make all the citizens replete with the feelings of reverence for the President. And he led creators to write and compose the immortal revolutionary paean \"Song of General Kim Il Sung\". He, therefore, made a brilliant contribution to ensuring the absolute authority of the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He did not concede or compromise in the least in the efforts to defend the ideas and lines of the President and to implement his orders and instructions. He was possessed of only absoluteness and unconditionality as unswerving faith. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President had kept only his photograph taken with Kim Chaek in his safe. This eloquently proves how deeply he was engraved in the mind of the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to hand down the martyr's exploits, many units were named after Kim Chaek. Among them are Kim Chaek City, the Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Complex and Kim Chaek University of Technology. And feature films and songs were created on the themes of his activities.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

A spokesman for the White House also blustered that north Korea must make a strategic decision to dismantle its nuclear deterrent to begin with. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This suggests that this year, too, the United States intends to persistently pursue its aim to tarnish the DPRK's image in a bid to put spurs to the preparations to destroy its system with nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. slandered the DPRK as an \"outpost of tyranny\", an \"illegal state\" and a \"rogue state\" in the past, while asserting that the state is little short of a business engaged in criminal acts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is well-known that the scenarios for smear campaigns worked out by U.S. political tricksters at back rooms have been derided and condemned by the international community as they are full of lies and fabrications. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. is again peddling the bankrupt fiction of an \"illegal state\" and the unreasonable demand that \"north Korea abandon its nuclear program first.\"  This is aimed at forcing the DPRK to disarm itself at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The socialist system in the DPRK is a genuine social system under which everything serves the people and a precious social system chosen and protected by them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nature and mission of the DPRK do not allow such things as bad treatment of the people, counterfeiting and drug trafficking to happen in it.\r\n The reality fully reveals that the hard-line conservatives who claim to be U.S. politicians are political imbeciles and they represent a dangerous group of evils.\r\n It is preposterous, indeed, for this group to dare slander and insult the DPRK as they had grown rich at the cost of the blood shed by Indians and are now finding themselves in an abyss of crimes and intrigues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is by no means fortuitous that the world public comments the settlement of the DPRK-U.S. pending issues and regional peace and stability are facing bigger challenges owing to the U.S. hard-line hawks including Cheney. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. hard-line conservatives should clearly know that the U.S. drop of its hostile policy toward the DPRK is prerequisite to settling the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
