This is their way of thinking and logic.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The moves of the imperialists to monopolize natural resources at present are characterized by the fact that they are seeking to put major areas of natural resources under their control through reorganization and relocation of armed forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The imperialists are channeling main efforts into reorganizing and relocating armed forces in Central Asia and Mideast countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Imperialist big powers are now coveting Mideast and Central Asia, the major areas of oil resources, and embroiled in scrambles to seize them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is noteworthy in the moves of the U.S. imperialists to build new military bases is the forward-deployment of their armed forces to put major transport routes of natural resources and strategic vantages under their control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What merits attention in the above-said moves is that they are keen on mainly putting oil or uranium resources under their control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Another characteristic feature of their moves to monopolize natural resources at present is to secure natural resources through war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are now facing various knotty problems. One of them is a crisis of natural resources and oil.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A bigger problem of the U.S. is that its monopoly on oil is sinking. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the basic trend of the world politics to head for multi-polarization at present after the Cold War demised.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To protect natural resources precisely means an anti-imperialist struggle. Only through an intensified anti-imperialist struggle, is it possible to protect natural resources, develop economy and defend the sovereignty of the countries and the nations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe natural resources of the world should be developed and used in favor of the common development of humankind according to the new fair international economic order.

Particularmente pretenden controlar el petroleo crudo y recursos de uranio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la epoca actual otra caracteristica de tales maniobras de monopolio es el aseguramiento de los recursos naturales mediante la guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora, los imperialistas se enfrentan a varios problemas dificiles. Uno de ellos es la crisis de recursos naturales y de petroleo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl problema mas dificil para EE.UU. es que se va desmoronando su posicion monopolista de petroleo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy en que se finalizo la Guerra Fria, la multipolarizacion es la tendencia principal de la politica del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa defensa de los recursos naturales es precisamente la lucha antiimperialista. Solo la lucha antiimperialista posibilita defender los recursos naturales, desarrollar la economia y defender la soberania del pais y la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos recursos naturales del mundo deben ser explotados y utilizados  en  favor del desarrollo comun de la humanidad bajo el nuevo e imparcial orden economico internacional. Los paises en vias de desarrollo deben fortalecer mas la cooperacion Sur-Sur en el sector de explotacion de recursos naturales."
