The Korean people are happy to hold the two great leaders in high esteem, he added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The participants in the round-table talks praised the Songun politics of the DPRK as the most just political mode which should be applied without fail to defend and strengthen socialism. The DPRK's access to nuclear weapons is an entirely just self-defensive measure to cope with the U.S. escalating moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK, they noted.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

We hail this counter-measure as a just one reflecting the strong will of the Korean people who consider its sovereignty and dignity as something dearer than their life and highly appreciate it.  The Liberal Party of Egypt said this in a statement issued on Mar. 22 in support of the February 10 statement of the DPRK Foreign Ministry in which it solemnly declared it would suspend its participation in the six-party talks for an indefinite period and bolster its nuclear arsenal for self-defence in order to cope with the U.S. imperialists' moves to stifle the DPRK.\r\n The statement continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. truly wants a peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue and peace and security on the Korean Peninsula, it should meet the just demand of people's Korea that the U.S. roll back its hostile policy towards the DPRK.

This once again proves that they are greedy robbers who stoop to any infamy to realize their territorial expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This move assumes graver nature as it is stepped up, timed to coincide with their distortion of history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n History will never change and disappear no matter how hard they work to tamper with and cover up it. History remains as it is despite the change of the era and the flow of the time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese ultra-right conservative forces' moves to seize Tok Islet and distort history are hardening the resolution and will of the army and people of the DPRK to settle accounts with Japan to the last. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people reserve the legitimate right to get an apology and compensation from Japan for its forcible drafting of Koreans, massacre of them, the sexual slavery for the imperial Japanese army, the policy of forcing Koreans to change their names to Japanese and other crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is foolish of the ultra-right conservative forces of Japan to go wild to distort history and grab Tok Islet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They had better stop behaving so.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

To this end, they set in motion even gendarmes, to say nothing of the administrative and police organs including the \"Korean Government-General\", provincial, county and sub-county offices, police stations, sub-stations and police boxes. They officially declared that Japanese would be used as an official language at all government and public offices, courts and others. They unhesitatingly proclaimed that\r\nJapanese was the \"mother tongue\" to be compulsorily used by Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They promulgated the \"law on editing newspapers\" in 1907, the \"press law\" in 1909 and the \"press regulations\" in 1910, thus tightening the measures to obliterate the national identity of the Korean people and the Korean language. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They fabricated the \"ordinance on Korean education\" and retrogressively revised it four times in a bid to step up their policy of obliterating the Korean language. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This policy was harshly pursued in all fabrics of social life including family life, not to speak of education, press, radio broadcasting, drama, film, music, linguistics and other fields. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They forced the \"Korean Association of Literary Men\" to rename it the \"Korean Society of Literary Men for Protecting the Country\" in 1942, pressurized Korean men of literature to join it and write every work in the \"mother tongue.\" They made sure that its organ Kukmin Munhak, too, was published in Japanese. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They promulgated the \"ordinance\" related to \"the change of Korean names into Japanese\" in 1939 before intensifying their suppression of Koreans. All the ruling machines from the \"Korean Government-General\" to provincial, county and sub-county offices and police stations and sub-stations and pro-Japanese organizations did their utmost to thoroughly execute the ordinance in those days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such acts perpetrated by the Japanese imperialists to obliterate the Korean language and national identity during their unheard-of colonial fascist rule were the most brutal and horrible mental tortures and hideous crimes committed against the Korean people.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Not content with this, it is contemplating developing means to strike any part of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. unilateral, high-handed and arbitrary military actions in the international arena are heightening the vigilance of many countries. It is, therefore, as clear as noonday that the U.S. moves for military supremacy would spark a new arms race worldwide and foster confrontation due to military conflicts and frictions and this would lead to a new Cold War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. reckless moves for military supremacy are seriously upsetting military balance, disturbing stability and aggravating the military confrontation in various countries and regions of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n World public is unanimous in observing that the U.S. policy for military supremacy over the whole world is an anachronistic dream based on its outdated way of thinking. The U.S. would be well advised to face up to the reality and drop at once its foolish dream to dominate the world by force.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
