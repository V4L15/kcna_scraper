Minju Joson today says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As soon as the two girl students were killed by the armored car in Yangju county, Kyonggi Province in broad daylight on June 13, the U.S. Forces side was busy with moves to hide the truth of the incident and flee from the responsibility for it from the outset and had no idea of making any \"apology\" for what happened. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When a strong campaign was launched in different parts of South Korea to demand a probe into the truth of the incident and the punishment of those responsible for the crime, the U.S. Forces side made much fuss, belatedly \"indicting the driver of the armoured car\" and \"releasing a statement\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. imperialists truly feel responsible for the crime, how can they organize a celebration of their independence day with such pomp and splendour, turning a deaf ear to the demands of the families of those killed and other South Koreans for reparation and how can they unilaterally refuse to let the criminals face prosecution though nearly one month has passed since the occurrence of the incident or allow them to freely go to the bar. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This fact once again reveals how brazen-faced and crafty the U.S. imperialists are. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There should be neither concession nor compromise in the struggle against the U.S. imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that a similar tragedy is bound to occur again as long as they are allowed to stay in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists should take an honest and responsible attitude towards the probe into the incident and reparation for the killing and immediately pull their aggressor forces out of South Korea.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
