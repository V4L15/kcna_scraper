            "content": "3rd Meeting of KPA Battalion Commanders and Political Instructors Held under Guidance of Kim Jong Un\r\n  Pyongyang, November 5 (KCNA) -- There took place in Pyongyang with splendor the 3rd meeting of battalion commanders and political instructors of the Korean People's Army (KPA) on Oct. 3 and 4.\n\t\t\t\t\t The meeting marked a new landmark in preserving and glorifying forever the idea of the peerless great men of Mt. Paektu on attaching importance to battalions and their exploits performed in  army-building and reinforcing the battalions as required by the modeling of the whole army on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism. It was of weighty importance in ushering in a heyday of bolstering up the military power by arousing all service personnel to the struggle to train the battalions as elite guards units of devotedly defending the leader.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Present at the meeting were Hwang Pyong So, Hyon Yong Chol, Ri Yong Gil, Kim Won Hong and other KPA commanding officers, battalion commanders and political instructors, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un entered the venue of the meeting.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He acknowledged the enthusiastic cheers of the participants and sent a warm salute to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The report was made by KPA Vice Marshal Hwang Pyong So, director of the KPA General Political Bureau.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reporter said the annals of the Songun revolution which was started and triumphed by dint of arms under the banner of the Juche idea are associated with the tireless efforts made by the peerless great men of Mt. Paektu and the loving care shown by them for consolidating the battalions of the KPA.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t President Kim Il Sung, who provided a precious tradition of reinforcing the battalions in the crucible of the bloody anti-Japanese war, directed primary efforts to reinforcing the battalions politically and militarily from the early period of building a revolutionary regular armed forces, the reporter noted, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During the past Fatherland Liberation War he appointed many anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters as commanding officers of the battalions and wisely led the battalions to fulfill their roles in achieving the victory in the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Leader Kim Jong Il gave a unique definition that a battalion is the lowest commanding unit of the KPA and its basic combat unit and independent unit for service. He enunciated the idea of giving importance to battalions that the overall combat capability of the KPA will be bolstered up in every way only when the battalions are reinforced.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the second meeting of battalion commanders and political instructors, he set it as the basic duty of the battalion commanders and political instructors to make battalions elite and invincible combat ranks and led them with loving care to play the roles of central figures in reinforcing the battalions and twin pillars supporting them so that all of them might become a-match-for-hundred ones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il's idea of attaching importance to battalions and their cause of army-building are being successfully carried forward and developed on a new higher stage under the wise leadership of Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The future of the DPRK is immensely rosy and it is sure to win its final victory as it has Kim Jong Un at the helm of the Songun revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then followed speeches by KPA general and officers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un made a speech at the meeting.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that the third meeting of KPA battalion commanders and political instructors marked an epochal occasion as it provided an important landmark in fully applying Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il's idea of attaching importance to battalions and their idea of reinforcing them to army building and military activities and ushering in a heyday of bolstering up the military muscle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  He referred to the importance of the position and duties of the battalions in increasing the military capability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He set forth important tasks to be fulfilled to turn all battalions into invincible elite combat ranks capable of beating back any formidable enemy at one blow and dear old homes of service personnel linked with the yard of the Party Central Committee.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underlined the need to steadily improve the contents and modes of training as required by Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il's military idea of strategy and tactics, Juche-based war methods, combat duties of units and sub-units and modern war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He instructed commanding officers to embody Kim Jong Il-style outlook on service personnel, take warm care of their living and lead them as their real parents would do. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to reinforce the battalions it is necessary to decisively increase the responsibility and role of the battalion commanders and political instructors, he noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Battalion commanders and political instructors should work on the basis of strengthening companies from A to Z, he said, adding battalions and companies are like one organic body and it can be said that reinforcing companies precisely means strengthening battalions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He set it as an important way for bringing about a fresh change in strengthening battalions to raise a hot wind of mass movement and competition.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Stressing the need for the entire army to attach importance to battalions and sincerely help them, he called for building well the ranks of battalion commanders and political instructors and putting forward them and settling knotty problems arising in the battalion work in a responsible manner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He ardently appealed to them to dynamically struggle with indomitable faith to bring earlier the day of successfully completing the Korean revolution made under the leadership Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, bearing deep in mind the slogan of faith \"Do not abandon the revolutionary faith though one dies\" which made the hearts of the anti-Japanese revolutionary forerunners burn, the slogan in which their spirit still lives on in the hearts of the service personnel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He concluded his speech. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said through the meeting he learned the commanding officers of the battalions who have devoted themselves to strengthening battalions are, indeed, patriots and unknown heroes, adding that the Party Central Committee is most highly proud of having these comrades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that the Party Central Committed decided to highly praise them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then a decree of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly of the DPRK was read out by Ri Yong Gil, chief of the KPA General Staff.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un personally awarded the title of DPRK labor hero and gold medal (hammer and sickle) and Order of National Flag First Class to KPA officers Pang Kyong Chol, Choe Tong Yun, Han Chol Su, Kim Chol Ho and Sin Ye Gun, commanding officers of battalions, who performed distinguished feats.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed the conviction that all battalion commanders and political instructors would creditably live up to the expectation of the party by further reinforcing the battalions, the basic combat units of the KPA."

Korean Regime of Scuppering Opportunity of Mending North-South Relations\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, November 5 (KCNA) -- The international community remembers well that the south Korean chief executive talked volumes about north-south dialogue and unification during her foreign trips.\n\t\t\t\t\t Had this expressed her true intention, there would have been no reason for her to say no to the just demand made by the DPRK to the south Korean authorities for halting the anti-DPRK leaflet scattering operations desperately kicked up by human scum, pushing the situation to an extreme pitch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the south Korean authorities scuppered the hard-won opportunity of mending the north-south relations by conniving and patronizing the leaflet scattering operations hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and its social system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Wicked human scum were stopped from conducting a leaflet scattering operation in the area of Phaju, Kyonggi Province on Oct. 25 by inhabitants there and south Korean organizations of various circles including progressive and social bodies. But these betes noires perpetrated another leaflet-scattering operation in the area of Phochon, Kyonggi Province on Oct. 31.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet authorities again overlooked, connived and patronized the operation, talking about \"freedom of expression\" and repeating its claim that \"there was no legal ground to halt it\" and \"it was an exercise of the right provided for by the constitution.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They dispatched puppet policemen to the spot to calm down the protest among people. But, they were busy protecting the safety of the human scum together with those from the Defense Security Command of the south Korean puppet army, far from checking the leaflet scattering operation. On the contrary, they arrested an inhabitant on the spot for the mere reason that he damaged balloons and leaflets and branded the protest of inhabitants in the area and members of civic organizations against the operation as a \"riot of servants of the north.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This clearly indicates that the puppet authorities are the prime movers of the madcap leaflet scattering operations of human scum in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already disclosed, different ministries and agencies of the south Korean puppet regime are vying with each other to spend several millions of U.S. dollars for the leaflet scattering operations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Military gangsters provided military backing to the leaflet scattering operations. Not only forefront units of the puppet army but also flying corps of its air force were put on emergency alert. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is nonsensical, indeed, to have dialogue and discuss the issue of improving the north-south relations with such black-hearted guys.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group is getting frantic in its anti-DPRK human rights racket in international arena in collusion with the U.S. and desperately hurling human scum into leaflet scattering operations as part of its confrontation ruckus. This is aimed to escalate the confrontation with the north and ignite a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is an undeniable fact that the prospect of the north-south high-level contact remains gloomy though it had been high on agenda.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The leaflet scattering operations malignantly hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and its social system are undisguisedly staged under the eyes of service personnel of the Korean People's Army. The puppet forces are not entitled to say anything when these operations are subject to such merciless physical countermeasure as opening sighting fire to foil them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said crimes of the puppet group against reunification, the nation and ethics deserve condemnation and punishment by all Koreans."

esta capital la III Conferencia de Jefes e Instructores Politicos de Batallon del Ejercito Popular de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\tEl certamen tiene gran importancia en defender y glorificar la idea de dar importancia al batallon de los grandes hombres sin pares del monte Paektu y sus hazanas de construccion del ejercito, preparar un nuevo jalon del fortalecimiento del batallon conforme a la demanda de la transformacion de todo el ejercito segun el kimilsungismo-kimjongilismo, exhortar a todo el ejercito a la lucha por convertir los batallones del EPC en las filas de vanguardistas de flor y nata en la defensa a ultranza al lider y abrir la era dorada para el fortalecimiento de las fuerzas militares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la cita participaron Hwang Pyong So, Hyon Yong Chol, Ri Yong Gil, Kim Won Hong y otros comandantes del EPC, los jefes e instructores politicos de batallon, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Mariscal Kim Jong Un salio al salon de la conferencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl envio saludo cordial a los participantes respondiendo con una mano alzada a las aclamaciones de los participantes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl informe de la conferencia estuvo a cargo del vicemariscal del EPC Hwang Pyong So, jefe de la Direccion Politica General del EPC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl informante senalo que en la historia de la revolucion del Songun explorada y avanzada con los fusiles bajo la bandera de la idea Juche estan impregnados los incansables trabajos y la benevolencia de los grandes hombres  del monte Paektu y continuo:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Generalisimo Kim Il Sung preparo en el periodo de la guerra sangrienta antijaponesa la noble tradicion para el fortalecimiento del batallon y presto primordial atencion a fortalecer en lo politico y militar el batallon desde los primeres dias de la construccion de las fuerzas armadas revolucionarias regulares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante  la pasada Guerra de Liberacion de la Patria el Presidente envio a numerosos combatientes revolucionarios antijaponeses como comandantes de batallon para que el batallon cumpliera con su papel en lograr la victoria de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Generalisimo Kim Jong Il dio la explicacion original de que el batallon es la unidad de mando de base y de combate principal y de vida independiente del EPC y presento la idea de dar importancia al batallon de que al fortalecerse el batallon se consolidara por todos los medios la combatividad general del EPC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la II Conferencia de Jefes e Instructores Politicos de Batallon del EPC presento como deber principal de ellos convertir el batallon en la fila selecta de combate y dirigio para que ellos convirtieran todos los batallones en las filas de combate capaces de aniquilar uno contra cien enemigos siendo protagonistas principales y dos pilares del fortalecimiento del batallon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGracias a la sabia direccion del Mariscal Kim Jong Un la idea de dar importancia al batallon y las hazanas de construccion del ejercito de los Generalisimos se llevan adelante con brillantez en la nueva etapa mas alta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSera radiante el porvenir de la RPDC y cierta la victoria final por enaltecer al Comandante Supremo al frente de la revolucion de Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSeguidamente, hubo intervenciones de generales y oficiales del EPC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Jong Un pronuncio un discurso en la conferencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Mariscal senalo que esta conferencia sirve de un motivo trascendental para preparar el jalon importante en materializar cabalmente en la construccion y las actividades del ejercito la idea de dar importancia al batallon de los Generalisimos y abrir la era dorada del fortalecimiento de las fuerzas militares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSubrayo sobre la posicion y la importancia del deber del batallon en fortalecer las fuerzas militares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPresento las tareas programaticas para convertir todos los batallones en las invencibles filas selectas capaces de aniquilar de un golpe a cualesquier enemigos y en las  aldeas de la tierra natal de los soldados ligadas con el Comite Central del PTC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe refirio a  la necesidad de mejorar de continuo los contenidos y los modos de ejercicios conforme a la idea militar estrategica y tactica de Kim Il Sung-Kim Jong Il y los metodos de combate del Juche, los deberes de combate de las unidades y subunidades y la demanda de la guerra moderna.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDijo que los oficiales deben asimilar la concepcion de soldados del Dirigente y atender cordialmente a los militares con afecto maternal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEnfatizo que se debe elevar decisivamente la responsabilidad y el papel de los jefes e instructores politicos de batallon para fortalecerlo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSenalo que ellos deben trabajar dando hincapie a fortalecer la compania y agrego que el batallon y la compania son igual a un organismo y el fortalecimiento de la compania es precisamente el del batallon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPresento como remedio importante para imprimir nuevo cambio en el fortalecimiento del batallon dinamizar el movimiento masivo y la emulacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSenalo que todo el ejercito debe apreciar y ayudar bien al batallon, hacer selectas las filas de sus jefes e instructores politicos, presentarlos y evaluarlos bien y resolver con responsabilidad los problemas surgidos en las labores del batallon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebemos grabar en nuestros corazones la consigna de los martires revolucionarios antijaponeses \"!No abandone la conviccion revolucionaria aunque se muera!\" y ella nos hace sentir hasta hoy las palpitaciones de ellos, dijo y exhorto encarecidamente a luchar tenazmente con la fe indoblegable para acoger lo mas pronto posible el dia en que se cumpla con exito la revolucion coreana transcurrida bajo la guia del Presidente Kim Il Sung y el Dirigente Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Comandante Supremo concluyo su discurso.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos comandantes del batallon que dedicaron todo lo suyo al fortalecimiento de su unidad militar son patriotas y heroes desconocidos y el CC del PTC esta muy orgulloso de tener a tales companeros y decidio concederles altas condecoraciones aprovechando este conclave, informo el Mariscal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl jefe del Estado Mayor General del EPC, Ri Yong Gil, dio lectura al decreto correspondiente del Presidium de la Asamblea Popular Suprema de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Jong Un otorgo personalmente el titulo de Heroe del Trabajo de la RPDC, la medalla de oro (el Martillo y la Hoz) y la Orden Bandera Nacional de primera clase a estos comandantes del batallon: los oficiales del EPC Pang Kyong Chol, Choe Tong Yun, Han Chol Su, Kim Chol Ho y Sin Ye Gun quienes realizaron meritos excepcionales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl final, expreso la conviccion de que todos los jefes e instructores politicos de batallon recompensaran la esperanza del partido al fortalecer mas el batallon, principal unidad de combate del EPC."
