This aphorism of Kim Jong Il powerfully arouses the entire Korean nation to the genuine patriotic struggle for national reunification.\r\n  Also it clarifies the truth of life and struggle for the Koreans who have been undergoing sufferings caused by the national division. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation, with King Tangun as its ancestral father, is a homogeneous nation of one and the same blood who has created a 5,000-year-long history while living in the same territory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It, however, has been subjected to misfortunes, divided into the north and the south by outside forces for over 60 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists and its satellite forces do not want to see the reunification of Korea to achieve their aggressive and separatist design. They are making desperate efforts to rupture the reconciliation and cooperation between the north and the south by hook or by crook and lead the situation on the Korean Peninsula to the brink of war for the purpose of imposing the scourge of a nuclear war on the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to achieve the reunification at the earliest date under the present grave situation, those, with the blood and soul of the Korean nation, should value the great national unity dearer than anything else and turn out as one in the struggle against the separatists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Each member of the nation should bear in mind that the reunification of the country is patriotism and the struggle for it is the highest form of the patriotic struggle and devote his all to the reunification. Only then, he will be known among the fellow countrymen and become a patriot famous in the history of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The validity and vitality of the aphorism have been proved by the known and unknown heroes who laid down their valuable lives for the country's reunification and are being displayed by the Koreans in the north, south and overseas who are daringly joining the grand march for national independence and reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Its neo-conservative forces inculcate into the minds of the U.S. soldiers the idea of extreme misanthropy and destruction of other nations, the idea that they should be merciless and no mercy should be shown to anyone, if the United States is to lord it over and rule the world. The U.S. ruling quarters put pressure to block the passage of the \"bill on banning tortures\" through Congress and backed the maltreatment and brutal tortures of prisoners by U.S. soldiers, arguing that tortures are \"necessary\" to open the mouths of \"terror suspects.\" This vividly shows the hypocrisy and fiction of the \"defense of human rights\", loudly advertised by the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world people cannot get rid of misfortunes, sufferings and disasters caused by the U.S. imperialists as long as the latter continue armed intervention in and aggression upon sovereign states after setting up military bases of aggression and deploying armed forces in all parts of the world. The club of \"anti-terrorism\" brandished by the Bush warlike forces is the root cause of the violation of the independence of sovereign states, abuse of human rights and destruction of world peace and security in the present century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people cannot live a tranquil life and the world cannot be peaceful unless the U.S. imperialists' policy of aggression is checked and frustrated. The world should wage a relentless fight against the U.S. imperialists, a gang of murderers and war maniacs.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
