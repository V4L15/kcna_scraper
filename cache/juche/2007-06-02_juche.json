Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The justice and vitality of the three principles of national reunification are clearly proved by the reality in the June 15 era of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historic June 15 joint declaration, a banner in the era of independent reunification, could be published because the three principles of national reunification clearly indicated the way for the Korean nation to follow in order to achieve reunification. The idea of the era \"By our nation itself\" is inspiring the fellow countrymen replete with the patriotic desire to a dynamic movement for independent reunification and national cooperation as it is an embodiment of the above-said three principles, a great programme for national reunification. Without remaining true to the three principles the Koreans can hardly think of inter-Korean relations in the June 15 era of reunification in which they get reconciled and cooperate with each other and of the nationwide patriotic movement for reunification aimed at carving out a rosy future of peace and independent reunification by their concerted efforts, while rejecting flunkeyism and dependence on outsiders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The three principles of national reunification ushered in the stirring June 15 era of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The three principles represent the most just and realistic programme for independent reunification common to the nation as they propel the advance of the June 15 era of reunification. The fundamental principles for national reunification can never change in the struggle for national reunification, though its specific methods may alter according to the changing situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-mentioned three principles serve as an immortal great programme for national reunification which should be consistently maintained and thoroughly implemented by the Korean nation, as they reflect Kim Il Sung's noble idea of achieving independent reunification and his patriotic will and indicate the most correct principles and ways for the reunification movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Independent national reunification can be achieved only when all Koreans invariably adhere to the three principles of national reunification as immutable principles for reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Pero, son inmutables los principios fundamentales de la reunificacion de la patria. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Los tres principios mencionados constituyen un gran programa que la nacion coreana debe materializar hasta el fin para esa gran causa nacional. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La reunificacion independiente de la nacion coreana se lograra sin falta solo cuando todos los coreanos mantengan invariablemente esos tres principios.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
