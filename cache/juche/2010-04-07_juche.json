Korea\r\n Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- The commander of the U.S. forces in the Pacific at a recent hearing at the Armed Services Committee of the House of Representatives underscored the \"necessity\" to \"tighten alliance\" between the U.S. and south Korea to \"cope with provocation\" by someone.\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a clear indication of the U.S. ambition for aggression to launch a new war on the Korean Peninsula at any cost by instigating the south Korean puppet forces to escalate the confrontation with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the invariable strategic scenario of the U.S. to keep south Korea under its tighter military control and use it as a springboard from which to launch the second Korean war and, furthermore, establish military domination over Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To this end, the U.S. is busy training the south Korean forces to fully serve its operational purpose in a bid to use it as a shock brigade in provoking the new war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"tightened alliance\" between the U.S. and south Korea is prompted by this purpose. It is aimed to enhance the \"role\" of the puppet army in provoking and waging a war of aggression against the DPRK under the pretence of coordinating the military actions between the U.S. and south Korean forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"tightened alliance\" with south Korea much touted by the U.S. is a cynical ploy to cover up the U.S. attempt to keep its forces in south Korea for an indefinite period and the true nature of its policy for aggression against the DPRK and mislead the world public opinion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For the past several decades the U.S. has brought to south Korea huge aggression troops and all types of war means while crying out for \"tightened alliance\" with south Korea. It has thus turned south Korea into its nuclear arsenal and an outpost for a war of aggression against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Last year the U.S. stipulated the provision of \"extended deterrence\" including \"nuclear umbrella\" to south Korea in the joint document of the U.S.-south Korea \"summit\" and deployed different types of operational hardware including 40 F-15Ks and smart bombs there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently Aegis warships of the U.S. Navy entered Tonghae Port in south Kangwon Province and staged full-scale military exercises in the waters of the West Sea. The U.S. is also contemplating additionally deploying 21 F-15Ks as well as 125 new type medium-range air-to-air missiles, 35 air-to-ground missiles, 280 JDAMs and other war hardware in the near future. All these moves are part of its scenario to \"tighten alliance\" with south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ceaseless war exercises are a product of the U.S. and the south Korean puppet army's policy of aggression and their theory of a war against the DPRK to all intents and purposes. They are, at the same time, an undisguised military confrontational racket intended to \"tighten alliance\" between them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This alliance is, in a nutshell, nothing but an alliance for aggression and war targeted against the DPRK. It has only resulted in straining the situation on the Korean Peninsula and increasing the danger of a war on it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said moves to \"tighten alliance\" assume more grave nature as they are stepped up at a time when operational plans are being worked out in the U.S. and south Korea to cope with \"contingency\" in the DPRK and a black propaganda campaign has gained in scope and strength to tarnish the image of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. loud-mouthed \"tightened alliance\" is, in essence, nothing but its scenario to use war maniacs of south Korea in executing its anti-DPRK confrontational policy, launch a new war on the Korean Peninsula and violate the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The campaign of the U.S. and south Korea to \"tighten their alliance\" amounts to a hideous crime as it goes against the desire of the Koreans and other people of the world for peace on the Korean Peninsula and the need of the times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. would be well advised to face up to the reality with a cool head and drop its wild ambition to put the DPRK and the rest of Asia under its domination by retaining its grip on south Korea."

Debarajan, secretary of the Central Committee of the All-India Forward Bloc, made public a statement on Apr. 1 on the occasion of the Day of the Sun.\n\t\t\t\t\t He said in the statement that President Kim Il Sung, founder of the Workers' Party of Korea, was a great strategist and an ever-victorious iron-willed brilliant commander who defeated two imperialisms in one generation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Il Sung declared a war against the Japanese imperialists and applied superb guerilla war tactics with the extraordinary military wisdom and stratagem even though there was neither state rear nor support from regular army, thus striking one million-strong army of the Japanese imperialists with terror, he noted, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe war, which the U.S. imperialists provoked against the young DPRK in 1950, was the fiercest one after World War .\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Il Sung defeated the U.S. imperialism which was boasting of being the \"strongest\" in the world with the original military tactics and bold and adroit operations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the post-war period, too, he declared that the DPRK would react to \"retaliation\" of the U.S. imperialists with retaliation and their all-out war with an all-out war and smashed all the moves of the enemies for aggression against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He is, indeed, a legendary hero and a military genius who performed military feats to be specially recorded in the world history by liberating Korea and creating the outstanding military ideas, original strategy and tactics and all-round experience through the protracted and arduous struggle to defend the sovereignty of the country."
