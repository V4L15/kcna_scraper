This was a political fraud unprecedented in history, says Rodong Sinmun Tuesday in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists massively hurled their forces and troops of their satellite countries into the Korean war. To justify this they carefully worked out a scenario beforehand to bring the Korean issue to the UN. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their Korean war of aggression did not go well from its outset according to their wishes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the situation turned out to be unfavorable to them, they intended to straighten out it in the name of the UN.  The U.S. forced the UN to call a meeting of the UNSC at 3 p.m. on June 27, 1950 at which an illegal resolution on providing \"aid\" to south Korea was adopted and an aggressive resolution on allowing U.S.-led armed intervention of its satellite nations against the DPRK was also adopted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to hurl more troops of their satellite nations into the war and escalate the armed invasion the U.S. imperialists instigated the UNSC to create U.S. forces-led \"UN Forces\" on July 7, 1950 and adopt a resolution on mobilizing them to the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By nature, the \"UN resolution\" approving military intervention in the DPRK was illegal as it was adopted without the participation of the former Soviet Union, a permanent member of the UNSC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On July 8 Truman unilaterally appointed MacArthur, commander of the U.S. Forces in the Far East, as concurrent commander of the \"UN Forces.\" On July 25 the U.S. imperialists set up the \"UN Command\" and allowed the U.S. forces and troops of their 15 satellite countries to go under helmets of \"UN Forces\" during the Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They perpetrated indiscriminate destructions and mass killings, wantonly violating the UN Charter and international law and bringing unspeakable disasters and misfortune to the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists will always stand condemned by history for committing such unprecedented hideous crimes as perpetrating the Korean war with the mobilization of their huge forces and troops of their satellite nations under the name of the UN and thereby wrecking peace on the Korean Peninsula and bringing the war holocaust to the Korean nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

First, citizens of the DPRK were abducted by them in an organized manner. Second, it was not one or two citizens of the DPRK who were abducted by them to Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By origin Japan is ill-famed for abduction. In the first half of the last century, Japan committed such hideous crimes as drafting at least 8.4 million young and middle-aged Koreans to battle sites and sites of slave labor and forcing more than 200,000 Korean women into sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is proven by history that every monstrous crime was not committed according to an individual intention but perpetrated as an organized state-sponsored crime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that cases of Japan's abduction of citizens of the DPRK have been clearly disclosed recently, the Korean people will never pardon the Japanese reactionaries' hostile acts against the DPRK, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries should repatriate to the DPRK all its citizens abducted by them. They should, at the same time, give the DPRK assurances that they would punish the criminals and take steps against the recurrence of similar crimes and roll back at once all reckless hostile policies toward the DPRK including abduction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "All Koreans Urged to Come out to Honor Kim Il Sung's Instruction on National Reunification\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 10 (KCNA) -- Every member of the Korean nation living in the June 15 era of reunification should turn out in the sacred patriotic struggle to accomplish the cause of independent reunification, bearing in mind the instruction given by President Kim Il Sung for reunification as the motto in his life and struggle and immortal guidelines for the patriotic movement for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President had consistently adhered to the line of one Korea, the line of reunification despite whatever difficulties and adversity since the very day the nation was split by foreign forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The line of the country's reunification laid down and consistently maintained by the President is a line of national independence to achieve the complete sovereignty and independence of the country and the nation from A to Z and a true patriotic line for achieving the prosperity and development of a reunified country and the prosperity of the whole nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The three principles of national reunification, the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation and the proposal for founding the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo are the three charters for national reunification which he provided to the fellow countrymen by systematically and comprehensively dealing with the fundamental principles and ways to achieve the country's reunification on the basis of the great Juche idea and the precious experience gained in the course of the struggle to reunify the country. They clearly indicate the way for the Koreans to achieve the independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fundamental principles and ways for national reunification indicated by the President are the most correct great programme for national reunification common to the nation the validity and vitality of which have been clearly proven in reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The driving force for reunification and patriotism grew stronger and the movement for national reunification mounted nationwide against the backdrop of the growing desire of the nation for reunification even at a time when the foreign forces and pro-U.S., anti-reunification forces of south Korea became evermore undisguised in their moves to create \"two Koreas\" and pursue confrontation and war against reunification in the last century and the nation greeted the June 15 era of reunification and the whole land of Korea was swept by the hot wind for national cooperation and the dynamic trend of independent reunification with the advent of the new century. All this was possible thanks to the President who enabled the Koreans to enshrine the three charters for national reunification as the mainstay for achieving national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whoever loves the country and is willing to contribute to the cause of reunification should remain true to the noble idea and will of the President for independent reunification and wholeheartedly uphold the instruction given by him for reunification irrespective of ideology and ideal.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Blasts Japan's Suppression of Chongryon\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 10 (KCNA) -- The Korean Central News Agency released a detailed report titled \"The Abe group will have to pay a dear price for its reckless suppression of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) on July 10 as regards Japan's moves to obliterate Chongryon, a dignified organization of overseas citizens of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its gist says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KCNA brands the Japanese authorities' outrageous actions against Chongryon and Koreans in Japan as an extremely grave provocation little short of a declaration of a war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The application made by the Resolution and Collection Corporation of Japan for a forced sale of the hall of the Headquarters of Chongryon was a product of premeditated and systematic plots of the Abe authorities to stamp out Chongryon and tide over their ruling crisis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said corporation bought bad bonds to the tune of 4004.1 billion yen by spending 353.3 billion yen from 1999 to 2005. This means that Japanese businesses and enterprises redeemed those bonds at such a low rate as 8.8 percent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The corporation, however, pressurized Chongryon to redeem 100 percent the debts of the hall of the Headquarters of Chongryon to it and add an annual interest of 5 percent to the payment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Abe at a press conference called on June 12 blustered that \"it was becoming evident that Chongryon was involved in abduction and other crimes\" and \"it became a target of investigation under the law on the prevention of subversive activities\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These reckless remarks revealed the intention of the prime minister to build up public opinion for inciting enmity and national chauvinism towards Chongryon and the Koreans in Japan and spearhead the brutal political terrorism intended to stamp out Chongryon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Abe group has become evermore undisguised in its moves to usurp not only the hall of the Headquarters of Chongryon but its Tokyo Metropolitan Headquarters, Osaka Prefectural Headquarters, Aichi Korean Middle and High School and other local headquarters of Chongryon and Korean schools. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The director of the Japan National Police Agency hurled policemen into such a wholesale repressive campaign as persecuting and arresting officials of Chongryon and Koreans in Japan and other actions though they are under the obligation to protect their rights and activities, raving that \"the police is tasked to implement the step for pressurizing north Korea\" and \"it is the job of the National Police Agency to force north Korea to come out for negotiations with Japan\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chongryon organizations and their officials and its related facilities have become the primary targets of this campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' reckless terrorism intended to paralyze the function of Chongryon have reached a graver phase since the outset of this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have worked hard to stifle Chongryon economically by lifting the measure to exempt the hall of the Headquarters of Chongryon and its facilities from taxes and, at the same time, openly infringed upon the business and vital rights of Koreans in commerce and other Koreans in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have obstructed the performing activities of the Kumgangsan Opera Troupe of Chongryon in every way, taking issue with and slandering those activities and disallowing the use of the hall. They are suppressing the democratic national education of Koreans in Japan and their freedom to travel to their homeland. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Yomiuri Shimbun\" and its weekly magazine \"Aera\" and other reptile media of Japan are busy with the false propaganda aimed at hurling mud at officials of the Central Standing Committee of Chongryon and Koreans in Japan on the basis of false \"testimonies\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As proven by the cases of women An Phil Hwa and To Chu Ji, the truth of which has been disclosed in recent years, Japan has persisted in its abduction of Koreans while loudly trumpeting about the \"abduction issue\", a leftover of the Cold War era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is preposterous for Japan to use the \"abduction issue\" as a pretext for suppressing Chongryon though it has remained the world's worst abductor since the days of its colonial rule over Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK-Japan relations have reached the most dangerous explosive point since the end of the Second World War due to the reckless anti-DPRK, anti-Chongryon moves of the Abe group. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the jungle logic for Japan to cry out for \"sanctions\" against the DPRK, doing harm to the Koreans in Japan, the victims of the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule, and their descendents, though it has not yet redressed its crime-woven past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This behavior of Japan is further straining the relations among states in the Asia-Pacific and posing great threat to peace and stability in the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is nothing but the death-bed frenzy of those in despair for the Abe group to go mad with the moves against the DPRK and Chongryon, bereft of reason. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will force the Abe group to pay a dear price for their moves to suppress and stamp out Chongryon.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
