Joining them, the mayor and many other people in the city have urged the U.S. Forces side and the South Korean puppet authorities to withdraw the unwarrantable demand and to completely revise the agreement on the use of the U.S. Air base in Kunsan.\r\n   The commentary says:\r\n   The anti-U.S. struggle of the Kunsan people, which has come when the U.S. crimes are increasing numerically, is an expression of strong protest against the U.S. aggressors, who have illegally occupied south korea and are engaged in plunder, an eruption of the South Korean people's pent-up anti-u.s. Sentiments and manifestation of their firm will and patriotic resolution to retake the dignity and sovereignty of the nation.\r\n   The United States is neither a \"friend\" nor \"protector\" of the South Korean people, nor any \"war deterrent\", but the ringleader of aggression and plunder.     \r\n     \r\n\r\n"
