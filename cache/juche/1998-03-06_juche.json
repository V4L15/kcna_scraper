Joining them, the mayor and many other people in the city have urged the U.S. Forces side and the South Korean puppet authorities to withdraw the unwarrantable demand and to completely revise the agreement on the use of the U.S. Air base in Kunsan.\r\n   The commentary says:\r\n   The anti-U.S. struggle of the Kunsan people, which has come when the U.S. crimes are increasing numerically, is an expression of strong protest against the U.S. aggressors, who have illegally occupied south korea and are engaged in plunder, an eruption of the South Korean people's pent-up anti-u.s. Sentiments and manifestation of their firm will and patriotic resolution to retake the dignity and sovereignty of the nation.\r\n   The United States is neither a \"friend\" nor \"protector\" of the South Korean people, nor any \"war deterrent\", but the ringleader of aggression and plunder.     \r\n     \r\n\r\n"

We will closely watch what the U.S. is doing.\r\n   The DPRK-U.S. framework agreement of October 1994 is a joint document for improvement of bilateral ties. It is a landmark that aims to put a period to the deep-rooted hostile relations of scores of years and move toward the normalisation of their ties.\r\n   Under the agreement, the U.S. is obliged to renounce its hostile policy through relaxation of embargo on the DPRK, provide two light-water reactors each with a million kw generating capacity to the DPRK by 2003 and supply heavy oil to the DPRK until that time in order to make up for the DPRK's electric power shortage, while the DPRK is obliged to freeze its independent nuclear facilities based on graphite moderated reactor.\r\n   We lost no time to freeze our independent nuclear power facilities we had built with colossal funds and labor. We are promoting the safe storage of spent fuel in the final stage. Thus, we have sincerely fulfilled our obligations under the agreement, which the u.s. Administration has officially confirmed.\r\n   This shows our sincere and responsible attitude and position to implement the framework agreement and improve the bilateral relations through confidence-building.\r\n   However, the U.S. fulfilment of its obligations is lagging behind our sincere efforts.\r\n   The U.S. has not taken substantial measures to ease its sanctions but made empty talk for years. And it has made little progress in the construction of light-water reactors under the pretext of internal problems within the KEDO such as sharing of funds, though it is more than two years since the LWR supply agreement was adopted.\r\n   We cannot but express deep concern over this insincere attitude of the U.S. toward the implementation of the framework agreement.\r\n   Now, our competent department demands that the DPRK no longer lend an ear to the empty promises of the U.S. Such as the easing of sanctions and construction of light-water reactors but do as it originally planned, because it does not make any sense to victimise our independent nuclear power industry continuously with hopes pinned on the light-water reactors that are not sure to come.\r\n   Nobody can predict what will happen unless the U.S. seeks new practical measures and takes decisive action to implement its obligations under the agreement as scheduled. \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
