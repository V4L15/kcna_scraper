This is an intolerable mockery and insult to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The best way for the U.S. to escape deadly blows of the DPRK is to exercise self-prudence and self-restraint, not encroaching upon the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will take multi-phased eventful measures for doubling its capabilities for nuclear attack to cope with the U.S. vicious hostile policy toward the DPRK aimed to dare threaten its sovereignty and right to existence, the statement warned."
