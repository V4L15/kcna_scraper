            "content": "Rodong Sinmun condena el intento de enfrentamiento de Lee Myung Bak\r\nPyongyang, 20 de febrero (ATCC) -- Recientemente, el traidor Lee Myung Bak sustituyo a los miembros del \"Consejo de Asesores de la Reunificacion\", entidad de consulta, por sus lacayos conservadores ultraderechistas.\n\t\t\t\t\t Por otra parte, bajo la instigacion del traidor Lee, el vicepresidente en jefe de la \"Sociedad Consultiva de la Democracia, la Paz y la Reunificacion\" y otros tipejos deambulan por todo el territorio surcoreano difundiendo sofismas provocativos de que el actual empeoramiento de las relaciones Norte-Sur es el producto de la supuesta \"tactica de abrir las puertas a Estados Unidos y cerrarlas al Sur de Corea\" y se debe a la \"situacion interna\" de alguien.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Al respecto, el diario Rodong Sinmun divulgo este viernes un comentario individual que sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La sustitucion del personal del \"Consejo de Asesores de la Reunificacion\" parte del siniestro intento del traidor Lee de mantener a toda costa su \"politica hacia el Norte\" rechazada en el interior y el exterior del pais y alcanzar sus metas criminales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Al convertir esa entidad en un antro de elementos conservadores ultraderechistas, el traidor Lee se burla y desafia frontalmente a toda la nacion coreana que desea el mejoramiento de las relaciones Norte-Sur, la reunificacion independiente, la paz y la prosperidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ademas, dejo en claro su voluntad de intensificar la campana de enfrentamiento fratricida apoyandose ese aparato anti-reunificacion, lejos de reparar las empeoradas relaciones con el Norte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El esta calculando que si moviliza a todos los maniacos de confrontacion, podra encubrir el crimen de sus compinches de haber llevado al fracaso las relaciones Norte-Sur, que se desarrollaban positivamente, calmar a la encolerizada opinion publica y alcanzar a toda costa su siniestra meta de atropellar a la RPDC al cabo de intensificar las acciones conflictivas con ella.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La banda de Lee debe saber bien que seran mas fuertes la protesta y la denuncia de los habitantes surcoreanos de diferentes sectores cada vez que fueran intensificadas las acciones conflictivas con la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La nacion coreana no estara con brazos cruzados ante tales maniobras demenciales de la horda de los traidores liderados por Lee Myung Bak y la castigara duro sin falta."
