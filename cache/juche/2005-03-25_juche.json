This is a very ill-boding  development predicting that the Asia-Pacific region may turn into a theater of confrontation and military conflicts over territorial issues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's \"defense of state interests\" is, in essence, nothing but a sophism to justify its ambition for territorial expansion. Its designs of territorial aggrandizement now becoming all the more outspoken is chiefly related to U.S. patronage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries who are driving the regional situation to a dangerous phase are a cancer-like existence and a source of trouble wrecking peace and security in Northeast Asia. Japan's claim to territories of other countries is an overture of a military conflict and its dispatch of troops to trouble spots is a prelude to continental aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation urges its surrounding countries to be awakened to its moves for territorial expansion and cope with them jointly. Japan is not entitled to participate in the six-party talks as it is seeking territorial aggrandizement and aggravating the situation around it while toeing the U.S. line. It is hard to promote a common development, not to speak of the guarantee of peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and the Asian region as a whole with Japan openly pursuing territorial expansion left alone    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun Thursday says this in a signed article. \r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. aid is one of its important means to implement the strategy for world supremacy. It is nothing but dangerous leverage to enslave other countries economically and politically in order to Americanize them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. claims that there is no need to aid any country if there is nothing to benefit from doing so, the interests and demands of the U.S. should strictly be respected and aid should be used as leverage to meet the U.S. strategic interests. This is the main aim and standard pursued by the U.S. in aid. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Accordingly, U.S. aid always has unacceptable conditionalities. The U.S. forces those countries that depend on or hope for its aid to change their political systems and follow the American political and economic style. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they fail to clearly see through the reactionary essence of the U.S. aid and accept it, they will come under the U.S. political and economic yoke, far from finding a solution to problems. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The developing countries should not be taken in by the U.S. claim that its aid helps other countries achieve socio-economic progress and settle problems but be vigilant against it. Any illusion and expectation for U.S. aid only invite subjugation and national ruin.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
