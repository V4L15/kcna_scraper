            "content": "CPRK Hits Out at S. Korea for Co-Sponsoring \"Resolution on Human Rights in North\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, December 6 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) released information bulletin No. 1016 Thursday. It denounced the south Korean authorities for co-sponsoring the \"resolution on human rights in the north\" which the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries and other anti-DPRK forces referred to at the third committee of the UN General Assembly.\n\t\t\t\t\t The information bulletin said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak group of traitors came out as a co-sponsor of the \"resolution on human rights in the north\" peppered with groundless invectives and provocative sophism against the DPRK, while chiming in with the anti-DPRK forces' \"human rights\" racket against it. This is an intolerable insult and another unpardonable politically-motivated provocation against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This act of treachery disclosed once again the group's true colors as ignoramus and die-hard confrontation maniac.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The human rights issue exists in south Korea, a colony of the U.S. ill-famed for the unpopular fascist rule.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The people's elementary political freedom and rights are harshly violated in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea is a dark land under fascism and a tundra of human rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is ridiculous and shameless, indeed, for such fascist group to have come out as a \"co-sponsor,\" pulling up the north over its non-existent human rights issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The human rights campaign kicked up by the group even in the international arena, not content with such ruckus inside south Korea, is aimed at tarnishing the dignified international image of the DPRK, justifying its despicable policy of confrontation with compatriots and creating hostile atmosphere towards it in a bid to realize international cooperation in the anti-DPRK campaign.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This will, however, bring to light its ugly nature as confrontation maniacs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group should look into south Korean society torn with distress due to its human rights abuses and acts of treachery before pulling up others and face judgment by history, the nation and people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will never pardon those talking about \"human rights\" and the like as part of the smear campaign against its dignified social system but sternly judge them."
