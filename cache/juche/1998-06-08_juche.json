Their attempt poses a grave threat to peace and security in Asia. \r\n   The manoeuvres is mainly aimed at the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. This is proved by the fact that the manoeuvres is participated in by the U.S. marine mobile strike force which will respond to the \"emergency\" on the Korean peninsula and more importance is attached to the Japanese \"self-defence forces\" and the South Korean puppet army in the planned manoeuvres. \r\n   The U.S. attempt to stifle the DPRK by allied force of arms and establish domination over the Korean peninsula is a daydream.     \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n"

In the situation the sixth-term Hanchongryon was successfully inaugurated with due ceremony and 127 universities and colleges re-entered into the organisation. \r\n   The credit is the South Korean students' confidence in the victory of the just cause of Hanchongryon.\r\n   The South Korean puppets' suppression goes only to add to the fighting spirit of Hanchongryon.    \r\n\r\n"

The buildings of the centres and checkup station are in the main preserved in the original state.\r\n   Girls at the age of 15 to 20 who were taken to the place on the excuse of \"introduction of jobs\" and \"women working volunteer corps\" were in the \"Phunghae pavilion\" and \"Unwol pavilion\", the comfort centres for the exclusive use of the navy.\r\n   The two comfort centres had 25 and 15 girls respectively.\r\n   The comfort women were called \"Haruko,\" \"Yoshiko,\" \"Kiyoko\" and other Japanese names, deprived of their Korean surnames and names and chances of going outside and having postal exchange.\r\n   According to the eye-witnesses, not a single day has passed without piercing cries of the girls who were forced to brutal sexual services.\r\n   Though they were suffering from undernourishment and tuberclosis caused by indescribable maltreatment and hunger, they had to offer sexual services to Japanese soldiers.\r\n   They often had to do so for 20 soldiers a day.\r\n   They were raped by the Japs in the base every day and by the sailers aboard the warships on Wednesdays and Sundays and in turn by the sailers in daytime and officers in the evening.\r\n   The Japs standing in a queue on the ground of the \"comfort centres\" were vying with one another for first place.\r\n   A comfort woman called Nam Chun Ja, unable to put up with the sexual slavery, tried to run away, but was tortured to death.\r\n   In those days the residents buried her corpse without the knowledge of the Japs after being thrown in a valley.\r\n   Her tomb still remains.\r\n   This is only the part of the crimes the Japanese imperialists committed against the \"comfort women\" in Korea.\r\n   Japan must pay dearly for its past crimes in any circumstances.\r\n   The Japanese imperialists reduced nearly 200,000 Korean women to sex slaves for the army.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"
