She owed this to the superior socialist public health system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Jang To Gyong, a department director of the Ministry of Public Health, had an interview with KCNA regarding this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Reporter: It is told that grandma Choe owes the secret of her long life to the socialist public health system under which the state takes care of the life and health of the people with responsibility. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Director: The government of the DPRK, which regards the lives and health of the people as the first and foremost object of protection by the state, promulgated a decision on enforcing the universal free medical care system unprecedented in the history of world public health on November 13, Juche 41 (1952) when the Fatherland Liberation War was in its height. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Socialist Constitution stipulates to receive the free medical care as one of the civic elementary rights and the government has taken all steps for the citizens to enjoy this right to the full. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Reporter: Would you elaborate upon the benefits of the universal free medical care system? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Director: A well-arranged medical service system has been established in all parts of the country, provinces, cities, counties and ris. Under the section doctor system, doctors call on inhabitants and do their best for the lives of patients. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the medical services are also free of charge in the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fees for medicines, vaccination and prosthetic appliances, to say nothing of medical examination and operation are also free. Working people go to and come back from sanatoriums and undergo medical treatment there for scores of days at the expenses of the government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In particular, the working women have the maternity leave at the state expense on top of the paid regular and supplementary leaves. The state also provides them with the maternity allowances tantamount to 100 percent of the monthly salary, food and stabilized living conditions irrespective of the length of service. When they are hospitalized to the Pyongyang Maternity Hospital, they are benefited 10 times their monthly salary free of charge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Each hospital has a department for the regular medical examination and treatment of the aged. Thanks to this, 100-year macrobians are ever growing in number.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is only the DPRK's military muscle built up under the banner of Songun on which the Korean nation can depend in this struggle. The DPRK's military strength means that of the whole Korean nation. The DPRK's military strength plays a sacred role in protecting the whole Korean nation from the foreign forces' aggression and ensuring peace on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Songun proves truth that an army guarantees peace. It is the idea which runs through the Songun policy that the army of Songun guarantees peace on the Korean Peninsula and security of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a matter of fact, but for the Songun policy of the DPRK which binds the U.S. hand and foot a war would have broken out on this land a hundred times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today Songun means independence, peace and the greatest national pride for the Korean nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is keen to supply its allies with military products under the spurious name of \"collective security\" and thus keep them dependent upon the U.S.-made weaponry. By doing so, it seeks to interfere in the situation in the hotspots of the world and put them under its control through arms sale and contain and prevail over its \"strategic rivals\" through the sale of military products to other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Prompted by this ambition, the U.S. makes no scruple of manufacturing the internationally banned WMD. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is unreasonably putting pressure and international sanctions on other countries under the pretext of \"opposing\" the production of WMD but it is, in reality, the U.S. which has the world's biggest arsenal of WMD and is unhesitatingly using those weapons in wars of aggression against humankind. The U.S. imperialists are the heinous criminals using WMD for achieving their aggressive and hegemonic purpose without hesitation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With no artifice can the U.S. cover up its true colors as the arch criminal stepping up international arms race and the spread of WMD.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Bajo la mascara de la \"seguridad colectiva\", EE.UU. ofrece los pertrechos de guerra a sus aliados para mantener asi el apoyo de estos en los armamentos suyos y al tomar por palanca la venta de los materiales belicos se propone manejar y controlar la situacion de las regiones litigiosas del mundo y mantener a raya a los \"adversarios estrategicos\" mediante la venta de los materiales belicos al exterior. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Con tal ambicion agresiva el imperio no se vacila en producir armas de exterminio masivo prohibidas internacionalmente. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  So pretexto de \"oponerse\" a la produccion de armas de exterminio masivo ejerce presion injusta sobre otros paises o toma las medidas de sancion internacional contra estos. Pero, de hecho posee el mayor numero de armas en cuestion en el mundo y las usa sin vacilacion en la guerra de agresion contra la humanidad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Los imperialistas yanquis son perversos criminales que utilizan sin escrupulo las armas de extermino masivo para la realizacion de su objetivo agresivo y dominacionista. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Con ninguna artimana EE.UU. podra encubrir su naturaleza de promotor de la carrera armamentista internacional y proliferador de las armas de exterminio masivo.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
