Kim Jong Il visits island-defending unit\r\nPyongyang, June 24 (KCNA) - Secretary Kim Jong Il, Chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission and Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army (KPA), inspected an island-defending unit of KPA Unit No. 1106 on Monday.\r\n   He was accompanied by staff members of the KPA Supreme Command.\r\n   At 09:30 he arrived at the island, when soldiers welcomed him with a storm of cheers and shouts \"human bombs\" and \"devoted defence.\"\r\n   He was met by the unit's commanding officers.\r\n   After receiving a salute from the unit's commander, he looked round a monument to  President Kim Il Sung's on-the-spot guidance. The President had visited the island-defending unit on November 5, 1976, given the unit detailed tasks and taken warm care of the life of soldiers and officers' families.\r\n   Secretary Kim Jong Il said every military post in Korea is associated with the President's noble efforts for Juche-based army building. The President's exploits are recorded in the proud history of the KPA building, he added. \r\n   He expressed great satisfaction and highly praised the unit's soldiers for having turned the island into an impregnable fortress as wished by the President.\r\n   He said the unit's soldiers have grown to be matchless combatants as they tried hard, ready to share weal and woe with their Party, leader and socialist motherland. \r\nNo force on earth can match the strength of the KPA, which is intensely loyal to its Party and leader, he added.\r\n   He gave the unit important tasks to strengthen its fighting efficiency, saying that it has a very important mission to defend the gate of the motherland.\r\n   While seeing soldiers in firing-posture training, he noted with great satisfaction that every soldier of the KPA has grown to be a match for a hundred foes.\r\n   He inspected a bedroom, a dining hall, a daily provision storage, an education room and other places to learn the food and bed conditions, entertainment, water service and families' living conditions. He did great favors for the soldiers on the island, saying that they should be provided with best conditions.\r\n   He gave the unit a machine gun, an automatic rifle and a pair of binoculars as gifts.\r\n   He had a picture taken with the unit's soldiers and families. \r\n \r\n"

This false report was also carried by the Japanese Asahi Shimbun.\r\n   This is a groundless slander at the socialist system and realities of the DPRK. \r\n   So, we categorically denounce their false propaganda.\r\n   The clamour about \"shack houses\" is nothing but a false propaganda faked up by the south Korean puppets in a bid to impair the image of the DPRK. It is because there cannot exist such a camp in our country.\r\n   Our people are living a happy life at modern dwelling houses under the tested leadership and benevolent care of the Workers' Party of Korea. in Nampho, a port city, stand rows of high-storied apartment houses. Our people have no worry about housing.\r\n   This notwithstanding, the south Korean puppets are vociferating about \"shack houses\" in the suburbs of Nampho. \r\nThis groundless rumour is a fake up by the puppet ANSP, a trickster against the DPRK.  We cannot overlook their clamourings about \"concentration camp\".\r\n   It is well known a fact that there is no political prisoner in the DPRK which is administering benevolent politics. Needless to say, \"concentration camps for political prisoners\" cannot exist in the place where there is no \"political prisoner\".\r\n   As a matter of fact, the south Korean puppets have no face to vociferate about \"concentration camps and shack houses\".\r\n   South Korea ranks first in the world in the number of prisons for political prisoners and shack houses.\r\n   It has more than 40 prisons and detention houses in which over 63,000 innocent people are being subjected to political persecution.\r\n   There are more than 500 slums in Seoul, Pusan, Taegu, Inchon and other areas of south Korea, in which 1.4 million people live in vinyl houses and dugouts.\r\n   It is ridiculous of the south Korean puppets to spread a false report about \"shack houses\" and \"concentration camp\", turning a blind eye to this stark reality.\r\n   The point at issue is what the \"ANSP\" seeks in such a third-rate anti-DPRK smear campaign.\r\n   Lurking behind it is the foolish design to bridge over the ruling crisis of Kim Young Sam's \"civilian\"-veiled regime whose days are numbered.\r\n   Their clamourings about \"shack houses\" and \"concentration camp\" are intended to escape from the present ruling crisis and divert elsewhere the attention of the political camp and people.\r\n   Their attempts are, indeed, the height of shamelessness.\r\n   We will on all accounts make the \"ANSP\" of south Korea pay for all their anti-DPRK smear campaigns including \"drug case\", \"case of counterfeit bank notes\", \"black-market dealings of dollars\" and the \"shack-like concentration camp for political prisoners\". \r\n\r\n"
