But it is the \"ANSP\" itself that engages in espionage activities.\r\n   \"ANSP\" agents failed to buy secret information from a Russian army officer in July 1993 and were arrested in an attempt to get Russia's nuclear technology last year.\r\n   The \"ANSP\" has conducted espionage activities in crafty ways in the Central Asian Region, too.\r\n   It has also collected dishonest people in various Asian countries for criminal activities against the DPRK.\r\n   Its agents are active also in major military and industrial establishments in the far east and other areas of Russia.\r\n   The United States, too, is a target of its activities. In September 1996 Pak Tong Il, a naval attache of the South Korean puppet embassy in the United States, was arrested while trying to collect U.S. naval secrets.\r\n   The facts require all countries and people to heighten vigilance against the intensified espionage activities of the \"ANSP\" in the world. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is, in essence, the continuation of the suppression of \"Jongyojo.\"\r\n   \"Jongyojo\" was inaugurated in 1989, the fighting goal of which is to win the right of teachers to organisation and \"conduct a genuine education for the nation, democracy and humanity.\"\r\n   The fascists of the \"Sixth Republic\" suspended the qualifications of more than 1,500 teachers who were hardcore members of \"Jongyojo\" in a bid to destroy the organisation.\r\n   The \"people's government's\" demand is as good as that of the preceding rulers for breaking with \"Jongyojo.\"\r\n   By expressing its willingness to keep from being reinstated the \"Jongyojo\"-lining teachers who had participated in a movement for democracy in society and campus the \"people's government\" betrayed its ulterior intention to destroy \"Jongyojo.\" \r\n\r\n"

We expect that all the religious organizations and believers of the south that love justice and sincerely want national reconciliation, unity and reunification will join in the efforts for the successful festival. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

She is Hwang Jong Sun, 49, who is living in Tonghungsan district, Hamhung.\r\n   Jong Sun was crippled from malnutrition and infantile spinal tuberculosis while  in Japan in the past. She was bereft of her mother at the age of six and repatriated to the socialist homeland with her aged father at the age of 14. \r\n   After her father died of geriatric disease later, she had no people to look after her. \r\n   She received treatment in hospital for scores of years under the free medical care.    \r\n   And neighbouring people helped her much. Among them is a woman who devoted her sincerity to Jong Sun for nearly 20 years. She is Kim Kwi In, 55, who is working at a kindergarten in Tonghungsan district.\r\n   When she was taken to a hospital in January 1980, she was acquainted with Jong Sun, a girl in her thirties, in the same room. She looked after Jong Sun as her own flesh and blood while in the hospital. When she was released from the hospital a month after, she could hardly leave Jong Sun, choked with tears, behind her.  This determined her to attend the unhappy girl  all her life. She took the girl to her home and lived together. \r\n   Since then, she always served Jong Sn as a nurse, practical nurse and cook while continuing her job. She learned a manual treatment and cauterized the skin of Jong Sun with moxa as dictated by a doctor. She took  vacations to climb up and down  mountains and cross fields in local areas, making long journeys, pick up 100 kinds of flowers and make medicines. She catched  even wild crows. \r\nShe shed tears inwardly and  underwent sufferings. \r\n   In fact, she was faced with many personal problems  when she lost her husband five years after her marriage. But she found human beauty and fragrance of life in her infinite devotion to a comrade.\r\n   At last her laudable sincerity set Jong Sun on her feet more than 40 years after. Jong Sun is now working as a medical worker at the South Hamgyong Provincial People's Hospital.\r\n   Underlying the miracle is the disinterested sincerity of medical workers of the provincial people's hospital, officials in the city and people in neighbourhood unit.\r\n   The  rare-to-be-seen  fact offers a glimpes of the features of Korean society in which all the members have formed a large harmonious family, helping and leading each other forward.\r\n   General Secretary Kim Jong Il showed high appreciation for the beautiful deed of Kim Kwi In and put political trust in her. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
