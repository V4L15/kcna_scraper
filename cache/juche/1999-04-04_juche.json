Speakers highly praised General Secretary Kim Jong Il as a iron-willed commander, who is brilliantly carrying forward the cause of Juche-oriented army building pioneered by the President Kim Il Sung and strengthening the Korean People's Army into revolutionary armed forces, each  being a match for a hundred foes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They said that Kim Jong Il is a famous commander  who has strengthened the KPA into an invincible army with outstanding military wisdom, strategy, iron  will and courage.   Those watchers of the U.S. Defense Department said the \"North Korean leadership is characterized firstly by its correct  judgement, secondly by its strong determination and thirdly by its merciless attack.

Only Japan still does not admit it.   Former prime minister of Japan Tomiichi Murayama, a social democratic member of the house of representatives stressed that improving the relations between Japan and the DPRK is related to peace in Asia, and this belongs to Japan's responsibility. \r\n\r\n"

Recalling the contention inside the United States that this is almost infeasible and  it is hard to expect any effect and its implementation should be considered, the paper  in a signed commentary observes this is indicative of the widespread notion  in the U.S. that its move to establish the systems is anachronistic. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States is underscoring the need to build the \"NMD\" system and \"TMD\" system on the pretext of protecting itself and its allies from the \"missile threat\" from somebody, the commentary notes, adding:&nbsp;This is intended to secure its military edge in East Asia and other parts of the world and meet its hegemonic ambition for global domination.    The U.S. talk about \"missile threat\" from somebody is nothing but a trite subterfuge to justify its criminal move to build systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Underlying the assertion of former U.S. defense secretary Perry that the projected \"TMD\" system would not be productive is his wish to see the caution and concern of big powers about the U.S.  allayed. But this, in fact. Constitutes an admission of the unfeasibility of the systems.    The United States is well advised to face the reality and behave properly. The anachronistic and hegemonic move to establish the systems will bring nothing good to the United States. \r\n \r\n"

The struggle of workers and other people sweeping all parts of South Korea is an expression of their fixed will to win  genuine rights to work and existence through a united struggle, not being taken in by the deceptive trick of the authorities who pretend to work for \"people.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their struggle for democracy and the right to existence is a very just one which is an exercise of their inviolable right.   Nevertheless, the South Korean authorities are threatening to crack down upon the struggle, branding it as \"illegal.\"   This shows that they are a group of murderers.   Water is bound to take its course and one's crime rebounds itself upon him.   The South Korean authorities are well advised to stop such foolish acts as trying to calm down the anger of people at the point of bayonet, clearly seeing the trend of the times. \r\n\r\n"

This is a question put by Rodong Sinmun in a signed article today.   The author of the article says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Japan is faced with the most serious crisis after World War II.   So, it is getting frantic in its moves to find a way out of their crisis in invading other countries.   What it seeks in this is to extricate itself from the crisis of economic bankruptcy, create an international climate for new \"prosperity\" and, furthermore, become a \"world empire.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Urged by an ulterior desire to make an overseas invasion, Japan is these days trying to designate \"Hinomaru\" as the national flag and \"Kimigayo\" as the national anthem and applying itself to implementing the updated \"guidelines for Japan-U.S. defense cooperation\" allegedly to cope with \"emergencies in the areas surrounding Japan.\"   What is noteworthy is the fact that the Japanese reactionaries are putting spurs to their scheme to possess the capacity for long-distance transport and mid-air refueling and introduce spy satellites. Japan is now crying that this is a measure taken for the \"preservation of peace\" and \"emergency aid\" but the reality is quite opposite.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese militarist's overseas invasion, which is now going beyond the danger line, is a matter of time.   If Japan chooses overseas invasion at historic crossroads, it will result in its second defeat and self-destruction.   Japan had better make a correct choice with proper reason if it wants not to be buried in oblivion of history forever. \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n"

The condition of the unconverted people who settled down in the \"house of meeting\" in Kwanak district, Seoul,  after being released from prison at the end of long prison terms has become more difficult because a woman, their helper, was laid up with sickness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Though they were set free, they live in misery, their human rights violated by the fascist \"Law on Supervision for Public Peace.\"   Particularly, old men of the DPRK origin who have no blood relations in South Korea and those who have family members in the north lead a very miserable life.   If any mishap befalls them,  the South Korean authorities  will have to bear full responsibility for all consequences. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Myohyang Transit Marine Transport Company on maritime accident\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- A DPRK trade cargo vessel \"Manphok\" collided on March 31 with \"Hyundai Duke\", a trade cargo vessel of the \"Hyundai group\" of South Korea, in the open sea 420 miles away from Colombo port in Sri Lanka, while it was sailing to Colombo port via Singapore from Jakarta port in Indonesia.    In this connection, the spokesman of the DPRK Myohyang Transit Marine Transport Company issued a press statement today.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The statement says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this accident, the \"Manphok\" sank and 37 of the 39 crewmen aboard the vessel are missing.  The collision is the first of its kind between civil vessels of the north and the south.   When the vessels collided, 2 crewmen of the \"Manphok\" were narrowly rescued and boarded the \"Hyundai Duke\".   In this regard, we took  measures to immediately dispatch resident officials of our company in Singapore to Colombo to learn about the circumstances of the accident, and bring the 2 crewmen back to the motherland after comforting them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   When our company representatives reached the \"Hyundai Duke\", 3 persons including 2 secretaries of the South Korean embassy were already on board their vessel and hindered the northern  officials from getting aboard the vessel to meet our 2 crewmen. The South Koreans even forcibly drew our crewmen from the deck into the inside of the vessel.   By the accident, we lost dozens of invaluable crewmen and our cargo vessel sank while the \"Hyundai\" side has no human and material loss except for insignificant scratch on the vessel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Nonetheless, the rumour is afloat in South Korea that the southern vessel gave \"alarm whistles\" but the northern vessel \"ignored\" them, resulting in the accident. Some news reports unilaterally distort the fact, talking as if the north side were to blame for the accident.   This cannot be construed otherwise than a premeditated and deliberate plot of the South Korean authorities to conceal the truth, mislead public opinion and abuse the tragic maritime accident for north-south confrontation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As a matter of fact, the \"Manphok\" left Singapore port at 20:00 March 26 and its speed is 11 knots while the \"Hyundai Duke\" left the same port at 22:20 March 29 and took the same course at the speed of 26.2 knots. This proves that the \"Hyundai Duke\" chased after our vessel.   As a result of the collision, the \"Hyundai Duke\" suffered small scratch on its port bow while the \"Manphok\" sank on the spot. This is indisputably patent proof that shows which is the offender and which is the victim.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Since the accident happened between civil vessels of the north and the south, we consider it to be most reasonable that the problem should be resolved smoothly by the parties concerned of the two sides from a compatriotic and humanitarian stand without the interference of authorities,  a third country or a third party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
