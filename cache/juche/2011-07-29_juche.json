            "content": "DPRK to Start Legal Disposal of S. Side's Real Estates in Mt. Kumgang Resort\r\n Pyongyang, July 29 (KCNA) -- The Guidance Bureau of Special Zone for International Tour of Mt. Kumgang of the DPRK released the following report now that it has become impossible to hold negotiations with the south side's businessmen due to the south Korean authorities' unjust obstructions. The DPRK set July 29 as a deadline for holding the negotiations.\n\t\t\t\t\t As already opened to public, the DPRK promulgated a law on special zone for international tour of Mt. Kumgang of the DPRK following three-year suspension of the tour of the mountain due to the south Korean authorities. Then it took measures allowing the south Korean businesses to register their businesses and properties again and make up their minds either to take part in international tour or adjust their properties. The DPRK also provided several opportunities for them to hold negotiations with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This was an expression of sincerity and magnanimity as it was a measure taken as compatriots to protect the property right and interests of the south side's businesses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities, however, obstructed the negotiations between the DPRK and the south side's NGO business groups for the adjustment of properties. A few days ago, they proposed north-south authorities' working talks in a bid to totally elbow out NGOs from the negotiations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK side conveyed its stand that it can hold authorities' working talks on condition that the south side brings NGO groups to the Mt. Kumgang resort and start adjusting properties even though it was well aware of the ulterior aim sought by it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities, however, misled public opinion for no good reason, saying that the DPRK rejected the north-south authorities' working talks. They neither sent NGO groups nor showed up themselves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This proves that the \"protection of property right\" of the south side's businesses touted by the south Korean authorities are empty talks and the proposed authorities' working talks are nothing but a trick to block the adjustment of properties and scotch international tour and the south Koreans' resumption of tour of Mt. Kumgang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK side notified the south side that it would start the legal disposal of the south side's properties according to its law unless the south side responds to the negotiations for the adjustment of the properties by July 29.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that it has become impossible to hold negotiations due to the unreasonable obstructions of the puppet group, the Guidance Bureau declares that it would start the legal disposal of all the real estates and other properties of the south side inside the special zone for international tour of Mt. Kumgang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK notified Hyundai of this decision at Mt. Kumgang resort so that it can be conveyed to the south side's businesses. It also informed the south Korean authorities of the decision through a Panmunjom channel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The period of undergoing the procedures for the legal disposal of the south side's businesses' properties is three weeks and those concerned of the south side are obliged to witness the proceedings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The disposal period can be extended if necessary so as to offer the south side's businesses the opportunities of taking part in international tour or leasing, transferring and selling their properties.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those businesses whose entry into Mt. Kumgang resort is difficult due to the authorities' obstruction can entrust the matter to a third party. They can meet the DPRK side in a third place for the registration and disposal of their properties or can choose other ways.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those businesses which failed to take part in the legal disposal of the properties within three weeks shall be considered as having given up their property right and their properties shall be disposed of according to the law on special zone for international tour of Mt. Kumgang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those real estates shall be used for international tour after going through necessary procedures.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The responsibility for the prevailing situation entirely rests with the south Korean authorities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These measures taken by the DPRK fully conform with the DPRK law and the international usage and therefore, the south side has no right to appeal against them."

He was the first to disclose the defoliant burial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to his testimony, trucks of a U.S. air force unit carried drums containing defoliant and other unknown chemical substances to the Waegwan base two or three times per a week in six months by the end of 1978 after defoliant in the base was buried. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whenever the trucks arrived, the U.S. troops in Waegwan guided them to the place where they buried defoliant for the first time. Then they unloaded the drums of defoliant and buried them with bulldozers, and the number of drums amounted to hundreds in all.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Early next year when this area was covered with snow and water, there floated in the water yellow and brown bubbles.

En virtud de esa ley, demandamos a los empresarios surcoreanos registrar de nuevo sus negocios y propiedades y participar en el turismo internacional o ajustar sus bienes inmuebles y les ofrecimos varias veces la oportunidad de negociar con nuestra parte. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Esta medida fraternal para proteger el derecho sobre propiedades y los intereses de las empresas surcoreanas es una muestra de sinceridad y magnanimidad de nuestra parte. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Sin embargo, las autoridades surcoreanas obstaculizaron hasta el final las negociaciones con los empresarios civiles surcoreanos para el ajuste de los bienes, y hace pocos dias, propusieron las conversaciones de trabajo entre las autoridades Norte-Sur con el fin de excluir de las negociaciones a los empresarios civiles. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Nuestra parte notifico la posicion de aceptarlas a condicion de que las autoridades surcoreanas acudan junto con los empresarios civiles para el ajuste de bienes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　No obstante, las autoridades surcoreanas inducen en error la opinion publica diciendo que nuestra parte nego las conversaciones de trabajo entre autoridades y hasta ahora a punto de vencer la fecha limite, que hemos definido y avisado a ellas, no vienen a negociar ni envian a los empresarios surcoreanos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　El hecho muestra que la \"proteccion del derecho sobre las propiedades\" de que hablaban las autoridades surcoreanas es una palabra vana y que su iniciativa de las conversaciones de trabajo entre autoridades no pasa de ser una artimana para impedir el ajuste de bienes y frustrar el turismo internacional y la reanudacion del turismo auspiciado por la parte Sur. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ya hemos declarado que si la parte Sur no acepta hasta el 29 de julio las negociaciones para el ajuste de bienes, nos veremos obligados a la disposicion legal de los bienes de la parte surena, en virtud de la ley de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Por lo tanto, la Direccion de la Zona Especial del Turismo Internacional al Monte Kumgang declara que desde hoy, pasara a la disposicion legal de todos los bienes inmuebles y otras propiedades de la parte Sur en esta zona. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Hemos transmitido hoy desde el monte Kumgang la resolucion sobre el respecto a las empresas surcoreanas correspondientes, por conducto del Grupo Hyundai, y lo hicimos tambien a las autoridades surcoreanas por via de Phanmunjom. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　El tiempo de tramitacion de tal disposicion legal es de 3 semanas en que los interesados surcoreanos deben asistir a este proceso. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Para ofrecerles la oportunidad de optar por participar en el turismo internacional, alquilar, traspasar o vender, prolongaremos, si es necesario, la moratoria de disposicion legal. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Los empresarios, que tienen dificultades para  viajar al monte Kumgang por la obstruccion de las autoridades, pueden encomendar el ajuste de bienes a una tercera persona, contactarse con nuestra parte en un tercer lugar para discutir el problema de registro y disposicion o usar otros metodos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　En el caso de las empresas que no asistan a la disposicion legal dentro de tres semanas, lo tomaremos como la renuncia total al derecho sobre sus propiedades en el monte Kumgang y las dispondremos en estricto apego a la ley de la zona especial del turismo internacional al mismo monte. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Los bienes inmuebles dispuestos legalmente se utilizaran en el turismo internacional segun el procedimiento legal de nuestra parte. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　La responsabilidad de esta situacion recae enteramente sobre las autoridades surcoreanas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　La presente medida de la RPDC conviene completamente a la ley de la RPDC y a las costumbres internacionales, por lo tanto, la parte Sur no puede apelar mas sobre ella."
