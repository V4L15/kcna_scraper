Paektu, they introduced in detail the advantages and invincible might of Korean-style socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The chairman of the Addis Ababa Youth Association of Ethiopia said at the reading session that the DPRK could emerge victorious in the stand-off with the U.S. styling itself the world's \"only superpower\" as it holds Kim Jong Il in high esteem as supreme commander of the KPA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The participants of the film show watched Korean film \"The Korean People's Army, Steel-like Ranks\".    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean Authorities' Yielding to U.S. Pressure to Spend More for U.S. Forces Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, December 14 (KCNA) -- The south Korean authorities recently yielded to the U.S. pressure to spend more fund for the upkeep of the U.S. forces in south Korea. A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland in a statement Thursday dismissed this as an unpardonable treacherous act that can be committed only by those preoccupied with flunkeyism and submission to the U.S. in utter disregard of the dignity and the interests of the nation.\r\n At the recent \"negotiations\" the U.S. glaringly revealed its ambition to continue using south Korea as its military base and step up its preparations for the invasion of the DPRK though it claimed that it will reduce its troops in south Korea and has no intention to invade the north, the statement said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities oft-repeated \"self-reliant national defence\" and \"south-north cooperation\". But their recent behavior clearly proved that they are no more than colonial stooges keen to prolong their dirty remaining days by clinging to the coattail of their American master and a group of traitors conspiring with outsiders in the moves for a war of aggression against the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have so far offered a fabulous amount of fund to the U.S. As if it were not enough with this, they continue spending a ridiculous amount of money collected from the people as taxes for the upkeep of the U.S. forces, utterly indifferent to their destitution. This is foolish drain on resources for Uncle Sam. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and the south Korean authorities should face up to the trend of the June 15 era demanding the withdrawal of the U.S. forces from south Korea, retract their agreement on increasing south Korea's share of the upkeep of the U.S. forces and opt for the pullback of all of them from south Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "\"Human Rights Judge\" Should Be Brought to Dock \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, December 14 (KCNA) -- The United States is making a hullabaloo in the international political arena while styling itself a \"human rights judge\".\r\n The U.S. makes public \"human rights report\" every year to label other countries as \"human rights graveyard\" and to impose American style \"human rights\" on them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"human rights situation\" of the DPRK on its lips glaringly shows black-hearted intention of the \"human rights judge\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK government has established and consistently developed the man-centered socialist system on the basis of the conception and standard of the human rights, independent rights of the social being. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Therefore, the people of the DPRK are enjoying an independent and creative life, evenly provided by law with all rights of social being such as political freedom and rights, right to labor and rest and the right to free education and free medical care. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the contrary, the United States, which is loudly talking about \"welfare for all people\" and \"material civilization\", witnessed 37 million people below the poverty line and 2.2 million prisoners, record high in history as of the end of the last year. In one week of October this year, over 320,000 people were kicked out of job. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is natural in the United States where only the human rights of the big monopolists, 0.02 percent of the population, are recognized and defended that \"the rich get ever richer and poor ever poorer\" and crimes are ever growing as the days go by. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nearly 60 years have passed since the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted in December 1948. But the U.S. is making no scruple of committing such thrice-cursed human rights violations as unscrupulous aggression upon other sovereign states and massacre of innocent people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality discloses in all nakedness that the \"human rights\" offensive of the U.S. against the anti-imperialist and independent countries is nothing but to make a pretext for invasion, pressure and interference and the mastermind who should be brought to the dock of human rights court is none other than the U.S., the world's arch criminal of human rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be advised to throw off the cloak of the \"human rights judge\" and immediately give up the interference in other's internal affairs.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

We wanted to live a worthwhile life for the motherland and people\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They said this after they were rescued after 94 hours. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These simple and short words reflect the revolutionary soldier spirit, the noble spiritual world of the Korean people who regard as the most sacred deed to devote themselves to the development and prosperity of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the period when the country was undergoing difficulties, servicepersons of the Korean People's Army performed heroic feats in socialist construction, saying that they would take in charge of the defence of the country and socialist construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With a firm determination not to see the blue sky of the country before carrying out the order given by the Supreme Commander, they built the gigantic Anbyon Youth Power Station and many other objects for the affluent and happy life of the people, overcoming difficulties beyond human imagination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary soldier spirit is the ideological and moral source of the Korean people striving for the prosperity of the country.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
