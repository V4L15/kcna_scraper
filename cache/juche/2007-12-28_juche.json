It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The institution of the Socialist Constitution made it possible to codify the great successes achieved by the Workers' Party of Korea and the people of the DPRK in the revolution and construction and provided a firm guarantee for developing the state and social system of the DPRK and dynamically pushing forward socialist construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea of the President on building the Juche-oriented state and the feats performed by him in doing so have been firmly adhered to and brilliantly inherited thanks to the Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il made sure that the Socialist Constitution was revised and supplemented and renamed Kim Il Sung Constitution as required by the new era of the Songun revolution at the 1st Session of the 10th Supreme People's Assembly held in Sept. Juche 87 (1998). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That was the demonstration of his firm will to glorify the DPRK as the country of the President forever. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The promulgation of Kim Il Sung Constitution helped the people of the DPRK to fully apply the idea and exploits of the President in all fields of the revolution and construction including the politics, military affairs, the economy and culture and state activities and strengthen the function and role of the DPRK government in every way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il saw to it that Kim Il Sung is held in high esteem as the eternal president of the DPRK and all work of the revolution and construction is orientated to successfully materializing the intention and the cause of the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to his distinguished leadership socialism in the DPRK has made steady victorious progress full of vitality as socialism centered on the people century after century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson in an editorial calls on all the people to fully embody Kim Il Sung Constitution in all spheres of the revolution and construction and thus strikingly demonstrate once again the dignity and might of Songun Korea to the whole world.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It ended with adopting several documents. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The member nations of the MERCOSUR held a summit at which they agreed to call on the regional countries to widely use their national currencies instead of U.S. dollar in trade. They reorganized the South American Community, an organization for regional cooperation whose ultimate aim is to realize the integration of South America, into the South American Union and set up its permanent secretariat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year also witnessed an intensified positive movement of the Latin-American countries to counter by concerted efforts the U.S. move to found the \"American Free Trade Zone\" intended to establish domination over economy and trade. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-mentioned movements eloquently prove that the activities of the developing countries to settle the issues arising in the struggle to build a new society and achieve regional stability and development by concerted efforts have gained in scope and strength, making big progress this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Progress made in the efforts to achieve regional integration, stability and development this year is a clear indication of the trend of the times toward global independence.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Paektu and the tempest of the arduous revolution, thus giving a steady continuity to the revolution so that revolutionary cause of Juche started by Kim Il Sung can be accomplished. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He called on all Koreans in Japan to turn out as one to implement the resolution adopted at the 21st Congress of Chongryon and thus win sure victory in the movement of Koreans in Japan in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the end of the lecture the participants watched the Korean film \"Comrade Kim Jong Suk, Great Communist Revolutionary Fighter and Woman Commander of Mt.
