It was thanks to his wise leadership that the line of building a rich and powerful country, independent in politics, self-supporting in economy and self-reliant in defence, has been firmly upheld generation after generation and the Workers' Party of Korea has developed into a party transparent in the faith in independence and the Korean people have displayed their dignity as a people with strong national self-respect. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Born as the son of guerrillas in Mt. Paektu, he grew up with arms.

Paektu and the DPRK has turned into an impregnable fortress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He has made endless journeys for Songun leadership, the road of his patriotic dedication, guided by his noble view on the future that one should live for tomorrow, not for today. It was against this backdrop that the revolutionary soldier spirit and the Kanggye spirit were created, the torch of Ranam and the torch of Songgang kindled and an epochal phase was provided for the building of a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We have the foundation solid enough to reach a new eminence of grandeur and prosperity and a national power strong enough to settle by ourselves any issue arising in defending the socialist country and building an economic power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our dignified socialist country is the most precious gain of the Korean revolution and a cradle of eternal happiness. The highly dignified Songun Korea throwing its bright rays all over the world guarantees the immense pride and honor of the Korean people and the prosperity of the generations to come. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A country and nation can never protect and glorify their honor and dignity automatically. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Party members, servicepersons and people should wage a dynamic struggle to give fuller play to the might of an ideological and military power and effect a great turn in building an economic power, cherishing deep in mind the great pride and self-confidence of living and making revolution in Songun Korea which is displaying its dignity as a powerful socialist nation of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An editorial of Minju Joson notes that definite is the triumphant advance of the cause of building a great prosperous powerful nation and invincible is the revolutionary cause of Juche as they are led by Kim Jong Il.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
