            "content": "Minju Joson denuncia posicion contradictoria de EE.UU.\r\nPyongyang, 2 de enero (ATCC) -- En un comentario individual publicado hoy, el periodico Minju Joson revela la posicion contradictoria de Estados Unidos que usa la pauta de doble rasero en el trato del problema nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\tAl publicar recientemente su informe intermedio, el comite del Congreso norteamericano sobre la disposicion estrategica de EE.UU. acuso a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea e Iran senalando que debido a la \"ambicion nuclear\" de estos paises, se reportan uno tras otro los casos de proliferacion nuclear abriendo las posibilidades de que caigan en manos de los grupos terroristas las armas nucleares, comienza el comentarista y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor lo tanto, -continua ese documento- EE.UU. debe perseguir la estrategia de no proliferacion nuclear de alcance global y mantener una confiable y segura arma nuclear capaz de disuadir no solo a los paises hostiles sino tambien a los aliados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn contraste con este informe, ultimamente, EE.UU. intenta firmar el convenio nuclear con algunos paises del Medio Oriente. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste hecho demuestra que no hay una pauta fija y correcta en la politica nuclear norteamericana que se altera facilmente segun los paises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon esta injusta politica esta relacionado directa e indirectamente el problema nuclear surgido hoy en la arena internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnteriormente, EE.UU. amenazo gravemente con armas nucleares a la RPDC y otros Estados sin estos artefactos, aparte de las provocaciones militares, aunque habia prometido lo contrario. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tParadojicamente, vino ayudando activamente el armamentismo nuclear de sus satelites despreciando la ley internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUn buen ejemplo de ello es Israel, que segun estimaciones, tiene ahora casi 200 armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto es lo que hizo EE.UU. diciendo tanto que rechaza la proliferacion nuclear. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste imperio maneja el problema nuclear partiendo de sus intereses estrategicos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta actitud parcial de EE.UU., que no valora con la misma pauta el problema nuclear de varios paises del mundo, esta complicando este asunto.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. no podra liberarse de ninguna manera de la responsabilidad por la proliferacion nuclear."
