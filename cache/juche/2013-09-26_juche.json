It is also becoming so crafty as to conduct a hypocritical farce of \"expressing consolation to separated families.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a false propaganda to mislead public opinion in a bid to justify its crimes such as impairing the validity of the steps taken by the DPRK and blocking the progress made in the inter-Korean relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK was compelled to postpone the reunion of separated families and their relatives scheduled to take place on the Harvest Moon Day. This was entirely attributable to the intolerable situation where the group is abusing the efforts of the DPRK to mend the inter-Korean relations and its will for dialogue for the purpose of confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is nonsensical for the group to talk about humanitarianism in view of such grave situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All inter-Korean humanitarian undertakings were conducted thanks to the DPRK's positive initiative and efforts, not by any action of the south Korean authorities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Most of the humanitarian undertakings in south Korea were conducted by civilian organizations and individual businessmen at a \"NGO level\".

Kumgang and reunion of separated families and their relatives in June. The legacies of the June 15 era of reunification were ruthlessly trampled down due to the grave challenges of the anti-reunification forces and the puppet group totally denied the DPRK's proposal for creating an atmosphere for mending the inter-Korean relations through the holding of the June 15 joint event while resorting to acts of alluring and abducting DPRK's youngsters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the DPRK pushed ahead with the dialogue between authorities of the north and the south out of broad magnanimity including such humanitarian issues as the reunion of separated families and their relatives and unreservedly and promptly settled all the issues proposed by the south side in the course of dialogue, irrespective of the situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative forces, however, have resorted to the tactics of delaying the dialogue, asserting that the present inter-Korean relations are something like \"tangled skeins\" so that it is necessary to unreel them one by one before settling all matters at once and the like.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As regards fruits yielded by the hard-won  north-south dialogue, they made a mockery of their dialogue partner, claiming \"it is a result of their confidence-building process on the Korean Peninsula\" and \"a fruition of their theory of principle\" and the like, a behavior of drawing water to their own mill. Not content with staging the drills of \"striking the north beyond the military demarcation line\", an indication of their open war scenario against the north, they undisguisedly staged a farce of \"appointing governors\" of the provinces of the DPRK. They went the lengths of blatantly hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is no other than the south Korean puppet forces which have abused the north-south dialogue for inciting confrontation and totally derailed the process for inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation including the humanitarian issue through a racket of confrontation of the social systems.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how hard the anti-reunification confrontation forces try to wear the veil of humanitarianism, they can never conceal their true colors as anti-reunification and confrontation maniacs with daggers hidden under their belts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They will never be able to evade their responsibility for the prevailing situation."

            "content": "Son incompatibles el dialogo y la guerra, insiste Rodong Sinmun\r\nPyongyang, 26 de septiembre (ACNC) -- En un articulo individual difundido este jueves, el diario Rodong Sinmun senala que si bien la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea se esforzara mucho por desarrollar las relaciones con el Sur de Corea, no dialogara con los que se obstinan en atacarla con fuerzas armadas, y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\tAunque las autoridades surcoreanas hablan mucho del \"dialogo\", detras de la cortina recurren a los complots y los ejercicios de guerra anti-RPDC en contubernio con las fuerzas extranjeras.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos belicistas titeres surcoreanos libraron en agosto pasado junto con Estados Unidos los ejercicios militares conjuntos de gran envergadura \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn plenos dias de esa maniobra, realizaron el entrenamiento de ataque nuclear contra la RPDC introduciendo los bombarderos estrategicos nucleares B-52H.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ministro de Defensa Nacional Kim Kwan Jin y otros belicistas surcoreanos acusaron a la RPDC diciendo que hay antecedente de la provocacion del Norte (de Corea) aun en el tiempo de dialogo e insistiendo en la \"amenaza de armas nucleares y misiles norcoreanos\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPuesto que la banda surcoreana agrava ahora intencionalmente la tension interpretando mal la paciencia de la RPDC y malempleando el dialogo N-S en la provocacion militar, resulta imposible la marcha exitosa de dialogo y cooperacion entre ambas partes coreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa realidad comprueba que las autoridades surcoreanas son totalmente responsables de la grave situacion actual.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi ellas continuan con su campana de enfrentamiento anti-RPDC desoyendo la advertencia de esta, las relaciones intercoreanas se empeoraran mas y la paz y seguridad de la Peninsula Coreana se veran mas amenazadas."
