This is something abnormal unprecedented in the world history as well as a tragedy of the present times. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The current armistice system is so fragile and the peninsula is technically at war that no one can predict at which moment a big military conflict will break out.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Establishing peace-keeping mechanism serves as a fundamental key to completely removing the acute military confrontation and the danger of a war from the peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As long as huge forces of the DPRK and the U.S. stand in acute confrontation, it is not possible to remove distrust between the two sides nor is it possible to solve any bilateral issues.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Replacing the AA by a peace one would help the DPRK and the U.S. build trust and improve relations on the principle of mutual respect and equality. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is chiefly to blame for the failure of concluding the peace agreement as it has pursued a hostile policy toward the DPRK under the shadow of the AA for the past more than half a century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whether the peace-keeping mechanism is set up on the Korean Peninsula or not entirely depends on the U.S. attitude. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should not make empty words but make practical actions to fulfill its legal and moral obligations and responsibility for peace on the Korean Peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world hopes to see durable peace settled on the peninsula."
