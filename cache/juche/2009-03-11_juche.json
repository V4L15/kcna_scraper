The war maneuvers are nuclear war exercises designed to mount a preemptive attack on the DPRK in terms of their scale and contents from A to Z.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInvolved in the exercises are far greater number of U.S. troops present overseas and more offensive military equipment including two nuclear-powdered carriers and nuclear submarines than those mobilized in the previous war maneuvers.

And it has been persistently working to establish the MD system at any cost under the pretext of \"protection\" and \"security,\" pouring an exorbitant amount of funds in this scheme.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is as clear as noonday that if the U.S. establishment of MD system is stepped up, this would cause complicated situation, seriously threaten and wreck peace and increase the danger of a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUnder this situation, not only those countries without any nuke and missile but also those countries with comparably less nuclear weapons and missiles are compelled to take military measures against the U.S. nuclear and missile threat. In actuality, various countries are putting spurs to increasing the military capability. Besides, big powers do not remain a passive onlooker to the U.S. scheme for establishing MD system but are taking corresponding measures. That is why it is needless to say that the U.S. moves for securing the military edge will trigger off a new arms race and a cold war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn history there were many forces that ran amuck in conquering the world.
