The U.S. has since increased the time for broadcasting by steadily boosting its financial disbursement for the reptile broadcasting services.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It allotted 2 million U.S. dollars for its anti-DPRK operation in the fiscal 1998. A huge financial allocation was made for this purpose until 2008 according to the \"North Korean Human Rights Act.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Obama administration's huge spending for smear broadcasting against the DPRK indicates that it is little different from the preceding regimes in the hostile policy towards it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is that the U.S. rulers asserted that the important role of the broadcasting services for overseas listeners to meet U.S. interests is reflected in the new budget. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is, indeed, a base and mean act to deceive the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The main objective of \"the Voice of Free Asia\" and the Voice of America is to disseminate the American-style \"freedom\" and \"democracy\" and corrupt bourgeois way of living to the DPRK and other Asian countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Most of the contents of their broadcasting programs are a whole string of vituperation against the top leaders of those countries, stories finding fault with their policies, interference in their internal affairs and reactionary propaganda.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is needless to say that the activities of the above-mentioned broadcasting services are designed to bring down the DPRK and other countries which do not meekly follow the instructions of the U.S. or incur its displeasure. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is sadly mistaken if it calculates the above-said media's spread of \"freedom\" and \"democracy\" would help eliminate the ideology and system chosen by the people of the DPRK themselves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They cherished the ideology in the DPRK as their faith in the course of a protracted and arduous struggle and regard the most advantageous Korean-style socialism centered on the popular masses as more important than their own lives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is keen to bring down the dignified and inviolable system in the DPRK and looks forward to any \"change\" there. This is nothing but a day-dream of those who know nothing of the single-minded unity of the leader, the party and the masses. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Intolerable is the U.S. attempt to do harm to the DPRK by increasing the funds for the reptile broadcasting services and enlarging their broadcasting hours. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The new U.S. administration has run the whole gamut of accusations against the DPRK over its satellite launch for peaceful ends and put the sanctions against the DPRK into force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t And it succeeded in plugging the south Korean puppets into the PSI.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality goes to clearly prove that the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK will remain unchanged no matter who takes presidential office in the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will bolster up its nuclear deterrent to protect its ideology and system as already clarified."
