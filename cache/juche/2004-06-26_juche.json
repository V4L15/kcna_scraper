A similar meeting of school youth and children was held in front of the monument to the sinking of the U.S. imperialist aggression ship \"General Sherman\" in Pyongyang,\r\n Reporters and speakers at the meetings recalled that the U.S. imperialists began stretching their tentacles of aggression to Korea with the intrusion of their aggression ship \"General Sherman\" into Korea. The Korean war provoked by them was the most brigandish war of aggression and a war of most hideous massacre of people in the world history of war, they added, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people including women have undergone immeasurable calamities and sufferings. Women Yun Kum I and Jon Ji Na were murdered gruesomely and two middle school girls were killed by an armored car. They met such tragic deaths due to the U.S. imperialist murderers, who have lorded it over south Korea for over half a century, watching for a chance to start a war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Genuine peace can not be expected as long as the U.S. imperialists present in south Korea. They are the sworn enemy of the Korean people upon whom they should take revenge down through generations as he has brought all sorts of tragedies and misfortunes to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. imperialists and their stooges intrude even an inch of the airspace, land and seas of the inviolable country, the women, school youth and children alongside the Korean People's Army will turn out to wipe out all the aggressors and force them to pay for the blood shed by the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Poems \"Angry Shouts\" and \"No Mercy to the U.S. Imperialists, Wolves!\" were recited at the meetings.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

In early April 1950 notorious warmonger Dulles was assigned a duty to finally confirm the preparations for the war and issue an instruction to start the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n So he inspected areas along the 38th parallel in south Korea to examine the deployment of the south Korean army and the combat readiness of weapons and combat technical equipment and even that of police. He examined the military strategy plan for \"northern expedition\" on the spot. It was June 18 that he ordered Syngman Rhee to start the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On June 19 Dulles at an opening session of the \"National Assembly\" of south Korea blustered that it goes without saying that south Korea would win when it mounts an attack and it might count on the U.S. for everything that might crop up after the outbreak of the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He sponsored the four-party talks involving McArthur, Johnson, Bradley and himself in Tokyo on June 22. It was the final secret operational meeting to decide on the way and procedure of starting the war and the D-day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The military proposals made at the talks were later approved at the joint meeting of the then U.S. President, Truman, and bosses of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Defense and State Departments in Blair House in Washington and ratified by Truman, chieftain of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After making such thorough-going preparations the U.S. imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique finally launched an all-out armed invasion against the northern half of Korea in all areas along the 38th parallel at the dawn of June 25, 1950 without the declaration of a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. imperialists ignite the second Korean war at any cost oblivious of the lesson of the history, they will sustain a bitterer defeat, shame and death than what they suffered in the last Korean war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But a durable peace has not been settled on the Korean peninsula and dark clouds of war keep the people in the grip of constant unrest and fear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean peninsula is left without any legal mechanism to avert the outbreak of another war owing to the hostile policy toward the DPRK and moves to provoke a new war on the part of the U.S. imperialists who systematically scrapped most of the provisions of the Armistice Agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Still more grave is that the U.S. makes no bones about provoking a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula and is pushing ahead with it in a planned manner to seize supremacy over the Asia-Pacific region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration in the first days of its office listed the DPRK as part of the \"axis of evil\" and designated it as a target of preemptive nuclear attack and has displayed feverish activities to speed up its preparations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is entirely thanks to the great Songun politics of the Workers' Party of Korea that peace is preserved on the Korean peninsula under such crucial situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is high time the U.S. made a responsible bold decision.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

People from all walks of life in the city marched along the streets, holding aloft placards reading \"Let's take revenge upon U.S. imperialist murderers a thousand times!\" and \"Let's wipe out U.S. imperialist aggressors\" and so on.\r\n At least a million people thronged Jonsung Square, the plaza of the Tower of the Juche Idea, the plaza in front of the monument to party founding, the plaza of the Arch of Triumph, the plaza of the Mangyongdae Schoolchildren's Palace and other plazas in the city in no time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The mass rally was attended by senior party, state and army officials including Pak Pong Ju, premier of the Cabinet, and chairpersons of the friendly parties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present on invitation were diplomatic envoys of different countries, military attaches and other foreign guests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ryang Man Gil, chairman of the Pyongyang City People's Committee, made a speech. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said that the U.S. imperialists sought to stifle the DPRK by mobilizing huge troops and lethal military equipment but they could not bring to their knees the army and people of the DPRK who rose up as one in do-or-die resistance to defend the country, rallied close around the party and the leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He vehemently denounced the U.S. imperialists, the sworn enemy, for having ceaselessly schemed to stifle the DPRK and provoke a new war for over 50 years after the ceasefire, far from drawing a proper lesson from the bitter defeat they suffered in the last Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-U.S. and anti-war struggle to frustrate the ever more undisguised moves of the U.S. and its followers to stifle the DPRK and provoke a war is a great sacred war to defend the destiny of not only Koreans in the northern part of the Korean peninsula but all other Koreans and an all-out confrontation between justice and injustice and between the Korean nation standing for peace and the U.S. standing against peace, he said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. warhawks ignite a war at any cost in the inviolable territory of Korea despite its repeated warnings, the army and people of the DPRK will mobilize all their built up war deterrent force to wipe out the aggressors to the last man and achieve a shining victory in the showdown with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The great Songun policy is a genuine patriotic policy to avert a war and defend peace, he said, underscoring the need for all the Koreans in the north and the south and abroad to support and uphold the great Songun policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Representatives of workers, peasants and youth and students in their speeches said that if the U.S. imperialists launch a war of aggression again in this land, all the Korean people will defend their homeland at the cost of their lives in do-or-die spirit just as their parents did in the 1950s, wipe out the aggressors and certainly accomplish the sacred cause of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The participants loudly chanted slogans reflecting the desire of the times and their iron will to achieve a historic victory in confrontation with the U.S. and in the cause of national reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
