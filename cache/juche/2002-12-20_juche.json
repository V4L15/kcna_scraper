The United States said that it would not fight a war with North Korea. \r\nBut clearer is its real aim to put \"military sanctions\" upon the DPRK which means a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, the U.S. has removed all the institutional mechanisms standing in the way of launching a war on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present DPRK-U.S. relations, though unstable, have been maintained on the basis of the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework (AF). However, it is now gathering dust. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has not implemented any point of the AF which calls for the simultaneous actions on the part of the two sides but gone the length of unilaterally scrapping it. It much delayed the construction of the light water reactors which it promised to hand over to the DPRK on a turn-key basis and has discarded its commitment to supply heavy oil to the latter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It declared its decision to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK in violation of the article providing for the non-use of nukes in which it promised not to threaten the DPRK with nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK-U.S. relations have, thus, been brought back to the belligerent ones. The U.S. deliberate non-compliance with the AF and far-fetched assertions have pushed the bilateral relations to the brink of a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was against this backdrop that the U.S. actually issued a declaration of a war by deciding on a way of a military counter-action against the DPRK at the South Korea-U.S. \"annual security consultative meeting\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under this situation the DPRK has no intention to beg the U.S. for dialogue, the commentary says, stressing that the DPRK will go its own way under the great banner of the army-based policy. \r\n\r\n"
