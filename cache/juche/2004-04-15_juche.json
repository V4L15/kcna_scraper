This was an event of world historic significance as it made a switchover in the orientation of the development of history to the struggle to realize the desire of the people for independence and put the true path of the revolution on the orbit of independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe President, placing the people in the center in the practice of the Korean revolution, set out revolutionary theories involving all stages from national liberation and class emancipation to socialist construction and its completion and the world revolution. He also enunciated revolutionary theories involving all fields including nature-harnessing, social reform and transformation of man. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis meant a new clarification of the revolutionary theory of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Il Sung led the cause of national liberation and the deep-going social revolution at the two phases to victory under the banner of independence, thus putting an end to national and class subjugation and freeing the Korean people from exploitation and oppression. He built man-centered socialism demonstrating its might with independent politics, self-supporting economy and self-reliant national defence on this land where centuries-old backwardness and poverty once prevailed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He founded the Juche-oriented revolutionary party and the people's government. This helped the Korean people emerge a revolutionary and dignified people who carve out their destiny independently with strong power in their hands under the leadership of the Party and victoriously advance the revolutionary cause of Juche along the road of socialism meeting all challenges of history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He created a new history of national cohesion and great unity, paved a wide avenue for the country's reunification and independent development and ushered in the era of a fresh surge in the worldwide struggle for national liberation against imperialism upholding the banner of independence against imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His revolutionary idea and exploits are being successfully carried forward and developed by leader Kim Jong Il. Basing himself on the review of the one hundred year-long history of the development of preceding revolutionary theories, Kim Jong Il formulated the President's revolutionary idea as an integral system of idea, theory and method of Juche and proclaimed it as a guiding idea of the revolution in the era of independence. This was a historic event as it opened up a road of an epochal change in developing the revolutionary idea for the Korean revolution and independence of the popular masses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What occupies the most shining position in Kim Jong Il's leadership over the efforts to carry forward and develop the President's revolutionary idea and exploits is that he set out the Songun idea and carved out the road of Songun revolution to cope with the grim situation the Korean revolution faced in the 1990s of the last century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should invariably and vigorously advance under the Songun revolutionary leadership of Kim Jong Il in the future, too just as we did in the last decade when we paved the road of proud struggle victoriously standing the most stern trials so as to glorify the President's idea, cause and revolutionary traditions of Juche for all ages. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a sure guarantee for carrying forward and developing the President's idea and cause and attaining the final victory of the revolutionary cause of Juche to devotedly defend Kim Jong Il and uphold his Songun idea and revolutionary leadership with loyalty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an unshakable will of the WPK to defend the motherland and socialism and carve out the destiny of the nation independently, considering it as the most important affair to increase the national defence capacity, the reporter said, underlining the need to strengthen the People's Army, give priority to the development of the national defence industry and consolidate the single-hearted unity of the army and the people as firm as a rock. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north and the south and abroad should thoroughly implement the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration under the banner of national independence and actively promote the reunification cause on the principle of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity, the reporter said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation on the Korean peninsula at present has reached a serious phase due to the U.S. persistent and vicious hostile policy toward the DPRK. If the U.S. imperialists misunderstand the generosity and patience of the DPRK and ignite another war on the peninsula, its army and people will turn out as one to mercilessly wipe out the aggressors to the last man.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
