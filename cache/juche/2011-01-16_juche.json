This is proved by the last three years of confrontation between the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOnly when the responsible authorities of the north and the south holding real power hold candid talks to wipe out misunderstanding and distrust is it possible to improve the inter-Korean relations, clear the atmosphere of hostility and pave the way for cooperation and peace. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There are a lot of good precedents in which the north and the south narrowed down bilateral differences and successfully weathered difficulties through dialogue and negotiations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Had the north and the south defused confrontation through dialogue and negotiations last year, the situation on the Korean Peninsula would not have remained so tense as now.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t How to approach dialogue and negotiations is a touchstone distinguishing patriotism from treachery and peace from division.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean authorities wish to see the inter-Korean relations improved, without playing into the hands of foreign forces keen to do harm to the destiny of the Koreans, they should come out for dialogue and negotiations without any precondition."

Such sophism about someone's \"provocations\" and the like let loose at the talks were just rhetoric to cover up its sinister purpose. Japan is now availing itself of the mounting tension between the north and the south to prod the south Korean authorities into laying a springboard from which it can stage a comeback to Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities are turning their eyes away from the goodwill offer from fellow countrymen while unhesitatingly tightening the nexus with the Japanese reactionaries keen to launch a war of reinvasion against the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If they are interested in the improved inter-Korean relations and peace on the peninsula even a bit, they should give up military cooperation with foreign aggressors, an act quite contrary to dialogue."
