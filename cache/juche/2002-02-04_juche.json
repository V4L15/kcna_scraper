            "content": "S. Korean authorities' unwarranted step assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 4 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the central committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea Sunday issued a statement denouncing the South Korean authorities for refusing to permit under an absurd pretext the Pyongyang visit of representatives of the \"Korean Confederation of Trade Unions\" (KCTU) and the \"Federation of Korean Trade Unions\" (FKTU) who have taken the lead in implementing the June 15 joint declaration.\r\n At a time when all Koreans should pool their efforts to implement the joint declaration published by the north and south the South Korean authorities took the step of blocking the visit to the north of representatives of the unions, the statement noted, adding that this is an anti-reunification move that can never be justified.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We bitterly condemn the moves to block dialogue and contact between non-governmental organizations by reviving fascist evil practices during the past military dictatorship in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We hold that such unwarranted acts as suppressing the free activities of the KCTU and the FKTU for reunification and blocking their visit to Pyongyang in contravention of the spirit of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and the cause of national reunification should be unconditionally stopped in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will never tolerate any moves to bar the workers in the north and the south from achieving national unity and the reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will firmly join hands with the South Korean workers in a more vigorous struggle to implement the joint declaration and frustrate the anti-reunification moves of the separatist forces through their concerted efforts.    \r\n\r\n"

One of them is to escalate the hardline policy toward the DPRK under the pretext of its \"nuclear issue\" and ignite the second Korean war when an opportunity presents itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another is to charge the DPRK with \"possession of nuclear weapons\" in a bid to divert the international community's criticism of the U.S. criminal nuclear policy to the DPRK and isolate it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was the U.S. which developed and used nuclear weapons for the first time in the world and it is again the U.S. which has deployed more nukes in its mainland and different parts of the world than any other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though it is talking about \"nuclear disarmament\", the U.S. is set to keep not a small number of the nuclear warheads to be dismantled in the nuclear arsenal and reuse them when necessary conditions are created. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This clearly shows the U.S. attempt to hold an unchallenged nuclear edge and pose a nuclear threat to humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to stop its foolish anti-DPRK smear campaign over its \"nuclear issue\" and redeem its crimes committed as a nuclear fanatic.    \r\n\r\n"

It should not force South Korea to pursue a hostile policy towards the north in the future under the pretext of \"South Korea-U.S. cooperation\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean Youth Federation in a statement noted with concern that Bush's remarks might further strain the south-north relations. \"Bush should immediately retract his remarks if he does not want to face resistance from the peace-loving Korean people,\" it warned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The national council for independence and peaceful reunification in a statement held that those reckless remarks repeated by Bush and officials of his administration would have a serious baneful impact not only on the DPRK-U.S. relations but on the south-north relations and peace on the Korean peninsula.    \r\n\r\n"
