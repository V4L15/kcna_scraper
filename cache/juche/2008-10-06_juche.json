Korean Conservative's Anti-DPRK Malarkey\r\n Pyongyang, October 4 (KCNA) -- The south Korean conservatives' moves to push the north-south relations to the phase of acute confrontation have gone beyond the danger line.\n\t\t\t\t\t A typical example is that So Jae Jin, director of the puppet Institute for Unification Studies, advocated the \"uselessness\" of the inter-Korean dialogue at a seminar held at Seoul National University on September 23.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK vehemently dismisses this as a total denial of the north-south dialogue and an open declaration of confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The north-south dialogue requires both sides to wipe out misunderstanding and mistrust and promote national unity by making concession and compromising with each other irrespective of differences.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Dialogue is necessary and meaningful only when both sides consider reunification as an urgent national task and take the option to achieve it peacefully, not by war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t So Jae Jin's rhetoric proves that he is an anti-reunification element keen on inciting confrontation in utter disregard of the country's reunification, not befitting his post as \"director of the institute\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He even talked about \"reform\" and \"opening\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There exist differing social systems in the north and the south at present. Neither side is willing to make a concession to the other side out of its own accord over the issue of social system. Therefore, if one side pressurizes the other side to make \"opening\" and \"reform\" it will naturally escalate confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This proves that the \"reform\" and \"opening\" touted by him are, in essence, no more than a version of \"the call for unification by absorption\" made by the successive anti-reunification elements only to drink a bitter cup.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK can never tolerate So's reckless remarks slandering the sacred political system in it and the Songun policy of the Workers' Party of Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is a genuine popular masses-centered socialist system in which the working masses have become genuine masters of the state and society and everything of the society serves them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The great Songun policy is aimed at firmly protecting genuine socialism, mainstay of the people and their cradle, from the moves of all hues of enemies to invade and stifle the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This notwithstanding, he defamed the political system, the Songun politics in the DPRK this or that way. This casts doubt as to whether he is a human being with elementary thinking power, to say nothing of his qualification as \"director of the unification institute\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is not the first time that rhetoric defaming the political system in the DPRK was heard from among conservatives since the Lee Myung Bak group came to power in south Korea. But it was only So who let loose so malignant vituperation about the political system and the political mode and the single-minded unity in the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No wonder, even south Korean media noted with concern that his reckless remarks would mark an occasion of further bedeviling the inter-Korean relations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t So Jae Jin was marginalized in the June 15 era of reunification for being a political greenhorn and an imbecile bereft of any political philosophy or elementary ability to understand reality and a wicked anti-reunification element. However, he dared defame the political system in the DPRK. Lurking behind this is his sinister intention to maintain at any cost the post with small authority he managed to obtain with difficulty under the puppet Lee regime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Explicitly speaking, the DPRK can never tolerate the smear campaign against its supreme headquarters and the noble popular system absolutely trusted by all people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will never pardon anyone who slanders the dignified political system in the DPRK and insults the spiritual world of its people devotedly safeguarding their leader."

confrontation, totally refusing to implement the historic June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration, an action programme for its implementation.\n\t\t\t\t\t The October 4 declaration comprehensively deals with all issues of developing the north-south relations and achieving the peace of the country and the prosperity common to the nation in the spirit of the June 15 joint declaration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group, among other things, has seriously violated the spirit of \"By our nation itself\" enshrined in the October 4 declaration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From the outset of its office it laid it down as its policy to settle the issues concerning the north-south relations with a \"yardstick of pragmatism not with a yardstick of ideology.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It did not hesitate to let loose a string of rubbish terming the idea of \"By our nation itself\" \"chauvinist nationalism\" and \"shaky nationalism.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These are very grave outbursts defaming the spirit cherished by all Koreans as an idea common to the nation irrespective of the ideology and system after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It openly took up the cudgel against the October 4 declaration which deals with specific issues of boosting the multi-faceted cooperation and exchange between the north and the south for the prosperity common to the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet authorities laid down \"four principles to govern the policy towards the north\" at the outset of their office and opted to freeze the north-south relations that had favorably developed since the publication of the June 15 joint declaration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They suspended the implementation of the October 4 declaration which enjoyed full support of all Koreans, complaining that it is not in line with \"state interests\" and talking about \"economic propriety\" and \"financial burden.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are openly justifying their opposition to the implementation of the declaration, asserting that it is \"unreasonable to demand an  \"unconditional implementation of the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration\" and spreading undesirable stories that their implementation requires \"staggering amount of funds.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is an unpardonable separatist act to totally deny the successes achieved in the movement for the country's reunification and chill the Koreans' desire to independently settle the issue of reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean regime has further escalated the military confrontation between the north and the south, thus challenging the October 4 declaration which clarifies realistic measures for removing the hurdles lying in the way of national reunification through dialogue and negotiations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It introduced ultra-modern nuclear war hardware including a super-large nuclear-powered carrier and nuclear-powered submarines into south Korea and labeled compatriots in the north south Korea's \"principal enemy.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It staged with outside forces joint military exercises Key Resolve, Foal Eagle and Ulji Freedom Guardian targeted against compatriots, turning south Korea into a theater of saber-rattling. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group's military confrontation racket is so dangerous as to block the advance of the June 15 era of reunification by rendering the north-south relations extremely tense and start a war of aggression at any cost with outsiders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean conservative group is now talking about \"reconciliation and cooperation\" between the north and the south, paying lip-service to \"co-existence and co-prosperity.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not long ago it made much fuss about \"overall dialogue\" in a bid to create impression that it is interested in improving the already strained north-south relations and developing cooperation and exchange.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But as the reality proves, it is seeking confrontation and tension, not the development of inter-Korean relations and peace and prosperity, and working with bloodshot eyes to stifle the DPRK in collusion with foreign forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the Lee group of traitors that has frantically pursued the confrontation in ideology and system between the north and the south while calling for somebody's \"change\" and \"improved human rights record.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is busy with a wholesale purge of pro-reunification progressive forces in an effort to chill the people's desire to achieve reunification through an alliance with the north and stoke confrontation with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All areas of south Korea are swept by the waves of suppression of the Solidarity for Implementing the South-North Joint Declaration, an organization for the movement of the reunification which has been active to implement the June 15 joint declaration after its publication.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The crackdown on the above-said solidarity only brought to light the intention of the Lee Myung Bak regime to liquidate the forces supporting the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration and striving to implement them and thus bring the north-south relations and the declarations to collapse.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All this is directly linked with the south Korean puppet clique's treacherous moves for confrontation against reunification as it blocks the implementation of all agreements reached between the north and the south according to the historic declarations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The validity and vitality of the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration have been fully proved as the most important documents for national reunification and nothing can replace them in the efforts to develop the north-south relations and achieve national reunification at present.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Had it sincerely met the requirements of the declarations, big successes would have been attained in the development of the inter-Korean relations and the movement for national reunification and the Koreans would have commonly benefited from them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a serious crime against the nation and reunification that the Lee clique played down the historical weighty significance of the above-said declarations and refused to implement them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee regime will not be able to escape a stern judgment of history for having betrayed the nation."

Accordingly, the October 4 declaration is not a document that allows one to dodge its implementation. Moreover, it is impossible to improve the inter-Korean relations in the future, too, if one ignores and negates any document as one pleases for the mere reason that it was signed by one's predecessor. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The day is not far off when traitor Lee will face the nation's stern judgment for being hell-bent on sycophancy towards the U.S. and confrontation with compatriots in disregard of the above-said two declarations, warns the commentary."

Rodong Sinmun Sunday observes this in a signed article. \n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The moves stepped up by the U.S. to build missile shields are aimed to dominate the world by dint of military edge. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the invariable strategic goal and wild ambition of the U.S. to put the world under its control and domination. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. adopted a new strategy for preemptive strike as a national policy and is keen to use the MD for carrying it out. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. MD is linked with its scenario for world supremacy. This is proved by the fact that it unilaterally pulled out of the ABM Treaty. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accordingly, the U.S. is pushing forward the moves for the MD in real earnest, not bound to international law. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. talk about \"military threat\" from other countries is nothing but rhetoric intended to play down the criminal nature of its MD and justify it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The U.S. imperialists are so vociferously calling for building missile shields in a bid to contain independent countries and big powers and hold world hegemony by dint of nuclear superiority. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. seeks to further expand its military bloc for aggression through the MD. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is their intention to build missile shields under the pretext of \"threat\" from the DPRK and other anti-U.S. and independent countries. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  By stepping up the moves to establish the MD under the pretence of \"threat\" from the DPRK the U.S. seeks to pose increased military threat to it and mount a preemptive missile attack on it any moment and thus stifle it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is working hard to plug various countries into an arms race under the motto of building missile shields. This is intended to contain the \"potential enemies\" with ease by wearing down their strength. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said moves for MD are sparking off a new Cold War and straining the international situation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is an anachronistic daydream for the U.S. to try to realize its wild ambition for world domination by building a global network of missile shields."

            "content": "ATCC comenta actos anti-reunificacion de Lee Myung Bak\r\nPyongyang, 4 de octubre (ATCC) -- La banda de traidores al mando de Lee Myung Bak niega totalmente la ejecucion de la historica Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio y el programa de su materializacion, Declaracion del 4 de Octubre, y lleva a la confrontacion las relaciones entre ambas partes coreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\tLa segunda plantea de modo comprensivo todos los problemas para desarrollar las relaciones intercoreanas conforme al espiritu de la primera declaracion y para lograr la paz del pais y la coprosperidad nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnte todo, la banda de Lee viola gravemente el espiritu de \"Entre nosotros, los connacionales\" estipulado en la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde el principio, ellos formularon como una politica la solucion de las relaciones intercoreanas \"no con la pauta del ideal sino con la de pragmatismo\" y se atrevieron a calificar el ideal de \"Entre nosotros, los connacionales\" de \"nacionalismo chovinista e inflexible\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto constituye un grave acto criminal para desvirtuar el espiritu de \"Entre nosotros, los connacionales\" que se enraizo firmemente despues del 15 de junio en el corazon de los coreanos como ideal comun nacional por encima de las ideas y regimenes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda del traidor Lee desafio abiertamente a la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre en que estan mencionados los problemas concretos para intensificar la cooperacion e intercambio multilaterales entre el Norte y el Sur encaminados a la coprosperidad nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde el comienzo de su mandato, las autoridades titeres surcoreanas procedieron a cerrar la puerta de las relaciones intercoreanas, que se desarrollaban positivamente despues del 15 de junio, presentando los llamados \"4 principios para el fomento de la politica al Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSuspendieron la implementacion de la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre, apoyada absolutamente por toda la nacion coreana, diciendo que no conviene a los \"intereses estatales\" ni a las \"razones economicas\" y significa una \"carga financiera\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, al insistir en que la exigencia de la \"ejecucion incondicional de las declaraciones mencionadas\" es \"irracional\", justifican abiertamente su posicion en contra de esta labor difundiendo un rumor de que \"ella requiere fabulosos fondos\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa negativa total a los exitos logrados en el movimiento por la reunificacion de la patria y el desaliento del deseo nacional de solucionar independientemente este problema son intolerables actos divisionistas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl \"poder\" surcoreano lleva al extremo la confrontacion militar entre el Norte y el Sur desafiando a la declaracion de octubre que presenta las realistas medidas para superar mediante el dialogo y las negociaciones los obstaculos en el camino a la reunificacion de la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIntrodujo en el terreno surcoreano el portaaviones nuclear de tamano ultragrande, submarinos nucleares y otros ultramodernos equipos para la guerra nuclear de EE.UU. y definio a los compatriotas como \"enemigo principal\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesplego con las fuerzas extranjeras los ejercicios militares conjuntos \"Key Resolve\", \"Aguilucho\" y \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\", que toman por su blanco a los compatriotas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl alboroto de confrontacion militar de la banda de Lee es peligroso acto para impedir el avance de la epoca de reunificacion iniciada el 15 de junio mediante el empeoramiento al tope de las relaciones entre las dos partes coreanas y desatar a cualquier precio la guerra de agresion junto con las fuerzas foraneas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora, las fuerzas conservadoras surcoreanas hablan aparentemente de la \"convivencia y coprosperidad\" y de la \"reconciliacion y cooperacion\" con el Norte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHace unos dias, hablaron tanto del \"dialogo global\" como si estuvieran interesados en la mejora de las relaciones intercoreanas empeoradas y en el desarrollo de la cooperacion y el intercambio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, la realidad demuestra que ellas no quieren el desarrollo de las relaciones intercoreanas ni la paz ni la prosperidad sino persiguen la confrontacion y la tension y maniobran desesperadamente para aplastar a la RPDC junto con las fuerzas foraneas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa camarilla traidora de Lee persigue tenazmente la confrontacion entre las ideas, ideales y regimenes de las dos partes coreanas exigiendo \"cambios\" y cuestionando los \"derechos humanos\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tElla libra una intensa campana de liquidacion de las fuerzas progresistas pro-reunificacion para sofocar el animo de los habitantes surcoreanos de reunificar el pais en alianza con el Norte e inculcar en ellos el sentimiento de confrontacion con este.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, se libra en toda la extension surcoreana la represion a la Solidaridad de Ejecucion de la Declaracion Conjunta Sur-Norte, entidad del movimiento por la reunificacion que vino actuando para materializarla despues de su publicacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta represion constituye una revelacion abierta del intento del \"poder\" de Lee de quebrar las relaciones y las declaraciones intercoreanas mediante la eliminacion de las fuerzas que las apoyan y tratan de ejecutarlas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los hechos estan relacionados directamente con las maniobras de confrontacion de caracter antinacional y anti-reunificacion de la camarilla titere surcoreana que obstaculiza la ejecucion de todos los acuerdos Norte-Sur provenientes de la historica Declaracion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAmbas declaraciones son los documentos nacionales de nivel supremo para la reunificacion, cuya justeza y vitalidad fueron comprobadas patentemente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo hay nada que pueda sustituirlas en la causa para lograr el desarrollo de las relaciones entre el Norte y el Sur y la reunificacion de la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi se hubiera cumplido con sinceridad los requisitos de ellas, hoy se habria alcanzado grandes exitos en el desarrollo de las relaciones intercoreanas y el movimiento por la reunificacion de la patria, de lo cual se habria beneficiado practicamente toda la nacion coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa horda de Lee cometio un grave crimen antinacional y anti-reunificacion al restar la importancia historica de las declaraciones intercoreanas y rehusar su implementacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl \"poder\" de Lee, que traiciono a la nacion, sera castigado duro por la historia."
