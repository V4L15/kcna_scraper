Paektu left by Generalissimos Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il as the greatest legacy of patriotism and provided a sure guarantee for the ever-victorious future of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il's Korea, he noted, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Marshal Kim Jong Un displayed distinguished military wisdom and qualifications as a brilliant commander, getting closely associated with arms in his teens. He made an immortal contribution to the development of the revolutionary armed forces as the closest Songun revolutionary comrade and military aide to leader Kim Jong Il, enjoying boundless reverence and trust from service personnel and people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the greatest fortune and honor for the WPK, the army and people to hold Kim Jong Un, another great man of Mt.

Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He is an iron-willed brilliant commander as he firmly defends the country, revolution and socialism with his matchless pluck and grit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He truly represents the might of the great Paektusan power and the banner of its eternal victory as he resolutely safeguards the country, revolution and socialism with his matchless pluck and toughest counter-measure at the supreme headquarters on the forefront of revolution and draws an arrow for the victory in the great battle for national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He is a great master of creation and construction as he let the revolutionary army play a vanguard role in working miracles in the drive for prosperity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He is not only a peerlessly illustrious commander demonstrating the might of the powerful revolutionary army of Mt. Paektu, the military power of Juche, with his outstanding idea and experienced and tested leadership ability and noble virtues but the great sun in the new century as he carves out a bright future for the Korean nation and mankind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reporter called for building a thriving socialist nation at an early date, achieving national reunification and accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche, true to the idea and leadership of Kim Jong Un, adding that the country's reunification was the life-long desire of the great Generalissimos and the greatest historic task of the nation the fulfillment of which is desired by the Korean people so much.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK who are always keeping sharp eyes on the anti-DPRK war maneuvers of the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean warmongers will firmly guarantee the peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula with an invincible military capacity and surely achieve the historic cause of national reunification by the concerted efforts of all Koreans, the reporter declared, stressing that only victory and glory are in store for the DPRK advancing under the leadership of Kim Jong Un, holding high the flag of the WPK as the supreme colors of revolution."

This is a heinous anti-DPRK act like a war act.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. denied the DPRK's development of space for peaceful purposes. No sooner had the DPRK announced its plan to launch Kwangmyongsong 3-1 than the U.S. unilaterally announced that it would stop the food provision, quite contrary to its claim that it does not link the humanitarian issue with politics. This resulted in breaching the February 29 DPRK-U.S. agreement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Fearing the objective confirmation of the peaceful nature of the DPRK's satellite launch, the U.S. is orchestrating hostile acts of encroaching upon the DPRK's just right to launch satellite Kwangmyongsong 3-2, labeling it a long-distance missile launch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. left no stone unturned to carry out its foreign policy in a bid to execute its anti-DPRK acts. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. administration and think-tank cried out for the \"logic of threat from north Korea\" with an aim to justify the strategy for dominating the Asia-Pacific region. The \"third Armitage report\" published by the group of experts for supra-partisan diplomacy and security said the U.S. and Japan are exposed to threats from north Korea equipped with nuclear weapons. The U.S. Centre for Strategic and International Studies in its report submitted at the request of the U.S. Defense Department claimed that north Korea is the primary threat to the U.S. in Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The commander-in-chief of the U.S. forces in the Pacific region cried out for getting prepared to ensure security from provocation of north Korea and the deputy commander of the U.S. 8th Army said that the mission to deter threat from Pyongyang is important as never before now that the U.S. forces are shifting their emphasis to the Pacific region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has escalated military pressure and blackmail against the DPRK. This is the main cause of the tensions that ran high on the Korean Peninsula this year. At the beginning of the year the U.S. officially signed the \"plan for jointly coping with local provocations\" which envisaged the involvement of the south Korean puppet forces and the U.S. forces in Japan and the Pacific in case of the contingency on the peninsula. This plan, part of its new defense strategy, aims to ignite a Korean war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has intensified war maneuvers against the DPRK. They were staged according to OPLAN 5027, a scenario for an overall war on the peninsula, and OPLAN 5029, a scenario for surprise attack operation of the U.S. and the south Korean puppet army in \"contingency.\" They were staged under the simulated conditions of \"removal of the weapons of mass destruction\", attack operation such as strike at commanding post and \"removal of nuclear facilities\" through Key Resolve, Foal Eagle and Ulji Focus Guardian joint military exercises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In June alone the U.S. staged joint exercises in the South Sea of Korea together with Japan and the south Korean puppet army and joint naval exercise in the West Sea of Korea with the puppet army with nuclear carrier George Washington involved. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. aggravated the situation while crying out for the initiatives for military cooperation to cope with someone's \"threat\", instigating traitor Lee Myung Bak keen on igniting a war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Top U.S. military officials often had secret confabs with the south Korean warmongers at which they vociferated about \"completion of the plan for joint operation\" and the \"provision of deterrent forces including a nuclear umbrella\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Clarified in the operational plan of the past war confabs was the mode of war operation that an overall war will be orchestrated by the U.S. and local war by the south Korean puppet army in case a war breaks out on the Korean Peninsula. But the new joint operational plan was amended to the effect that the U.S. and south Korea will jointly cope with the local war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. gave the south Korean puppet forces a free rein as regards the use of missiles so that they can put the whole areas of the DPRK in the firing range and strike them. This provided a condition for a preemptive strike at the DPRK, indicating what extent the U.S. reckless war hysteria to egg the south Korean puppet forces on to wage a war against the DPRK has reached.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is driven into a tight corner as regards the Korean issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the U.S. State Department in a recent press briefing said the DPRK's rocket launch as planned showed that the U.S. policy toward the DPRK failed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A senior researcher at the U.S. Cato Research Institute referred to the infeasibility and uselessness of the Obama Administration's Korea policy. The U.S. is falling into a pitfall as regards its policy toward north Korea, he noted, adding the Obama Administration's policy toward north Korea is risking the worst result.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Bottom-line is for Washington to change its present strategy in a bold way, he said. It is foolish to call for following in the footsteps of the decades-long policy which produced very useless results, he added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is very just when the DPRK decided to bolster up its war deterrent to cope with the worst situation on the Korean Peninsula created by the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. had better clearly understand its rival and roll back at once its anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK."
