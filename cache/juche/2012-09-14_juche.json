Korean Military's Farce of \"Examination Regarding Forces Following North\" Flailed \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, September 14 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea released information bulletin No. 1010 Friday as regards the south Korean army's farce of \"examination concerning the forces following the north\". The bulletin said:\n\t\t\t\t\t Units of the south Korean army were recently disclosed to have staged the farce of \"examination regarding forces following the north\" among officers and soldiers, touching off a big furor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet military present more than 120 \"problems for the recognition and evaluation of entities following the north\" and let officers and men of the army sit for the compulsory examination. They are giving passing grades only when examinees call pro-reunification and democratic forces in south Korea \"pro-north leftist forces\" that follow the Juche idea and socialist idea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Only those who received passing grades are allowed promotion and furlough and those who have not passed the examination are forced to sit for it until they pass.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this regard, south Korea's opposition parties and civic and public organizations are calling it a \"political intervention for the election of conservative forces in the presidential election\" and \"revival of yusin-based army\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, south Korean \"Defense Minister\" Kim Kwan Jin and other top military officials are insisting on holding the examination, claiming that \"education regarding pro-north forces is essential for soldiers\" and \"it is quite natural to teach the soldiers the entity of pro-north forces\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a hideous fascist action going against the nation, democracy, reunification and humanity that could not be seen even under the rule of the past military fascist dictatorial regime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The examination concerning \"pro-north forces\" orchestrated by the south Korean military regime is aimed to revive the fading \"outlook on the arch enemy\" and \"theory of principal enemy\" within the army and prod servicepersons to escalate confrontation with fellow countrymen and launch a war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Increasing among the army are voices denouncing the Lee Myung Bak regime of traitors for its frantic moves for a war against the DPRK and praising the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is against this backdrop that the regime is imposing the \"examination\" to revive the \"outlook on the arch enemy\", escalate confrontation with fellow countrymen and raise war awareness.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is also the last-ditch efforts to ensure the conservative forces' stay in power in the upcoming \"presidential election.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those of the puppet military are trying to prolong their remaining days by relying on the conservative regime. So, they use the \"examination regarding pro-north forces\" to justify the \"yusin\" dictatorship and make more votes for the \"Saenuri Party\" candidate in the \"election\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak regime and the \"Saenuri Party\" at the back of the U.S. are behind the farce of \"examination\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Clear is that south Korea will go back to the dark period of the \"yusin\" fascist dictatorship, far from coming out for the improvement of north-south relations unless the Lee regime and the \"Saenuri Party's\" moves for confrontation with the DPRK are foiled.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Koreans from all walks of life should heighten vigilance against the revival of the \"yusin\" dictatorship that gained ill-fame for military coup and fascist suppression, and strongly denounce and reject the moves of \"examination\"."

            "content": "DPRK Will Discharge Its Duty as Nuclear State: Official\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, September 14 (KCNA) -- The head of the delegation of the Institute for Disarmament and Peace of the DPRK Foreign Ministry on Sept. 7 made a speech on the theme \"Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty: Ensuring its Vitality\" at the Moscow international conference on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.\n\t\t\t\t\t The full text of his speech is as follows:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t CTBT basically aims at not allowing the qualitative improvement of the existing nuclear weapons and the development of any new types of nuclear weapons, through banning all sorts of nuclear tests that accompany physical nuclear explosion in the air, outer space and under water and ground.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accordingly, all governments that have signed this treaty are neither allowed to conduct nuclear tests or other nuclear explosions inside their own countries nor to be involved in any kinds of acts that instigate or encourage such explosions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In a nutshell, the main objective of this treaty is to fundamentally eliminate any possibilities of nuclear development.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Once this treaty becomes effective and displays its vitality, then there is no doubt that it would make a great contribution to the world peace and stability. However, CTBT still has not come into effect though 16 years has passed after its adoption. Then what could be the reason for that?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is because the current situation of the nuclear disarmament is too far distant from the treaty's ideal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The realistic and massive nuclear disarmament is the pre-condition for enforcing the treaty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But currently, the world-wide nuclear disarmament is not making satisfactory progress due to the disagreements and conflicts in the interests of the main nuclear powers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In particular, the U.S., which emerged a nuclear superpower after the end of the Cold War with the Soviet Union, is exerting all its efforts to take pre-emptive measures to prevent the appearance of any other nuclear power and to secure the overwhelming superiority in the strategic nuclear armed forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For this, the U.S. is initiating nuclear disarmament negotiations in order to weaken the nuclear power of the potential enemies while seeking absolute military and strategic supremacy by enforcing qualitative modernization of its nuclear weapons and building strategic missile defense system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is more serious is that the U.S. is enhancing the efficiency of the nuclear weapons without physical nuclear tests by making the ill use of the advanced technology such as sub-critical nuclear testing technologies and thus, deceiving the world public opinion and veiling its sinister intentions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the U.S. is pursuing high-handed politics based on the powerful military capability, still seized with the Cold War way of thinking, tensions have become more acute in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is for this reason that other nuclear powers that do not measure up to the U.S. in the overall military and economic capabilities are giving priority to nuclear weapons in their security policy in order to retain their position by maintaining the basic strategic balance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In case we avoid the complete elimination of existing nuclear weapons and unilaterally execute CTBT, it would give rise to serious inequality and imbalance in the security of each state and this would rather bring about irretrievable consequences in the global peace and stability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Up to the end of 2009, the world recorded a total of 2 054 nuclear tests and 99.99 percent of those were carried out by permanent member states of the United Nations Security Council.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nuclear powers conducted many nuclear tests and built up their nuclear arsenal as much as they could and thus monopolized the nuclear weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Therefore, no more nuclear tests are necessary for them and still, they can exercise their influence as much as they want in the international stage as a nuclear power by depending on their existing nuclear arsenal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Given this current situation, countries like the DPRK can not but take the issue of signing CTBT seriously because they are placed in special circumstances beyond control where they need to be equipped with self-defensive nuclear deterrent in order to cope with the direct nuclear threats of the U.S., the only nuclear superpower of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK has been enforced for more than half a century to eliminate the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What's more serious is that the U.S. has its national policy of not ruling out the use of nukes in order to stifle the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the \"2010 Nuclear Posture Review\", the U.S. refused to give the guarantee to nonuse of nuclear weapons against the DPRK and Iran and thus, made a pre-emptive nuclear strike a fait accompli.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In addition to this, the U.S. stages frantic nuclear war exercises against the DPRK every year with massive nuclear strike means in and around the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The constant U.S. hostile policy and threats forced the DPRK to carry out nuclear tests twice and possess nuclear deterrent as part of the self-defensive measures aimed at safeguarding the security and sovereign rights of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even countries like France and UK that are not directly under the threats of war as being member states of the NATO, regard the nuclear deterrent as a guarantee for ensuring sovereignty and peace.   So it is needless to say that the DPRK should take the same approach to defend itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Unless the U.S. hostile policy and its nuclear threats are completely withdrawn and a solid and permanent peace regime is in place on the Korean Peninsula, the DPRK is left with no other choice but to steadily strengthen its self-defensive nuclear deterrent to the standard as it deems necessary.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is so clear that unless the U.S., the nuclear superpower which is allegedly playing a \"pivotal role\" in the world peace and stability, abandon its plan to seize the military supremacy based on the modernized nuclear weapons and give up its nuclear threats to the anti-imperialist independent countries like the DPRK, the prevention of nuclear weapons development through CTBT would remain a mission impossible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Only when CTBT is enforced under the pre-condition that the nuclear weapons would be completely removed on a worldwide scale can all states be granted practically equal and just obligations and rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In that sense, the more pressing issue than enforcing CTBT is to establish an international legal framework on unconditional ban on the use and complete removal of existing nuclear weapons worldwide and work out impartial and proportionate measures for nuclear disarmament and removal based on mutual trust.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to make CTBT effective in the reality, its pre-conditions should be ready and for that, the main nuclear powers should fulfill their responsibility and duty in the efforts to thoroughly remove the source of the nuclear war in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Especially it is important for the U.S., a nuclear superpower of the world, to promptly stop all acts of military buildup that destroy the world stability such as modernizing and conventionalizing nuclear weapons as well as developing new ultra-modern weapons in substitute for nukes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Unless the U.S. puts an end to these maneuvers, we would never see the folding up of arms race among the great powers aimed at defending their own security and strategic interests and this would produce grave consequences to the world peace and stability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As repeatedly clarified, the DPRK would discharge its responsibility and duty as a responsible nuclear state for the nuclear non-proliferation in the future."

It added that \"such mistake should not be repeated.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Describing the idea of \"By our nation itself\" reflected in the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration as \"narrow-minded nationalism\" and \"chauvinistic nationalism\", the Lee group spelled out \"no nukes, opening and 3 000 dollars\" as \"a policy toward the north\", a replica of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK, seriously bedeviling the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Asserting that dialogue is possible only when \"the north dismantles its nukes,\" the group derailed all north-south dialogues and cooperation undertakings under the pretext of the nuclear issue.

It, at the same time, kicked up a noisy anti-DPRK racket not only in south Korea but even in the international arena over the non-existent \"human rights issue\" at the zealous prodding of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group in zealous pursuance of the U.S. policy is mainly aimed at doing harm to compatriots by force of arms, backed by its master.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean nation can neither pave the way for independent reunification, peace and prosperity nor escape a war disaster as long as such worst sycophants and traitors are allowed to stay in office, concludes the article."

            "content": "U.S., S. Korea Do Not Want Detente: Voice of Russia \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Moscow, September 13 (KCNA Correspondent) -- The Voice of Russia on Sept. 12 reported as follows as regards the provocative joint military drills of the U.S. and south Korea:\n\t\t\t\t\t Had the army of the DPRK staged a military drill for invading south Korea, the world would have accused the DPRK. Maybe, the UN Security Council might have called an emergency meeting and called for calming down the invaders. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But when Dong-A Ilbo of south Korea reported that the U.S. and south Korea staged joint military exercises for invading the DPRK some time ago, the world made almost no response. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Asmolov, expert of the Institute of the Far East of the Russian Academy of Sciences, said it is clear that double standards are being applied in evaluating the situation of the Korean Peninsula. When the DPRK launched an artificial satellite, the world became fussy as if it launched \"Seoul-targeted\" or \"Tokyo-targeted\" missile. However, when south Korea staged a military drill for invading the DPRK, the world made no response to it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean army together with the U.S. forces staged the joint military exercises in August. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The purpose of the exercises has recently been disclosed. It was for the south Korean army to occupy the DPRK and stabilize the situation after the occupation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In particular, the south Korean army and the U.S. army staged the exercises for unifying the north and the south of Korea by a military way, recovering the work of the administrative bodies of the DPRK and providing the residents with humanitarian aids. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Asmolov said in the past they staged military exercises simulating an \"attack\" by the DPRK. South Korea would have asserted that it was its right for it to stage military exercises to defend itself from outside enemy. But, now the essence of the military exercises approached to provocation. The purpose of such military exercises is not only to provoke the DPRK but display its hostility as regards the interests of the Asia-Pacific region as a whole, Asmolov added. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korean \"President\" Lee Myung Bak thinks that unification of the Korean Peninsula should be achieved by way of the south's absorption of the north. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK views it as the declaration of a war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is by no means accidental that leader of the DPRK Kim Jong Un ordered the whole army to be ready for action. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un examined the operational plan to move on to all-out counterattack to cope with the enemies' moves and finally signed it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S.-south Korea joint military exercises showed that the U.S. and south Korea do not want detente on the Korean Peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The military exercises have increased the possibility of the situation on the peninsula developing toward the use of the armed forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Surely, the DPRK will revise its military principle and its media will launch a new campaign against the enemies of the nation in the south."

del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea pronuncio el dia 7 un discurso con el tema de \"Tratado Comprensivo de Prohibicion de Prueba: Aseguramiento de su vitalidad\" en la conferencia internacional de Moscu sobre el desarme nuclear y la no-proliferacion.\n\t\t\t\t\tAbajo se transmite el texto integro del discurso: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl CTBT (siglas de Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty) se encamina basicamente a no permitir el mejoramiento cualitativo de las existentes armas nucleares y el desarrollo de cualquier nuevo tipo de los mismos artefactos, mediante la prohibicion de las pruebas nucleares de toda clase que acompanan la explosion nuclear fisica en el aire, el espacio y debajo del mar y la tierra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn virtud de ese tratado, los gobiernos de todos los paises firmantes no pueden realizar en su propio pais ninguna prueba de explosion de armas nucleares ni incorporarse en ninguna accion que pueda provocar o fomentar tal explosion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn una palabra, la meta principal del CTBT es eliminar fundamentalmente la posibilidad del desarrollo de armas nucleares. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el caso de que el CTBT ponga en vigencia, hara indudablemente un gran aporte a asegurar la paz y la seguridad del mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo problematico es que a los 16 anos desde la publicacion del CTBT, este no se ha llevado todavia a efecto a causa de que la situacion actual de desarme nuclear es tan distante del ideal del tratado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl desarme nuclear efectivo e intensivo es la premisa del cumplimiento del CTBT. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Pero, en la actualidad el desarme nuclear en escala mundial no esta dando progreso satisfactorio debido a los diferendos y conflictos en funcion de los intereses de las principales potencias nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, Estados Unidos, que emergio como superpotencia nuclear despues del fin de la Guerra Fria con la Union Sovietica, esta dedicando todos sus esfuerzos por tomar medidas para prevenir la aparicion de otra potencia nuclear y asegurar la superioridad absoluta en las fuerzas armadas nucleares estrategicas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por eso, EE.UU. inicio las negociaciones de desarme nuclear para debilitar el poder nuclear de los enemigos potenciales mientras persigue la supremacia militar y estrategica absoluta impulsando la modernizacion cualitativa de sus armas nucleares y construyendo el sistema de defensa de misiles estrategicos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl problema mas serio esta en que EE.UU. mejora la eficiencia de sus armas nucleares sin las pruebas nucleares fisicas abusando de las tecnologias avanzadas como las de prueba nuclear sub-critica con el fin de distraer la opinion publica mundial y encubrir sus siniestras intenciones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPuesto que EE.UU. persigue las politicas autoritarias basadas en la gran capacidad militar, atrapado todavia por el modo de pensar de la Guerra Fria, las tensiones se hicieron mas agudas en el mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Por esta razon, otras potencias nucleares que no pueden alcanzar a EE.UU. en la capacidad militar y economica en general, estan dando prioridad a las armas nucleares en sus politicas de seguridad para defender su posicion manteniendo el equilibro estrategico basico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En el caso de que evadamos la eliminacion completa de las existentes armas nucleares y ejecutemos unilateralmente el CTBT, esto produciria seria desigualdad y desequilibro en la seguridad de cada Estado y causaria consecuencias irremediables en la paz y estabilidad del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hasta el fin del ano 2009, el mundo registro un total de 2054 pruebas nucleares y el 99.99 por ciento de estas fueron realizadas por los miembros permanentes del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Las potencias nucleares llevaron a cabo muchas pruebas nucleares y construyeron su arsenal nuclear hasta que pudieron monopolizar las armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por lo tanto, no son necesarias mas pruebas nucleares para ellas que pueden ejercer sus influencias cuanto quisieran en la arena internacional como potencia nuclear apoyandose en su existente arsenal nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDada esta situacion, los paises como la RPDC no tienen otro remedio que examinar seriamente el problema de firmar el CTBT porque se hallan en las circunstancias especiales que obligan a tener el disuasivo nuclear de autodefensa para hacer frente a las amenazas nucleares directas de EE.UU., unica superpotencia nuclear del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La politica hostil de EE.UU. sobre la RPDC ha sido endurecida durante mas de medio siglo para eliminar a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lo mas serio es que EE.UU. tiene su politica nacional de no reparar en el uso de armas nucleares para atropellar a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En el \"Panorama de la Postura Nuclear 2010\", EE.UU. rehuso a dar la garantia de no uso de armas nucleares contra la RPDC e Iran y asi hizo de ataque preventivo nuclear un hecho consumado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ademas, EE.UU. realiza todos los anos freneticos ejercicios de guerra nuclear anti-RPDC con los medios de ataque nuclear masivo en la Peninsula Coreana y sus periferias.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La constante politica hostil de EE.UU. y sus amenazas obligaron a la RPDC a realizar dos veces las pruebas nucleares y poseer el disuasivo nuclear como parte de las medidas de autodefensa orientadas a salvaguardar la seguridad y los derechos soberanos del pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Hasta los paises como Francia y Gran Bretana, que no estan sometidos directamente a las amenazas de guerra por ser miembros de la OTAN, consideran el disuasivo nuclear como una garantia de soberania y paz. Por eso, es muy natural que la RPDC tomara la misma actitud para la defensa legitima.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Antes de que sean eliminadas completamente la politica hostil de EE.UU. y su amenaza nuclear y se implante en la Peninsula Coreana un sistema de paz permanente, a la RPDC no le queda otra opcion que fortalecer continuamente su disuasivo nuclear de autodefensa al nivel que estime necesario.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta claro que a menos que EE.UU., superpotencia mundial que se considera jugar un \"rol importante\" en la paz y seguridad del mundo, abandone su plan de tomar la supremacia militar basada en las armas nucleares modernizadas y deje de amenazar con ellas a los paises independientes antiimperialistas como la RPDC, la prevencion de desarrollo de armas nucleares a traves de CTBT quedara como mision imposible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSolo cuando el CTBT sea cumplido a condicion de que las armas nucleares fueran canceladas completamente en escala mundial, todos los paises podran asumir las obligaciones y derechos practicamente iguales y justos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn ese sentido, el asunto mas apremiante que el cumplimiento del CTBT es establecer el marco legal internacional sobre la prohibicion incondicional de uso y eliminacion completa de armas nucleares existentes en el ambito mundial y buscar medidas imparciales y proporcionadas para el desarme y la cancelacion basados en la confianza mutua. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara hacer efectivo en la realidad el CTBT, deberian preparar sus premisas y para eso, las potencias nucleares deberan cumplir con su responsabilidad y deber en los esfuerzos por eliminar la fuente de guerra nuclear en el mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEspecialmente, es importante para Estados Unidos, la superpotencia nuclear del mundo, parar todos los actos de aumento armamentista que destruyen la estabilidad mundial, tales como la modernizacion y la convencionalizacion de armas nucleares y el desarrollo de nuevas armas ultramodernas que puedan sustituir a aquellas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi EE.UU. no pone punto final a tales maniobras, no terminara en este planeta la nueva carrera armamentista entre las potencias para defender la seguridad y los intereses estrategicos propios y esto producira graves consecuencias para la paz y la estabilidad del mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo ha sido aclarado reiteradamente, la RPDC cumplira en el futuro su responsabilidad y deber para la no proliferacion como pais responsable con armas nucleares."
