Korea\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, March 30 (KCNA) -- The South Headquarters of the Pan-national Alliance for Korea's Reunification released a statement on Mar. 26, 100 years after An Jung Gun, a martyr, was killed. The statement called on all the Koreans to turn out in the struggle to reject the foreign forces and wipe out the sycophantic and treacherous forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t It said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 100 years have passed since the death of An Jung Gun, but the Japanese authorities still insist on Japan's \"dominium\" over Tok Islets of Korea and continue the suppression and discrimination against the Korean residents in Japan, far from making apology and reparation for the crimes committed by Japan in the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In collaboration with such behavior of Japan, the \"Grand National Party\" and other conservatives in south Korea are making no scruple to conduct sycophantic and treacherous deeds, defaming An and other patriotic martyrs who resisted the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule and labeling the compilation of a directory of pro-Japanese elements as \"leftist action\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In particular, when the Japanese prime minister talked nonsense that \"there was no way but to write Tok Islets as 'Takeshima' in textbooks for primary and middle schools\", the chief executive asked the former to wait for his action. This disgraceful behavior revealed his true colors as a traitor to the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement held that all the people should smash to smithereens the militarist ambition of Japan and, at the same time, drive out the U.S. forces who occupied south Korea to replace the Japanese imperialists, and accomplish the cause of national reunification without fail.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On the same day the south Korean Federation of University Student Councils and the preparatory commission for the Student Committee of the Youth and Students Solidarity for Implementing the June 15 Joint Declaration, too, made public statements urging the punishment of the pro-Japanese and treacherous, puppet dictatorial regime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They appealed to the youth and students to come out in the struggle to force the pro-Japanese treacherous regime to step down at an early date by inheriting the anti-Japanese spirit displayed by An."

Segun los datos recien publicados por el Instituto de Paz Internacional de Estocolmo en Suecia, EE.UU. ocupa el primer lugar en la exportacion de las armas del mundo en el periodo 2005-2009. \n\t\t\t\t\t  Lo que no podemos pasar por alto es que la mayor parte de esas armas fue entregada al Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esto demuestra que EE.UU. es el autor de la destruccion de la paz y la estabilidad del mundo y el promotor que lleva al borde de la guerra la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Asi senala el periodico Minju Joson en un comentario individual del dia 30 y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  No es casual que la Peninsula Coreana se ha convertido en la region mas candente en lo militar en el mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ahora, los belicistas surcoreanos armados con las armas norteamericanas recurren desesperadamente a los alborotos de enfrentamiento militar con la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea y actuan con frenesi para provocar la guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esta realidad demuestra que las armas norteamericanas proliferadas al mundo se utilizan no para la paz sino para las maniobras belicas y el asesinato.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  EE.UU., que crea grandes obstaculos en la paz y desarrollo del mundo y convierte el mundo en el campo de guerra, no tiene calidad de hablar de la  reduccion de armamentos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Durante los 5 anos ultimos, enorme cantidad de armas de fabricacion norteamericana fue entregada al Sur de Corea, lo cual demanda a la RPDC fortalecer mas y mas el disuasivo autodefensivo de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Como ya fue declarado, el Ejercito Popular de Corea mostrara bien el poderio de las fuerzas armadas del monte Paektu y el verdadero sabor de la guerra a los enemigos, si estos toman el camino de la provocacion militar para aplastar en lo militar la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Entonces, cualquier arma moderna de fabricacion norteamericana no podra defender el destino de EE.UU. y los belicistas titeres surcoreanos."
