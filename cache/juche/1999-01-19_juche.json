            "content": "On U.S. military strategy toward DPRK \r\n Pyongyang, January 19 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today runs a commentator's article captioned \"On U.S. military strategy toward the DPRK.\"\r\n   The article calls attention to the boisterous military strategic moves of the U.S., Japan and the South Korean ruling quarters, and says what is clear here is that the Asian version of NATO is brought into shape at the final stage.\r\n   The military tie-up of the U.S., Japan and the South Korean authorities is alleged to be made because of the launch of an artificial satellite in the DPRK and a non-existent \"suspected underground nuclear facility,\" it says, and continues:   The purpose is to take issue with the DPRK and thus secure military power for monopolistic domination over the Asia-Pacific region.\r\n   The region is vital to the U.S. which dreams a dream of becoming the only \"superpower\" in the world.\r\n   The U.S. efforts to bring into shape the Asian version of NATO so as to increase military cooperation and beef up its military power will inevitably get on the nerves of other big countries in the region. The efforts will necessarily invite resistance against the U.S. design for military and economic monopoly from those countries. Then, the Cold War which disappeared in Europe will revive in Asia. The Cold War is, in actuality, reviving in Asia.\r\n   The U.S. is zealously intensifying military preparedness on the pretexts of our \"missile launch\" and \"nuclear suspicion.\" In other words, it claims that non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear arms, is a demand of international laws, as well as  \"top priority\" in its external policy and that as the DPRK refuses to meet the demand, there should be \"military counteraction.\"\r\n   The U.S. allegation that there should be \"military counteraction\" towards the DPRK means that it dislikes the ideology, ideal and system in the DPRK.\r\n   The final aim of the U.S. Korea policy is to destroy the socialist system in the DPRK.\r\n   To this end, the U.S. has left no stone unturned to isolate and stifle the DPRK. It has resorted to the method of appeasement and military pressure.\r\n   The last resort of the U.S. is to carry out the \"operation plan 5027\" for a second Korean War of aggression.\r\n   That is why from the beginning of the year the U.S. in league with Japan and the South Korean authorities is now intensifying military preparedness, zealously bringing into shape the Asian version of NATO.\r\n   Recently, some people of the U.S. cry for such a \"carrot\" as granting diplomatic recognition and lifting economic sanctions to the DPRK for the prevention of the DPRK's missile development and the removal of the \"nuclear suspicion.\"\r\n   We make it clear that as long as the U.S. strategic aim to undermine our socialism remains unchanged, there can be no true improved relations between the DPRK and U.S.   as long as the U.S. does not give up a design to undermine our system, there will inevitably be a military conflict anytime.\r\n   We are in full readiness to annihilate the aggressors at one stroke.\r\n   The U.S. design for monopolistic domination over the Asia-Pacific region will never be realised.\r\n   Military showdown with the DPRK will only precipitate the destruction of the U.S. and its hirelings. They should be mindful of this. \r\n \r\n"

During the trip he had military confabs with senior political and military officials of Japan and South Korea almost every day at which they discussed a \"cooperation system\" over \"inspections of underground nuclear facility in North Korea\" and its \"missile threat.\" \r\n   In a word his junket showed that the U.S. moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK militarily are getting more reckless from the beginning of the year, assuming a new dangerous aspect.\r\n   In meeting with the Japanese reactionaries, Cohen laid stress on the policy of engagement with the DPRK backed by military strength,  saying that it is necessary to strongly deter the DPRK. And, at a \"South Korea-U.S. annual consultative meeting on security affairs\" with the South Korean authorities, he examined and agreed upon the issue of intensifying the deployment exercises of the reinforcements from the U.S. mainland and the \"proposal for taking a powerful military counteraction\" in case of \"emergency\".\r\n   What cannot be overlooked is the fact that Cohen, in a press conference, cried out on somebody's \"provocation\" and declared the U.S. would \"punish it by all means including the nuclear umbrella.\"\r\n   Worse still,  Cohen hinted that the U.S. might use nuclear weapons. Before saying such threatening words, he should have considered what a destructive end such a gamble would bring to the United States.\r\n   The U.S. hawks should know that if they think they can survive a nuclear war in the Korean peninsula kindled by them, it would be a serious mistake. \r\n   \r\n"

Officials were hesitant about building the new process for financial reasons. At that time, Kim Jong Il told them to start the project without delay, saying that even the national safe should be emptied for the happy life of the people, that nothing should be spared for their sake and that this was the calculation method of the Workers' Party of Korea.\r\n   While on a journey by train for personal guidance to Jagang Province in January 1998, he looked out of the window, counted the number of houses and the number of aerials installed on the roofs and found that the numbers are not equal. He took measures for equally distributing television sets to local people.\r\n   One day in December last year, he told officials what makes him pleased and happy. He said that when he hears that people are well off, his fatigue disappears at once and he feels strong even after working without sleep and meals.\r\nThe people's pleasure and happiness are what makes him pleased and happy, he added.\r\n   His popular traits are a source of the Korean people's absolute worship, loyalty and devotion to him.\r\n\r\n"
