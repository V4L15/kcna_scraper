It is the youth league and young people who should undertake it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to put forward the youth league and young cadres, entrust them with important work and help the youth league organisations do work independently so as to train many cadres of excellent caliber who work with ardent zeal, revolutionary sweep and creative initiative. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Strengthening the youth league is required for smashing the anti-socialist moves of the imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The enemies are viciously scheming to infuse reactionary ideology and culture into young people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present situation calls for pushing ahead with the training of the young people in a revolutionary way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the youth league is pushed to the foreground and strengthened, the proud tradition of the Korean youth movement characterized by boundless loyalty to the party, strong sense of unity and organisation and high militancy will last for ever. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
