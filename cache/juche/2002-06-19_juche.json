Stanzaed songs, Pangchang, dances, uninterrupted stage decor and other means of representation are introduced to the opera. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The troupe has produced many music and dance pieces of high ideological and artistic value. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the period of the \"arduous march\" in the 1990s the troupe created and staged the revolutionary opera \"the victory of revolution is in my sight,\" depicting the indomitable revolutionary spirit of a woman soldier of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army, the legendary dance drama \"a touch-me-not\" and others and \"leader is always with us,\" \"the way of victory\" and other famous songs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Tell the story, forest\" and \"a true daughter of the party\" are also staged by the troupe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The troupe received \"Kim Il Sung Order\" in 1982 for its contribution to the Juche-based art development of the country. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
