This is the inevitable result of their unpopular, sycophantic and treacherous politics of kowtowing to foreign forces and relying on them, bereft of the spirit of national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Traitors standing in the way of the independent development of their nation while meeting outsiders' aggressive interests are bound to emerge from among those steeped in sycophancy and dependent on foreign forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lee Myung Bak group, zealously pursuant to the policies of outside forces, is blatantly challenging the June 15 era of reunification as their bootlickers in the moves against national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n It is keen to block the cause of reunification and do harm to fellow countrymen, seeking cooperation with foreign forces, instead of siding with the nation and working hard to protect its interests at a time when the Koreans are striving to regain the sovereignty of compatriots and achieve national reunification by the concerted efforts of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n The inter-Korean relations are inching close to the worst crisis since the publication of the June 15 joint declaration and the danger of war is increasing day by day. The desperate moves of the Lee group to stem the trend of history, depending on foreign forces in utter disregard of the reunification of the country and the destiny of the nation have, indeed, tremendous harmful impact on the development of the national history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  \r\n Military clashes between compatriots will be unavoidable if the south Korean bellicose forces persistently go mad with the moves to provoke a war in collusion with foreign forces, openly calling for even a \"preemptive attack\" on the DPRK. It is quite clear to everybody to what grave danger the destiny of the Korean nation will be exposed in that event. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the bitter historic lesson drawn by the Korean nation that sycophancy and dependence on foreign forces are bound to lead to national ruin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lee group will not be able to escape a stern judgment of history as it is betraying the nation and blocking national reunification with the backing of foreign forces, steeped in sycophancy and the idea of depending on foreign forces. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
