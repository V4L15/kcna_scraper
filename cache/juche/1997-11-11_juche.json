It should also refrain from obstructing Korea's reunification.\r\n   If the U.S. hawks and the south Korean puppets dare infringe upon our sovereignty in defiance of our repeated warnings, our invincible army and people will annihilate the aggressors and provokers and accomplish the historic cause of national reunification without fail. \r\n\r\n"

For instance, they are working to check the Japanese delegation's visit to the DPRK.\r\n   It is no use trying to check progress in DPRK-Japan ties.\r\n   The train bound for improved DPRK-Japan ties which has made a starting signal will run on time.\r\n   The Kim Young Sam regime must cool its anti-DPRK frenzy, desist from poking its nose into others' business and stop its criminal obstructions to the improvement of DPRK-Japan ties at once.    \r\n\r\n"
