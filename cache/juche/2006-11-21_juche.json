            "content": "Adoption of Anti-DPRK \"Human Rights Resolution\" at UN Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, November 20 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA Monday as regards the adoption of a \"human rights resolution\" against the DPRK at the third committee of the UN General Assembly:\r\n The anti-DPRK \"human rights resolution,\" a product of the collusion and tie-up among hostile forces including the U.S. and the EU was railroaded through a meeting of the third committee of the 61st UN General Assembly on Nov.  17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The resolution fabricated by hostile forces, toeing the U.S. line, is full of sheer lies that can convince no one as was the case with the similar one adopted last year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  For this reason the majority of UN member nations including almost all developing countries clarified their principled stands either by voting against it, abstaining from voting or boycotting the meeting. This proves that the resolution, in fact, has no legal validity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and other hostile forces are sadly mistaken if they think they can frighten us by debasing and slandering the inviolable dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK over its \"human rights issue\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and other western countries are deliberately sidestepping serious human rights abuses such as extreme racial discrimination and keeping the world's biggest number of prisoners and horrendous human rights violations such as massacre of civilians in Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine, Lebanon and other countries, while bringing absurd charges of \"violation of human rights\" to some countries. This eloquently proves that the politicization of the human rights issue, selectivity and double standards concerning it have gone beyond a tolerance limit in the international arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and the EU had better put an end to their own human rights abuses before finding fault with the human rights performance in other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We categorically reject the recent \"human rights resolution\" as a product of their anti-DPRK political plot.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The match made me 10 years younger. I drew fresh courage and was dominated by an irresistible impulse to do something for the country and the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The news inspired athletes in particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri Ung Ju, boxing coach of the Pyongyang City Sports Group, said that his boxers are full of resolution to demonstrate the honor of the country with stubborn fighting spirit shown by the footballers at the international games to be held and are intensifying training with a higher goal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The news of the football match is also the topics at streets, families and working sites. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Parents educate their children so they can do a great thing for the country and people as the footballers did. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Workers in the sectors of the railway transport and electric power production are registering fresh successes with a resolution to devote themselves to the development of the country with increased transportation and production.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The constructors are now pushing ahead with various projects including building dams in the upper and lower parts of the river and cladding dams with stones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are carrying out their daily assignment at 120 percent in the project of covering the water tunnel with concrete. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those in charge of assembling generators have finished in the main the assembling of facilities and the electric power system projects so as to produce electricity at hydro-power stations Nos. 2, 3 and 4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A collective innovation has been reported from the construction site of the Orangchon Hydro-power Station. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The builders there have introduced efficient construction methods in the assembling of generators, closing up of the temporary drainage and the foundation work, thus making it possible to carry out the projects ahead of the schedule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The workers of the construction site of the Ryesonggang Hydro-power Station have done the earthen dam project 95 percent and are putting the finishing touch to the construction of the generating room and the assembling of turbines Nos. 1 and 2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have finished the assembling of cylinder for turbines and guide wing and the installment of the waterproof door. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Innovations are taking place at the construction site of the Kumyagang Hydro-power Station, too.

            "content": "Japanese Reactionaries' Anti-Chongryon and Anti-DPRK Campaign Flayed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, November 20 (KCNA) -- The Korean people are bitterly denouncing the Japanese reactionaries for their reckless and frantic hostile policy against and suppression of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) and the Koreans in Japan with the nation's towering rage, declares Rodong Sinmun Monday.\r\n Commenting on this, an analyst of the paper declares: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The Japanese reactionaries have banned the entry of the DPRK ship \"Mangyongbong-92\" into Japanese ports, restricted the reentry permit for Koreans in Japan, cancelled the reduction and exemption of taxes on fixed assets of Chongryon and perpetrated arson, destruction, threat, violence and wild blast against Chongryon organizations and students of Korean schools in Japan in an unbroken chain. All these go to prove their indiscreet anti-Chongryon campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their anti-ethnic, inhuman crimes against Chongryon and Koreans in Japan vividly remind us of the atrocities of the Japanese imperialist brutes that imposed unbearable slavery and national humiliation upon the Korean people and whipped themselves into frenzy to exterminate the Korean nation once and for all during their colonial rule over Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their hostile acts and frenzied suppression of the bare-handed Chongryon and Koreans in Japan clearly show that they are barbarians ignorant of elementary international law, diplomatic usage and morality and a group of gangsters accustomed to terrorism and human rights abuses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should clearly know that any form of sanctions against and suppression of Chongryon and the Koreans in Japan are immediately unpardonable criminal acts of infringing upon the sovereignty and dignity of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an unshakable stand and will of the Korean people to answer Japan's sanctions with tougher retaliation and strictly settle account with it with regard to all its crimes. The tighter the Japanese reactionaries cling to political repression and persecution to put down and harass Chongryon and the Koreans in Japan, the fiercer are the hatred and revengeful thought of the army and people of the DPRK against Japan, their sworn enemy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should stop at once their reckless suppression of Chongryon and the Koreans in Japan, deeply pondering over its catastrophic consequences, and drop their malicious hostile policy toward the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
