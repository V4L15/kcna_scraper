            "content": "Implanting Militarism in Japan Denounced\r\n \r\n.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- Papers Tuesday carry signed commentaries denouncing the intensified drive in Japan to inculcate the militarist idea of aggression into people's mind through the visit to the \"Yasukuni Shrine\".\r\n Ninety-six lawmakers of Japan affiliated with the \"Meeting of Dietmen to Make All Visit Yasukuni Shrine\" went to the shrine in group. When Asian countries voiced protest to this, the Japanese reactionaries tried to justify it, throwing together the balderdash that this is \"an interference in internal affairs\" and only some countries strain their nerves while others remain silent. .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Branding this as a manifestation of militarist self-righteousness and aggressive psychology, the Rodong Sinmun analyst says: .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the Japanese ruling quarters seek in the visit to the \"Yasukuni Shrine\" is to indoctrinate the Japanese people in militarist idea so they may carry forward the \"will\" of the forefathers who engaged themselves in aggression and war. .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are going to great pains to din the militarist idea of aggression into the ears of the Japanese people, particularly the younger generation, through the visit to the shrine. .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Asian people, who suffered shocking misfortunes and pains at the hands of the Japanese imperialists in the past, hope that such blood-stained history will not be repeated. That is the root cause of the opposition of Asian countries to the Japanese ruling quarters' visit to the shrine. .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the Japanese militarists zealously support the visit of the chief executive to the shrine and go to it in group, complaining of the just demand of Asian countries.\r\n Their visit to the shrine is intended to lay an ideological foundation for reinvasion. But they are seriously mistaken. They will pay dearly, if they persist in the visit to the shrine and race headlong to reinvasion, averting their eyes from the change of the times. .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson brands the recent visit to the \"Yasukuni Shrine\" by the Japanese reactionaries in group as a downright challenge to justice and human conscience and warns them not to act on impulse.       \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The second is that a country should not harbor any illusion about the aggression forces' clarion rhetoric about \"peace\" but build up powerful military force by tightening its belt in order to win a victory of justice over injustice and that of peace over war. .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Much water has flown under the bridge since the war between the Soviet Union and fascist Germany. But there still remains on earth the outdated force of imperialism and the danger of aggression and war still hovers. U.S. imperialism, the ringleader of imperialism, is unhesitatingly committing aggression of sovereign countries under the pretext of \"combating terrorism\" to realize its ambition to put the world under its domination. .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The prevailing situation requires the countries aspiring after independence and peace to bolster their military muscle to avert a war and defend their sovereignty and security.       \r\n\r\n\r\n"
