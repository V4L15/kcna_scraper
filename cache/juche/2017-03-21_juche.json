            "content": "DPRK Delegate Discloses Human Rights Situation in Western Countries, S. Korea\r\n Pyongyang, March 21 (KCNA) -- The DPRK delegate disclosed the human rights situation in the U.S. and other Western countries and south Korea at the 34th Session of the UN Human Rights Council on March 15.\n\t\t\t\t\t The delegate said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Humankind has long desired to lead a happy life while enjoying genuine human rights in a peaceful world free from aggression and war. However, this desire is faced with serious challenges.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Right at this moment, many and various forms of gross human rights violations are being committed in different countries and regions of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is the worst-ever tundra of human rights in the world and the ringleader and the mastermind of human rights violations as well.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Cases in point are the extreme xenophobia and racial discrimination, gun-related crimes that claim many lives, an army of the homeless, the unemployed and street people and parental abuse that takes the life of children, and the record high number of prisoners, which makes up a quarter of the world. These are no more than a tip of deplorable human rights violations in the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S.-led human rights violations abroad are in particular appalling the whole world. Wherever the U.S. sets its bloody foot in, there follow endless streams of blood of humankind. Counted among them are the establishment of scores of overseas secret prisons, their brutal torture atrocities and massive civilian casualties and 65.3 million refugees resulting from the aggression against sovereign states committed by the U.S. under the pretext of \"war on terrorism\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The international community and the UN Human Rights Council should no longer tolerate such human rights violations of the U.S. but work collectively to pressurize it into being accountable for its wrongdoings without delay. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Next comes the EU, a group of human rights abusers, which is little better than the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recent years have witnessed within the member states of the EU such unprecedented, uncontrollable state-sponsored human rights violations as Islamophobia, xenophobia and minority abuse, revival of neo-Nazism, and the massive deportation, forced repatriation and forfeiture of property of tens of thousands of refugees.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is in the EU countries that even basic human rights are not guaranteed. Thousands of refugees fell victims to human trafficking, sexual abuse and forced labor and many people are still living under the poverty line.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The EU would be well advised to get rid of its bad habit of backbiting others and fix its own deplorable human rights situation first. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is a classic human rights violator and criminal state that evades the admission of its past heinous crimes against humanity, let alone making apology and compensation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The invasion into Korea and many other Asian countries, the massacre of civilians in those countries and the forced sexual slavery of 200 000 Korean women for the Imperial Japanese army are only part of the crimes against humanity committed by Japan in the last century. No statute of limitations is applicable to such crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan claims that it has agreed with south Korea to settle the issue of sexual slavery with its deceptive apology and a trifle sum of money. This is a mockery of the international community and a contemporary form of deception. Japan should unconditionally admit its heinous crimes against humanity and make an apology and compensation for them without delay before it is too late. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea is by far the worst tundra of human rights in the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a well-known fact that the notorious \"security law\" of south Korea is the one and only fascist law in the world that legalizes human rights violations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It will take ages to enumerate the human rights violations in south Korea, including the forced disbandment of progressive opposition party, the brutal crackdown on pro-reunification forces, the Ferry Sewol disaster that drowned 300 children and the connivance at such cruel atrocities committed by the U.S. troops present in south Korea as sexual abuse and murder.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In April last year, in particular, the south Korean regime commanded gangsters of its Intelligence Service to abduct more than 10 women citizens of the DPRK in Ningbo of China and is still refusing to provide any information on their existence. This is the first-ever group abduction and heinous crime against humanity in the 21st century. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The fact that Park Geun Hye completely severed the inter-Korean relations and openly agitated \"defection from the north\", believing in the bluff of a shaman that the DPRK would \"collapse within a couple of years,\" vividly tells us that the group abduction was also a joint work and conspiracy from start to finish of the shaman and Park.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean regime is the first-ever terrorist ring and den of demons that are keen on committing unscrupulous group abductions to produce many more separated families, while turning a blind eye to the immense sufferings from the national division and territorial split caused by outsiders upon our nation for over half a century. Such terrorists and demons should be brought to justice as soon as possible. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The families of the victims of the group abduction submitted twice last year and again in January this year, letters to the UN secretary-general, the high commissioner for Human Rights and the president of the Human Rights Council, asking for help in the repatriation of victims to their families as early as possible. They are still anxiously looking forward to a positive reply. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The UN human rights mechanisms should bring the south Korean authorities to justice and call on south Korea to send back the victims to their families at once. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is a people-centered socialist state where people are placed at the centre of all considerations and everything serves them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the people in our country are now fully enjoying their independent and genuine rights while leading a happy and carefree life, with firm confidence and optimism about their future, which are ensured by the politics of affording priority, respect and love to the people of our respected Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will continue to crush the ever-more exacerbated moves by the hostile forces to isolate and stifle it and further consolidate and develop the Korean-style socialist system centered on the popular masses."

            "content": "KCNA Detailed Report on All-People Resistance in S. Korea\r\n Pyongyang, March 21 (KCNA) -- The Korean Central News Agency issued a detailed report Tuesday to inform the people of the historical facts of all-people resistance in south Korea which dealt a heavy blow at heinous traitor Park Geun Hye and shook the pro-U.S. fascist dictatorship to its every foundation.\n\t\t\t\t\t The report said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The all-people resistance that lasted more than 130 days since the end of October 2016 was an eruption of the pent-up wrath and indignation of the south Koreans against Park Geun Hye, chieftain of dictatorship and kingpin of corruption and irregularities, who pursued unpopular rule and sycophancy toward outsiders and escalated confrontation with the fellow countrymen in the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Wrath against Park mounted high across the south Korean society as she turned south Korea into the medieval dark land and the barren land of democracy, livelihood and people's rights through the revival of \"yusin\" dictatorship and unpopular rule while treating people as dogs and pigs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was against this backdrop that there broke out Park Geun Hye-Choe Sun Sil scandal, the hideous case of abuse of power, in October last.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the people, young and old, including workers, farmers, lawmakers from the opposition parties, professors, housewives, the aged, and university, high and middle school students and pupils and children, took to the streets holding candlelight.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The declaration on the situation made public by the students and teachers of Ehwa Woman's University became a starting point of the movement for issuing declarations on the situation that swept universities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This movement was joined in by high school students, to say nothing of workers, farmers, academic and cultural and arts organizations across south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Repugnancy against Park and distrust in the present regime grew even among the conservative forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The candlelight action of south Koreans was unprecedented all-people resistance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The people's emergency action for resignation of Park Geun Hye regime was formed with the involvement of more than 1,550 organizations across south Korea, including the 2016 Headquarters for People's All-out Action and the Joint Council of Civic and Public Organizations, on Nov. 9 last year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The number of organizations that joined in the emergency action increased to more than 2 300 with the steady expansion of the ranks of protesters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the people, irrespective of affiliation, political view, sex and age, took part in the action for impeachment of Park.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the period from the first candlelight action on Oct. 29 to the sixth candlelight action on Dec. 3, a total of over 5.03 million people took part in rallies and demonstrations in Seoul while a total of more than 1.28 million in provinces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The number of participants in more than 20 massive candlelight actions that began from the end of October last and lasted on March 11 to celebrate the impeachment of Park hit an all time high of a total of 17 million.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The all-people resistance was held in diverse forms and ways.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Media including newspapers and broadcasting services reported the candlelight actions as breaking news, detailing the public demand and stand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In keeping with the south Koreans' candlelight actions for the impeachment of Park, Koreans residing in different parts of the world including the U.S., Japan, Canada, France and Germany held solidarity candlelight actions, movement for issuing declarations on the situation and demonstrations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The all-people resistance of south Koreans for bringing about new society of independence, democracy and reunification, was a fierce battle against sycophants and traitors and conservative forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group of conservatives issued a white paper praising the administrative records of Park in a desperate bid to maintain the worn-out policy against the nation, reunification and people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Puppet acting president Hwang Kyo An, an accomplice of Park, checked special investigation into Chongwadae and stood against the extension of the investigation period and the puppet Intelligence Service saw to it that mobile phones of high-ranking officials were scrapped to remove evidence of crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The civic and public organizations including the people's emergency action and people from all walks of life intensified their actions, saying that the candlelight revolution should not end as an uncompleted civic revolution just like the June resistance in 1987, and calling for bringing down Park by force if words do not work.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the face of determined struggle waged by the awakened people, the special investigation and the \"constitutional court\" could not but confirm the crimes of Park and make a final decision on impeachment on March 6 and 10.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The all-people resistance which left a clear mark in the history of the south Koreans' struggle proved that force of injustice going against the desire of people and trend of the times while lording it over the people is bound to ruin and nothing can match the united strength of people based on justice and truth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The detailed report stressed that the miserable fate of Park and the conservative group is a deserved one they faced for the thrice-cursed crimes committed through sycophancy toward outsiders, escalated confrontation with the fellow countrymen, unpopular rule, fascist dictatorship and corruption and irregularities."

la sublevacion sin precedentes en la historia del Sur de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 9 de noviembre del ano pasado fue constituida la Accion Emergente de la Poblacion para la dimision del \"poder\" de Park Geun-hye, integrada por mas de mil 550 entidades de todas las localidades del Sur de Corea incluso la Direccion de Movilizacion General del Pueblo de 2016.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon

en otras localidades. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde finales de octubre del ano expirado hasta el 11 de marzo del ano en curso en que se aprobo la dimision de Park Geun-hye, se desarrollo en 20 ocasiones la lucha masiva con velas con la participacion de 17 millones de habitantes en total, cifra nunca vista antes en la historia de las sublevaciones populares. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, la lucha de la poblacion surcoreana se desarrollo de diferentes formas y metodos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos medios de prensa reportaron con urgencia las noticias sobre la lucha con velas transmitiendo en detalles la demanda e insistencia de la poblacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCoincidiendo con la lucha con velas en el Sur de Corea, los compatriotas residentes en Estados Unidos, Japon, Canada, Francia, Alemania y otras partes del mundo tambien realizaron la misma forma de lucha, el movimiento de declaracion sobre la situacion y las manifestaciones de solidaridad con la poblacion surcoreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa sublevacion de la poblacion surcoreana para construir un nuevo mundo independiente, democratico y reunificado fue una enconada batalla con las fuerzas traidoras y conservadoras y las otras serviles a agrandes potencias. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos conservadores surcoreanos publicaron la carta blanca encomiando los \"meritos\" de Park Geun-hye realizados durante su mandato e hicieron todo lo posible para mantener las politicas antinacionales, anti-reunificacion y antipopulares ya fracasadas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl presidente interino Hwang Kyo An impidio el registro del equipo de la inspeccion especial sobre Chongwadae y la prolongacion del periodo de investigacion y se apresuro por eliminar las pruebas materiales del crimen dando de baja los telefonos celulares para el trabajo de los altos funcionarios publicos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa Accion Emergente de la Poblacion y otras entidades sociales y civiles y los habitantes de distintos estratos del Sur de Corea intensificaron la lucha insistiendo en que la revolucion de velas no puede terminar en la civil inconclusa como la sublevacion de junio de 1987 y hay que destituir a Park por la fuerza si ella no acepta la demanda verbal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGracias a la incasable lucha de la poblacion despertada, el equipo de inspeccion especial y la \"Corte Constitucional\" se vieron obligados a confirmar los dias 6 y 10 de marzo, respectivamente, los crimenes de la traidora Park y tomar la decision final sobre su dimision. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa sublevacion popular dejo imborrables huellas en la historia de luchas masivas del Sur de Corea y demostro que se arruinan sin falta las fuerzas injustas como Park Geun-hye que desafian a la aspiracion de la poblacion y a la corriente de la epoca despreciando al pueblo y que nadie puede vencer al pueblo unido a base de la justicia y la verdad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa situacion tragica de Park Geun-hye y la banda conservadora del Sur de Corea es el resultado merecido de sus intolerables crimenes de haber recurrido a los actos vendepatrias, el servilismo a grandes potencias, el enfrentamiento fratricida, las politicas antipopulares, la dominacion fascista y los casos de irregularidades y corrupcion."

            "content": "ACNC ridiculiza la obstinada campana fratricida de complices de Park Geun-hye\r\nPyongyang, 21 de marzo (ACNC) -- El presidente interino surcoreano, Hwang Kyo An, sigue fomentando el enfrentamiento fratricida calumniando a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea aun despues de la dimision de la traidora Park Geun-hye. \n\t\t\t\t\tTan pronto como se diera la decision final de la Corte Constitucional, el llamo por telefono al ministro de Defensa Han Min Gu y al canciller Yun Pyong Se y les instruyo \"prepararse perfectamente para frenar la voluntad de provocacion del Norte (de Corea) y responder inmediatamente a cualquier tipo de provocacion y fortalecer la colaboracion Sur de Corea-EE.UU. y la otra con los paises amistosos para hacer frente a la provocacion nuclear y de misil del Norte\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn su \"declaracion al pueblo\" sobre la dimision de Park, Hwang acuso a la parte connacional usando expresiones como la \"amenaza nuclear y de misil del Norte\" y la \"firme seguridad\". Y convoco la reunion de seguridad en que mando a todo el ejercito que se mantenga de alerta. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHace poco, acudio al puesto de mando en el tiempo de guerra del Cuartel General del Estado Mayor Conjunto donde insistio en \"tomar la firme disposicion de seguridad para que el Norte no pueda cometer una provocacion imprudente juzgando mal la situacion de emergencia nunca vista, causada en el Sur de Corea por la decision de la Corte Constitucional sobre la dimision de la presidenta\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto no pasa de ser un proceder ridiculo para eludir la actual crisis de dominacion creada por la destitucion de la traidora Park cuyo nombre fue registrado como ignominia mas grande en la historia politica del Sur de Corea y para desviar las criticas y burla de la sociedad internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor muy desesperados que fueran sus esfuerzos por crear la \"crisis e incertidumbre de seguridad\", Hwang no puede encubrir su tremendo crimen cometido en confabulacion con la traidora Park Geun-hye ni eludir las criticas de la indignada poblacion surcoreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl es el complice principal que trajo la actual crisis del Sur de Corea y primer traidor que debe ser sentenciado por la historia junto con Park.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde el comienzo del Ano Nuevo, expuso su malsano intento de mantener la \"politica anti-Norte\" de caracter antinacional de la traidora Park, calificada como residuo de la historia, con los disparates como \"mantenimiento de base y principio\" e invento hasta el rumor de la \"posible provocacion del Norte en febrero\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLejos de sacar la leccion del destino tragico de Park, Hwang, residuo partidario de ella, sigue recurriendo a la fracasada politica de enfrentamiento fratricida para eludir la responsabilidad de la crisis actual y reagrupa a las fuerzas conservadoras hablando de la \"crisis de seguridad\", lo cual es intolerable burla e insulto a la poblacion surcoreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora, los habitantes surcoreanos desean unanimemente acoger la primavera tras eliminar a todas las escorias humanas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos gusanos como Hwang seran condenados a la muerte por la historia."
