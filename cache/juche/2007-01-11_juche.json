            "content": "Defence of Global Peace and Security Called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 10 (KCNA) -- To defend the global peace and security at present is an urgent requirement and task of the times which no one can turn aside from as it is a vital issue related to the destiny of humankind. \r\n Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed article. It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S.-led imperialist forces are becoming evermore undisguised in their moves for aggression and war. This requires all the countries to turn out as one to defend the global peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the U.S.-led imperialists that pose the biggest threat to the global peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the basic requirement for defending the global peace and security to deal a deadlier blow at the staggering U.S. imperialists badly beaten in different parts of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is very important to strengthen the non-aligned movement. The NAM serves as a very effective and strong force in achieving the above-said objective. It is necessary to be vigilant against the imperialist forces' moves to drive a wedge and sow the seeds of dissension among its member countries. It is equally important to give momentum to the trend of the world towards regional cooperation and multi-polarization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is essential to foil the moves of the allies of the U.S. imperialists for aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has emerged a dangerous aggressor force in Asia backed by the U.S. Israel has a scenario to attack the nuclear facilities in Iran. The situation is growing tenser wherever there are forces toeing the U.S. line. It is, therefore, important to pressurize and isolate those forces toeing the U.S. war policy to deter them from running wild, while intensifying the struggle against the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary for each country to build up its own strength to defend the global peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The practical experience gained by the DPRK proves that a country can prevent a war and protect its sovereignty and peace only when it attaches importance to the military affairs and bolster its self-reliant defence capability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year, too, the Korean people will smash the moves of the U.S. imperialists to provoke a new war, defend the peace on the Korean Peninsula and firmly protect the global peace and security, united close with all the anti-imperialist independent forces in the world under the uplifted banner of Songun.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
