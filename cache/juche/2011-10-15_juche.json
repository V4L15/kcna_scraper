            "content": "Kim Jong Il Gives Field Guidance to Taehung Youth Hero Mine and Ryongyang Mine\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPyongyang, October 15 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Il, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK, provided field guidance to the Taehung Youth Hero Mine and the Ryongyang Mine.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe first leg of his guidance was the Taehung Youth Hero Mine.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter being briefed on the mine before a big map showing its panoramic view, he looked round the light burned magnesia second processing institute, oval briquette bond production process, oval briquette molding ground, tile production process and other places of the mine to learn in detail about its introduction of science and technology and mineral production.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe expressed great satisfaction over the fact that the mine not only provided a sure guarantee for mass mining and ore-cutting while sharply decreasing earth-scraping by introducing a new open-air mining method of Korean style but is increasing mineral production.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe highly praised the mine for achieving technological progress in the drive for producing light burned second processing goods by a physical method, thus turning out products which bring several times more benefits than first processing products while significantly cutting down production cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSeeing leaves of doors and tiles made by use of light burned magnesia, he said that fixtures and building materials made from them are \"green fixtures\" and \"green building materials\" as they adsorb carbon dioxide, a cause of global warming.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe also expressed satisfaction over the fact that the mine is producing alcohol by use of sawdust and making quality bond from its by-product for using it for the molding of anthracitic oval briquette.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWatching the mines mass produce magnesia clinker and light burned magnesia with anthracitic oval briquette, Juche fuel, as fuel, he noted the mine proved in practice that it did not stop using cokes but declared they are no longer necessary.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter being told by officials that it has become possible to transport and export greater quantities of magnesia clinker and light burned magnesia of high purity produced by the mine through Tanchon Port, he said the Taehung Youth Hero Mine is, indeed, a rich mine rare to be seen in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe dropped in at the Taehung Noodle Restaurant of modern Korean architectural style in the miners village to acquaint himself with its service.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe tasted the noodle and dishes served at the restaurant and wine produced by the mine.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe met with the women employees who volunteered to work at the mine far away from the capital city of Pyongyang more than two decades ago. He kindly called them Pyongyang girls though they were middle-aged and praised their deeds as laudable. He also kindly asked them if all of their parents and brothers and sisters in Pyongyang are well.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe posed for a picture with them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe said that as the Taehung Youth Hero Mine is of weighty importance in the nation's economy and the improvement of the standard of the people's living it is necessary to steadily increase the production of minerals and further raise the quality of magnesia products. He set forth the tasks facing the mine.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe second leg of his guidance was the Ryongyang Mine.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe first dropped in at a general control room. After being briefed on the establishment of the computerized general production control system, he saw varieties of minerals produced by the mine to acquaint himself with the production there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is a great success that the mine exerted tenacious efforts to devotedly carry out the plan of the WPK for mass-mining and mass-ore cutting, thus providing good mining conditions and sharply increasing its production capacity, he noted, repeatedly expressing satisfaction over the fact that the mine turned itself into a huge mineral producer as desired by President Kim Il Sung.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe praised the mine for raising a lot of goats and producing meat and milk for miners' diet by directing efforts to the supply service. It is good that the mine has regularly provided the children of its villages with soy-based milk by increasing the bean production every year and quality socks and stockings produced at a hosiery shop built by itself are supplied to the workers, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe went round the Kumsan Pit No. 2 honored with the title of Twice Three Revolution Red Flag, encouraging the miners.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe personally wore a safety helmet used by the miners and went down as far as a mining face of a deep pit where water was dropping from its ceiling. He watched the latest mining equipment at work.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe said it is a laudable innovation that the mine boldly applied a method of blowing up a whole face, thus leaving no mining sites idle and realizing mass-mining, the success which made it possible for the mine to do in a matter of just one year what was done for 10 years in the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe advanced the tasks to be carried out by the mine.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is necessary to push ahead with the work to build the mine under a long-term plan to demonstrate its vitality as a world-famous magnesite producer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is essential to give definite priority to prospecting for securing more reserve ore fields and, at the same time, take concrete and dynamic steps for cutting based on the latest science and technology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is important to put Pit No.4 of the Tonsan branch mine on a large and modern basis in a brief span of time and steadily update the cutting equipment to meet its need.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe called upon all the fields and units to learn from the revolutionary and militant spirit and work style of the workers of the Taehung Youth Hero Mine and the Ryongyang Mine and bring about miracles and innovations to be recorded in the history of the country in their revolutionary advance toward the year 2012, the centenary of birth of President Kim Il Sung.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe was accompanied by Kim Kyong Hui, member of the Political Bureau and department director of the WPK Central Committee, Jang Song Thaek, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the C.C., the WPK, and vice-chairman of the NDC, Pak To Chun, alternate member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the C.C., the WPK, Kwak Pom Gi, chief secretary of the South Hamgyong Provincial Committee of the WPK, and Ri Jae Il and Pak Pong Ju, first vice department directors of the C.C., the WPK."
