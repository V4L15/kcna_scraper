The fact shows that the Japanese \r\nreactionaries' intention to step up military modernization \r\nunder the pretext of \"threat from the DPRK\" remains \r\nunchanged.  Rodong Sinmun says this in a commentary today.\r\n   Japan's plan to take part in the establishment of the TMD \r\nsystem under the preposterous pretext indicates that the TMD \r\nsystem's target is the DPRK and the military modernization \r\nsought by the Japanese reactionaries is designed to reinvade \r\nKorea militarily and, furthermore, dominate the whole of \r\nAsia, the daily says, adding:\r\n   Such moves of Japan will inevitably enkindle arms race \r\nin the Asian region.\r\n   If Japan, with the fiction of the DPRK's \"threat\", \r\npersistently seeks military aggression and overseas \r\nexpansion in concert with the United States, instead of \r\natoning for what it did against Korea in the past, we will \r\nnever remain an onlooker to what it is doing.\r\n   Those who groundlessly slander others and desperately try \r\nto attain their goal of aggression cannot go unpunished. \r\n\r\n"
