Paektu, the sacred mountain of the nation, grew up, acquiring literary and military arts and training talents and virtues in his early years under the care of President Kim Il Sung, the peerlessly great man who led the anti-Japanese, anti-U.S. wars to victory.

The United States stages military training in over 70 countries of the world on 60 or 70 occasions every year, among them above 30 percent in south Korea.\r\n   The U.S.-south Korea joint military exercises are the largest in the world in the scale of forces involved and most of their military equipment is the newly developed.\r\n   A force 120,000 strong participated in the \"Team Spirit\" joint military exercises in 1993, nearly 700,000 strong in the \"Ulji Focus Lens\" joint military exercises in 1994, and 700,000 strong in the \"Foal Eagle\" joint military exercises in 1996. The force is as large as 4 or 20 times that in other regions.\r\n   Participating in the recent U.S.-south Korea joint military exercises were nuclear aircraft carriers, nuclear submarines, planes for electronic warfare and aerial command and control and other uptodate war hardware, along with F-117 a stealth fighter planes, B-1 B strategic bombers, pioneer unmanned remote control planes and patriot missiles which have never been involved before.\r\n   The war exercises are obviously aimed at taking a surprise attack on the DPRK.\r\n   The south Korean puppets are intensifying the military drills with all three services involved for three-dimensional attack in the sky and the sea and on the ground. \r\n   The United States and the south Korean puppets are strengthening nuclear bomb-dropping, bombing and chemical weapon-attacking exercises.\r\n   All the war exercises in south Korea have been staged according to the U.S. war plan to stifle the DPRK by force of arms.\r\n   The \"Team Spirit\", \"Ulji Focus Lens\", \"Foal Eagle\" and other joint military exercises are aimed at hurling into the war against the DPRK the aggression forces deployed in the areas close to the Korean Peninsula within 24 or 72 hours in the event of \"contingency\".\r\n   The United States is planning to bring in more than 1,600 fighter planes, over 200 warships and military force about 500,000 strong within two or three months after starting a war against the north.\r\n   The United States and the south Korean puppets should not test the military strength of the DPRK by force of arms and not try to frighten or bring to their knees the Korean people with military threats and provocation.\r\n   The heroic Korean people and People's Army remaining unfailingly loyal to the Party and the leader will decisively smash any moves of the enemy and defend the socialist motherland as firm as a rock. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

New positive moves are being made in bilateral relations.\r\n   The home visit of Japanese women is evidence of the benevolent, magnanimous politics of the Workers' Party of Korea.
