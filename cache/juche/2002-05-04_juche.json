            "content": "Asian regional symposium urges Japan's settlement of its past\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 4 (KCNA) -- The Asian regional symposium demanding Japan's liquidation of its past opened in Pyongyang yesterday.\r\n Hong Son Ok, chairwoman of the DPRK Measure Committee for Demanding Compensation to \"Comfort Women for the Army\" and the victims of the Pacific War, made a keynote report there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The report was subtitled: \"1. Damage done by imperial Japan in the Asian region,\" \"2. Japan's attitude and stand toward the settlement of its past\" and \"3. Future tasks to force Japan to make earliest settlement of its past.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is a war criminal state that killed tens of millions of innocent Asian people through wars of plunder and aggression from the end of the 19th century to the first half of the 20th century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the \"Meiji restoration\" Japan perpetrated ceaseless bloody invasions and wars in a bid to conquer Asia and emerge the \"world's empire.\" crimes it committed against the Asian people including Korean, Chinese and people of the southeast Asian countries were beyond human imagination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While pursuing a three-point policy which called for killing everybody, setting fire to everything and looting everything in the occupied areas the imperial Japanese army perpetrated such inhumane acts as wounding or killing tens of millions of peaceable civilians in Korea and china. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The forced drafting of Koreans by the Japanese imperialists was barbarism reminiscent of a medieval slave hunting in view of its size, means and method. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After enacting or revising one after another such evil laws as \"law on national all-out mobilization,\" \"order for labor conscription of people,\" \"revised order for labor conscription of people,\" \"order for labor conscription of all middle-aged men\" and \"order for creation of the women's volunteers' corps and labor\" the Japanese imperialists drafted at least six million Koreans for unpaid forced labor and lured or kidnapped nearly 200,000 girls and married women to reduce them to sexual slaves for the \"imperial army.\" they killed most of them in cold blood in the end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During their occupation of Korea the Japanese imperialists did not bother to commit such murder as shooting or burning to death, burying alive Korean revolutionaries, patriots, progressive people and more than a million innocent civilians. They even killed Koreans by hanging and dismembering them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Material damage done by the Japanese imperialists to the Korean people reached an astronomical figure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to drastically curtailed data released by Japan, it plundered Korea of 363 tons of gold, more than 30 million cubic metres of timber, countless quantities of rice and various resources such as iron ore, steel, zinc and magnesite. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's past crimes can be classified into crimes against humanity, slavery and war crimes as it wantonly violated justice and morality of the international community and international law by infringing upon the human rights of Koreans and other Asian people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has played every possible trick to keep acts of aggression and other crimes it committed in the last century buried into oblivion, refusing even to admit them. it is the only country in the world that greeted the second year of the 21st century without settling its past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n More than half a century has passed since the war, but Japan has neither apologized nor compensated for its hideous crimes committed in the past. On the contrary it has worked hard to embellish and justify them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has neither honestly apologized nor compensated even a bit to the DPRK, its biggest victim, and those who suffered from its crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The movement to force Japan to redeem its past presents itself as an important issue for us this time of the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to create an international consultative body to demand Japan's liquidation of its past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If such body is inaugurated, it will be possible to discuss and organize worldwide a variety of work for an early realization of Japan's postwar compensation and national and regional organizations will be able to take common steps and strengthen solidarity and thus display greater might in putting international pressure upon the Japanese authorities to liquidate their past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also a common task not only for the countries and peoples who fell victim to Japan's aggression but for the world people to force Japan to admit its history of aggression and crimes and make reparation and compensation for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She expressed the expectation that whoever values justice and truth and respects the international law and humanitarian principles would extend positive support and solidarity to this just movement, not allowing Japan to evade liquidation of its past.     \r\n\r\n\r\n"
