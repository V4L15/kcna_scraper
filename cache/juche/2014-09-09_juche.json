life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They paid a particular attention to providing the DPRK with a firm political, military and economic guarantee for creditably performing its duty as a powerful weapon for accomplishing the cause of Juche with a noble sense of mission to protect the destiny of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They regarded the single-minded unity as a mainstay for the revolution and consolidated in every way the unity of the revolutionary ranks in thinking and purpose, morality and sense of obligation, thus laying a firm socio-political foundation of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the whole period of leading the revolution they considered the military affair as the most important state affair and exerted all efforts for bolstering up the defence capability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They built strong self-supporting national economy so that the Korean people could enjoy happiness and wellbeing in the thriving socialist nation for all

Jong Il while thoroughly implementing their behests without an inch of deflection and the slightest concession and settling all the issues arising in the revolution and construction the way the President and Kim Jong Il did.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As clarified in the statement of the government of the DPRK, it will make our every effort to weather the difficulties facing the nation, mend the north-south relations and open up a new phase for independent reunification, and carry out without fail the last instructions of the President and Kim Jong Il for national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The government of the DPRK will as ever remain true to the idea of its foreign policy-- independence, peace and friendship-- and boost the friendly and
