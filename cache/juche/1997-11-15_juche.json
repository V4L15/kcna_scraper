The DPRK is technically at war with the united states.

            "content": "Wet blanket over atmosphere for improved DPRK-Japan ties\r\n Pyongyang, November 15 (KCNA) -- A few days ago, the Japanese Sankei Shimbun in an article entitled \"abducted Japanese are 50\" groundlessly slandered the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.   \r\n   Carrying a testimony of a foreign woman who was allegedly released after being \"abducted\" by the DPRK at the end of the 1970s, it said that the DPRK \"kidnapped\" nationals of different countries including 50 Japanese men and women and has trained them for \"espionage activities\".\r\n   This is false propaganda which can be faked up only by Sankei Shimbun, a group of reactionary hackwriters. \r\nAccordingly, we cannot but consider its false report to be a deliberate provocation to hurt the high international prestige of the DPRK.\r\n   In the past, Sankei Shimbun, in a bid to slander the DPRK, carried many reports woven with fabricated materials full of falsity and deception. Typical of them is \"case of suspected abduction of a Japanese girl\".\r\n   As was fully revealed, this case was a dastardly political drama produced by the south Korean puppets to incite consciousness of extreme confrontation with the DPRK and an outcome of the anti-DPRK hostile policy of the right-wing conservative politicians of Japan who have pursued the policy inclined only to south Korea.\r\n   Far from drawing a serious lesson from the failure of its past anti-DPRK propaganda, Sankei Shimbun is zealously engaging itself in another smear campaign.\r\n   We cannot remain a passive onlooker to their ill-intentioned campaign.\r\n   It does not make any sense that the DPRK, whose foreign policy is independence, peace and friendship, \"kidnaps\" people from Japan, Europe and mideast countries and \"trains them into spies.\" \r\n   We take a serious view of the fact that Sankei Shimbun carried the false article at a time when the work of improving relations between the DPRK and Japan was getting into its orbit.\r\n   Its false propaganda is an act throwing a wet blanket over the atmosphere for improving the DPRK-Japan relations and, furthermore, is an undisguised insult to and mockery of the dialogue partner.\r\n   It is also a criminal act siding with the south Korean puppets desperately trying to bar the DPRK-Japan relations from being improved.\r\n   Now, Sankei Shimbun is in a serious financial crisis. So, it is engaged in false propaganda to earn money from the south Korean puppets. This is an act going against the trend of the times and doing harm to the interests of the peoples of the DPRK and Japan.\r\n   Sankei Shimbun must act with discretion and stop spreading false rumours against the DPRK, mindful that the more recklessly it resorts to false propaganda, the more dearly it will pay for it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
