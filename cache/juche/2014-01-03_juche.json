It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t Seeing vibrant Korean-style socialism demonstrating the invincible might under the leadership of Marshal Kim Jong Un, along the road indicated by President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il, the army and people of the DPRK are convinced of the bright prospect of socialism of Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is displaying the dignity as a satellite manufacturer and launcher and the might as a matchless military power. This is the precious fruition of its firm independent principle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Korean-style socialism is dynamically advancing along the road of independence under the guidance of Kim Jong Un who is leading the revolution and construction the same way as Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il did, possessed of same grit and spirit with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The single-minded unity in the DPRK is developing into purer and more solid one in the present times led by Kim Jong Un. The leader leads service personnel and people to perform heroic feats, believing in them. All the service personnel and people are devotedly defending the leader politically and ideologically by becoming a thousand-fold fortress.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The relations between the Supreme Commander and soldiers are becoming the genuine relations of revolutionary comrades and comrades-in-arms, and all the service personnel and people are thoroughly implementing with loyalty the idea and intention of the leader. This is the true picture of the single-minded unity in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the unanimous desire of all service personnel and people to glorify this year as a year of grandiose struggle, a year of sea changes, in which they usher in a golden age of Songun Korea, and the new centenary of Juche as annuals of victory of Korean-style socialism, true to the noble intention of Kim Jong Un."
