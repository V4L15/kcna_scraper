            "content": "Rodong Sinmun Calls for Propelling Great Advance in Heroic Spirit of Sangwon Workers\r\n Pyongyang, January 24 (KCNA) -- The Korean revolution is more dynamically advancing by dint of the great might of the heroic Kim Il Sung-Kim Jong Il workers who are following and defending the Workers' Party of Korea single-mindedly, says Rodong Sinmun Sunday in an editorial. It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t The workers of the Sangwon Cement Complex produced last year tens of thousands of tons of more cement than that in the peak year in production, a clear demonstration of the revolutionary disposition of the Korean working class going through thick and thin in response to the call of the party and the leader.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the unshakable faith of the Korean workers to more strikingly demonstrate the highest dignity and honor of the Korean working class going by the august name of the great leaders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Sangwon workers surpassed last year the peak year in production of cement with the firm faith that to make a signal boost in the cement production means implementing the behests of the leaders and defending the party policies. Their spirit and mettle clearly show how to exalt the greatest honor of being the heroic Kim Il Sung-Kim Jong Il workers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the torch of the drive for surpassing the peak year in production at the Sangwon Cement Complex flares up across the country to be a more intensive campaign, the enemy's moves to render the DPRK further isolated and ratchet up the sanction and pressure on it are bound to go bankrupt by the self-development of Juche Korea, and the glory will be store in the road indicated by the party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The success made by them in surpassing the peak year in production precisely means the defence of the revolution and the greatest labor gift to the 7th Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea. It is like thrusting daggers into the heads of the imperialist reactionary forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The editorial calls upon all the workers to share idea and intention with the party just as the Sangwon workers did and turn out as one in the drive to usher in a golden era in building a thriving nation."

Korea, Inevitable Product of Sycophantic and Treacherous Politics: Rodong Sinmun\r\n Pyongyang, January 24 (KCNA) -- Political confusion and contradictions have reached an extreme phase in south Korea, throwing the whole society into the worst crisis and touching off public anger, says Rodong Sinmun Sunday in an article.\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Greatly infuriated by the outcome of the negotiations between the south Korean and Japanese authorities on the crimes related to the sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army, south Korean people of various circles are condemning the conservative group for conniving at the past crimes of Japan, and rising up in massive actions to nullify the humiliating \"agreement\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, the Federation of Trade Unions declared the retraction of the \"great compromise among the workers, business and government\" and stop to dialogue in token of the protest against the conservative authorities keen on passing the unpopular bill \"on labor reform\" through the \"National Assembly\" in disregard of the will of the workers, giving further momentum to the anti-\"government\" struggle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural that politics is bound to be in mayhem, economy in the grip of crisis and massive actions are gaining in scope and strength in such corrupt and ailing unpopular society as south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The present crisis is a natural product of the unprecedented unpopular politics pursued by the sycophants and traitors while selling off the interests and dignity of the nation to foreign forces, subservient to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea cannot exist even a day without depending on foreign forces. Herein lie the instability of the south Korean regime and vulnerability of its colonial system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean society is going to ruin due to sycophancy and treachery and is torn off due to corruption and irregularities. Only graves of history wait for the traitors as they have turned south Korea into a veritable hell by enforcing an unpopular rule."
