            "content": "U.S. urged to properly approach DPRK-U.S. negotiations \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 26 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary lashes out at the U.S. authorities for letting loose a spate of jargons about \"threat\" from the DPRK, while talking about their intention to \"resume their dialogue\" with it.\r\n The commentary says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The remarks of U.S. President Bush compel the DPRK to question Washington once again about its true intention of \"proposing the resumption of the dialogue\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The keynote of the U.S. proposal is to adopt nuclear, missile and conventional armed forces-related issues of the DPRK as topics of discussion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But, it is the normal diplomatic practice for the two negotiating parties to sit together and discuss and agree upon agenda items prior to the start of negotiations and hold them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the united states unilaterally adopted the agenda items without any prior discussion with the DPRK side and opened them to the public as agreed items.   This is a rude behaviour in diametrical contravention of the norms of international relations and diplomatic practice calling for impartiality and equality and a sort of pressure and affront to the dialogue partner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Topic of discussion are very serious and delicate issues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n None of the socalled nuclear, missile and conventional armed forces-related issues of the DPRK set out by the United States is acceptable to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the U.S. touted issue of \"missile verification\" is concerned, it is aimed at sifting through the DPRK's national defence industry and military bases. The DPRK has no intention to beg for a dialogue with its bullet-proof jacket stripped off. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"reduction of conventional armed forces\" can never become an object of discussion.  This \"proposal\" is nothing but a crafty intention to disarm the DPRK and put both its areas along the front and rear in a defenseless state in a bid to swallow it up with ease. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unpractical and unreasonable issues raised by the U.S. can never be agenda items of the DPRK-U.S. negotiations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The most urgent and realistic issue to be taken up at the negotiations is the issue of the U.S. compensation for the DPRK's loss of electricity caused by its delay in the LWR provision. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States should drop its impudent and rude attitude to snub the DPRK and lead the negotiations and rectify its conditional and unjust proposal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The prospect of the negotiations depends on attitude of the present U.S. administration.    \r\n\r\n"

It is the unanimous view of experts that Japan can emerge as a nuclear power anytime it wishes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As U.S. politicians admited, if Japan is allowed to go nuclear, this will adversely affect the security not only in the Asia-Pacific but in the U.S. itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is Japan which poses the most dangerous potential nuclear threat to the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world will never allow Japan to do so as the world people are aware of its past history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are well advised to stop talking about the non-existent \"nuclear threat\" from someone but abandon their reckless nuclear program and discontinue their moves for nuclear weaponization.    \r\n\r\n"
