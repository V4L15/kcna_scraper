The vice-chairman of the Indonesian Trade Union said this in a statement issued on October 22 on the occasion of the 24th anniversary of the proposal for founding the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo.\r\n The June 15 North-South Joint Declaration opened a bright prospect of realizing this proposal, he noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"By our nation itself\" is an idea of national independence, the steadfast idea of peace and great national unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This proposition was clarified by leader Kim Jong Il when he met with former south Korean President Kim Dae Jung and stipulated in the declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This proposition is thus publicly recognized as the main idea of the nationwide movement for reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Unilateralism Denounced \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 28 (KCNA) -- The U.S. neo-conservative forces' ballyhoo that the \"world has become peaceful\" is aimed to calm down the international public critical of the U.S. war of aggression and its policy of military presence in Iraq and justify and reinforce its unilateralism and bellicose policy for aggression in a bid to put the world under its unchallenged domination, says Rodong Sinmun Thursday in a signed article.\r\n It continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite clear to everybody that the world can never become peaceful today when the sovereignty and security of different countries are being seriously infringed upon by evermore undisguised unilateralism and military high-handed policy of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is defiant of the international community and public. It resorts to any unilateral act, when necessary, disregarding the international organizations including the UN. It does not bother to commit a war of aggression against those countries, which court its displeasure, after branding them as \"sponsors of terrorism\" and \"rogue states.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the real intention and strategy of the U.S. to frighten the world with its military high-handed practices and dominate humankind. U.S. unilateralism and high-handed practices are a product of its policy for supremacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After declaring the aggressive \"anti-terrorism war\" the U.S. insisted that it was for \"justice.\" The U.S.-advocated \"justice\" is nothing but a subterfuge and fig-leaf to justify and cover up its military high-handed practices and war crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. unilateralism and bellicose foreign policy are the root cause of the present proliferation of nuclear weapons. The U.S. listed various countries as targets of its nuclear attack and has since worked hard to realize its strategy of \"preemptive nuclear strike.\" This compels big powers and other countries to possess or bolster nuclear means to counter it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By a \"peaceful world\" the U.S. means a world where U.S. unilateralism, high-handed and arbitrary practices for aggression are rampant. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. war-like forces are contemplating modifying Bush's conception of preemptive attack in a bid to dramatically extend the sphere of military attack on other countries. This indicates that they intend to perpetrate undisguised military attack and aggression against any region, any country if necessary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. unilateral and bellicose foreign policy is, however, bound to go bust as it goes against the trend of the times and history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to properly understand the desire and will of humankind and face up to reality and abandon its megalomaniac, unilateral and bellicose foreign policy.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Joint Naval Exercise in Tokyo Bay under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 28 (KCNA) -- The U.S.-led joint naval exercise that has been under way in Tokyo Bay of Japan since Oct. 26 is by no means a simple naval maneuver but a reckless preliminary war against the DPRK as it is aimed to lay a siege to it and stifle it by force of arms at any cost.\r\nRodong Sinmun Thursday says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The objective of the exercise is to lay an international siege to the DPRK with U.S.-led allied forces involved and pressurize, blockade and contain it by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is watching for a chance to stifle the DPRK by force at any cost after winding up preparations for a preemptive attack on it behind the scene of the six-party talks. The U.S. pays lip-services to \"peace\" and \"dialogue\" whenever an opportunity presents itself. This is, however, nothing but hypocrisy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the U.S. imperialists are working hard to blockade and stifle the DPRK by mobilizing multinational forces, no one can predict when they will come in attack to swallow up the DPRK unless its physical deterrent force is increased. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any measure taken by the DPRK to bolster its physical deterrent force is urgently required by the tense situation prevailing on the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia. No one is entitled to find fault with this move as it is aimed to defend the sovereignty and security of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is improper for some forces to participate in this joint naval maneuver, chiming in with the U.S. anti-DPRK campaign. Any involvement in the U.S.-led cooperation system to stifle the DPRK would only render the situation more complicated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and its allied forces had better properly understand the stand of the DPRK and its mode of toughest countermeasure and stop acting ashly.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

With this, the speakers added, it has been scientifically confirmed that Pyongyang is the cradle of the Korean nation and the historical holy land which heralded all origins of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Tangun's Korea was one of the ancient states founded early in the 30th century B.C. in the basin of the River Taedong around Pyongyang and a civilized state which took shape on the basis of developed bronze culture, they said, and proved on a scientific ground that the culture of the River Taedong holds a cultural historic position equal to or ahead of the world's four cultures in view of the period of its formation and the level of its development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They called for invigorating the excavation and studies of historic relics, true to the instructions given by Kim Jong Il while going round the mausoleum, and thus adding shine to the time-honored national history spanning 50 centuries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present at the symposium were Thae Hyong Chol, president of the Academy of Social Sciences, Kim Sok Hwan, director of the Bureau for Direction of Cultural Preservation, and officials concerned.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
