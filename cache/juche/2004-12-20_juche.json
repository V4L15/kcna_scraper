            "content": "Day of UN South-South Cooperation Observed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 19 (KCNA) -- Papers here Sunday observe the day of \"UN south-south cooperation.\"\r\n It is the consistent stand of the DPRK government to strengthen and develop the south-south cooperation. The DPRK has steadily boosted the friendly and cooperative relations with other developing countries through this cooperation. Rodong Sinmun Sunday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On December 23 last year the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution (58/220) on marking December 19 every year as the day of the \"UN south-south cooperation\". The theme of the day this year is the \"Achievement of goal of development for millennium through south-south cooperation.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Observing the day worldwide for the first time marks an important occasion in putting the south-south cooperation on a higher stage and demonstrating its vitality in the new century, the article notes, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south-south cooperation represents an international movement to help the peoples of the developing countries achieve economic emancipation and their sovereignty. This cooperation among these countries is a noble work to achieve self-support in economy by economically and technically cooperating with each other and meeting each other's need and the new international economic relations based on their common aspiration and interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to reenergize the south-south cooperation and give full play to its vitality, it is important to properly lay down the principles to be adhered to in boosting the cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The developing countries are called upon to make positive efforts to give momentum to this cooperation on the occasion of the day of \"UN south-south cooperation.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the developing countries strengthen economic cooperation and swap valuable technology and experience by making an effective use of their economic potentials and possibilities, they can successfully build self-supporting national economies and achieve progress and prosperity of nations without relying upon western countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to boost this cooperation it is most important to abide by the principle of collective self-reliance. The developing countries should make every possible effort to establish new south-south economic relations through the expansion and development of the south-south cooperation based on the collective self-reliance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary for them to sincerely implement the action programme for south-south cooperation and projects adopted at the NAM Summit held in Havana and earnestly seek new strategies and ways for south-south cooperation and put them into practice.\r\n Papers in their articles say that the DPRK government will as ever exert positive efforts to boost the south-south cooperation.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

They additionally deployed ultra-modern long-distance striking means including B-52 in their bases for aggression around south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the wake of their deployment of more than 10 F-117 Stealth fighter-bombers in an air force base in Kunsan, south Korea after their participation in the \"reception, staging, onward-movement and integration exercise\" they brought two battalions of \"PAC-3\" to Kwangju, south Korea, from Texas State and B-52 and B-1 long-distance strategic bombers to Guam. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They transferred a squadron of F-15E of the U.S. air force to south Korea from Alaska in the middle of September and deployed Aegis destroyers equipped with an ultra-modern missile system belonging to their 7th Fleet in the East Sea of Korea from October 1 to be ready to go into action. This is just a few examples of their massing of ultra-modern military hardware in south Korea and the areas around it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these facts go to clearly prove that the U.S. loudmouthed \"six-party talks\" and \"negotiated settlement of the nuclear issue\" are nothing but a window-dressing to cover up its bellicose nature and it is, in actuality, stepping up its preparations for a nuclear war against the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S. troops massacred Koreans in a most brutal manner during the Korean war in the 1950s, leaving an indelible blot on the U.S. history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the facts clearly prove that the U.S. is the worst graveyard of human rights and a special class human rights abuser in the present world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has already revealed to the full its true colours as the principal enemy of human rights, the worst violator of human rights, before the justice of the world and conscience of humankind. This has completely deprived the U.S. of its moral right to say this or that about human rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now is the time to bring the U.S. to the international human rights court. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to behave itself, properly understanding its deplorable position in which its moral ruin is drawing near.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA on Achievements in Capital Construction\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 18 (KCNA) -- The Korean Central News Agency issued a report Saturday in which it said that the army and people of the DPRK have made great achievements in capital construction over the last decade since leader     Kim Jong Il held high the banner of Songun.\r\n The report says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this period signal successes have been made in the overall construction including the building of monumental edifices for conveying the greatness of President Kim Il Sung and his revolutionary exploits down through generations and industrial construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Epoch-making changes have taken place on this land even under the most difficult situation where the people had to make the \"Arduous March,\" forced march and they were hard pressed for everything. This steadily added to the treasure of the country. It is the miracle unprecedented in the world history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A shining example was set in building monumental edifices and sprucing up revolutionary historic sites. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the leadership of Kim Jong Il the army and people of the DPRK consecrated the Kumsusan Assembly Hall where the President worked as a memorial palace at the highest level where he lies in state for perpetuity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Il Sung's statues and monuments to his revolutionary history were erected in every place associated with his giant footprints. The area of Mt. Paektu and various other revolutionary battle sites and historic sites have turned into centres for effective education of people in the revolutionary traditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The might of Songun Korea was strikingly manifested in the overall construction including the industrial construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The construction of production units such as factories and power stations that will contribute to boosting modern economic potential has made rapid progress. As a result, at least 49,500 new industrial establishments have started their operation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In hearty response to the order of Supreme Commander Kim Jong Il, servicepersons of the Korean People's Army built the Anbyon Youth Power Station. The construction of large hydraulic power stations including Thaechon Power Station No. 3 was accelerated in various parts of the country. Many minor power stations have appeared in various places, more than doubling the generating capacity of the minor power stations of the country as compared with that in Juche 84 (1995). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A lot of light industrial factories were built or updated. They include the Sinuiju Cosmetics Factory, the Taedonggang Beer Factory, the Potato Starch Factory under the Taehongdan County Agricultural Management Committee, the Instant Noodle Factory, the Sanitary Goods Factory, the Taedonggang Syringe Factory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There have appeared modern chicken farms, fish farms and stock farms to greatly contribute to improving the people's living standard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There have sprung up many fish-breeding centers to make the fish-breeding brisk. As a result, the area under fish cultivation has grown more than 5 times and the production of fresh water fish more than 7 times that in Juche 84 (1995). \r\n Many large stock-farms and co-op farms specializing in stock-raising have appeared. The production of goat milk has more than trebled as compared with that in Juche 84 (1995). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Salterns including the Kwangmyongsong Saltern and the Wonsan Bay Saltern, the first of their kinds in the nation's history, were built on the east coast of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A large number of modern dwelling houses have been built in urban and rural areas to provide the people with more comfortable and highly civilized living conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pyongyang has been spruced up as required by the new century and the rural villages have turned into a socialist land of bliss. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n New houses for more than 458,000 families have appeared and at least 1,600 new villages taking the country as a whole. They include modern houses of peculiar architectural style for more than 3,580 families built in Samjiyon County Township, a new city in the forest at the foot of Mt. Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Gigantic land realignment project for the prosperity of generations to come has been carried out. As a result, more than 284,000 hectares of paddy and dry fields have been realigned into those of standardized shapes as of the end of March Juche 93 (2004) taking the country as a whole. \r\n Waterway projects have been pushed forward to form the irrigation networks extending at least 400 kms on the west coast. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The servicepersons and people wound up the Kaechon-Lake Thaesong Waterway Project, the great nature-driven waterway of Korean style, in a matter of a little over two years and declared its commissioning in October Juche 91 (2002). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While making the \"Arduous March,\" the Korean people established an 40-odd km-long circular irrigation system in December Juche 84 (1995) under which the West Sea Barrage-Sinchon and Pyoksong waterways are connected with Kangryong County. In Juche 85 (1996) they completed the second-phase project of a 64-odd km-long waterway project to water orchards. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The over 40 km-long modern Youth Hero Motorway linking Pyongyang to Nampho was completed in a matter of less than two years, demonstrating the heroic stamina and the indomitable fighting spirit of the Korean youth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n More roads were paved for study tour of the revolutionary battle sites in the area of Mt. Paektu and courses for tourists have been built in Mt. Chilbo, a famous mountain on the east coast of the country, to match its scenic beauty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This period witnessed the construction of modern Chongryu Bridge and Kumrung Tunnel No. 2 and major arterial roads such as Pyongyang-Hyangsan Tourist Road and roads linking counties to ris and those leading to revolutionary battle sites and scenic spots, which extend hundreds of kilometers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These monumental edifices are eternal treasures for the country's prosperity and people's happiness and precious ideological and material boon to building a great prosperous powerful socialist nation, the report said, stressing that these epoch-making changes are a clear proof of the validity and the tremendous vitality of the Songun politics and the Songun revolutionary leadership of Kim Jong Il who has successfully carried forward the President's unique Songun revolutionary idea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
