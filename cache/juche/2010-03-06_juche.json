            "content": "Kim Jong Il Praises Feb. 8 Vinalon Complex Builders\r\n Pyongyang, March 6 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il on Friday sent a letter of special thanks to the workers, technicians and officials of the February 8 Vinalon Complex for having brought about a great auspicious event by successfully building a modern vinalon factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t In his letter Kim Jong Il noted that the February 8 Vinalon Complex is a historic complex associated with the great efforts and undying leadership exploits of President Kim Il Sung who dedicated his whole life to the happiness of the Korean people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to glorify the immortal revolutionary feats of the President, pioneer and builder of the Juche-oriented vinalon industry, down through generations, I provided field guidance to the complex and issued an order to build a modern vinalon factory as required by the new century and took revolutionary measures for dynamically pushing ahead with the construction project.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our trustworthy workers in the field of vinalon industry actively tapped latent reserves and kicked off waves of a dynamic socialist emulation in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude even under the hard conditions where everything was in short supply, achieving such eye-opening success as building modern production processes of vinalon, agrochemicals and dyestuff. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The workers, technicians and officials of the complex put the vinalon production process on a CNC basis and radically changed the appearance of the complex as required by the IT age, true to the idea and intention of the Party to push back the frontiers of science.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They successfully completed in a matter of two years the project for the modernization of the complex, which would have taken more than a decade at an ordinary pace, and began mass-producing vinalon belt fiber, vinalon cotton, agrochemicals, dyestuff and varieties of other chemical products. This is the result of their manifestation of tremendous mental power and a great auspicious event of the whole country foretelling a rosy future of a great prosperous and powerful nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The start of production at the February 8 Vinalon Complex which has turned into a modern young one made it possible to give fuller play to the might of the Juche-oriented vinalon industry established by the President and realize at last the lifelong wishes of the President who made indefatigable efforts and worked heart and soul to enable our people to benefit from the vinalon production.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The complex, which is of key importance in the nation's economic development and people's living, has turned into a modern huge chemical centre demonstrating its tremendous capacity. This is an extra-big event as important as launching a new type A-bomb and represents a great victory of socialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The trustworthy workers of the complex, who protected the equipment of the complex, tightening their belts during the \"Arduous March\", forced march, made the complex go operational again though it had remained at a standstill for 16 years, hitting the back of the heads of the imperialists hell-bent on applying sanctions against the DPRK in a bid to stifle it and demonstrating that no formidable enemy can ever bring the Korean people to their knees.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Looking again and again at the vinalon cotton, a product of the indomitable mental power of the workers in the field of vinalon industry, I was overwhelmed with the excitement at the thought that I can make a report on another victory to President Kim Il Sung out of joy and our people came to enjoy happiness after spending years of hardships.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are the genuine soldiers and disciples of the President and true heroes and patriots born of the era of a revolutionary great surge as they glorified in practice the President's Juche-oriented idea of building a vinalon industry and exploits and made a breakthrough towards improving the people's standard of living.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Party and the people will always remember the feats they have performed by providing a bright prospect for improving the people's standard of living and achieving the prosperity of the country by building a modern vinalon factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I note with great satisfaction that the workers, technicians and officials of the complex successfully built a modern vinalon factory in the spirit of thoroughly implementing the Party' instruction, the spirit of flattening even a high mountain if requested by it, thus demonstrating the spirit of socialist Korea advancing towards a thriving nation riding Songun Chollima. I highly appreciated your heroic feats. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The February 8 Vinalon Complex should operate the newly built modern production processes at full capacity without a moment's standstill to keep the production of such chemical products as intermediary vinalon products, vinalon cotton, agrochemicals and dyestuff going at a high rate and play a very big role in radically developing the nation's light industry and agriculture and bringing about a turning point in improving the people's standard of living. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is my firm belief that they will bring about a fresh boost in the production of chemical products and make a positive contribution to effecting a radical change in improving the people's standard of living and opening the gate to a thriving nation, deeply aware of their heavy mission and tasks they assumed before the Party, the revolution, the country and the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A meeting for conveying the letter was held in Hamhung on the same day. It was conveyed by Kim Yong Nam, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and president of the Presidium of the DPRK Supreme People's Assembly."
