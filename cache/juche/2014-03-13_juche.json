This is nothing but a ridiculous jargon of those who can not understand the advantageous election system of the DPRK as they are engrained with repugnance toward the Korean-style socialist system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. had better feel ashamed of the American-style election which decides everything with fraud and swindle and its dollar-almighty election system in which a duck on a pond can be a president if it has money, and mind its own affairs before impudently finding fault with others.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how desperately the U.S. may try to slander the social system of the DPRK and pull it down, its single-minded unity will be further consolidated and Korean-style socialism centered on the popular masses will emerge victorious."

Worse still, the U.S. will lose its initiative in the issue of the Korean peninsula, and also not a few arms markets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is clear that the U.S. is a very mean villain and rogue state which seeks to fish in troubled waters by inciting the confrontation between the north and the south of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is better for the U.S. to behave itself, knowing if the sun rises in the east or west and how the world affairs develop.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK regards vituperations let loose by the U.S. as exhausted screams of old hooligans making desperate efforts to sustain their waning life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With no rhetoric can the U.S. arrest the victorious advance of the DPRK."
