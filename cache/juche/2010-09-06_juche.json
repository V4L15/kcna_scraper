            "content": "Withdrawal of US Forces from S. Korea Demanded\r\n Pyongyang, September 6 (KCNA) -- The Jurists Institute of Korea released a white paper Monday exposing the background against which the U.S. forces occupied south Korea, which marked the beginning of the division and misfortune of the Korean nation, and its illegality in connection with the lapse of 65 years since the U.S. enforced its colonial rule over south Korea after occupying it on Sept. 8, 1945.\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the U.S. forces' occupation of south Korea was a product of the U.S. policy of dominating the whole of Korea, the white paper explained how it put south Korea under its control. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It went on: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. stretched tentacles of its aggression to Korea from a century ago. It persistently tried hard to put the whole of Korea under its control under the pretext of \"trusteeship\" during World War II, pursuant to its strategy of world domination.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the Korean People's Revolutionary Army launched an all-out offensive operation for crushing the Japanese imperialists together with the former Soviet Army on August 9, 1945, this made Japan's surrender as clear as daylight. Much afraid of losing even an opportunity to set foot on the soil of Korea, the U.S. was busy hatching a plot to occupy even half of Korea at any cost. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the end of a series of confabs the U.S. came out with a proposal \"for fixing the line for sharing the operation\" to disarm the Imperial Japanese Army. This proposal was conveyed to MacArthur, commander-in-chief of the allied forces in the Pacific, on August 15 and put into practice. On Sept. 2, 1945 the U.S. let MacArthur to announce that the U.S. forces will occupy the areas south of the 38th parallel in Korea on U.S. imperialist aggression forces' warship \"Missouri\" that entered Yokohama Port, Japan. On Sept. 4 37-member advance team belonging to the 24th army corps of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces arrived at Kimpho, south Korea by air. The U.S. mobilized a great number of warships of its navy and even civilian ships to ensure Inchon landing of the Okinawa-based main force of the army corps on Sept. 8.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. hurled more than 45,000 troops belonging to 6th, 7th and 40th divisions under the 24th army corps of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces to south Korea till October 1945, thus putting the whole of south Korea under its control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The line extending hundreds of kilometers divided Korea into two parts. As a result, 514 villages disappeared, 8 counties and 122 villages, rivers, streams, railways and roads were divided into the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The white paper cited concrete facts to prove that the U.S. occupation of south Korea was a wanton violation of the sovereignty of the Korean nation, a blatant breach of international agreements on the Korean issue and a flagrant violation of the universally recognized war laws and regulations of international law. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  After faking up the Syngman Rhee regime in the wake of its occupation of south Korea the U.S. ignited the Korean War to seize the whole of Korea and perpetrated the most cruel and barbarous air raids, bombardment and massacres, the white paper noted, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Though the old century is replaced by a new one, the dark clouds of a war are still hanging over the Korean Peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSince the division of Korea by the U.S. the people in the north and the south of Korea suffered damages to the tune of 64,959,854 million U.S. dollars as of 2005 and 43,139,020.63 million U.S. dollars as of 2003 respectively.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The white paper strongly demanded the U.S. halt its domination and interference in south Korea and pull its forces out of it without delay as required by the new century in which reconciliation, cooperation and development have become a main trend. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It called upon all the peace-loving people and progressive jurists the world over to extend full support and solidarity to the Korean people in their just struggle."

Due to these anachronistic and treacherous hostile feelings toward fellow countrymen the inter-Korean relations have been driven into a collapse and the danger of a war is increasing on the Korean Peninsula as the days go by. \n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Monday says this in a signed article.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hostility toward fellow countrymen is the root cause of the collapse of the inter-Korean relations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak group is regarding the DPRK as its rival in the confrontation, denying the idea of \"By our nation itself.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As soon as the group came to power, it has systematically brought to naught landmark achievements made in the inter-Korean relations under the banner of the June 15 joint declaration, talking about what it called \"lost decade.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Due to these reckless acts of the south Korean ruling forces the inter-Korean relations have been brought to a collapse and the June 15 era of reunification has hit a big snag.

Y en el periodo de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, en virtud de su estrategia de dominar el mundo, el imperio recurrio obstinadamente a las maniobras para dominar toda Corea bajo el rotulo de \"administracion en fideicomiso\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pero, el 9 de agosto de 1945, el Ejercito Revolucionario Popular de Corea desarrollo junto con el ejercito de la ex URSS la ofensiva general para aniquilar a los imperialistas japoneses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ante la evidencia de la capitulacion de Japon y por su temor a perder la posibilidad de asentarse en el territorio coreano, EE.UU. se apresuro a idear algo para apoderarse a toda costa de la mitad de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Al cabo de debates continuos, planteo el \"proyecto\" de desarmar al ejercito japones en las partes divididas de Corea \"para las operaciones militares\", el cual fue notificado el 15 de agosto al comandante en jefe del ejercito estadounidense en la region del Pacifico, MacArthur, quien lo puso en practica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El 2 de septiembre de 1945, EE.UU. mando a MacArthur anunciar desde el buque de guerra \"Missouri\", anclado en el puerto de Yokohama de Japon, que las tropas norteamericanas tomarian la zona al sur del paralelo 38o de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Dos dias despues, llegaron a bordo de avion a Kimpho del Sur de Corea 37 soldados como avanzada del 24o cuerpo de las tropas agresoras norteamericanas, y el dia 8, desembarco en Inchon el grueso de este cuerpo, que estaba estacionado en Okinawa, usando los buques de la fuerza naval norteamericana y hasta los barcos civiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hasta octubre de 1945, introdujo en el suelo surcoreano a mas de 45 mil efectivos de las divisiones no. 6, 7 y 40 del 24o cuerpo de las tropas norteamericanas, de manera que se completara la ocupacion de todo el territorio surcoreano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Debido a la linea de demarcacion militar de centenares de kilometros que atraviesa el medio de la Peninsula Coreana, desaparecieron 514 poblados y se dividieron en el Norte y el Sur 8 distritos, 122 aldeas, rios, riachuelos, vias ferroviarias y carreteras. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La ocupacion del Sur de Corea por parte de las tropas norteamericanas fue un grave atentado a la soberania de la nacion coreana, una traicion cinica a los convenios internacionales sobre el problema coreano y una flagrante violacion a las reglas de guerra reconocidas por la ley internacional:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tras ocupar el Sur de Corea y fabricar el \"poder\" de Syngman Rhee, EE.UU. provoco la guerra coreana  con el fin de apoderarse de todo el territorio coreano y perpetro de manera mas salvaje y barbara los bombardeos, canoneos y masacre. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Desde entonces hasta la fecha, o sea, de un siglo al otro, persiste en la Peninsula Coreana el nubarron de la guerra. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El monto total de las perdidas, que EE.UU. causo a los habitantes norcoreanos y los surcoreanos desde cuando dividio a Corea en dos partes, llega a 64 billones 959 mil 854 millones de US$ (hasta 2005) y 43 billones 139 mil 20 millones 630 mil US$ (hasta 2003), respectivamente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Finalmente, la carta blanca exige fuertemente a EE.UU. dejarse de sus maniobras dominacionistas e intervencionistas en el Sur de Corea y sacar sin demora a sus tropas ocupantes del suelo surcoreano, de acuerdo con la demanda del nuevo siglo en que la reconciliacion, la cooperacion y el desarrollo se hacen una corriente principal. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Exhorta a los pueblos pacifistas y los juristas progresistas de todo el mundo a enviar el activo apoyo y la solidaridad a la justa lucha del pueblo coreano."
