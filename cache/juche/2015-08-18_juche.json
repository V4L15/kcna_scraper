            "content": "Japan's Future Is Gloomy: KCNA Commentary\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, August 18 (KCNA) -- After the \"statement to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of WWII\" by Japanese Prime Minister Abe was published, the world understanding of Japan has become worse.\n\t\t\t\t\t The international community has long paid attention to his statement to be published to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II hoping that Japan would sincerely apologize to the peoples of the victimized states and clearly part from the history of militarist aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But his statement for which the world has so far shown concern made no mention of honest admission and apology for Japan's history of aggression. So, the Japanese people and the international community unanimously estimated that the statement made a big retreat in the understanding of history from the one made by the then Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama in August 1995 marking 50 years since Japan's defeat in the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the past century Japan ran amuck for the aggression war with the wild ambition of the \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\" and inflicted great disasters on the peoples of different countries in Asia and the world only to fall into a deep abyss of ruin to the end.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In particular, Japan's aggression of Korea and colonial rule over it that lasted at least four decades were unprecedentedly atrocious and brutal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During occupation of Korea the Japanese imperialists massacred more than one million innocent Koreans, forced murderous slave labour after forcibly drafting over 8.4 million people and made 200 000 women sexual slaves for the Imperial Japanese Army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, Abe cried out for sort of future and responsibility and contribution to the international community with ambiguous phrases of reflection and apology, not mentioning any word of apology and reflection on the hair-raising crimes and unspeakable damage done by Japan against Korean and other Asian people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Abe let loose a string of shameless remarks that women's honor was defamed due to war, not mentioning the atrocities committed by the Japanese imperialists, the unprecedented crimes such as the forcible drafting of many Korean women for the sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army. He went the lengths of blaring that posterity having nothing to do with war should not be made to continue to make apology as the number of those who were born after the war make up the overwhelming majority of the population. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's past liquidation is an urgent matter good for itself rather than for others.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That is why many Japanese with a proper thinking faculty about Japan's future have asserted that the government should make a bold decision for the past liquidation at an early date.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 67 percent of the respondents polled recently by the Kyodo News answered that the chief executive should include an expression of apology for the colonial rule and aggression in his \"statement to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of WWII\", a reflection of the Japanese people's mindset.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In a press conference as regards Abe's statement, Murayama charged that his sentences failed to give impression that Japan honestly apologized for its colonial rule and aggression which were very bad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The chairman of the International Relations Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives in a statement said it is very regretful that Abe neither apologized to the victims of Korea and neighboring countries nor made any mention of crimes related to the sexual slavery. Michael Honda, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives said Abe's statement is an insult to the victims of the \"comfort women\" for the Imperial Japanese Army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t BBC of Britain and media of France and Germany said that Abe did not make direct and official apology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts prove that the ruling forces of Japan are blatantly challenging the international community demanding its past liquidation, far from reflecting on the history of aggression on the 70th anniversary of the defeat of the Japanese imperialists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If this is a true picture of Japan, its future is gloomy, indeed."

            "content": "DPRK History Society Discloses Japan's Crime Related to Ulmi Incident of 1895\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, August 19 (KCNA) -- The History Society of the DPRK Wednesday released a memorandum denouncing the Japanese reactionaries  for trying to cover up the despicable crime of the Ulmi Incident of 1895 committed by the Japanese militarists and to evade the responsibility for it. \n\t\t\t\t\t Branding the Ulmi incident in which the Japanese militarists killed the Empress Myongsong in a brutal and cruel way as a hideous crime gravely violating the sovereignty of the Korean people, the memorandum went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the time of the incident Korea was on the decline owing to the evermore intensified moves of the capitalist powers for aggression and the incompetent rule by the feudal ruling quarters. However, Korea was still maintaining its status as an independent state and exercising its sovereignty. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As for Empress Myongsong, she was the then representative of the state power who was taking the helm of state affairs representing Emperor Kojong. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese militarists stormed the imperial palace of an independent and sovereign state and cruelly murdered the Empress. This was a hideous crime against humanity as it was wanton violation of sovereignty of Korea and an intolerable infringement upon the dignity of the Korean people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By committing the Ulmi incident in breach of the basic principles of international law, the Japanese militarists sought to turn Korea into its exclusive colony.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Ulmi incident was the state-sponsored terrorist crime committed by the then Japanese government. It was proved by all facts including the purpose of the incident, how it was carried out and disposal of the aftermath. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The purpose was to block Czarist Russia's expansion of power toward Korea and realize the ambition for unchallenged domination. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To this end, Japan tried to remove Empress Myongsong, head of pro-Russian group, to easily realize the ambition for aggression. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After finding the murder of Empress Myongsong as the best way for changing the Korean feudal government's pro-Russia policy into the pro-Japanese policy the Japanese militarists planned to assassinate the Empress by the use of pro-Japanese element Pak Yong Hyo, the then minister of internal affairs of the Korean feudal government, through Japanese minister resident to Korea Inoue. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Shocked by the failure of assassinating the empress, the Japanese government directly worked out a plot to kill the Empress in a bid to turn in its favor the policy for aggression of Korea that faced the crisis of total destruction. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The whole process in which the Empress was murdered by Miura-led Japanese murderers fully proved that the Ulmi incident was cooked up by the Japanese government. It was also proved by what Japan did later to deal with the aftermath of the incident. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Ulmi incident was the brigandish crime showing brutality and shamelessness of the Japanese militarists. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The murder of the Empress was the most brutal and monstrous one unprecedented in the history of the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its brutality and cruelty were proved by the eyewitnesses and testimonies of people in different countries who investigated the fact later. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The then Japanese militarists also admitted its brutality and cruelty. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The shamelessness of the Japanese militarists was fully revealed by the cunning moves they resorted to cover up the truth of the Ulmi incident and shift the blame for the incident on to Koreans. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the Japanese militarists tried to distort the fact to give impression that it had nothing to do with them under the foolish calculation to evade the responsibility for the crime. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Later the Japanese militarists obtained the exclusive possession of all the historical materials of the Korean feudal government and removed all the records related to the killing of Empress Myongsong so that they would not be an object of future controversies as far as the responsibility for the incident was concerned. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, no fraud can cover up the historical truth. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean people will never forget the crime related to the Ulmi incident committed by the Japanese militarists but force Japan to make an apology without fail."

Purge is an essential means for the puppet forces to prop up their regime as they resort to repression and bestial suppression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park grumbled that the north is \"wrecking peace and going against south-north integration\" while not responding to the \"proposal for dialogue\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If she had been sincere in her proposal for dialogue, she would have buckled down to creating an atmosphere for it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From the outset of the year, Park and her group, however, have escalated confrontation totally going against the resumption of dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This time, she trumpeted about the inviolable nuclear issue of the DPRK once again. Not only all the Koreans but the world public regards the DPRK's nuclear deterrence as a treasured sword for protecting the peace of the country and security of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Only Park is denying this universally accepted truth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She vociferated about the trite \"north's deed\" peppered with intrigues and fabrications. She unhesitatingly said that the north is \"threatening security\" through \"cyber attack\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She wagged her venomous tongue to let loose a spate of invectives such as \"provocation and threat\" and to say the north will \"invite isolation and ruin by itself\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is Park who does not know even the conception of provocation and threat.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Though belatedly, she should study the conceptions of provocation and threat and acknowledge herself to have been a chieftain committing provocation and threat on this land.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She talked rubbish that \"an opportunity is being given now\", trumpeting about the July 4 joint statement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We would like to ask Park who dared talk about the July 4 joint statement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Does she sympathize with the principle of independence that calls for settling all the issues arising between the north and the south, large and small, from the stand of attaching importance and giving priority to the nation without dependence on foreign forces and free from their interference?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Does she approve the principle of peaceful reunification that reflects the patriotic spirit of protecting the living place of fellow countrymen from war disaster and guaranteeing the co-prosperity of the nation?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Has she willingness to accept the spirit of By Our Nation Itself and the principle of great national unity, which is the nation's mode of existence the key point of which is that division leads to ruin and reunification to powerful nation, and engine of improving north-south relations?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If she stands before the solemn questions of all Koreans, she will get ablush as she has so far become all the more hysteric going against all of them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Resentful is that she talked crafty venoms as if she were interested in settling the issue of \"separated families\" which had already gone bankrupt. Lurking behind this is her ill purpose to calm down the people's mindset against her self-opinionated and shameless unpopular rule.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This time, she talked nonsense that she would create \"world ecology peace park\" in the Demilitarized Zone to make it a \"new axis for realizing cooperation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nonsensical is her call for creating the \"peace park\" in the biggest hotspot in the world, where the worst confrontation persists and a war may break out any moment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She also made all kinds of spurious remarks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Explicitly speaking once again, she should set right the bad situation in south Korea before caring for and discussing the life of someone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how glittering make-up she may put, it is too late to prevent the foul smell from reeking off from her body interwoven with sycophancy, treachery, confrontation and hostility.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What she should do for the nation is to leave Chongwadae, the doghouse of the U.S., shut her unshapely mouth and get her crime-ridden body buried in the ceremony at an early date."
