He decided to attack the county town where a large Kwantung Army unit, a puppet Manchukuo army unit and puppet Manchukuo police and self-defense corps were posted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He convened a joint meeting with officers of the Anti-Japanese Guerilla Army and the National Salvation Army to work out a detailed operation plan for the battle of Dongning County Town.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The main thrust of the battle was directed against a two-storied fort built on a mountain ridge outside the west gate.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe President ordered a company of the guerilla army to advance along the main line of attack.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At 9 p.m. of September 6 a unit of the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Army which had approached the enemy's line by stealth concentrated its fire on the fort when the President made a signal shot for the attack.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Embarrassed by the attack, the enemy reinforced its troops continuously through a communication trench and a secret underground passage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The President made the guerrilla unit which had stormed into the town blockade the enemy's barracks while other forces bypassed the fort to the north so as to divert the enemy's fire; then he sent in a demolition team to seize the fort by means of a violent bomb attack.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe fort abandoned resistance and fell quiet near dawn.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The guerrilla main force surrounded the barracks of the enemy in tight formation and mercilessly checked the enemy's desperate attempt to launch a counterattack.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The guerrilla army units killed or wounded a lot of enemy soldiers and captured war supplies in the battle. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The victory won in the battle of the Dongning County Town thanks to the brilliant military intelligence and superb command of the President demonstrated the might of the guerrilla army to the full and dealt a heavy blow to the enemy."

It used this type bombs in killing resistance fighters and innocent civilians in Vietnam. The U.S. dropped these bombs in Iraq during the Gulf War. After the advent of the new century the U.S. developed super-large bombs including BLU-118B whose explosive power is equivalent to that of smaller nuclear bombs under the pretext of a \"war on terrorism\" and used them in the Afghan and Iraqi wars. The U.S. production and deployment of those type bombs precisely mean a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No wonder, the international community expressed deep concern about the plan for the earlier deployment of MOP when the U.S. announced it early in August just before the start of Ulji Freedom Guardian, denouncing it as a serious threat to the world peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. moved up the period of equipping its forces with MOP three years as compared with the schedule. The Iranian people hardly repress their indignation, saying that this meant the implementation of its war scenario has been stepped up so much. An Iranian Netizen denounced the U.S. development of the said bombs as \"a fanatic act bereft of human reason.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to an opinion poll conducted through Internet in China, 91 percent of the respondents asserted the need to \"strongly denounce\" the U.S. development of super-large bombs. An arms control expert of Tsinghua University said it is nothing but an excuse for the U.S. to claim that the production of the said bomb is aimed to cope with \"threats\" from the DPRK and Iran, adding that the U.S. would develop new-type weapons even without such pretext.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Similar voices are heard even from Americans. A citizen of Los Angeles expressed indignation, saying the military is manufacturing lethal weapons by use of the money collected from people as taxes when a lot of people are tightening their belts after losing their jobs due to the impact of financial crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality clearly proves that although the U.S. is vocal about \"change\" it remains unchanged in its belligerency and that it is an arch criminal harassing world peace and security.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is mistaken if it thinks it can browbeat someone with such new type weapon as MOP being keen on putting military pressure and sanctions against others.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is following the U.S. adventurous war moves with vigilance and will continue taking corresponding measures for self-defence."

            "content": "Armas modernas no son omnipotentes, advierte ATCC\r\nPyongyang, 5 de septiembre (ATCC) -- Estados Unidos se apresura a fabricar la nueva bomba \"MOP\" capaz de destruir las \"instalaciones nucleares subterraneas\" de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea e Iran.\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Pentagono pidio ya al Congreso el egreso del presupuesto necesario para posibilitar dentro de un ano la carga de esa bomba en los bombarderos estrategicos Stealth \"B-2\" de la aviacion norteamericana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun trascendidos, el Pentagono confiaria esa tarea a la corporacion \"Boeing\" tan pronto como su peticion fuera aceptada por el Congreso.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl fanatismo de EE.UU. por producir y ubicar la \"MOP\" constituye un infame acto criminal para implementar su plan de provocacion de la segunda guerra coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo grave del caso es que EE.UU. anuncio otra vez el plan de produccion precipitada y colocacion de la \"MOP\", cuya premisa es la guerra contra la RPDC, coincidiendo con el fin del ejercicio \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\" que se libro segun el nuevo guion de la guerra de agresion al Norte de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo ya conoce todo el mundo, la historia de EE.UU. es la de agresiones y guerras. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas bombas supergrandes de EE.UU. han sido simbolos de matanza y destruccion en las ilegales guerras de agresion desatadas contra los Estados soberanos despues de la Segunda Guerra Mundial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el periodo de la guerra vietnamita, EE.UU. desarrollo la nueva bomba \"BLU-82\", que luego de ser lanzado desde el aire, explota al ras de la tierra aniquilando a todos los efectivos dentro de mas de 500 m.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMuchos combatientes insurgentes y habitantes inocentes de Vietnam fueron las victimas de esa bomba.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tElla fue usada tambien contra Iraq durante la Guerra del Golfo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el nuevo siglo, bajo el rotulo de la \"guerra antiterrorista\", EE.UU. desarrollo \"BLU-118B\" y otras bombas supergrandes con poder explosivo equivalente a la bomba nuclear de pequeno tamano y las esta utilizando en las batallas en Afganistan e Iraq.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn ese sentido, la produccion y la colocacion de las bombas supergrandes de EE.UU. significan la guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor eso, cuando EE.UU. publico el plan de colocacion de bomba mencionada a principios de agosto en visperas del inicio de \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\", la sociedad internacional expresa seria preocupacion calificandolo de grave amenaza a la paz mundial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos iranies expresan su colera alegando que el ejercito norteamericano adelanto 3 anos el tiempo de pertrecharse con la \"MOP\" y esto  significa tanta   anticipacion de su plan de guerra. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUn internauta irani condeno el desarrollo de la bomba supergrande por parte de EE.UU. calificandolo de \"acto demencial carente de la razon del ser humano\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun el resultado de la encuesta via Internet efectuada en China, el 91 por ciento de los encuestados sostuvieron que \"hay que condenar categoricamente\" esa labor belicista de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUn especialista en el control de armamentismo de la Universidad Qinghua de China, senalo que si bien EE.UU. esta desarrollando las armas nuevas pretextando hacer frente a la RPDC e Iran, este imperio lo haria aunque no tenga tal pretexto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTales voces suenan tambien en el propio territorio estadounidense.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUn ciudadano de Los Angeles expreso su indignacion diciendo que \"cuando numerosos habitantes viven con escasez economica siendo despedidos debido al impacto de la crisis financiera, el circulo militar fabrica las armas letales con el dinero de los contribuyentes\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa realidad muestra claramente que aunque EE.UU. habla tanto del \"cambio\", no ha cambiado en nada su caracter belicista y este imperio es el autor que destruye la paz y la seguridad del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta equivocado EE.UU. que intenta asustar a alguien con las nuevas armas como \"MOP\" prefiriendo la presion militar y la sancion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC observa con vigilancia las aventureras maniobras belicas de EE.UU. y seguira tomando las contramedidas autodefensivas correspondientes."
