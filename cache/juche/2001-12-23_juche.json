The search and arrest committed by the Japanese authorities can never be justified and should invite deserved condemnation from the world public as it was a political suppression intended to destroy Chongryon, the letter said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It strongly demanded the Japanese authorities immediately stop their political suppression of Chongryon, release all the arrested people and apologize for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chairman of the Guinean Committee for Supporting Korea's Reunification Mamadou Ali Sampil and secretary general of the national confederation of Guinean workers Labiatou Sera Diallo in their statements issued on Dec. 10 branded the Japanese authorities' fascist suppression of Chongryon as an anachronistic act and a flagrant infringement upon the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK and strongly demanded an immediate halt to such act.    \r\n\r\n"
