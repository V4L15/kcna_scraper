            "content": "Portavoz de MINREX de RPDC demanda a paises europeos actuar con prudencia\r\nPyongyang, 18 de diciembre (ACNC) -- A la pregunta formulada por un periodista de la ACNC en relacion con que fue revelada la verdad de que los paises europeos se sumaron a los actos de violacion de derechos humanos de Estados Unidos, el portavoz del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea dio el dia 17 la siguiente respuesta.\n\t\t\t\t\tUltimamente se dio a conocer el hecho de la brutal tortura cometida por la Agencia Central de Inteligencia (CIA en ingles) contra los presos en las carceles secretas, lo cual provoca la fuerte critica de la sociedad internacional. En tanto, se revelaron los datos alusivos a la cooperacion de los paises europeos con el imperio en cuanto a aquellas torturas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun los datos, 21 paises europeos, inclusive Gran Bretana, ofrecieron a la CIA las carceles  secretas y las bases de interrogacion y permitieron el paso y estancia de los presos en sus propios territorios.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHasta la fecha, la Union Europea y los paises europeos cuestionaron a otros paises fingiendose \"modelos\" en el aseguramiento de derechos humanos y se sumaron a ciegas a la campana de \"DDHH\" anti-RPDC de Estados Unidos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, recientemente se revelo el hecho de que la mayoria de los paises miembros de la UE cooperaron con EE.UU. en la brutal violacion de DDHH, lo cual comprobo que la pancarta de \"proteccion de DDHH\", reclamada tanto por la UE como una de las politicas principales, no pasa de ser una cortina para cubrir la innata hipocresia politica de Europa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora, muy perplejos por la fuerte censura y presion del interior y exterior, varios paises europeos excusan absurdamente que ellos mismos habian permitido a la CIA solo la gestion de carceles secretas, pero no le habian dado el derecho a tortura, mientras hablan con descontento que se dio a la publicidad tal como es el hecho de haber cooperado en las acciones de tortura de EE.UU. a pesar de que demandaron a omitir tales contenidos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl fin y al cabo, Europa, que obedecio a ciegas a EE.UU., se vio obligada a sentarse en el banquillo de acusados junto con el imperio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHace mas de 10 anos, bajo el control de EE.UU. que cuestionaba el problema nuclear de la RPDC, Europa habia frustrado por si mismo el dialogo de DDHH con la RPDC, que se desarrollaba sin dificultades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn los dias ultimos, la Union Europea reconocio la voluntad de cooperacion internacional de la RPDC en la rama de DDHH, pero, bajo la presion de EE.UU. tomo delantera en la aprobacion de la \"resolucion de DDHH\" anti-RPDC en la Asamblea General de la ONU, basada en las mentiras de unas escorias humanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos paises europeos deben conocer correctamente su situacion de haber perdido la calificacion elemental de hablar del \"problema de DDHH\" de alguien y tener presente que si obedecen a ciegas a otros, perderan solo sus intereses y mancharan su propia honra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi ellos tienen de veras el interes en la proteccion de DDHH, deben actuar con juicio ellos mismos y cuestionar en la ONU y otras escenas internacionales los crimenes de violacion de DDHH de categoria especial de EE.UU., en lugar de criticar el \"problema de DDHH\" de la RPDC penetrado por las falsificaciones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSolo de esta manera, la Europa podra liquidar su pasado y convertirse en el verdadero defensor de DDHH de que habla tanto ella misma."
