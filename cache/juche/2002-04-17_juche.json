This betrays a black-hearted intention to build up public opinion on the \"possibility of terrorist attack\" by the DPRK, justify their criminal attempt at armed invasion including nuclear attack, dominate the korean peninsula by force of arms, and, furthermore, conquer the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Armitage also showed an intention to check the \"missile export\" by the DPRK by force of arms. This is an anti-DPRK diatribe to convince the world of the \"seriousness\" of the \"nuclear and missile threat\" from the DPRK and invent a pretext for their criminal nuclear preemptive attack on it and armed invasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the U.S. still pursues the policy of confrontation with the DPRK, the dialogue partner, with the hostility, the DPRK cannot but take a thoroughgoing counter-measure with the sharpened vigilance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK does want peace, but does not fear war. And it has no intention to avoid it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK warns once again that the slightest encroachment upon the sovereignty of the DPRK will be regarded as the declaration of war against it. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
