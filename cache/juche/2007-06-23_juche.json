All of them have the same bitter history in which they suffered under the colonial yoke and share the aspiration and desire to defend and realize independence. They have most of the raw materials and other resources and manpower in the world and possess good experience and technique gained while building a new society. South-South cooperation is in full line with the interests and desire of the developing countries. If those countries, possessed of huge economic potentials, develop the South-South cooperation under the banner of collective self-reliance, they can fully solve many problems arising in achieving sustainable economic development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The successes and experience gained in the course of South-South cooperation go to prove that if the developing countries make an effective use of their economic potentials and possibilities and boost the South-South cooperation as required by the new century, they can surely achieve economic self-reliance without any help from the developed countries and successfully push forward the building of a new society.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They seem to contend that money decides everything. This is the most vivid expression of the economic animal's way of thinking. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Responsible posts at international organizations including the UN are not something to be bought or sold and one cannot hold such post as one pleases. What matters is whether one is qualified for such post. It is in this context that Japan can never be a \"country enjoying such respect.\" Japan should, above all, win confidence from the international community. In other words, Japan should fulfill such commitments as admitting its past crimes and compensating for them. This is the assertion of the unbiased world public opinion, the commentary concludes.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
