In those periods the DPRK rose as a socialist power independent, self-supporting and self-reliant in defence and the people's power grew stronger than ever before. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people's army and people of Korea, united closer around their leader, firmly defended socialist Korea in the 1990s when they were forced to carry out the \"arduous march\" and the forced march due to the imperialists' moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman on Japan's rocket test-fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 10 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry today issued a statement assailing Japan's recent test-fire of a large-scale carrier rocket \"H-2A\". Noting that the test-fire came as a shock to the public at home and abroad and is arousing serious apprehension among them, the statement says:\r\n The rocket is said to be a \"perfect prototype rocket\" easily convertible into an inter-continental ballistic missile to serve various purposes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities themselves are not hiding the fact that the rocket can be \"exclusively used for a military purpose\" and even the chief of the Japan Defence Agency did not bother to claim that the rocket is to \"cope with north Korea's missiles.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Serious moves to revive militarism are now taking place in Japan as evidenced by the fact that history is undisguisedly distorted to justify its past aggression at the tacit connivance of the authorities and the prime minister and other high-ranking officials visited the \"Yasukuni Shrine\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a well-known fact that Japan, considering the DPRK as its no. 1 \"target\", is invariably pursuing its hostile policy toward it and steadily revising its national defence guidelines to cope with the \"emergency\" on the Korean peninsula, pursuant to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities are even asserting that Japan must \"independently develop\" its missile system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent rocket test-fire was carried out at a time when Japan's moves to revive militarism and covert the country into a military power reached their height. It, therefore, can not be construed otherwise than moves to harass peace and stability in northeast Asia and very serious and reckless moves for military confrontation with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan totally discarded the spurious signboard of its oft-repeated \"exclusively defensive policy\" and plunged itself into a dangerous gamble to realise nuclear weaponization with the test-fire as a momentum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Given that Japan has a huge quantity of plutonium and high technology enough to manufacture tens of thousands of nuclear bombs anytime and is possessed of even large-scale long-distance carrier means, it is quite clear that it will rush headlong toward militarization and overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits serious attention are the attitudes of the U.S. and Japan toward the test-fire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is well known that Japan made much ado about the \"missile threat\" from the DPRK after terming its satellite launch for peaceful scientific research a \"missile launch.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This notwithstanding, Japan is now making no hesitation to launch a missile targeted against the DPRK in a bid to incite military confrontation and the U.S. is conniving at and defending it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has become, therefore, clearer that the \"threat\" from the DPRK much touted by them was nothing but a subterfuge to justify their hostile policy toward the DPRK and their moves for militarization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These double standards of the U.S. and Japan will work on no one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should not misjudge the peace-loving DPRK's stand whereby it declared a moratorium on its satellite launch. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's persistent moves to develop missiles and their system targeted against the DPRK have, in fact, reached a dangerous stage. This serious development compels the DPRK to reconsider its moratorium on the satellite launch. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's missile program is of a peaceful nature but it will deal a merciless blow to those who dare infringe upon its dignity and sovereignty.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
