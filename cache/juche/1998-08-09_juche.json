The Japanese reactionaries intend to invade the Korean peninsula first and expand their aggression on Asia with it as a foothold.\r\n   Japan 's moves for reinvasion have invited deep caution of the Korean and Asian peoples.\r\n  The Japanese reactionaries must liquidate the past wrongdoings and seek peace, not running amuck with the moves for reinvasion.\r\n   Minju Joson says that the unprecedented war racket of the Japanese reactionaries proves that Japan is trying to be fully prepared to launch a war of overseas aggression at any moment on the pretext of implementing the \"Japan-U.S. defence cooperation guidelines.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
