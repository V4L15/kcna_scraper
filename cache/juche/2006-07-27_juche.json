            "content": "National Meeting Marks Day of Victory in War \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 26 (KCNA) -- A national meeting was held at the April 25 House of Culture Wednesday to celebrate the 53rd anniversary of the victory in the great Fatherland Liberation War.\r\n Present there were Kim Yong Nam, Jo Myong Rok, Pak Pong Ju, Kim Yong Chun and other party, army and state senior officials, Cabinet members, officials of the party, armed forces and power organs, public organizations, ministries and national institutions, servicepersons of the Korean People's Army, working people in the city and overseas Koreans staying in the socialist homeland.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n KPA Vice Marshal Kim Il Chol, who is member of the DPRK National Defence Commission and minister of the People's Armed Forces, made a report. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n July 27, Juche 42 (1953) is recorded as the day of the second liberation in the glorious history of the DPRK because it was the day when the army and people of the DPRK beat back the armed invasion of the U.S. imperialists who boasted of being the \"strongest\" in the world and achieved historic victory in the hard-fought Fatherland Liberation War under the outstanding political and military leadership of President Kim Il Sung, the reporter said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The undying feats Kim Il Sung performed by winning the victory in the war are shining more brilliantly in the history of the anti-U.S. and anti-imperialist struggle with a new chapter of victory added to it and the ever-victorious history and tradition of the heroic DPRK have been given steady continuity under the outstanding Songun leadership of Supreme Commander Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK will beat back any aggressor at one stroke and Korean-style socialism will emerge ever-victorious as the above-said immortal feats remain shining as an eternal treasured sword in the anti-U.S. and anti-imperialist struggle and as there is the ever-victorious Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter went on to say: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has staged in south Korea ceaseless war exercises including RIMPAC joint military exercises by mobilizing even its allies. Recently it took issue with the DPRK's missile launches and got the UN Security Council to adopt a \"resolution\" against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was a sheer brigandish act for the U.S. to have used the UN arena for branding the DPRK's missile launches as \"a threat to the global peace and security\" and got it to adopt a \"resolution\" calling for international pressure aimed to force the DPRK to disarm itself and stifle it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK find it hard to repress their towering hatred and resentment at the U.S. and the Japanese reactionaries who are working hard to form an international alliance against the DPRK in a bid to provoke another Korean war of aggression after painting the issue between the DPRK and the U.S. as one between the DPRK and the UN. And they vehemently denounce the U.S. sponsored \"resolution\" of the UNSC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They will bolster war deterrent for self-defence in every way by employing all possible means and methods, not bound to anything, to cope with the serious situation created on the Korean Peninsula due to the U.S. extremely hostile act and the irresponsibility of the UN Security Council. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They will never abandon their principle in preserving the ideology and system chosen by themselves but deal deadly blows at the enemies' moves for aggression with all-out do-or-die resistance and unprecedented devastating strikes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Should the U.S. and its allies including Japan ignite a war of aggression at any cost despite our repeated warnings the army and people of the DPRK will mercilessly wipe out the aggressors and remove the very root cause of the misfortune imposed upon the Koreans century after century by fully displaying the invincible might of Songun Korea that they have built under the guidance of the brilliant commander of Mt. Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter called on all the Party members and other working people and servicepersons to resolutely uphold and thoroughly implement the Songun idea under the Songun revolutionary leadership of Kim Jong Il and thus carry forward and glorify generation after generation the undying feats performed by Kim Il Sung by winning the war and the traditions established by him under the banner of Songun and emerge honorable victors in the stand-off with the U.S. in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He underlined the need for the entire Party and the army and all the people to increase the nation's capacity for self-defence and give priority to the development of national defence industry as required by the WPK's line of economic construction in the Songun era and thus further bolster the nation's war deterrent for self-defence true to the WPK's Songun politics.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The daily aggravating situation in this region is arousing serious apprehension among the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Israel's military aggression against Lebanon is a dangerous act of harassing regional peace and pushing the Mideast into the crucible of \"another war.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Israel should immediately respond to the voices of the Arab countries demanding it halt at once barbaric genocide, pull back from the occupied Arab territories and release the Arab prisoners. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits attention in the Lebanese situation is the U.S. improper attitude. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is defending Israel's man-killings in Lebanon and Palestine, describing them as a \"measure for self-defence.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This clearly shows how hypocritical, dangerous and reckless the Bush administration is as it claims to be an \"apostle of peace\" and \"defender of human rights.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and Israel had better immediately stop their reckless military actions that will bring the holocaust of a new war, as demanded by the Arab countries and the international community.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is clear evidence proving their intention to pressurize and blackmail the DPRK militarily and deliberately strain the situation on the Korean Peninsula and ignite a new war any time they think appropriate.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says this in a signed commentary. It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. claims the flotilla's portcall is a \"regular visit,\" but no one believes it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is well known that the nuclear-powered carrier has been used as a means of \"gunboat diplomacy\" of the U.S. imperialists and a shock brigade for surprise strike in carrying out a war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is nobody's secret that this naval task force led by Enterprise appeared near the Korean Peninsula whenever the U.S. imperialists kicked up an anti-DPRK racket, bringing the situation on the peninsula to an extreme pitch of tension and creating the danger of a war there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The sphere of its operation is not confined to the Korean Peninsula only. Wherever the U.S. imperialists perpetrated military invasion, they rapidly mobilized huge naval task force including Enterprise to launch air-raids and make missile strikes and perform other military missions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not hard to guess what is sought by the portcall of Enterprise as it has been ill-famed for its missions carried out to execute the U.S. imperialists' wars of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As proven by the flotilla's entry into south Korea, their moves to invade the DPRK are fraught with an increasing danger. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their evermore undisguised moves to start another Korean war and the ever-increasing danger of war posed by them only heighten the Korean people's hatred for the U.S.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He also proved that the Juche philosophy and the preceding philosophies are fundamentally different because they are based on different understanding of human being and that the Juche philosophy verifies the intrinsic nature of man that man is a social being with independence, creativity and consciousness and defines them as social attributes that take shape and develop in the social and historical process in which man establishes social relations with each other and conducts activities, which is a perfect elucidation of the originality of the Juche philosophy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He scientifically clarified that unlike the preceding philosophies that established materialistic conception of history by applying the general law governing development of the material world to social history, the Juche philosophy expounded the law peculiar to social movement with the popular masses as a driving force so that it has brought about a fundamental change in the viewpoint of social history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the work Kim Jong Il made it clear that the Juche philosophy serves the purpose of revolutionary practices and elucidates the philosophical foundation of the Juche idea, the guiding idea of the Party, and the fundamental principle of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The work helped enrich the Juche philosophy with new propositions and perfectly proved its originality and advantages and provided methodological guidelines to develop the Juche philosophy into the revolutionary philosophy of the present era.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They dismissed them as \"very irresponsible ones as they will only escalate tensions in Northeast Asia,\" \"very unreasonable outbursts\" and \"a grave violation of the Constitution as they are fraught with the danger of reviving the situation before the Second World War.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan launches reinvasion with preemptive strikes, defying warnings and demands of the public at home and abroad, it will only meet its self-destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries would be well advised not to go reckless like a newborn puppy which knows no fear of a tiger.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Women War Heroes\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 26 (KCNA) -- More than half a century has passed since the ceasefire of the Fatherland Liberation War (June 1950 - July 1953).\r\n The army and people of the DPRK emerged victorious in the war by displaying unparalleled self-sacrifice spirit and bravery under the wise leadership of President Kim Il Sung. Among the known and unknown heroes were many women heroes who distinguished themselves in the hard-fought war with ardent patriotism, indomitable fighting spirit and revolutionary optimism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Typical of them was Hero of the DPRK Thae Son Hui. She was the first female aviator of the Korean People's Army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She, with her skilful low-altitude flight, surprised and bombed Taehwa Island several times in the teeth of the enemy's anti-aircraft fire barrier to annihilate a large number of soldiers and destroy combat and technical equipment. And she successfully bombed fuel depots and military establishments of the U.S. army in Inchon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In Juche 41 (1952), President Kim Il Sung granted an audience to her, highly praised for her battle gains and gave a pocket pistol to her as a gift. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hero Kim Hak Sil, a truck driver of the KPA, also gave a good account of herself in the war by carrying a large quantity of bullets and shells to the front. She made a 20,596-km non-accident run in six months from October 1951 to transport over 87,600 tons of war supplies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Army nurse Jo Sun Ok destroyed two enemy's tanks at the cost of her life and Ri Sun Im and An Yong Ae, nurses of the KPA, saved severely wounded soldiers by transfusing their blood to them. They were all heroes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, a number of women heroes were produced in the rear, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri Su Dok joined a guerrilla unit in the enemy's rear to kill, wound and capture over a hundred enemy soldiers. And Jo Ok Hui, chairperson of the Pyoksong County women's union committee in South Hwanghae Province, was true to the revolutionary principles to the last moment of her life. Sin Pho Hyang and Ri Chan Hwa devoted themselves to ensuring the wartime production defying enemy's persistent air raids and manifold difficulties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The praiseworthy services performed by the women heroes in the war will shine long in the annals of the country.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Wartime Orders and Decisions Unprecedented in World War History\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 26 (KCNA) -- The world history of war has witnessed so many wartime orders and decisions.\r\n There were measures, not strategic and tactical ones, to completely overpower the warring countries by dealing a heavy mental blow to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the Korean war in the 1950s, the DPRK, two years old, had to fight the army two million strong of the U.S. imperialists and their allied forces. But it made such unheard-of military orders, decrees and decisions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n President Kim Il Sung, the peerlessly brilliant commander of Songun with clairvoyance and matchless courage, stated that the United States misjudged the Korean people, on the very day when the war broke out. Convinced of the victory of the Korean people in the war, he worked out a grand blue-print for tomorrow in those hard-fought days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In January Juche 40 (1951), the President instructed officials that preparations for rehabilitation and construction of Pyongyang City should be made from then on and the city be built not in its original state but as a most civilized and modern grand city. He saw to it to draw a general plan for the rehabilitation and construction of Pyongyang. In May of the next year, he saw to it that the Cabinet adopted a decision on the preparation for the rehabilitation and construction of the city. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the United States was dispatching more and more mercenaries to the front as cannon fodder, the soldiers of the KPA were given an order on recalling soldiers to the rear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There were the directive of the Supreme Commander of the KPA on recalling and sending soldiers from the front to universities (January 1952) and an order of the Military Commission on dispatching thousands of soldiers as forest protectors so as to strengthen the forest conservancy work (March 1953). They stirred up the confidence in victory among the army and people of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Popular policies were instituted one after another thanks to the noble outlook on people of the President who regarded the people as his God. These policies stroke terror into the hearts of the U.S. imperialist invaders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Among them were the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly \"On Enforcing the Land Reform in the Southern Region of the DPRK\" (July 1950) and the Cabinet decisions \"On Introducing Free Medical Care System\" (November 1952), \"On Increasing the Food Provision Supplied to the Families of Workers, Technicians and Office Employees\" (September 1952) and \"On Establishing the Honored Disabled Soldiers Schools for Officers and Men of People's Army and Guerrillas Wounded in the Fatherland Liberation War\" (April 1951). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such measures reflecting the faith in sure victory of the President aroused the army and people of Korea to heroic feats, making the DPRK the first victorious nation in the anti-U.S. confrontation in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As it is led by Supreme Commander Kim Jong Il similar to President Kim Il Sung, the DPRK will certainly emerge victorious in the present anti-U.S. confrontation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
