This was nothing but sophism in which the nature of the problem was craftily twisted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even a mere child can easily understand what visiting the shrine and paying homage to war dead mean and what this symbolizes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The chief executive has repeatedly clarified his stand to visit the shrine despite domestic and foreign protest and denunciation. This can not be interpreted otherwise than the pursuance of such sinister political purposes as inciting the idea of militarist overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  When viewed from this point of view, Japanese politicians' visit to the shrine, a center for spreading the idea of militarist overseas aggression, should be stopped and the distortion of history should be checked in view of its inherent reactionary essence and nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a very important and vital issue related to peace in Asia and other parts of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is without precedent in history that wrong acts were totally justified.\r\n The Japanese reactionaries should immediately stop their militarist moves for overseas aggression, an insult and mockery of the Asians, and opt to settle Japan's past as early as possible. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says:\r\n The south Korean authorities' dispatch of troops to Iraq quite contrary to the interests of the nation is a crime. Worse still, the south Korean troops in Iraq are keen on acquiring \"experience\" for an actual war against the north. This is a grave challenge to the whole nation desirous of the peace and reunification of the country and a serious development as it increases the danger of a new war on the Korean Peninsula.\r\n The news analyst goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities pretended to be reluctant in sending troops to Iraq under the pressure of the United States. But the fact proves that there was a secret promise between them and the U.S. behind the scene or they had their own calculation. Needless to say, they were an aggressive conspiracy and cooperation for a war to stifle the DPRK.\r\n Recently the south Korean belligerent forces have taken a gesture of \"reconciliation\" in the dialogues with the north but, upon going back, they made such perfidious military moves as agreeing with the U.S. to develop \"CONPLAN 5029\" for invading the north, drastically increasing the \"military spending\" for next year and staging south Korea-U.S. \"Ulji Focus Lens-05\" joint military exercises. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these facts go to clearly prove that the \"reconciliation\" and \"cooperation\" touted by the south Korean authorities are, in essence, no more than leverage to disarm the north and they are, in fact, conspirator and cooperator in the U.S. moves for a war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation will never pardon such anti-national criminal acts as bringing the dark clouds of war to hang over Korea in collusion with the foreign aggressor forces but certainly force them to pay for them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Kim Jong Il Gives On-the-Spot Guidance to Kwangpho Duck Farm\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 14 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Il, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission, gave on-the-spot guidance to the rebuilt Kwangpho Duck Farm.\r\n He was accompanied by Secretary Kim Ki Nam and Department Director Pak Nam Gi of the Central Committee of the WPK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was greeted at the duck farm by Hong Song Nam, chief secretary of the South Hamgyong Provincial Committee of the WPK, Kim Phung Gi, chairman of the South Hamgyong Provincial People's Committee, and others. \r\n Kim Jong Il was briefed on the history of the farm, looking round the monument to the on-the-spot instructions given by President Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the Kwangpho Duck Farm could turn into the nation's leading duck production centre under the benevolent care of the President, he stressed that the undying exploits of the President would always be remembered by the Korean people.\r\n Going round the hatching, duckling and duck breed houses, the processing shop and other places of the farm, he acquainted himself with the modernization and production on the farm. He was greatly pleased to see all the production processes put on a modern automation basis in Korean style and a high level of cultured practices in production and hygiene. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a great success that South Hamgyong Province has successfully completed the huge project for modernization on its own in a short span of time, he said, highly praising all the builders, scientists and technicians for having worked by the sweat of their brow with loyalty for the prosperity of the country and extended thanks to them.\r\n Pointing out that one more large stock-breeding base helpful to improving the standard of people's living has been updated thanks to the devoted struggle of Party members and other working people in the province, he said: This shining success is a striking demonstration of the might of the Korean people who have turned out as one to build a great prosperous powerful nation. And this, at the same time, clearly proves the justice and vitality of the WPK's policy on letting the important and urgent fields of the national economy effectively begin the technological reconstruction and modernization one after another. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After making the round of the farm, he set forth the tasks to be fulfilled by the farm.\r\n In order to put the production on a normal footing it is necessary, first of all, to satisfactorily solve the feed problem, he said, underscoring the need for the co-op farms responsible for the feed required by the duck farm to steadily increase the grain yield and for the farm to boost the production of water grass growing in the Lake Kwangpho.\r\n He called for thoroughly establishing a scientific system of breeding and management to increase the duck production. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He stressed the need to actively develop duck of good stock, which grow fast while consuming less feed, and widely introduce advanced technology instrumental in putting the breeding on a scientific basis to suit the physiological characteristics of duck.\r\n Kim Jong Il proposed tasks to be fulfilled to boost the production of quality processed duck and develop the Kwangpho Duck Farm into a large-scale centre for duck production.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
