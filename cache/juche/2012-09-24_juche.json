            "content": "CPRK Warns S. Korea's Provocations against Fishing Boats\r\n Pyongyang, September 24 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea issued the following statement on Sunday:\n\t\t\t\t\t As already reported, the south Korean puppet forces have become frantic with DPRK-targeted war exercises on the five islands in the West Sea of Korea and in the waters around them, escalating the military tension to extremes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On Friday, they perpetrated such a grave military provocation as letting warships of the navy intrude deep into the territorial waters of the north southwest of Yonphyong Island and firing at random bullets and shells at civilian fishing boats engaged in normal fishing operations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Timed to coincide with this, they kicked off such racket as letting fighters equipped with missiles make emergency sorties and massively beefed up their naval forces in those waters before putting them on emergency alert.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The fishing boats they targeted were civilian boats of other country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFiring at peaceful fishing boats is an unpardonable and illegal action against humanity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They committed such provocation though they were well aware that they were peaceful fishing boats. This clearly indicates they are ferocious brutes and man-killers. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That is why south Korean people of different strata are becoming vocal condemning them, bitterly angered by their military provocations and brutal acts while domestic and foreign public is expressing deep concern over them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is needless to say that the puppet forces orchestrated lots of military provocations in the area along the Military Demarcation Line and the East and West Seas of Korea in the same way as they did this time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reckless military provocations perpetrated by them in the waters along the maritime military demarcation line in the West Sea of Korea, the biggest flashpoint, cannot be construed otherwise than a deliberate and premeditated scenario to provoke a war at any cost and thus seek a way out of the abyss of ruin. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is nothing but a last-ditch effort of the conservative group to retrieve an ignominious defeat and disgrace they suffered in the last Yonphyong shelling battle and hype the issue of \"security\" in a bid to deter the public opinion from turning favorable for democratic and pro-reform forces and make the situation before the \"presidential\" election turn favorable for its stay in power. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent incident made it clearer who is the war provocateur on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world knows no such rogues and worst maniacs as the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors who is kicking up such war hysteria, misusing even civilian fishing boats for the confrontation with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group's desperate efforts to ignite a war, zealously pursuant to the U.S. policy of aggression in an effort to prolong its remaining days, only indicate that it is going to its doom.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will never tolerate any provocation of the enemies but mercilessly beat it back. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Only the most miserable end and death await the provocateurs."

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun denuncia lanzamiento de cohete de EE.UU.\r\nPyongyang, 24 de septiembre (ACNC) -- En un comentario individual difundido este lunes, el diario Rodong Sinmun senala que hace poco, las tropas norteamericanas ocupantes del Sur de Corea realizaron en la cercania de la linea de demarcacion militar el lanzamiento de prueba de cohete de largo alcance, lo cual es el abierto desafio a la RPDC y el criminal intento de desatar la nueva guerra empeorando la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana, y  continua:\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto deviene el preludio del ataque preventivo contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el periodo de los ejercicios militares conjuntos \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\" efectuados en pasado agosto, EE.UU. libro el simulacro de ataque preventivo contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl lanzamiento de prueba de cohete de largo alcance realizado bajo tales condiciones muestra que fue  arrancada la guerra de agresion a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo mas grave es que en este lanzamiento participo la division no.2 de las tropas norteamericanas que forma grueso principal de las tropas norteamericanas ocupantes del Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas fuerzas belicistas norteamericanas calculan revisar y cumplir la operacion de ataque preventivo por los cohetes de largo alcance en la linea de demarcacion militar con las fuerzas de aquella division y abrir la fase favorable al estallido de la segunda guerra coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl proposito de EE.UU. es librar de esta manera la operacion de ataque tridimensional de las fuerzas armadas de gran envergadura contra la RPDC en la tierra, el mar y el aire.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC no es el traspatio de EE.UU. ni  igual a los paises en que fueron logrados los \"exitos de operacion\" de cohetes de largo alcance de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSera absurdo que las fuerzas belicistas norteamericanas esperen lograr algo con la aplicacion de tales \"exitos de operacion\"."

Intentan construir mas en diversos puntos las bases de radar de alta fidelidad para detectar los misiles balisticas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEllos hablan de la \"amenaza\" y la ampliacion de la capacidad militar de alguien, lo cual es una sofisteria para encubrir su intento criminal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl hecho comprueba que entran en la peligrosa etapa practica las maniobras de expansion a ultramar de los militaristas japoneses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas imprudentes maniobras de Japon para la conversion de su pais en la potencia militar y la expansion a ultramar aceleraran solo su autodestruccion."
