This practically testifies to the validity of the reunification policy based on the conception \"one country, two systems\" pursued by the communist party and government of China. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Pleased with the return of Macao to China, Kim Yong Nam took this opportunity to sincerely wish the fraternal Chinese people greater success in their struggle for the prosperity and reunification of the country under the leadership of the Communist Party of China led by Jiang Zemin. \r\n\r\n"

Hence, it should be held accountable for the concrete wall still remaining on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The statement called upon the governments, political parties and organizations all over the world to undertake an international solidarity campaign for the removal of the concrete wall and the reunification of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Nepalese Committee for Supporting the Korean Reunification in a statement issued on Dec. 11 supported the Korean people's call for the removal of the concrete wall, noting that it is a constant source of threatening peace and security not only in Korea but in Asia and the world.  \r\n\r\n"

This is the source of strength of the Korean people advancing full of faith and optimism even under the difficult conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people are now performing exploits as pacesetters of the times at important posts of the socialist construction under the care of Kim Jong Il. I was deeply moved to see young Koreans building the Pyongyang-Nampho motorway. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the DPRK where the trait of living and struggling like heroes is prevailing in the whole society, the people are forging ahead for a great victory with faith and optimism about future, albeit they are hard pressed for everything. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   I would like to confidently say that all the Korean people are the heroes and heroines and one should come to this great country, if he wishes to see this spirit and might of Korea, he urged. \r\n\r\n"

The U.S., Japan and South Korean authorities set up the \"tripartite military cooperation system\" and under this step up preparations for a war of aggression to this end. This creates a touch-and-go situation in and around the Korean peninsula and exerts very negative influence upon the development of the situation in northeast Asia as a whole. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries try to deceive the world and flee from their responsibility, prompted by their bad habit of groundlessly  taking issue with others and drawing water to their mill.

As the world commented in those days, dispute during the Cold War was a war by proxy involving superpowers, the soviet union and the U.S. disputes in different parts of the world in the wake of the end of the Cold War are mainly characterized by deep-rooted contradictions, including those among nations and political groupings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"pluralism\" forced upon many countries by the west led to socio-political confusion and civil wars.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There was a new fierce scramble for sphere of influence in areas marked by vacuum of strength caused in some regions at the end of the Cold War, which was showdown between the superpowers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The article exposes deceptive \"globalization\" advocated by the U.S. in a bid to make a unipolar world, describing itself as \"the only superpower.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   An increasing number of countries join Europe and Russia and other big countries in the struggle against the U.S. highhanded practices, it says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   No doubt, in the 90s the international community has become more assertive for independence and democracy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Every country and every nation wants to live independently freed from any bloc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The 90s to which humankind bade farewell following the end of the Cold War gives a serious lesion that capitalism cannot be the future of humankind at all but socialism is the only one future of humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The article elaborates on the steady decline of capitalism in the 90s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the progressive humankind is to build a world reflecting its own desire and aspirations, it should consider independence, peace and friendship its shared idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThat is a valuable answer given to humankind by the 90s. \r\n\r\n"
