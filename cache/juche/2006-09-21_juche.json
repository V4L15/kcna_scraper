            "content": "U.S. Termed Harasser of Global Peace \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 20 (KCNA) -- The United States is a harasser of global peace because its \"war on terrorism\" has brought to the international community nothing but terror, retaliation, massacre, disaster, uneasiness and horror. Rodong Sinmun Wednesday observes this in a signed commentary. \r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Five years have passed since the Bush administration declared \"war on terrorism\" in the wake of \"September 11 incident.\" The U.S. ruling quarters claim that the \"anti-terrorism war\" is for the sake of the global peace and security but it is, in essence, aimed to achieve their aggressive purpose and the ambition for world domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not secret that the \"war on terrorism\" which the U.S. started as part of retaliatory actions following the \"September 11 incident\" has spilled over into a war to bring down progressive countries, going beyond the original nature, purpose and framework of its military operation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aim sought by the U.S. in the Afghan war was to keep its forces in Central Asia, encircle and contain China and Russia and thus put strategic natural resources in the region under its control and expand the sphere of its domination in Asia and Europe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. which used to abuse the UN as a means for overseas aggression in the past even discarded the voting machine of UN and openly opted for aggression against other countries under the signboard of \"war on terrorism.\" The U.S. ruling quarters cited the issue of \"development of weapons of mass destruction including biological and chemical weapons\" and \"anthrax case,\" etc. to brand Iraq as a \"terrorism sponsor\" and a \"rogue state.\" They even pedaled the rumor that the Saddam Hussein government was linked with Al-Qaeda. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By doing so the U.S. sought to put Iraq under its occupation and domination, keep firm grip on oil rich Mid-east and establish an energy monopoly in a bid to control world economy and expand its political and military domination worldwide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. chose a preemptive attack as a principal method of waging the \"war on terrorism.\" The U.S. war-like forces designated several countries including the DPRK as targets of nuclear attack, expanding the sphere of use of nuclear weapons and adopting preemptive nuclear attack as their policy. This more clearly testified to the fact that the U.S. strategy to escalate the \"war on terrorism\" is a very dangerous military strategy as it calls for resorting without hesitation to fresh and more destructive aggression against other countries, state terrorism, military intervention and war under the signboard of \"combating terrorism\" and acts of inflicting a nuclear holocaust upon humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only destruction awaits the aggressors and war fanatics who have committed all sorts of crimes while waging the \"war on terrorism\" characterized by state-sponsored terrorism, monstrous massacre and destruction unprecedented in history. Death sentence has already been passed on them. The Bush forces had better drop its criminal ambition to dominate the world.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It was an utterly illegal \"treaty\" cooked up under the Japanese imperialists' military threat and coercion against the Korean nation's will and interests. It was an unequal document of aggression aimed at political, economic and military intrusion into Korea and subjugation of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists thrust their dark aggressive claws deep into Korea through the \"treaty.\" Later, in 1905, they forged the \"Ulsa Five-Point Treaty\" and occupied Korea by force of arms to impose immeasurable misfortunes, sufferings and calamities upon the Korean people by pursuing the harshest ever colonial fascist rule over Korea for over 40 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Endless is the list of the crimes committed by Japan in the past days beginning with the fabrication of the \"Unyo-maru\" incident--invasion and colonization of Korea, medieval terror policy, cunning cultural rule, plunder of human and material resources, brutal suppression and killing of Koreans and extermination of Korean national culture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many years have passed since militarist Japan met its ruin while running about like a mad dog in aggression and war. However, the aggressive nature of the Japanese militarists has not changed at all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now they are whetting the sword sharp to stage a comeback to Korea, shouting themselves hoarse to whip up militarism, buoyed by wild ambition for overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarists are the long-time sworn enemy of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation will surely force Japan to pay for their past crimes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
