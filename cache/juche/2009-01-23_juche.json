But up to this date when he is near 80 his political career has been so miserable as to remain an insane politician keen to make queer remarks just to improve his image. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to Japanese media, he is employing every possible means and method to establish the sphere of political domination of his family in the Japanese political camp by taking advantage of his present office.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was reported to contemplate even shifting Tokyo food market, an issue related to the health of people, to a place polluted with poisonous substances where once stood a gas plant in a bid to curry favor with financial businesses including real estate dealers. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ishihara is no more than a dirty political philistine who does not hesitate to harm the health of people to satisfy his political greed. The above-said ruckus of sending the \"letter\" and the like kicked up by him is nothing but a ridiculous farce to improve his badly tarnished image. His behavior intended to fish in troubled waters by foolishly challenging the supreme dignity of the DPRK will never be tolerated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ishihara's reckless behavior glaringly revealed the hypocrisy of the ruckuses being kicked up by the Japanese reactionaries over the \"abduction issue\" and the nuclear issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries seem to calculate that they can win popularity and manage to make their living only when they trumpet about the \"abduction issue\" and the nuclear issue. Japan is, indeed, an abnormal country as such political philistine and those more dead than alive are allowed to ride roughshod in the political camp. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is treated as a political pigmy and stands further isolated from the international community than ever before due to such bad guys as Ishihara who is steeped in the hysteric Samurai spirit, carried away by revanchism and national chauvinism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No one knows that Ishihara may go the lengths of calling for annexing Japan to the U.S. in the future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this context, one may say Japan is fortunate enough to keep this guy from assuming its premiership up to this date."
