And we strongly call upon you to set a common goal, which is to realize the repatriation of Kim In So, Ham Se Hwan, Kim Yong Thae and other unconverted long-term prisoners who were taken prisoner during the last Korean War, before late June this year and return of all other unconverted long-term prisoners who want to go to the DPRK, until the 55th anniversary of Korea's liberation from the Japanese imperialists' rule, and work hard together with us to this end. \r\n\r\n"

It is aimed at getting strategic upper hand in different parts of the world under the pretext of missile defense and, furthermore, establishing military domination over the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Despite strong precautions of many countries around the world the U.S. is trying to establish the missile defense system at any cost under the pretext of the threat from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is not the U.S. but the DPRK that is exposed to nuclear and missile threat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. has deployed many nuclear weapons and missiles in South Korea, Japan and around the Korean peninsula to pose permanent threat to the DPRK. While continuously delivering latest missiles to the South Korean authorities, the U.S. is going to allow them to produce long-range missiles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   To move toward disarmament and peace is the trend of the times and demand of humankind. If the U.S. persists  in arms buildup,  aggression and war preparations, ignoring them, it will find itself isolated and meet a destruction. \r\n\r\n"

The world people should, thereafter, resolutely stand up against the U.S. sanctions. \r\n\r\n"
