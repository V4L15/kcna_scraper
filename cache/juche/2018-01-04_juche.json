The Japanese reactionaries even made public a plan on independent additional sanctions while asking the international community to put \"extreme pressure\" on the DPRK over its test-launch of ICBM Hwasong-15 and \"human rights\" issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is deliberately linking the nuclear issue of the DPRK which poses no problem to its security, while dancing to the war tunes of lunatic Trump. The aim sought by it is to get rid of the yoke of a war criminal state and turn the country into an aggression state, a war state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It would be a great mistake for it to think that the Japanese archipelago would be safe under the \"nuclear umbrella\" of the U.S. and with its backing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that the whole U.S. land is within the nuclear striking range of the DPRK, it is clear to everyone that it would not be of any trouble for the DPRK to reduce Japan to ashes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is like a dangerous gambling over the crucial issue of the security of the Japanese proper and the Japanese people to get frantic in escalating confrontation with the DPRK while taking advantage of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK."
