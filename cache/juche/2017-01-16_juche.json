Worse still, they are hit hard by the public.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Much upset by this situation, the Obama group have gone so foolish as to kick up the \"human rights\" racket against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They seek to recover from a heavy setback and get rid of their pretty fix by tarnishing the image of the DPRK at any cost. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is not qualified to talk about somebody's \"human rights\" as it is the world's worst human rights abuser and a tundra of human rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Obama would be well advised not to waste time taking issue with other's \"human rights issue\" but make good arrangements for packing in the White House. He had better repent of the pain and misfortune he has brought to so many Americans and other people of the world by creating the worst human rights situation in the U.S. during his tenure of office.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will protect Korean-style socialism to the last no matter what others may say as it thoroughly embodies the popular masses-first principle, the crystal of the Juche-oriented outlook on the people, the philosophy on them."
