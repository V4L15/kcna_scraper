It is the height of impudence and action that a guilty party files the suit first.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality eloquently shows it was a wise option that the DPRK accomplished the historic great cause of completing its state nuclear forces true to the line of simultaneously developing the two fronts to cope with the increasing nuclear threat from the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. would be well advised not to run amuck, well aware that it will meet its miserable doom while recklessly brandishing its nuclear stick of tyranny, obsessed with the anachronistic design for world hegemony."

            "content": "CCPAP rechaza el \"reporte de revision del estado nuclear de 2018\" de EE.UU.\r\nPyongyang, 10 de febrero (ACNC) -- El \"reporte de revision del estado nuclear de 2018\", recien publicado por EE.UU., muestra su intento de amenazar gravemente la paz de la Peninsula Coreana y el resto del mundo y provocar la nueva guerra fria y la nuclear. Por esta razon, ese documento es condenado y repudiado por todos los coreanos y la sociedad internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\tAl respecto, el portavoz del Comite Coreano por la Paz de Asia y el Pacifico (CCPAP) hizo publica el dia 10 una declaracion que sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el reporte, EE.UU. estipulo que iniciara la modernizacion de armas nucleares estrategicas y el desarrollo de \"miniartefacto nuclear de baja intensidad\" para hacer frente a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea que al igual que China, Rusia e Iran, constituye \"seria amenaza\" para el y sus aliados. Anoto ademas que usara el arma nuclear cuando el y sus aliados reciban el ataque nuclear o el no nuclear. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, describiendo el disuasivo nuclear de autodefensa de la RPDC como \"amenaza\" a la paz mundial, legalizo practicamente la modernizacion de armas nucleares y el ataque preventivo nuclear contra ella. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPronuncia tambien palabras provocativas tales como \"no tolerara nunca el ataque nuclear del Norte de Corea contra EE.UU. y los paises amigos\", \"no habra el caso de que el Norte de Corea sobreviva despues de usar el arma nuclear\" y \"cualquier forma de ataque del Norte de Corea terminara con el arruinamiento de su poder\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto demuestra que llega al extremo la furia de guerra nuclear de la banda de Trump que intenta aplastar con la fuerza a la RPDC estigmatizando su justa posesion de arma nuclear frente a la amenaza nuclear de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl \"reporte de revision del estado nuclear\" de EE.UU. es documento criminal que hace hecho consumado el ataque preventivo nuclear contra la RPDC. Significa ademas la abierta declaracion del Estado gangster de que no repararia en dar el ataque preventivo nuclear contra la Peninsula Coreana y todo el mundo ni en desatar la guerra nuclear. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInsatisfecho de tener el mayor numero de esas armas de exterminio masivo, EE.UU. quiere usarlas ahora como convencionales. Sin embargo, esta acusando a la RPDC con expresiones \"amenaza nuclear\" y \"desnuclearizacion\", lo cual parte de su cinismo y logica de bandido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa realidad confirma cuan sensata fue nuestra opcion de cumplir, en virtud de la linea de desarrollo paralelo de la construccion economica y la de fuerzas armadas nucleares, la historica causa de completar estas fuerzas del Estado para hacer frente a la escalada de amenaza nuclear de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe actuar con prudencia teniendo presente que sera arruinado tragicamente si esgrime a su antojo el garrote nuclear de opresion sin liberarse de su anacronica ambicion de tomar la hegemonia mundial."
