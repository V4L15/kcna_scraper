Korean Politician's Barbed Remarks Assailed\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPyongyang, November 7 (KCNA) -- Ri Ki Thaek, chief vice-chairman of the \"Advisory Council for Democracy and Peaceful Unification\" of south Korea, recently blustered that \"the north's dismantlement of its nukes is a major precondition for settling the issue of the inter-Korean relations\" and \"any exchange between the south and the north is meaningless as long as nukes exist in the north.\"  These outbursts come under fire by a signed commentary of Minju Joson Friday.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat he uttered is nothing but sheer sophism aimed at linking the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula with the inter-Korean relations in a far-fetched manner, the commentary notes, and goes on: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe public is simply surprised to know that Ri styling himself a veteran in the political circle of south Korea is behaving like an idiot. That is why the public deplores his wretched plight before expressing resentment against him.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula is attributable to the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA switchover in the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK would help find a smooth solution to the nuclear issue on the peninsula.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe above-said issue is a problem to be settled between the DPRK and the U.S. in the final analysis. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe issue of the inter-Korean relations is, however, different from the above-said issue. The issue of the inter-Korean relations was spawned as the Koreans were forced to live separated in the north and the south by outside forces though they have lived as a homogeneous nation for five thousand years. The above-said issue is a matter concerning the relations between compatriots desirous of national reunification. All Koreans in the north and the south are, therefore, responsible for settling it. The inter-Korean relations can be automatically solved if they get reconciled and cooperate with each other in the efforts to achieve independent reunification.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe \"precondition\" for settling the issue of the inter-Korean relations is not the \"dismantlement of the north's nukes\" but the implementation of the June 15 joint declaration based on the three principles-- independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity-- and the October 4 declaration, a programme for putting it into practice. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHad Lee Myung Bak taken a sincere stand to implement the above-said declarations, the inter-Korean relations would not have reached the present uncontrollable phase but inter-Korean cooperation and exchange would have made brisk headway. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAn old adage says a lack of knowledge is not a fault. But what is important is to admit it and honestly work hard to learn everything from now. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tShould Ri Ki Thaek continue letting loose a spate of reckless remarks in a bid to bedevil the inter-Korean relations, far from trying to learn something to enlighten himself, he will face a stern judgment by the nation for being a running dog of traitor Lee Myung Bak in the declining years of his life."
