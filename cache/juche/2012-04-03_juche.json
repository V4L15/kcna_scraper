            "content": "DPRK Media Organizations Reveal Lee Myung Bak Group's Suppression of Media\r\nPyongyang, April 3 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of the Journalists Union of Korea and the Press Sub-Committee of the North Side Committee for Implementing the June 15 Joint Declaration made public an indictment denouncing the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors for suppressing media in south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\tReferring to the coup against media effected by the Lee conservative group which put the past military regime into the shade, the indictment went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOn February 26, 2008 just a day after the \"presidential\" inaugural ceremony, the group of Lee passed the \"bill on establishment and operation of the Broadcasting and Communication Committee\" and on Feb. 29 it set up the committee by combining the Broadcasting Committee and the Ministry of Information and Communication and put it directly under the \"president\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLee Myung Bak appointed Choe Si Jung called \"shade of president\" as the head of the committee and replaced the heads of main press organs including KBS, MBC and YTN by his close confidants. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLee's close associates took the posts of heads of OBS, English broadcasting Arirang TV and the News Information Promoting Council, biggest shareholder of the Yonhap News, one by one. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee group retrogressively revised the \"law on newspapers\" which the past \"government for people\" enacted to restrict the conservative papers' monopolistic access to media market. It even tasked the conservative papers with the double mission of broadcasting. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs a result, the \"government\"-run broadcasting system collapsed and the clan-oriented media held sway over the south Korean media field, turning media reptile and conservative as a whole. This was the fascist violation putting into the shade the Chun Doo Hwan military regime which earned an ill fame for its act of merging or reorganizing press organs in 1980. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee group kicked up massive suppression of the progressive media after taking power. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOwing to the suppression by the conservative group, more than 180 pressmen were punished and at least 60 were prosecuted on charges of \"disturbance of performance of duties and violation of the law on assembly and demonstration\" till 2010 since the appearance of the Lee's regime. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe conservative group blocked the article-exchange and contacts abroad which had been held between the Press Headquarters of the South Side Committee for Implementing the June 15 Joint Declaration and the Press Sub-Committee of its North Side Committee. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn July 2011, the Intelligence Service and police of south Korea arrested en masse personages of political, academic, civic and public circles and put them into custody under the pretext of \"spy action at the instructions of the north\" and \"establishment of anti-government network\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe conservative media which turned into the waiting maid of the power and reptile trumpeter did tremendous harm to the north-south relations by inciting confrontation while availing themselves of the Lee group's \"north policy\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey actively shielded the targeting incident in 2011 which broke out by the military warmongers of south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey did not hesitate to let loose reckless remarks that the crucial step taken by the DPRK as regards the recent hideous provocation by a unit of the south Korean puppet army insulting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK was aimed to achieve internal unity. Worse still, they backed the Lee group's acts of sycophantic treachery. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee group can never silence the voices for justice and truth however hard they may try to suppress the media. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPressmen in the DPRK send support and solidarity to the general strike of the south Korean pressmen and believe that their just struggle to achieve freedom of speech and social justice and dynamically carry on the trend of the June 15 era of reunification will emerge victorious."
