            "content": "KCNA on Revival of Ultra \"Yamato Nationalism\" \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 16 (KCNA) -- The hands of the Japanese militarists were stained with the blood shed by Asians in the past century. Yet, Japan is again disturbing this part of the world, obsessed by ultra nationalism.\r\n Every recent move of Japan such as distortion of its history, actions for territorial expansion, the revival of militarism and its bid for permanent membership of the UN Security Council reminds one of Japan in the imperial era when it ran wild, crying out for the \"Yamato spirit\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The rapidly mounting \"Yamato spirit\" has become a real factor of threatening the political future of Japan and the world's stability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's advocates of \"national spirit\" are now vociferating about what they call the \"purity of blood lineage\" and \"spiritual unification\" of the Japanese nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their loudmouthed \"Yamato nationalism\" is, in a nutshell, no more than extreme national egoism and national chauvinism as it is a nationalist idea of underscoring only \"superiority\" of the Japanese nation to other countries and nations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Yamato nationalism\" means fascism of an oriental version that originated from Japan in view of its origin and nature, the role played by it during World War II and the idea of its advocates. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a reactionary ideological trend, a mixture of the bellicose nature of Samurais in the medieval era and the aggressive nature of imperialists since it was manifested by the Japanese militarists who came to power in league with the feudal forces in the modern times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Underlying the aggressive idea that guided the Japanese imperialists to cry out for continental aggression and \"Greater East Asia co-prosperity sphere\" after the \"Meiji Restoration\" was ultra nationalism based on the theory of \"the superiority of the Japanese nation.\"  The conservative right-wing forces and reactionary historians of Japan claim that the Japanese nation is \"the best nation\" in the world. This self-exaltation is gradually developing into the consciousness that prevailed throughout the empire before its defeat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The successive ruling quarters of Japan have worked hard to seek a way out in reviving the \"spirit of Japan.\" That was why they considered this as a procedure for a \"total political settlement in the postwar period.\" The core idea of this notion is to overcome the mentality of being a defeated state, instill the awareness of being a big power into people and exalt the position of Japan in the world's political structure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Proceeding from this, preposterous articles advocating the so-called \"excellence\" of the Japanese contributed by conservative right-wing professors are coming in the limelight of the press while voices calling for reviving the \"pure spirit of Japan\" through what they call \"spiritual campaign\" are ringing out.\r\n It is the socio-political reality of Japan today that in force there are domestic and foreign policies calling for veering the politics to the ultra Right, turning Japan into a military power and realizing overseas expansion, etc., the policies based on the blind \"spirit of Yamato nation\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Therefore, \"nationalism\" of Japan has raised its head as a dangerous idea of aggression threatening peace and stability of the world, to say nothing of Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The danger of \"Yamato nationalism\" lies, first of all, in kicking off a frantic drive to turn the Japanese society reactionary in its ideological and mental fabrics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has put on an official, regular and popular basis visits to the \"Yasukuni Shrine\" calling back the \"soul of Yamato\" who earned an ill-fame for perpetrating the war of continental aggression in the past, despite strong protest and denunciation of Asians. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It designated \"Hinomaru\" and \"Kimigayo\" as its \"national flag\" and \"national anthem\" in 1999. So now one may hear the ear-splitting \"Kimigayo\" millions of \"imperial army\" soldiers sang in man-killing war in the name of the \"emperor\" during World War II and watch the disgusting \"Hinomaru\" fluttering in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Nationalism\" and the consciousness of being a big power are gradually raising their heads in Japan, encouraged by wrong education in history and the false propaganda by rightist forces. Many Japanese are supporting the troop dispatch overseas and the retrogressive revision of the constitution, influenced by this trend. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already known, in April the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology approved the revised edition of history textbooks for middle schoolers in which the history related to its neighboring countries is grossly distorted and its history of aggression whitewashed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The textbook compiled by the \"Society for History Textbook Reform\", an ultra-right organization of Japan, is justifying the war crimes committed by it during World War II, saying that \"it provided an opportunity of promoting the independence movement in Asian countries\" and \"Japan's action helped Asians rise up\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The open description of Tok Islet as \"part of Japan's territory\" in social science books as well as in textbooks for primary and middle schoolers is stoking the ambition to grab the islet among Japanese. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Politicians of ruling and opposition parties and broad circles including financial and press circles of Japan are supporting in a more organized manner the rightist organizations spearheading the campaign to tamper with history textbooks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no need to find elsewhere the political and ideological, mental and psychological cause of all the crimes including murder, rape, allurement, abduction and abuse and chauvinism toward other nations, other races and other states which are rife in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The danger of \"Yamato nationalism\" also lies in that it accelerates the legalization and institutionalization of overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The political environment of Japan has reached such a pass that even politicians holding official posts are blustering that there is nothing for Japanese to feel ashamed when referring to World War II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the results of a survey, more than 80 per cent of the Dietmen have shown a positive attitude toward the revision of the \"pacifist constitution,\" forming a main stream in the political arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the objective data proving ultra nationalism and the rightist ideological trend prevailing in the Japanese society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rightist elements, steeped in ultra nationalism to the marrow of their bones, and officials of the government and the ruling parties are conspiring with each other in the moves to push the Japanese society to neo-fascism again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, the ideological and mental preparations and procedures for Japan's overseas aggression have been completed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The sphere of influence sought by the Japanese rightist reactionaries is expanding worldwide, going beyond the boundary of East Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ambition of revived Japanese militarism suggests that it will plunge not only Asia but the rest of the world into horrible disasters of war once again.\r\n This design is fraught with the biggest danger as it is modeled after and tailored to \"neo-conservatism\" in the United States, a modern version of fascism, which has brought fear and uneasiness to the whole world while going against peace and stability in the present century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world is becoming increasingly vigilant against the revival of ultra \"Yamato nationalism\", fascism in the East. This is quite natural because the world is well aware of its danger and the catastrophic impact it will have on the whole international community.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It, however, can never break the will of the Koreans to attain reunification, closely united thanks to the joint declaration, transcending differences in ideology, system and their abode, nor can it dampen their cherished desire for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The declaration stressed that the North Chungchong Provincial Headquarters would make a nationwide grand march to avert a war and achieve the country's reunification by the concerted efforts of the Koreans.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This indicates that the moves of the Japanese reactionaries to create legal and institutional environments for turning Japan into a military power and realizing their ambition for overseas expansion have entered into a full-fledged phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These moves are being pushed forward at the zealous instigation of the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Taking advantage of this militarist hysteria of the Japanese reactionaries, the U.S. seeks to use them as a shock force and servants for carrying out its strategy for Asian aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind the commission's move to institute a law on the national referendum for the constitutional revision is a crafty aim sought by them. In case the existing constitution is retrogressively revised, they intend to describe it as one reflecting the \"will\" of the Japanese people in a bid to soothe down the world public criticism of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their evermore undisguised moves for the retrogressive revision of the constitution are little short of a danger signal heralding the birth of a new war state in Asia and start of overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They would be well advised to bear in mind that these moves will only precipitate Japan's international isolation and destruction.    \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They called on all Buddhists to come out as one in the actions to put an end to the national split as early as possible and build a reunified great prosperous powerful nation and a modern earthly paradise on this land, true to the will of Buddha for mercy, equality and unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation in Korea remains so tense due to the frantic moves of the U.S. imperialists and the anti-reunification forces that a nuclear war may break out any moment, they noted, urging all Buddhists in the north, the south and overseas to join all other compatriots in waging a dynamic anti-U.S. and anti-war struggle, united in the idea of \"By our nation itself\" to repay the love of Buddha. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
