Notably, its �ghuman rights�h offensive toward the DPRK is going into a very grave stage. Suffice it to note that it is planning to appoint �ga special envoy in charge of north Korean human rights�h after cooking up �gthe north Korean human rights act�h in its hectic human rights offensive against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the U.S. imperialists seek in it is to impair the international prestige of the DPRK, internationalize the moves to isolate and stifle it and find an excuse for military \r\naggression  under the pretext of �ghuman rights issue.�h The U.S. human rights offensive is a dangerous challenge against the DPRK aimed at the �g overthrow of the political system�h of the latter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is tenaciously pursuing the purpose of isolating and stifling the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is hell bent on inventing a pretext for a war against the DPRK, while staging feverish large-scale war games, having amassed huge aggression forces in and around south Korea. One of the examples is that it is getting overheated in the �ghuman rights�h\r\nOffensive against the DPRK, persistently taking issue with the �ghuman rights issue�h\r\nof the latter.  But such a tricky offensive will not work with the DPRK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "All Koreans Called Upon to Turn out in Anti-U.S. Struggle \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 28 (KCNA) -- The Korean nation should not allow the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces' presence in south Korea to go beyond 60 years but terminate the U.S. hostile policy towards Korea, Rodong Sinmun Friday says in a signed article.\r\n The 60 years of their presence in south Korea are a history of aggression and crimes as they have ruthlessly infringed upon the Korean nation�fs dignity and independence and savagely violated democracy and rights of the south Korean people, the article observes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After occupying south Korea the U.S. imperialist aggressors enforced a harsh military rule over it and installed a pro-U.S. regime there, placing it under their system of colonial domination. Through this they completely subordinated all fabrics of south Korean society including politics, military affairs, economy and culture to the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Keeping south Korea under its militarily occupation for the last six decades, the U.S. has lorded it over as a suzerain state. It has dealt with all the issues such as the change of south Korean regimes and policy-making to meet its own aggression and domination interests as it pleased. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. massacre of Koreans has never ceased. It suppressed at the point of the bayonet the September general strike and the October popular uprising of south Korean people and the April 3 popular uprising that broke out on Jeju Island against the national division. The U.S. killed in cold blood more than a million patriotic south Koreans in just five years from its occupation of south Korea to the period before the Korean War. After the war the U.S. imperialists put down the April 19 popular uprising in south Korea by engineering a coup d�fetat and wire-pulled the armed crackdown upon the Kwangju popular uprising in 1980. This barbarism baffled human imagination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Documents favorable for national independence and great unity and peaceful reunification including the July 4 joint statement were adopted between the north and south in the past. However, the U.S. has barred all of them from being implemented in practice. It is still today desperately working to militarily stifle the DPRK after raising \" the nuclear issue\" on the Korean Peninsula in a bid to hamstring the implementation of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has been hell bent on its moves for a war against the DPRK since it unreasonably listed the DPRK as part of \"an axis of evil\" and a target of its preemptive nuclear attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All countries and nations of the world aspire after independence, stable and lasting peace and security as it greeted the 21st century after the demise of the Cold War in the international arena. The Koreans are the only nation in the world that has suffered a tragedy, disgrace, misfortune and pain resulting from the national division for the last six decades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the fellow countrymen in the north, the south and overseas should dynamically turn out in the struggle to drive the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces out of south Korea and put an end to the U.S. policy for domination over Korea under the uplifted banner of cooperation for national independence, cooperation for peace against war and cooperation for reunification and patriotism.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

According to Kang's \"philosophy of molten iron\", as any kind of scrap iron turns into steel in the electric furnace, those who join the family will certainly follow the pattern of the family. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A large number of people who had left their native towns during the Korean war come to Kangson after the war. Among them are characters with different careers and family backgrounds who become members of Kang's family. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through the efforts for rehabilitating the destroyed works and producing iron, Kang remolds Jin Ung San, who had been worried about his unsavory past, and those with similar careers on the pattern of the working class and encourage them to be good at the works. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The opera shows on a high ideological and artistic level that, under the benevolent politics of President Kim Il Sung, any Korean is a member of his family. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Phibada Opera Troupe, with a history of nearly 60 years, created the revolutionary opera \"Sea of Blood\" under the energetic guidance of Kim Jong Il in the early 1970s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The troupe was named after the revolutionary opera \"Sea of Blood\" (Phibada).    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
