I, determined  to fight against the provokers of the Korean War, the U.S. imperialists and  their lackeys, joined the  Korean People's Army by taking the chance of standing at a forefront post in January, 1951.

An \"operation plan for anti-north provocation was worked out soon at the \"headquarters of the joint chiefs of staff\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This included an armed provocation in Panmunjom, an armed provocation in waters along the \"northern limit line\" in the west sea and other options.  But the operation plan boiled down to an armed clash in waters along the \"northern limit line\" in the west sea.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe reason behind this choice was that the \"northern limit line\" in the west sea was unilaterally fixed by the \"UN forces command\" and the north, therefore, has not recognized  it so far and  it was their calculation that the North Korean army would take a prompt counter-action to protect some ten fishing boats of the north at work to catch crabs  around the line if they were provoked even a little.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The operation plan had four phases -- taking out the rival force to clash, bumping of against ships, preemptive firing and escalation of armed attack.  It was also planned to prepare in advance news materials intended to shift the blame for the incident on to the north and open them to the public at home and abroad and inform the countries concerned of it through South Korean missions abroad.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was also envisaged in the plan that  in order to keep the operation secret the personnel involved in the operation  would be banned from staying outside or going out, the waters off Yonphyong Islet, the operational waters, be blockaded and the operation be co-named \"WS(west sea)-99 operation.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"operation plan\" was immediately reported to Kim  Dae Jung and carefully examined and approved by the commander of the U.S. forces in South Korea who has the prerogative of the supreme command over the \"ROK army\" before going over to the phase of implementation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nJo Song Thae and other military brass-hats appeared on the spot and ordered warships of the \"ROK army\" to go into action according to the \"operation plan\" and escalate their provocation to the territorial waters of the north.   Kim  Dae Jung also heard reports about the situation any time, dispatched his \"chief adviser for diplomacy and security of Chongwadae\" to the second fleet command to convey his \"message\" telling it \"not to miss an opportunity\", and egged the officers and men onto an armed provocation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   On June 15, the date fixed for the start of an armed attack, Kim  Jin Ho, \"chairman of the joint chiefs of staff\", under the command of the \"National Defence Minister\",  under the prearranged plan, ordered 12 large warships which had intruded deep into the territorial waters off Yonphyong Islet, the waters of the north, to fire bullets and shells all at once.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The engagement between the two sides grew fierce as patrol boats of the north took an immediate counter-action.The naval force of the north that does not tolerate the slightest encroachment upon its sovereignty and territorial integrity severely damaged ten odd warships of the \"ROK army\", killed or wounded hundreds  of their crewmen in the engagement that day, thus frustrating the attempt to invade the north in an instant.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Upset by this, the South Korean authorities vociferated about the \"preemptive attack from the north\".   The \"incident in the west sea\" was orchestrated to tide over the serious ruling crisis of the present South Korean \"government\". The Kim  Dae Jung group tried to seek a way out of it in the shocking armed provocation in the west sea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The report cites materials to prove that the assertion of the South Korean authorities that the \"incident\" was caused by the \"north's provocation\" turned out to be baseless, inviting criticism from public at home and abroad.   It continues:   A gimlet protruding from a sack cannot be concealed.   With no trick can the South Korean warhawks ever conceal the fact that they are the real criminal responsible for the \"incident in the west sea\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The ruling quarters of the self-proclaimed \"people's government\" must fully probe the truth behind the \"engagement in the west sea\" before the people, give up the prize-giving farce and immediately and sternly censure the \"National Defence Minister\", the \"chairman of the joint chiefs of staff\" and others responsible for the incident.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States, the manipulator of the incident, must take off its mask, halt at once its reckless  moves to unleash a second Balkan war on the Korean peninsula and withdraw its troops from this land without delay. \r\n\r\n"

It is a form of hand combat in which two men stand face to face and deliver hand and fist blows while guarding themselves against each other's attacks until one of them falls down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Subakhui was already in practice in the period of the three kingdoms of Korea (third century BC.-AD. the seventh century).   Scenes of this sports are found on tomb murals of the Koguryo dynasty.   In the period of the Koryo dynasty (918-1392), it was one of major programs for martial arts training, and the ability of a soldier was evaluated by his skill in this military art.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Subakhui consists of 25 skills of the hands and body, as well as 10 other special skills.   In the Koryo dynasty competitions of this sport were frequently held. Those who were proficient were either chosen as professional soldiers and officers, or if they were already in active service, they were promoted to a higher rank.\r\n   Some talented practitioners at the time were so skilled in technique that their powerful fist blows were enough to make the rafters of a house tremble, and their strong punches could pierce a wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This military art continued to develop during the Ri dynasty (1392-1910). The skills now became diversified, one combining the hands and feet, and another combining kicking and head-butting with the use of fists.   This time-honored traditional sport has developed into Taekwon-do, which today symbolizes the fighting spirit and vigor of the Korean people. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "DPRK FM calls for withdrawal of U.S. from Panama Canal zone \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 15 (KCNA) -- A spokesman of the DPRK Foreign Ministry today answered the question  put by the KCNA as regards the demand of Latin American countries for the withdrawal of the U.S. troops from the Panama Canal zone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States is now scheming permanent presence of its troops in the Panama Canal zone, raising preposterous demands for \"rediscussion of the canal issue,\" \"establishment of multinational anti-drug center in the canal zone\" and \"joint patrol over the territorial air, waters and land of Panama\" under the pretext of \"security\" of canal and anti-drug struggle in this zone with the approach of the date of return of the Panama Canal, the spokesman said, and went on:   This is its usual practice done whenever it committed aggression and plunder of other countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Panama and other Latin American countries are now charging that although the United States is vociferating as if it were interested in the \"security\" of the zone, it is no more than a trick for its strategic interests in the western hemisphere. They are strongly opposing the permanent presence of the U.S. troops in the Panama Canal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The bid for the permanent presence of the U.S. troops in the Panama Canal zone is a brigandish act which cannot be justified in view of the national interests of the Panama people and the international law.   The U.S. sinister attempt clearly proves that the U.S. troops are the harassers of peace and security everywhere in the world and the invaders.   The plot for permanent presence of the U.S. troops is continuing in the Korean peninsula as in Panama.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States is chiefly responsible for the division of our nation. It is owing to the illegal presence of the U.S. troops in South Korea that our country remains divided for more than half a century.   The United States should give up its anachronistic ambition for world domination and withdraw its armed forces not only from the Korean peninsula but from Panama at once. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "DPRK FM spokesman clarifies its stand on satellite launch\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 15 (KCNA)-- The spokesman of the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea today gave the following answer to the question put by KCNA as regards the recent mixed fuss in the United States over the issue of our resumption of the satellite launch:   As already reported, the United States claimed that our satellite launch should be halted as it poses sort of \"threat\" to it and is undisguisedly calling for strongly reacting to our satellite launch. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  As for the satellite launch, this belongs to the legitimate right of an independent sovereign state.   The satellite launch aimed at a scientific research for the peaceful development of the space allows no one to say this or that of it. Many countries existing on this earth in the age of ultramodern science and technology are aspiring after an extensive scientific research into the outer space  and launching necessary satellites. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  We neither launch a satellite at anybody's dictate nor stop  it at anybody's advise. \r\n  It is our consistent stand to launch a satellite any time according to our decision when we deem it necessary and when we are prepared for it scientifically and technologically.   No one has the right to fault our satellite launch, saying this or that of it. \r\n\r\n"
