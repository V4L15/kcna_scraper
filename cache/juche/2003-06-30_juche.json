But if the U.S. pursues a big-stick policy, it will be countered not in a gentlemanly way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is not frightened by any tactics of pressure because it has a strong war deterrent force. The U.S. gunboat diplomacy is impotent before our army and people who value independence as much as their lives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to stop its policy of pressure upon the DPRK which is incompatible with dialogue, mindful that any base and vicious schemes and means do not work on the DPRK which has great Songun politics and the might of single-heated unity.    \r\n\r\n"

But this does not stand to reason from an international legal point of view. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Article 10 of the NPT stipulates that each signatory to the treaty can pull out of it under the extraordinary situation where its supreme interests are threatened. therefore, the measure taken by the DPRK to withdraw from the NPT was an exercise of its undeniable legitimate right. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The NPT, by its nature, assumes a noble purpose and mission of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons internationally, eradicating threats of those weapons and ensuring the use of nuclear energy for a peaceful purpose only. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, there is such a serious partiality in the course of implementing the treaty that a few powers resort to high-handed and arbitrary practices for a nuclear monopoly and force non-nuclear states to yield to their subjugation, control and dictation, infringing upon their sovereignty and dignity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As unanimously admitted by the world unbiased public opinion it is none other than the U.S. which has most wantonly violated the NPT. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even after its accession to the NPT the U.S. has kept developing and manufacturing new types of nuclear weapons of high performance, tested them and massively stockpiled weapons of mass destruction threatening the existence of humankind, instead of opting to cut down or dismantle nuclear weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This should be called into question as it is a wanton violation of the NPT. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Given that the U.S. has converted South Korea into the biggest nuclear arsenal in Far East and unilaterally poses a nuclear threat to the DPRK, it was quite just for the DPRK to have withdrawn from the NPT to protect the sovereignty of the country and the vital rights of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such being a stark fact, the U.S. is calling on the DPRK to cancel its decision of withdrawing from the NPT. This is preposterous. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Moreover, its intention to refer the issue to the UN can never be tolerated as it seeks to use the UN in achieving its criminal aim to isolate and stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will regard any move to bring the DPRK's nuclear issue up for discussion at the UNSC as a prelude to a war and take a corresponding measure.    \r\n\r\n"

This clearly shows that though it pays lip-service to the \"peaceful solution to the nuclear issue\" on the Korean peninsula it, in fact, seeks to evade its responsibility for sparking the nuclear crisis and realize its invariable ambition to bring the DPRK to its knees and put it under Washington's control by pressurizing it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. intention to use the UNSC as a platform for escalating the international pressure upon the DPRK is a very unreasonable move to misuse the noble un for achieving its selfish purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the U.S. which should be pressurized internationally. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is finally referred to the un, the UNSC should blame the U.S. before any others for sparking the nuclear crisis and escalating tensions on the principle of impartiality, the paper contends.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "DPRK FM sends letter to president of UNSC\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 28 (KCNA) -- Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun sent a letter dated June 26 to Sergey V. Lavrov, president of the United Nations Security Council.\r\n The letter said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n I would like to express hereby the viewpoint of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) with regard to the fact that one permanent member of the United Nations Security Council has started a diplomatic negotiation to bring before the security council the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United Nations Security Council assumes an important responsibility of safeguarding international peace and security in accordance with the united nations charter. This task requires greatest impartiality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In particular, since the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is the one between a small country and a big country, only fair approach of the security council would contribute to ensuring peace and security in the Korean peninsula and further the rest of the Asia-Pacific region and to restoring the authority of the united nations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this respect, I wish to draw your attention to the following several points to which I hope the security council will pay primary attention with regard to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n First, the security council should define its view and express position on the doctrine of \"axis of evil\" and \"preemptive strike\", as it is now the most fundamental issue that has a great impact on the international relations and the global peace and security. Targets of the doctrine of \"axis of evil\" and \"preemptive strike\" insisted on and adopted as a policy by one permanent member of the security council are the member states of the united nations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As this policy is put into practice, it gives rise to complicated situations that jeopardize global peace and security. \r\n The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and the aggravated tensions in the region surrounding this issue make no exception. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The security council should make due judgment on whether the said doctrine and the policy based on it conform to the spirit of the United Nations Charter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Second, it is important that the security council has a good insight into the essence of the positions of the parties concerned on talks on the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Either in view of the history of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, the complexity of its composition or from the viewpoint of the responsibility and ability to resolve it, it will be reasonable that the issue is resolved through an organic combination of all necessary forms of talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the stand of the government of the DPRK that bilateral, tripartite and multilateral or any other forms of talks proposed by the concerned parties and other countries concerned should be held in an appropriate order. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since there were tripartite talks in Beijing in April, it would be beneficial to have next DPRK-USA bilateral talks and then tripartite or further expanded talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States, however, puts up a precondition that one form of talks is acceptable but other form of talks is not acceptable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What we desire most with regard to the nuclear issue is to thoroughly eliminate the threats to the security of the DPRK, which have given rise to the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The real dire threats do not come from the countries surrounding us, but from the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the only reason why the DPRK attaches priority to the DPRK-USA bilateral talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is my view that the security council should, if it wants to promote the resolution of the issue, clearly see what kind of position is really helpful to the resolution of an issue and encourage it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Third, the United Nations Security Council should avoid giving any impression that it might apply double standards. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the security council is truly interested in the extension of the scope of the NPT, it should ask all countries remaining outside the NPT to join it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As is well known, the DPRK is not the only country remaining outside the NPT. Among Non-NPT state parties, Israel has been subject to greater suspicion of nuclear development for much longer period of time than the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for the DPRK's withdrawal from the NPT, it is an exercise of its sovereign rights recognized by the NPT itself and, therefore, does not in any way deserve condemnation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any condemnation by the security council of the rights exercised under article 10 of the NPT, which provides for withdrawal, will be tantamount to the condemnation by the united nations of the NPT itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no reason whatsoever to apply such terminology as \"non-compliance with the safeguards agreement\" of the IAEA in the case of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the DPRK-USA Agreed Framework, we were supposed to fully implement the safeguards agreement only after all non-nuclear parts such as turbines and generators of light water reactor no. 1 had been delivered. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unfortunately, however, the agreed phase did not come even until the DPRK withdrew from the NPT. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the security council resorts to double standards in the interpretation and application of the international instruments, any decision or measure it adopts will not be persuasive and will be hardly acceptable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Fourth, the security council has a moral obligation to judge, in the light of the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, whether or not it would be justifiable for one member state of the United Nations to pressurize other member state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At present, the United States pursues a policy of combining both \"dialogue and pressure\" towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is seeking to have in place a legal system aimed at check and control by other countries, based on its intelligence information, of the vessels and aircraft passing through their territorial waters and airspace. Japan, which is our neighbor, is already in action to realize it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After all, we can say that this has originated from the doctrine of the united states, the world's largest arms seller, that its intelligence should serve as a standard to judge the legitimacy and illegitimacy of the international trade and as a basis to put pressure on any member state of the United Nations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The war in Iraq constitutes a well-proven example that the intelligence gathered by the United States may be misused for political purposes in disregard of the principle of impartiality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If this is allowed with the support or acquiescence of the security council, it will result in a negative change in the international order. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It can be said that now, the United Nations is at the crossroads of whether it will maintain the international order led by the united nations or give way to the establishment of a dangerous world order led by an individual country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the common view of the international community that under no circumstances can the security council be used as a cover-up to justify unilateralism and policy of pressure of a certain country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Fifth, we consider that the security council should pay due attention, when considering the situation on the Korean peninsula, to the current status of the Korean Armistice Agreement with which the security council has a deep connection. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States has recently decided to bring into South Korea latest sophisticated weapons estimated at 11 billion us dollars. This is a violation of paragraph 13, article two of the armistice agreement, which bans the introduction into Korea of reinforcing weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States has also decided to redeploy its troops in South Korea and tries to shift the U.S. army responsibility for the control of the demilitarized zone on to the South Korean army. This is a violation of paragraph 10, article one of the armistice agreement which stipulates that the demilitarized zone be controlled by the Korean People's Army and the U.S. Army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The sea and air blockade pursued by the united states against the DPRK through \"inspection of vessels and aircraft\" is a violation of paragraph 15, article two of the armistice agreement, which calls on the contracting parties \"not to engage in blockade of any kind of Korea\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The seriousness of the issue lies in the fact that if the armistice agreement is abrogated by way of such violations as mentioned above, the Korean peninsula will go back to the warring situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It will be inevitable to a certain degree that when the confidence is lost in the power of the armistice agreement to deter war, the demand for other means of deterrence is raised. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n I still wish to think that the security council is not yet away from its objectivity and impartiality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In case the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is debated in the security council, I look forward to its just and reasonable efforts for a peaceful solution of the nuclear issue in keeping with its noble mission and responsibility by taking into due consideration the aforementioned points.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
