But it is the world's biggest nuclear criminal. Rodong Sinmun Sunday says this in a bylined article.\n\t\t\t\t\t The article cites concrete facts to prove that the U.S. is the biggest criminal that inflicted nuclear disasters upon mankind and triggered off a nuclear arms race in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists' reckless maneuvers for a nuclear war have brought the dark clouds of war to hang over the Korean Peninsula and posed a constant threat of a nuclear war to the Korean people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists' evermore undisguised nuclear blackmail compelled the DPRK to bolster its capability for self-defence. As a result, it won victories in the nuclear standoff with the U.S. and ensured the peace and security of the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In view of the U.S. nuclear threat not only countries around the peninsula but anti-imperialist independent countries have bolstered the defence capabilities and strengthened the means for strategic deterrence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is disturbing the normal relations among nations with its double-dealing nuclear policy and creating complexity in the international arena.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is conniving and patronizing the development of nuclear weapons by its junior allies while labeling the peaceful nuclear activities of the countries desirous of independence against imperialism as \"development of nuclear weapons\". It is even contemplating a military attack on them, not content with ratcheting up sanctions and pressure on them in collusion with those allies. This is a manifestation of the intolerable U.S. double standards.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is, at the same time, a product of the U.S. scenario for world domination.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If mankind is to live in a nuclear-free world, it should hold in check and frustrate the U.S. moves for a nuclear war."
