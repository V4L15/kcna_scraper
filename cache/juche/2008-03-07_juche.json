            "content": "South Korean Conservative Ruling Forces' Reckless Remarks over \"Human Rights Issue\" Denounced \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 6 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland issued a statement on Thursday denouncing the south Korean conservative ruling forces for letting loose a spate of outbursts crying out for the \"improvement of the human rights performance in the north\" and \"urging it to take proper measures\" over the nonexistent \"human rights issue\" in the DPRK at the 7th meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Council. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement branded their reckless remarks as an intolerable grave provocation to the DPRK and treacherous outbursts totally negating the spirit of the June 15 joint declaration and bringing back the inter-Korean relations to those of confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"human rights abuses in the north\" oft-repeated by them is a product of the plot hatched by the U.S. and its followers to tarnish the high international prestige and image of the DPRK and undermine its system as such things have never existed and cannot happen under the Korean-style socialist system centered on the popular masses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean conservative forces have made every desperate effort to deter the inter-Korean relations from favorably developing and stem the trend of the times towards reconciliation and unity, reunification and prosperity while escalating their smear campaign against the north even before their coming to power in step with the U.S. conservative hardliners' anti-DPRK row over the \"human rights issue.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have gone the lengths of letting loose malignant vituperation slandering and defiling even the regime and system in the DPRK, while frantically joining the U.S. bellicose quarters in the large-scale nuclear war exercises to invade it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality goes to clearly prove that the south Korean conservative ruling forces are violating even the spirit of the June 15 joint declaration the basic idea of which is \"By our nation itself\" and the October 4 declaration which calls for converting the inter-Korean relations into those of mutual respect and trust. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will never pardon those who are going reckless in a bid to hurt even the regime in DPRK which represents our dignity and lifeblood, only reading outside forces' faces utterly indifferent to the points agreed upon between the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those who only pursue confrontation and division, going against the desire of all the fellow countrymen and the trend of the times, are bound to be forsaken by the nation and meet destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean conservative ruling forces would be well advised to behave themselves.     \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The love for the motherland and home depicted by the songs convey the sentiments of grievances and defiance at the aggressors who snatched away and trampled upon everything dear to the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The children's songs \"Beloved Kangnam\" and \"Half-moon\" represent the earnest desire of the then people for national liberation through the children's mind longing for a new land free from exploitation and oppression. Many love songs of sorrow including \"River Tuman in Tears\" earnestly sing of the desire and yearning for the liberation of the country by metaphor about \"a lover who is sure to come back\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Emotional Age\", \"Falling Blossoms on Running Water\" and many other songs depict in a romantic poetic language the sentiments of the times overflowing with belief in the spring of liberation that was sure to come with victory in the anti-Japanese armed struggle led by President Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By preserving the melodious features of folk songs which had become familiar to the Korean people through a long period while broadly introducing excellent successes achieved by human music in applying means and technique of expression such as tonality and rhythm and combining them to suit the taste of the Korean nation, the songs in the enlightenment period assumed new artistic features peculiar to the modern songs to some degree.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Joint Military Exercises Slammed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 6 (KCNA) -- The Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military exercises now under way according to a carefully worked out operation plan for invading the north strip bare the bellicose and aggressive nature of the U.S. which has invariably pursued a hostile policy towards the DPRK under the signboard of \"dialogue\" and \"peace\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Thursday observes this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint military exercises targeted against the north are a main factor of blocking the reconciliation and unity of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is well known that the U.S. staged joint military exercises in south Korea every year, hamstringing the efforts to implement the June 15 joint declaration and warm up the inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Clear is the reason why the U.S. is standing in the way of achieving reconciliation and unity between Koreans and developing the inter-Korean relations. Its ulterior aim is to invade the DPRK by force of arms at any cost. It is clearly evidenced by the ongoing saber-rattling. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These war maneuvers are a product of the dangerous collusion and nexus between the U.S. and south Korea to boost cooperation in war and bring back the era of inter-Korean confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These days the U.S. ruling quarters are zealously egging south Korea on to join it in pursuing its hostile policy towards the DPRK, crying out for an anachronistic \"alliance\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and south Korean warmongers' joint military exercises targeted against the north are a negation of the June 15 era of reunification and a desperate offensive to stifle the cause of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to bring about a surge in the cause of independent reunification under the present situation it is necessary for all Koreans to unite close with one and the same will and desire and decisively foil the U.S. and south Korean trigger-happy forces' reckless moves to start a war against the north, concludes the article.      \r\n\r\n\r\n"
