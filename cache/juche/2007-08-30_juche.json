And it is an important demand in strictly curbing the reactionary ideological and cultural infiltration of the imperialists and firmly defending socialist ideology and culture in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolution victoriously advances where songs reverberate far and wide and miracles are wrought and feats performed in a place overflowing with rich emotion and optimism. When cultural and emotional cultivation is decisively intensified in all fields and at all units, the whole country will brim over with pulsating spirit and constant leaps be made in building a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when cultural and emotional cultivation is intensified, the people can clearly understand that socialist cultural and emotional life in the DPRK is the most superior cultural and emotional one conforming to the independent nature of man and can actively turn out in the struggle against bourgeois ideology and culture and mode of life with full knowledge of their reactionary and harmful nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the DPRK today there is no room for any alien and decadent culture with nothing in common with the most superior Korean-style socialist culture to set foot. The people in the DPRK are most sound and pure not only in ideology and spirit but also in culture and morality. There lies in intensifying cultural and emotional cultivation a sure guarantee for firmly defending Korean-style ideology and culture by frustrating the reactionary physiological smear campaign and ideological and cultural infiltration of the imperialists.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Now the progressive reform in south Korea is standing out as an urgent task of the times and it can be carried out only by the united efforts of the people of all social strata, its master. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Independence of the south Korean society and its democratization is the century-old desire of the south Korean people and is the main substance of the progressive reform. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the GNP band gratified its ambition for power, the people's dream of social independence and democratization would be crudely trampled underfoot and south Korea would remain indefinitely a politically underdeveloped area and dark society where fascist dictatorship would hold sway. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The great alliance against the conservatives is the prerequisite to national unity and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National reconciliation, unity and reunification can be achieved at an early date as desired and demanded by the nation only when GNP, the anti-reunification bellicose forces, is completely removed. Anyone who truly wants national unity and reunification should display interest in the achievement of the great alliance against the conservatives to sweep the pro-U.S. conservative forces off the arena of history.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Japan is going to develop and import ultra modern fighters with a very large range of operation while introducing refueling tankers.

Japan has become so emboldened as to attempt to seize supremacy by expanding the sphere of military actions without hesitation with the Asia-Pacific region as the theatre. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's drive to lay a military foundation for overseas expansion is fostering and aggravating a new arms race and cold war in the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its wild ambition is to round off preparations for overseas aggression through arms buildup. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Abe team obsessed with the revival of militarism and overseas expansion is longing for the days when the Japanese imperialists could draw arrows of invasion on the world map as they pleased and carried it into practice and trying to bring back those days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Abe team should not run about like a headless chicken, knowing clearly that its reckless push for the revival of militarism is a foolish act driving Japan into a quagmire of destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He, at the same time, jabbered he admitted to the great pain and damage inflicted by Japan upon Asian people in the past. But no word of \"apology\" could be heard from him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson today observes in a signed commentary carried in this regard: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such words as \"regret\" and \"recognition of fact\" uttered by Abe only to provoke people's derision are intended to calm down Asians' bitterness towards Japan and appease them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This explains the reason why Abe refrained from visiting the \"Yasukuni Shrine\" this time unlike what he did in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What he has in mind is that Japan did do nothing wrong in the past and, accordingly, it would not make any apology or compensation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such wicked intention of Abe found its clear manifestation during his junket to India. By meeting with the family of an Indian judge who denied Japan's war crimes Abe denied the legitimacy of the ruling made by the then Military Tribunal for Far East and sought to build international public opinion on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-mentioned fact proved that Abe is nothing but a poisonous herb sprouted from a poisonous root called militarism in view of his bloodline and political view. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such foolish behavior of Japan only arouses people's disgust and will inevitably lead it to isolation and ruin.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
