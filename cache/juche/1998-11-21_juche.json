Korea called for\r\n   Pyongyang, November 21 (KCNA) -- 50 years have passed since a \"resolution for maintenance of U.S. Forces\" was passed through the first \"National Assembly\" session following a \"separate government\" faked up in South Korea.\r\n   In this regard papers here today run articles calling for an early end to the U.S. military occupation of South Korea.\r\n   Rodong Sinmun ( Paper of Workers' Party of Korea) in a signed article says the U.S. military occupation of South Korea cannot be justified in any case because it goes against the basic interests of the Korean people.\r\n   The daily goes on:\r\n   The history of the division of the Korean nation which began in the mid-twentieth century still continues to the threshold of the 21st century, which is attributable to the U.S. military occupation of South Korea and colonial policy.\r\n   In view of the armistice agreement which envisaged the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the Korean peninsula and in view of the resolution of the 30th UN General Assembly session calling for the dismantling of the \"UN Command\" in South Korea and pullout of all foreign troops from the region, there is no legal justification whatsoever for the U.S. military presence in South Korea.\r\n   The U.S., far from pulling its forces out of South Korea, is claiming that the U.S. military presence is helpful, in a bid to maintain its forces in the region.\r\n   This proves that the U.S. still refuses to rectify its anachronistic Korea policy, and pursues the policy of strength in an effort to swallow up the whole of Korea.\r\n   Minju Joson demands that the present chief executive of South Korea stop pursuing a disgraceful policy of  dependence on outsiders to prolong his remaining days, pursue the policy of national independence in place of the policy of dependence on outsiders and get the U.S. Forces withdrawn from South Korea.    \r\n\r\n"

With the \"agreement\" signed, the U.S. military domination over South Korea has been further strengthened and the system of igniting another Korean war be completed.\r\n   Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary says:\r\n   The United States and the South Korean authorities are clamouring for maintenance of the aggressive \"agreement.\" \r\n   Underlying their clamouring is a sinister intention to ally with each other to stifle the DPRK.\r\n   After the \"agreement\" was signed, the United States  has deployed huge armed forces of aggression in and around South Korea and staged many war manoeuvres for an preemptive attack on the DPRK.\r\n   The \"agreement\" should be repealed  and the U.S. and South Korean authorities moves of aggression and war be stopped.\r\n   The key to fundamentally removing the acute political and military confrontation from the Korean peninsula is to put an end to the U.S. military intervention. To this end, a peace accord should be signed between the DPRK and the United States, the very signatories to the armistice agreement, and the U.S. troops be pulled out of South Korea. \r\n\r\n"
