            "content": "Imperialists' Wild Ambition for World Domination Can Never Come True \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 20 (KCNA) -- The imperialist forces' wild ambition for world domination has created a complicated situation in many regions, putting their own strategic interests at great peril, observes Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article cites facts to prove that U.S. security is exposed to danger and the much vaunted strength of the imperialist forces is clearly proving vulnerable on the international arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: The sphere of imperialist military domination is getting narrow worldwide and the contradictions among the imperialist forces are growing acute. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Western countries are guarding against the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, worried over its possibility of emerging a political and military bloc in opposition to the NATO. Most European countries are members of the NATO along with the U.S. but, in actuality, have an axe to grind, while accelerating the establishment of an independent security mechanism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists' plan to control world economy to perpetrate harshest possible exploitation and plunder in the world has also gone bankrupt. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialist forces' undisguised political and military intervention in the Mideast issues after their occupation of Iraq is aimed at putting the rich oil resources in this region under their control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But it has become impossible for the imperialists to realize this ambition with ease. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Big oil producing countries in Latin America are becoming anti-imperialist and independent, depriving imperialist forces of their oil concessions in this region, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialist forces' economic and military infiltration into Africa is sparking off greater unrest and antipathy there. It is as clear as a pikestaff that this development would deal another blow at the imperialists keen to put oil resources in Africa under their control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists have desperately pursued their strategy to invade the DPRK, regarding it as a key link in the chains of the efforts to realize their wild ambition to dominate the world. But the U.S. high-handed and arbitrary practices have never worked on the DPRK which has pursued the Songun politics. For this reason, their hostile policy toward the DPRK is bound to go bust.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 19 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Anti-Imperialist National Democratic Front released a statement Friday on the occasion of the 27th anniversary of the May 18 Kwangju Popular Uprising, according to the Internet site Kuguk Jonson. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement said that the Kwangju Popular Uprising on May 18, 1980 was a patriotic action as it recorded a brilliant page in the modern history of the liberation struggle in the East and marked a historic turning point in the history of the revolutionary movement in south Korea as it brought about a switchover from the anti-fascist movement for democracy to the anti-U.S. movement for independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that bloodthirsty brutes the U.S. imperialists turned all the areas of Kwangju into a \"huge bathroom drenched with blood\" and a \"city of death\" and are still committing ceaseless hair-raising atrocities in various parts of south Korea and mercilessly trampling down upon the sovereignty of the people, the statement went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Seized with the wild ambition to keep south Korea as its permanent colony, the U.S. is whipping together the pro-U.S. conservative forces, the remnants of military fascist dictatorship, and wire-pulling them behind the scene in a bid to set up a pro-U.S. regime. It is steadily escalating its war moves to invade the north, going against the June 15 era, thus leading the situation to the brink of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is clearly evidenced by the fact that the U.S. is massively introducing modern war hardware into south Korea while pushing forward in real earnest the construction of a new U.S. military base in Kunsan and the transfer of its bases for aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people in south Korea should intensify the anti-U.S. struggle for independence by inheriting the noble spirit displayed by the participants of the Kwangju Popular Uprising. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people from all walks of life should turn out as one in the anti-U.S., anti-war struggle and actions for the withdrawal of the U.S. forces from south Korea with the same indomitable will and spirit as displayed by the resistance fighters and hold aloft the banner of great alliance against conservatives in order to decisively frustrate the attempts of the pro-U.S. conservative forces including the Grand National Party of south Korea to return to power and thus bring back the dark era of fascism, dictatorship and division.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
