It was his maxim that one emerges ever-victorious when one believes in the people and relies on their strength and one is defeated when one is forsaken by the people, she noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What occupies the most important place in his feats was that he founded the invincible Korean People's Army, she said. He deeply loved the people all his life and devoted his all to their freedom and happiness, considering it as a noble maxim to believe in the people as in heaven. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Speakers said that he was highly praised by the world progressives, adding he was the sun of the 20th century and the greatest man. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK today is fully demonstrating its might thanks to the great feats of him who built an indestructible socialist bulwark in the east in which the leader, the army and the people are rallied as one, looking far into distant future, they said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the immortal feats performed by him in carrying out the cause of national reunification, they stressed that the unanimous desire of the Korean people to reunify the country independently and peacefully by applying the three charters for national reunification put forward by him will certainly come true. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A congratulatory message to Kim Jong Il was adopted at the seminar.    \r\n\r\n"

He held that it is high time for the special commission to seek a way to put an end to the U.S. ceaseless abuse of the UN name and its resultant legal contradiction.\r\n The present international situation where the international order is disturbed and the trust in the UN hurt by the U.S. arrogant attitude and high-handed practices and its policy of strength calls for asserting the spirit of the un charter and increasing its role as regards the relations between states and the preservation of international peace and security, he said, urging the special commission to pay primary attention to putting a brake on the arbitrary practices and high-handed policy of the country styling itself the \"only superpower\" in the present international relations and restoring the role of the un. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. violation of the UN Charter and legal duties is being perpetrated on the Korean Peninsula, too, he said. More than 40,000 U.S. troops are present in South Korea under the helmets of the \"UN force\" and the present U.S. administration recoils from implementing its legal commitment to honor the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework, rendering the situation on the Korean Peninsula extremely tense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. administration, in particular, is handling the nuclear issue, a product of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK, in contravention of the relevant resolution of the UN General Assembly and the principle of the UN Charter which ban the use of force and call for settling all disputes in a peaceful way, he said, adding that the United States is violating and misusing the articles of the Korean Armistice Agreement as it pleases as evidenced by the amassing of armed forces around the Korean Peninsula and staging of all forms of military exercises in a bid to mount a preemptive military attack on the DPRK under the pretext of the nuclear issue    \r\n\r\n"
