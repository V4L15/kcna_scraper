Troops in South Korea amounted to one million. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The brutal massacre was committed by the U.S. troops in the North Korea, too. They murdered 35,383 innocent people in Sinchon, South Hwanghae Province, or a quarter of the county population for 52 days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. should acknowledge the massacre in Rogun-ri, a stark fact, and compensate for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At the same time the U.S. should apologize and unconditionally compensate to the Korean people for the thrice-cursed murder, plunder and arson by their troops in South Korea for over 50 years and in the northern half of Korea during the past Korean War and should withdraw from South Korea, taking along their aggressor troops and all lethal weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean rulers should immediately stop their base flunkeyist and treacherous acts of patronizing the massacre by the U.S. troops and selling out the dignity and interests of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Our fellow countrymen will make the U.S. aggressors pay for the blood of the Korean nation however long the time may pass. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
