Korea Flayed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, August 25 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland issued information bulletin No. 941 Monday, 60 years since the U.S. and the puppet warmongers of south Korea concluded the shackling south Korea-U.S. \"Tentative Military Agreement\" for aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Late in August 1948 the U.S. and the south Korean war-like forces concluded the above-said agreement which stipulates that the U.S. forces shall \"organize, train and arm\" the south Korean army and the commander of the U.S. forces in south Korea shall \"exercise the right to command its operations.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The past six decades since the conclusion of the agreement were crime-woven and shameful years during which south Korea was reduced to an advance and logistic base for provoking a war against the DPRK and the peace and security on the Korean Peninsula were seriously disturbed by the U.S. policy of military presence and domination over south Korea and its war moves, the bulletin noted, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has become all the more frantic in its moves to provoke a new war while reorganizing and bolstering its imperialist aggression forces in south Korea to be a task force for a war of aggression against the DPRK after massively introducing WMDs and ultra-modern military hardware into south Korea. It is also trying to use the puppet army as a shock brigade in the war of aggression against the DPRK while talking about \"the transfer of the rights to command the wartime operations.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lee group's sycophancy and treachery to serve the U.S. are throwing south Korea deep into an abyss of U.S. colonial enslavement, forcing its people to languish in agony, barring the north-south relations from favorably developing and increasing the danger of a nuclear war with each passing day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people can never get rid of misfortune and pain nor can the Korean nation be free from the tragedy of division and constant danger of a war as long as the U.S. military presence and colonial domination over south Korea go on and the sycophantic and treacherous forces serving the U.S. are allowed to reign there.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The foundation thus marked the origin of building a revolutionary mass organization of the working class. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No sooner had he founded the revolutionary Party after the liberation of the country than he formed the trade union, a unified mass political organization of the working class and wisely led it so that it became the positive supporter to the Party and thorough implementer of the party policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today under the guidance of the Workers' Party of Korea, the might of the trade union has increased incomparably and grown to be single-minded militant ranks and a Songun revolutionary organization which is true to the Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun denuncia al traidor Lee Myung Bak\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, 25 de agosto (ATCC) -- Recientemente el traidor Lee Myung Bak, en las \"conversaciones\" con el presidente norteamericano Bush de visita en el Sur de Corea, calumnio la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea cuestionando el \"problema de derechos humanos\" de esta. Posteriormente, en la \"Declaracion Conjunta\" Sur de Corea-Estados Unidos se afano en la campana de \"derechos humanos\" contra la RPDC senalando que \"es la primera vez que se cuestiona el problema de DDHH del Norte de Corea\" y que la \"mejora de DDHH\" es la \"norma y principio\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El renegado titere habla tanto de \"DDHH del Norte\", lo cual es para denigrar la imagen de la RPDC, inculcar la confrontacion Norte-Sur y alcanzar el criminal proposito de aplastarla en contubernio con las fuerzas extranjeras. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Asi senala el diario Rodong Sinmun en un comentario individual del dia 24 y continua: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La RPDC es el mas ventajoso Estado socialista centrado en las masas populares y el sagrado pais de respeto a los derechos humanos donde se garantizan al maximo la soberania y los derechos del pueblo. En la actualidad, el Sur de Corea se va convirtiendose en un lugar privado de DDHH que se asemeja a la epoca de dictadura fascista del pasado. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El que el traidor Lee, junto con las fuerzas foraneas, se entrega sin titubeo al \"alboroto de DDHH\" anti-RPDC a que hasta sus antecedentes no se atrevieron, muestra a las claras la naturaleza de entreguista proyanqui y siniestro frenetico de confrontacion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Lee debe poner inmediatamente fin al alboroto de \"DDHH\" anti-RPDC que fomenta la confrontacion Norte-Sur y obstaculiza la causa de reunificacion de la patria, y actuar con prudencia.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
