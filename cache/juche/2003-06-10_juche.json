He claimed that the policy was enforced because Koreans asked Japan to name them in Japanese, the Japanese taught Korean alphabets and it is Japan that enforced the compulsory educational system, the statement said, and went on:\r\n It is not a mere \"mistake\" coming from the lack of understanding of history or the lack of the gift of the gab that the murderers are styling themselves as \"benefactors\" in the presence of those who experienced and witnessed the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However hard the Japanese reactionaries may embellish and beautify historical facts, they can never cover up their crime-woven history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"law on emergency\" targeted at the DPRK was openly passed through the diet, military exercises simulating \"emergency on the Korean Peninsula\" are being launched and right-wing reactionaries' frantic war moves are overheated in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the facts prove that conservative political figures of Japan are hell-bent on creating a favorable atmosphere in a bid to justify the history of blood-stained aggression, avoid the responsibility for their past crimes and realize their long-cherished ambition for reinvasion of Korea. \r\n Japan would be well advised to liquidate its criminal past and take the road of peace and stability of Asia, not the road of becoming military power, mindful of bitter lessons of the last century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is favorable for Japan itself and for it to get trust and reconciliation with Asian people.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA on DPRK's nuclear deterrent force \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- The Bush government is escalating its moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK.\r\n As already reported, the DPRK put forward a bold proposal for smoothly solving all issues at the DPRK-U.S. talks with a view to fundamentally settling the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since the DPRK put forward the proposal the world community has closely followed the U.S. attitude. Because the DPRK's proposal is a constructive offer conducive to settling the nuclear issue and guaranteeing peace and stability in Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the Bush administration is adamantly insisting on the multilateral talks while uttering extremely provocative words about \"further steps\" and \"stronger measures.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such attitude of the U.S. only more saliently reveals the sinister design of the bush administration to dramatize the DPRK's \"nuclear threat\" before the world community as much as possible and thus make it stand further isolated politically and diplomatically. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a universally known fact that the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula is a product of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK in every sense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This issue surfaced on the Korean Peninsula because the successive U.S. regimes have pursued this hostile policy towards the DPRK and threatened it with nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Therefore, the only way of settling it is for the united states chiefly responsible for the issue to seek a reasonable solution through bilateral talks with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has already clarified its stand that the DPRK-U.S. talks should be held to be followed by the U.S.-proposed multilateral talks. \r\n The U.S. attitude of insisting only on the \"multilateral talks\" while avoiding the DPRK-U.S. bilateral talks despite the DPRK's magnanimous stand only indicates the will of the Bush administration not to drop its hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has no intention to have a nuclear deterrent force without any reason, quite contrary to Washington's noisy propaganda. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is willing to clear up the U.S. concern as regards the nuclear issue if it drops its hostile policy toward Pyongyang and addresses its concern. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But if the U.S. keeps threatening the DPRK with nukes instead of abandoning its hostile policy toward Pyongyang, the DPRK will have no option but to build up a nuclear deterrent force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's intention to build up a nuclear deterrent force is not aimed to threaten and blackmail others but reduce conventional weapons under a long-term plan and channel manpower resources and funds into economic construction and the betterment of people's living. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will build up a powerful physical deterrent force capable of neutralizing any sophisticated and nuclear weapons with less spending unless the U.S. gives up its hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the DPRK is no longer bound to the safeguards accord with the International Atomic Energy Agency after its withdrawal from the NPT the DPRK has the same legal status as the United States and other countries possessing nuclear weapons not bound to international law, as far as the issue of nuclear deterrent force is concerned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration should clearly know that it is good for its future for the United States to opt for completely dropping its hostile policy toward the DPRK instead of spreading the rumor about the \"threat\" of its nuclear deterrent force.    \r\n\r\n"

This step for arms buildup can be seen only on the eve of a war, the news analyst notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such move of the U.S. forces proves that the U.S. imperialists' plan for preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK, a scenario for the second Korean war, is entering the phase of its full-scale implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the Iraqi war the U.S. is stepping up the preparations for the second Korean war, regarding the DPRK as a new target of state terrorism and a main target of armed intervention. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history records many instances of arms buildup and military exercises of aggressors leading to wars. This suggests that the U.S. moves to bolster its forces in South Korea may lead to the second Korean war. The U.S. imperialists have whetted swords of revenge to recover their defeat in the Korean war provoked by them in the 1950s and watched for a chance to attack the DPRK. They may mount a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK any time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such development compels the DPRK to take all possible countermeasures with a high degree of revolutionary vigilance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe U.S. should know how the DPRK will retaliate against its preemptive nuclear attack.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It has not yet been reunified because the U.S. troops remain stationed in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. forces' presence in South Korea is a direct product of the U.S. Korea policy. The U.S. considers the Korean Peninsula as a springboard to establish domination over Asia and, furthermore, the world. This is why the U.S. imperialists seek to keep their military occupation of South Korea, viciously block the peace and reunification of the Korean Peninsula and realize their domination over the whole of Korea. In particular, the U.S. troops are spreading a sophism of \"threat from the north\" in a bid to justify their military presence in South Korea and discharge their mission as scout feeler for aggression on the Korean Peninsula, rending the situation of the Korean Peninsula extremely tense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the facts clearly prove that the Korean nation can not establish sovereignty throughout the country nor achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the country and unified development of the nation unless the U.S. military occupation of South Korea is terminated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article calls upon all the fellow countrymen to turn out in the struggle to force the u.s. troops out of South Korea for the dignity and honor of the nation and speed up independence against the U.S. and independent national reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
