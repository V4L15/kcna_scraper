            "content": "Rodong Sinmun llama a mantener el espiritu Juche y la nacionalidad\r\nPyongyang, 4 de agosto (ATCC) -- El mantenimiento del espiritu Juche y la nacionalidad es el problema clave y vital que decide la victoria o la derrota de la revolucion y la construccion y la prosperidad o la decadencia del pais y la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t Imitar el modo de vida exotico, especificamente, del occidente, llevara a la ruina al pais y la nacion, adelanta el diario Rodong Sinmun en un articulo individual difundido este martes y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Para mantener el espiritu Juche y la nacionalidad, es preciso revelar y frustrar totalmente la corriente ideologica reaccionaria de todo tipo y las sofisterias de los imperialistas y los dominacionistas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, no se debe hacer la ilusion ni atemorizarse del imperialismo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lo importante en materializar el principio de independencia nacional reside en buscar y apoyarse siempre en los metodos y remedios propios para impulsar la revolucion y la construccion y en poner mas orgulloso al pueblo de su nacionalidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Especialmente, los partidos y los pueblos, que construyen el socialismo, tienen que atenerse sin falta al estilo propio de caracter revolucionario y nacionalista en todas las esferas de la vida estatal y social como la politica, la economia y la cultura.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Los paises, que sufren dificultades socioeconomicas o conflictos etnicos, deberan buscar la solucion por cuenta propia y conforme a sus condiciones reales sin cifrar la esperanza en la \"receta\" de los imperialistas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La falta de orgullo nacional termina en la perdida del espiritu de independencia nacional, la imposibilidad de mantener el espiritu Juche y la nacionalidad y, al fin y al cabo, en el sometimiento a las fuerzas foraneas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Todos los paises y naciones deben luchar dinamicamente por frustrar las maniobras de los imperialistas y los dominacionistas encaminadas a suprimir el espiritu Juche y la nacionalidad."
