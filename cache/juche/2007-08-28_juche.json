Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter called on all the young people to bear in mind the Songun revolutionary line of the WPK as immutable truth, firmly arm themselves with the Party's Juche idea, Songun revolutionary idea and thus become ardent adherents to the idea and its steadfast champions and implementers who think and act as required by the Songun idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter underscored the need for the young people to take the lead in implementing the tasks of giving importance to the nation, defending peace and achieving unity under the banner of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, fully support the young Koreans in Japan in their courageous struggle against the Japanese reactionaries hell-bent on the moves against the DPRK and the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan and boost the solidarity with world progressive young people, guided by the idea of independence, peace and friendship.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The designation of the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League going by the august name of the President and its flag bearing his noble image are the symbols of the WPK's idea and politics of giving importance to the youth. It is the brilliant fruition of Kim Jong Il's idea and politics of giving importance to the youth that the tradition of the single-minded unity of the Songun revolution has been given steady continuity and the Korean People's Army is demonstrating its invincible might and an uninterrupted surge is brought about on all the fronts of building a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean youth made a breakthrough towards the building of a great prosperous powerful nation by building such gigantic structures as the Young Hero Motorway, the Kwangmyongsong Saltern and large power stations in the difficult period. This was a miracle which could be worked only by the Korean youth who are struggling in the revolutionary soldier spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A rich and powerful country and the worthwhile life and future of the Korean youth would have been unthinkable without Songun. The road of Juche, the road of Songun, is the only way the Korean youth should follow at all times.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

But Japan's shameless ambition for territorial expansion can never come true. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Sunday observed this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries have recently again claimed Tok Islet is part of \"Japan's territory\" in the \"2007 defense white paper.\" Timed to coincide with this, they are working hard to enact the \"Basic Law of the Sea\" and enforce it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The East Sea of Korea was marked as \"Sea of Japan\" after the Japanese imperialists occupied Korea and converted it into their colony at the beginning of the 20th century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The international community is becoming increasingly assertive that the sea east of Korea be called \"East Sea\" or \"Sea of Korea\", \"East Sea of Korea,\" the name given afterwards, as the Koreans have long called so and they are widely known to different countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Much upset by this, the Japanese reactionaries have recently become desperate in their machinations to keep \"Sea of Japan\" marked on maps by having it recognized by the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have also changed the name of the Straits of Korea recognized by the international community into Japanese name of \"Tsushima Straits.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is busy publicizing before the international community that the designation of Tok Islet and the issue of \"dominium\" over it have become a dispute. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has been proved by history and law that Tok Islet belongs to Korea and so this object is indisputable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are insisting that the topographical names of the seabeds belonging to the continental shelves of Korea be marked on maps as part of their basins and mountain ranges with Japanese names as they please. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is planning to wind up the survey and measurement of the continental shelves of the sea around it before May 2009 under the signboard of \"survey of continental shelf\" in a bid to seize in real earnest the continental shelves and their resources claimed by Korea and neighboring countries belong to the territorial waters in the new century. Japan is contemplating including the continental shelf of Korea in the waters to be surveyed and presenting data on the survey of the continental shelf based on the results of its survey and measurements and its map to the UN Commission on the Limits of Continental Shelf in a bid to get its approval before any others. It is the cunning calculation of Japan that if the map of the continental shelf marked with Japanese names is internationally recognized, it can provide it with an international environment favorable for usurping vast areas of continental shelves of the neighboring countries including Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries drew the maritime boundary line deep inside the territorial waters of Korea including the waters off Tok Islet and got this line reflected in their \"defence white paper\", \"youth paper on maritime security\", \"Map News\" and other reptile media and documents before distributing them to the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It admits of no argument that such behavior is a grave infringement upon the sovereignty of Korea. The above-said frantic moves stepped up by Japan by every possible means and method in a bid to bring territories and resources of other countries under its control remind one of the days when the Japanese imperialists ran amuck to invade Korea and the rest of Asia.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is now being fully displayed in the struggle to achieve national reconciliation and unity and attain national progress by dint of great national unity. It also finds a striking manifestation in the fact that all Koreans are now waging a dynamic drive against the U.S. and war holding aloft the banner of championing peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The formation of the All-Korean Committee for Implementation of the June 15 Joint Declaration, an umbrella body for a nation-wide reunification movement grouping organizations and figures of different social standings in the north and the south and overseas, in March 2005, put the unity of the nation on a higher stage.

During the meeting of working group on energy aid Japanese negotiators blustered that Japan would not contribute anything unless progress is made in the settlement of the \"abduction issue\", etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This only aroused the derision of the international community as it is nothing but trite bullying resorted to by Japan whenever the political situation at home and abroad turned unfavorable to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The burlesque oft-repeated by Japan over the \"abduction issue\" quite contrary to the general trend of the world situation towards reconciliation is aimed at diverting elsewhere the attention of the world public. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The so-called plan of the above-said headquarters came as part of Japan's scenario to increase \"international pressure\" upon the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But it is unjust and unreasonable in every sense for Japan to \"internationalize the abduction issue\" as it is under unavoidable historical and moral obligations to redress the crimes it committed in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is ill-famed for the hideous forcible drafting and abduction of many Koreans. However, it has so far left this crime-woven past unsettled. It is the height of hysteria for Japan to persistently talk about the \"abduction issue,\" backtracking from the commitment it made as faith in the relationship with other country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Had Japan have even an iota of political sense, it would have been wise enough to guess that the deep-rooted grudge spawned such abnormal \"abduction issue\" and it does not stand comparison with several abductees. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Moreover, it is a sheer folly to peddle the issue that had already found a settlement, far-fetchedly insisting that the dead be brought to life and sent back. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe above-said issue is now being hyped and festering due to the desperate moves of the right-wing conservative forces of Japan to tide over its political crisis at home and abroad.  Their ruckus will only result in deteriorating the DPRK-Japan relations and tarnishing Tokyo's political image. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised not to forget that its hectic diplomacy over the \"abduction issue\" would get it nowhere. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Al mismo tiempo, tratan de fraguar y poner en vigor la \"Ley principal del mar\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El nombre del \"Mar Este de Corea\" se disfrazo bruscamente de \"Mar de Japon\" a principios del siglo XX cuando los imperialistas japoneses ocuparon a Corea y la convirtieron en colonia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Hoy, en la sociedad internacional prevalece la insistencia en anotarlo como \"Mar Este\", o \"Mar de Corea\" y \"Mar Este de Corea\" que desde antiguedades la nacion coreana y varios paises del mundo denominaron. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Para frenar esta tendencia general los reaccionarios japoneses maniobran para lograr que la sociedad internacional reconozca el nombre del \"Mar de Japon\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ellos tratan de cambiar por el \"estrecho de Tsushima\" tambien el Estrecho de Corea reconocido por la sociedad internacional. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Por otra parte, pretenden describir el nombre de la isla Tok y el \"derecho a la posesion de esta\" como objetos litigiosos en la sociedad internacional. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Tanto en lo historico como en lo juridico es bien claro que la isla Tok es parte del territorio coreano. Por tanto, ella no puede ser objeto de conflicto. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Al anotar los nombres topograficos del fondo del mar correspondiente a la plataforma continental de nuestro pais los reaccionarios japoneses anotan denominaciones japonesas en el mapa. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En el nuevo siglo con el objetivo de saquear el zocalo continental y sus recursos pertenecientes a la esfera de posesion de Corea y otros paises perifericos, tratan de terminar antes de mayo de 2009 la  investigacion y la medicion de la plataforma continental de los mares contornos de Japon bajo el pretexto de la \"investigacion de la plataforma continental\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Y tienden a incluir hasta la plataforma continental de Corea en el objeto de la investigacion arriba mencionada y presentar al Comite de Demarcacion de Plataformas Continentales de la ONU los datos y mapas obtenidos a base de sus trabajos realizados para recibir antes que nadie la aprobacion de este organismo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Japon cree que de recibir el reconocimiento internacional de ese mapa en que sean anotados los fondos del mar al estilo japones, puede preparar un ambiente internacional para saquear mayor parte de los zocalos continentales de Corea y otros paises perifericos. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Los reaccionarios islenos establecen la linea de limite del mar en las profundidades de las aguas jurisdiccionales de Corea inclusive la isla Tok y tratan de convencer a la sociedad internacional a  traves de las publicaciones venales y otros documentos como \"Carta blanca de defensa\", el \"periodico juventud de seguridad maritima\" y \"Noticias de mapas\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Es indiscutible que tales actos devienen una grave violacion a la soberania de Corea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Tales maniobras arriba mencionadas hacen recordar aquel periodo en que los imperialistas japoneses actuaban freneticamente para agredir a Corea y el continente asiatico.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
