Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 27 (KCNA) -- The decision of the south Korean authorities on additional troop dispatch to Iraq has touched off an angry barrage of condemnation from the south Korean public.\r\n Students of law colleges of Korea University and Hanyang University staged a protest around Chongwadae as part of \"relay actions to thwart troop dispatch organized by the Joint Measure Committee of Students for Checking Troop Dispatch to Iraq and Achieving Peace on the Korean Peninsula. An article sent by them to the \"government\" branded its decision on troop dispatch siding with an aggression army unlawfully occupying other country as an act of violating the constitution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Jang Chang Jun, permanent researcher of the south Korean Institute of Civil Rights, published an article titled \"The Reason Why Troops Must Not Be Dispatched to Iraqi War,\" which said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The invasion of Iraq was a lawless invasion of a sovereign state. It is utterly unreasonable to side with such an unjust war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nFurthermore, it is shocking to drive out our young people as bullet-shields for the U.S. troops. Not a people want young people to shed blood in a war of aggression without justification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A spokesman for the Solidarity for Implementing the South-North Joint Declaration issued a statement titled \"Stop Siding with a Shameful War,\" which said: It is a gross mistake, if the \"government\" authorities expect that the United States would peacefully settle the issue of the Korean peninsula in return for the dispatch of troops to Iraq. They should give away such hope and find a way out for the nation through national cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, the south Korean Confederation of Trade Unions published a statement and the Regional Permanent Committee of the East Seoul Federation of University Student Councils an appeal for struggle against the authorities' additional troop dispatch to Iraq.    \r\n\r\n"
