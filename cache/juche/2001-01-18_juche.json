But all of them value their country and love their nation, not seeking their interests only. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another reason is that patriotism serves as a most viable idea of achieving true great national unity under the present situation in Korea which remains divided into two. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The distinctions between the north and south are gaping as the days go by in all fields of social life such as politics, economy and culture as differing ideologies and systems have existed there for over a half century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not what the Korean nation wants. It is its unanimous desire to live and develop as a homogeneous nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation is a resourceful nation that turned its land into a fertile one, carving out its destiny by itself and rejecting foreign forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was patriotism that inspired our ancestors hand down wisdom and talent to posterity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nothing is stronger and nobler than patriotism. Patriotism alone serves as an ideological and mental basis of uniting the north and south as one nation irrespective of political views and isms.    \r\n\r\n"
