This is the final conclusion drawn by the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was compelled to have access to nuclear deterrent to foil the U.S. and puppet forces' adventurous nuclear war moves and protect the security of the nation and peace on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet forces have no face to talk about someone's \"dismantlement of nukes\" as they allowed U.S. shipment of nuclear weapons to south Korea, hell-bent on the moves for a war against the north and have zealously pulled outsiders' chariot of a nuclear war against the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the puppet forces' persistent nuclear war threat against the north and their policy of confrontation with it were the root cause that spawned the nuclear issue on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The peace and security on the peninsula are guaranteed by the DPRK's line of simultaneously developing the two fronts, the line calling for bolstering up its nuclear deterrent for self-defense in every way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This nuclear deterrent can never be a political bargaining chip."
