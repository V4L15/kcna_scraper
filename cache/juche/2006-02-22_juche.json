The U.S. armed forces are being beefed up in and around the Korean Peninsula and moves intensified to tighten the \"international blockade\" against the DPRK, pursuant to such military strategy. This is a product of the Bush administration's sinister aim to step up the war policy against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n East Asia including the Korean Peninsula is the region where the military strategic interests of big powers are intertwined in so complicated manner that an arms race can flare up and the situation fester easily. The U.S. is contemplating amassing its armed forces and throwing a cordon of an \"international blockade\" in this region in a bid to contain other big powers and increase its political and economic influence and establish a military edge and thus dominate the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the invariable design of the U.S. imperialists to stifle the DPRK by force of arms, seize the whole of Korea and carry out its aggressive Asia strategy with the Korean Peninsula as its springboard. To this end, they are busy with the moves to amass huge forces in and around the Korean Peninsula and throw the cordon of \"international blockade\" there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Given the U.S. scenario for mounting a preemptive attack on the DPRK at any cost, the army and people of the DPRK are keeping themselves fully ready for a strong military counteraction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialist bellicose forces had better give up their reckless attempt at a preemptive attack upon the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Hence, it has left no means untried to impose the U.S.-style election system upon the African countries. It is the true intention of the U.S. to replace the political systems in the countries and nations of this region by U.S.-style political regimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By advocating the above-said \"demarche\" the U.S. seeks to secure a justification for dominating the African continent, use African countries for protecting its concessions and thus realize its neo-colonial domination over these countries with ease.\r\n Underlying its moves to intensify the infiltration into Africa is its ambition to put oil resources in this region under its control. As the U.S. succeeded in manipulating some countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States to set up pro-U.S. regimes through its \"diplomatic activities for democratization\", it is getting more frantic in its moves to overthrow regimes and systems in the African countries. \r\n Not only those countries in the region but many other countries of the world are concerned about the U.S. keen to establish the U.S.-style \"democratic order\" in Africa under the watchword of \"demarche\". In case Africa is swept by the whirlwind of U.S.-style \"democracy\", it will suffocate the continent and reduce it into a tundra of democracy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the African countries and other developing countries should properly see through the aggressive nature and danger of the U.S.-style \"democracy\" veiled with the word of \"demarche\" and not allow it under any circumstances, urges the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S.-S. Korea Agreement on \"Strategic Flexibility\" Flailed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 21 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued a statement Tuesday to accuse the United States of pressurizing the south Korean authorities to agree on \"strategic flexibility\".\r\n The statement says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By the \"strategic flexibility\" the U.S. means that its forces in south Korea should take \"responsibility for ensuring peace and maintaining stability\" in Northeast Asia as a whole including the Korean Peninsula and rapidly intervene in conflicts or disputes in any part of the region. The aim sought by the U.S. through it is to contain big powers in the region with south Korea as well as Japan as military bridgeheads and, furthermore, put the whole of Asia under its military domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The agreement on the \"strategic flexibility\" of the U.S. forces in south Korea has paved the way for turning south Korea into an outpost and a logistic base serving the U.S. in realizing its Asia strategy. The U.S. forces present in south Korea have so far claimed their mission is to \"exclusively defend the Korean Peninsula.\" But the above-said agreement projected their aggressive nature by asserting that their mission is \"to meet the challenges of the region and the world.\" This has brought into bolder relief the true objective of those forces present in south Korea under the pretext of the illegal south Korea-U.S. \"mutual defence treaty.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The agreement, at the same time, made it possible for the U.S. to closely coordinate operations of its forces in Japan and south Korea, its biggest strategic strongholds in Asia and areas with the biggest U.S. military presence, and rapidly hurl the forces into anywhere in Asia, to say nothing of the Korean Peninsula, at any moment.\r\n The agreement diametrically runs counter to the U.N. Charter which stipulates that all the UN member nations shall refrain from threatening other country by force or using force against it for the purpose of intruding into its territory and depriving it of its political independence in international relations or in any manner incompatible with the objective of the UN. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and the south Korean authorities claim that the agreement contains a clause stipulating that the U.S. forces shall get a consent from south Korea under any circumstances before intervening in Asia-Pacific problems, in any dispute between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan in particular, and that, given this clause, the new agreement shall not create uneasiness among the neighboring countries. But this is no more than sheer sophism intended to deceive the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. asserted that it would refrain from dispatching its forces in south Korea to other dispute-torn areas with due respect paid to south Korea's stand. But this sounds nonsensical as the U.S. is the world's biggest criminal state engrossed in all sorts of arbitrary practices in utter disregard of the UN, international laws and the world public opinion to achieve its own aggressive aim and meet its own interests.\r\n What should not be overlooked in it is that the agreement is aimed to mount a preemptive attack on the DPRK without difficulty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The rumor put it that the U.S. and south Korea did not mention the military threat from north Korea while discussing the issue of \"strategic flexibility\" but stressed the strategic stability on the Korean Peninsula and the establishment of multi-lateral security mechanism on a wider range instead. But this is no more than a superficial view revealing the misunderstanding of the nature of the issue.\r\n The agreement on the \"strategic flexibility\" has further strained the situation in and around the Korean Peninsula and sparked off a fresh fierce arms race.\r\n It is a lesson taught by history and an irrefutable truth clearly proved by the grim reality today that one should respond to force in kind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is left with no other option but to steadily bolster up its military deterrent to cope with the tense situation prevailing in and around the peninsula.\r\n The moves for a war of aggression escalated by the U.S. against the DPRK, refusing to quit south Korea, will only compel the DPRK to bolster up its deterrent for self-defence under the uplifted banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had better stop straining the military and political situation in the Korean Peninsula and other parts of Northeast Asia and pull back its forces from south Korea immediately so that the Koreans may achieve reconciliation, cooperation and reunification by their concerted efforts. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
