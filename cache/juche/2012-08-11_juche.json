            "content": "KCNA Report on Kim Jong Il's Journeys for Patriotic Devotion(5)\r\n Pyongyang, August 11 (KCNA) -- General secretary Kim Jong Il led the onward movement for a great surge day and night with the staunch will not to slacken the speed of the forced march before achieving a final victory. His last three years was a period in which he reviewed the popular and heroic life as a peerless patriot.\n\t\t\t\t\t He visited nearly 1 000 units in those three years. He made ceaseless forced marches of guerilla style from the east to the west, from the west to the north, saying he used to travel along rough roads to visit far-off construction sites before anyone else. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In less than a hundred days from January of 2009 he covered tens of thousands of km to visit four times as many army units, factories and farms as those done by him in the same period in 2008. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He visited South Hamgyong Province dozens of times, launching a general offensive for a great final victory. As a result, there appeared a fertilizer production system based on coal gasification in the wake of such auspicious event as technological updating of vinalon production. The Juche-oriented refractory industry began operating in full capacity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the crucible of the industrial revolution in the new century, many heavy and light industrial centers, stock breeding, poultry and fish farms were put on a scientific, intensive and industrial basis. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Cultural and entertainment centers and catering centers have sprung up in different parts of the country to fit for a highly civilized socialist country. All these structures serve as precious assets for the happiness of the people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In 2011 Kim Jong Il called on all people to put steady spurs to Songun Chollima, to the general offensive in order to demonstrate the indomitable mental power and revolutionary spirit of heroic Korea all over the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il lived a life as a great patriot, performing undying exploits for the era and the revolution, the country and its people with his outstanding ideas and theories, distinguished leadership ability and iron-will and superhuman energy. He was aboard a train for field guidance to mix with people till the last moments of his life. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world knows no such great man as Kim Jong Il who laid an eternal foundation for happiness of posterity, totally dedicating himself to the people. He suffered all sorts of pain and ordeals as a revolutionary, leader and man. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His revolutionary career is, indeed, a sacred history of the sun to always shine along with the prosperity of Kim Il Sung's nation. The history of his forced marches made by him with his boundless devotion to the country, the revolution and people is a legendary patriotic history which could be made only by Kim Jong Il, peerless patriot and father of the people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The dear respected Marshal Kim Jong Un called his patriotic idea Kim Jong Il's patriotism and authored the historic work \"Let Us Effect Kim Jong Il's Patriotism and Step Up the Building of a Prosperous Country,\" reflecting the law to govern the building of a thriving nation and the unanimous desire of all the service personnel and people. This made the whole country pervade with Kim Jong Il's patriotism, \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean people have witnessed the patriotic soul, breath and spirit of Kim Jong Il in the personality of another great man. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Standing at the watershed of history for advance in the new century of Juche, Marshal Kim Jong Un is making tireless journeys with love for the people to make sure that the valuable seeds sown by Kim Jong Il on the land with his total dedication all his life yield bountiful fruits. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He led servicepersons to work with sweat of their brow like patriots, personally planting trees with care on the Tree-Planting Day. When he visited apartment houses in Changjon Street and the construction sites of the Ryugyong Health Complex, People's Open-air Ice Rink, Rungna People's Park, etc, he told officials to do more work for the real benefits of the people by considering it as a top priority and an absolute task to provide conveniences to people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He praised the builders of Tanchon Port who did good things for the country and its people as genuine heroes and patriots of whom the country can be proud before the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He saw to it that the 66th founding anniversary of the Korean Children's Union was grandly celebrated as the greatest event in history. This was his expression of his noble love for the future and posterity. The celebrations boundlessly excited all the people of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also made sure that the country grandly celebrated the War Victory Day, demonstrating the indomitable spirit and national dignity of heroic Korea. He thus helped glorify the exploits performed by President Kim Il Sung for winning the victory in the Fatherland Liberation War for all ages and the younger generation carry forward the fighting spirit of the elder generation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Descendants of Kim Il Sung's nation, soldiers and disciples of Kim Jong Il, will dash ahead like the wind for a final victory in hearty response to Kim Jong ll's patriotism, the acme of socialist patriotism, and surely build a thriving nation in this land under the leadership of Marshal Kim Jong Un."

Korean Magazine\r\n Pyongyang, August 11 (KCNA) -- South Korea's magazine Weekly Korea recently disclosed the true colors of the \"Statue Demolition Society\" (SDS), an anti-DPRK organization.\n\t\t\t\t\t According to the magazine, the matter of forming the SDS was brought up for discussion at a \"2010 year-end gathering\" of defectors to south Korea from the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the meeting, Kim Song Min, representative of the \"Front for Liberation of North Korean People\" and concurrently of the \"Voice of Free North Korea\", instigated those present to turn out in the formation of the \"society\", saying that \"symbolic action for bringing change in the north's social system is to demolish the statues.\" After all, the SDS came into being as an organization consisting of defectors who betrayed their country, parents and families.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The gathering was also attended by the south Korean \"government\" authorities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"society\", formed with back of the Lee Myung Bak regime, is tasked to blow up statues and monuments, holy places in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The United States and the Lee group of traitors supplied fund and all necessary means for the SDS's operation and subversive activities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under their directive, the society made desperate efforts to undermine the social system in the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It once forwarded a plan to demolish leader Kim Jong Il's old home in the Paektusan Secret Camp but gave it up halfway because of the DPRK's tightened security and obstacle in import of explosives. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In recent months, too, the U.S. and the Lee group examined and approved the \"society's\" plan to demolish statues and monuments in the DPRK while rendering full support to it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This being a hard fact, they have denied the existence of the SDS even after Jon Yong Chol, a man involved in the recently-detected heinous terrorist case, testified to the fact about it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Worse still, they insisted that the \"society\" is a \"bogus organization\" and termed the recent terrorist case as the DPRK's \"own drama.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was under such developments that Weekly Korea exposed the fact about the existence of the SDS, thus laying bare the dirty colors of the Lee group of traitors. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The magazine is one of the leading ultra-rightist conservative media in south Korea which would defend the Lee group's anti-reunification policy.
