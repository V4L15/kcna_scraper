Kim Jong Suk kept watchful eyes on what was happening around the President Kim Il Sung when he was commanding the battle from a rock at a hillside. She spotted five enemy soldiers leveling guns at him after creeping by stealth up to the point very close to the hillside. At this crucial moment, she lost no chance to shield him and fired her Mauser at them and he also fired at them over her shoulder, killing all of them in a moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There were not a few critical moments during the anti-Japanese war when his safety was threatened. But the President could escape from each danger unhurt as she protected him every time.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He recalled in his lifetime that she always saved him from a crisis several times and she was ready to become human bombs anytime for his sake. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   During the period of building a new country, too, she put her heart and soul into protecting his safety. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   One day of mid-February, 1946, he was giving precious instructions to officials in charge of propaganda at his residence till late at night. An unexpected shot was heard nearby and then an electric light went out. When everyone present was perplexed, he, perfectly composed, said it seemed that a few rats ran about. He proposed them to have a break before continuing his speech and went towards the door. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Before they knew, she appeared  with a Mauser in her hand, and stood in his way with open arms, earnestly asking him not to go out as this was a request from the guards corps. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Following this noble example set by her, the guards corps grew to be the most elite unit firmly armed with the spirit of devotedly defending the leader right after the liberation of the country and the Korean people defended the headquarters of the revolution as firm as a rock. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The legend-like anecdotes about her who lived a short yet brilliant life are conveyed down through generations.

As a result, our people's army has become powerful elite forces with offensive means to defeat any enemy on earth and defensive means to repulse any surprise invasion by the enemy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The KPA has thus developed to be ever-victorious revolutionary armed forces that demonstrate its might as a core unit of our revolution creditably defending the revolutionary cause of Juche with arms. This is the most shining feat Kim Jong Il has performed on behalf of the country, the revolution, the times and history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Underscoring the need to direct utmost efforts to strengthening the people's army, the main force for accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche, considering it as a fundamental issue on which hinges the destiny of the revolution, jo referred to the tasks to be implemented to steadily increase the politico-ideological, military and technical might of the KPA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Drawing attention to a touch-and-go situation now prevailing on the Korean peninsula due to the anti-DPRK moves of the U.S. and its followers, he clarified the DPRK's stand on this as follows: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We will never remain a passive on-looker to the frantic military moves of the enemies driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war but take a strong counteraction of our style. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   No force on this planet can escape from the strike of our revolutionary armed forces and there will be no place where the enemies can survive while attacking us. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the U.S., Japanese reactionaries and the South Korean authorities unleash a war on this land at any cost despite our repeated warnings, the Korean army and people will never miss the opportunity to wipe out the aggressors to the last one, but defend the socialist fatherland of Juche and achieve the national reunification, the long-cherished historic desire. \r\n\r\n"

We, however, cannot remain a passive onlooker to the recent rumour that the project of the LWR construction will be finished in 2007 or 2008 at the earliest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We have sincerely honored our obligations under the agreement framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Fulfillment of other obligations depends on whether the U.S. side completes the construction project in time as it promised to us. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the U.S. seeks to make the implementation of the agreed points of the framework complicated and attain other purpose, it is seriously mistaken. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The process of signing of the basic contract goes to prove that some KEDO members try to use the construction of LWRs in meeting their political interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The construction of LWRs is far beyond schedule. Any attempt to link this delay to what they term \"submarine incident\" and satellite launch by the DPRK is a base trick to flee from their responsibility. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Now that the implementation of the agreed framework needs a simultaneous action of both sides from A to Z, we will not move first unilaterally in any case, if the U.S. side delays the project as it pleases. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the construction is not completed as promised under the framework, our economic loss caused by the failure, to say nothing of what we lost due to the sacrifice of our independent nuclear power industry, will have to be counted or any other step of weighty importance will have to be taken. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
