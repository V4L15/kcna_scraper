            "content": "Provocateurs Should Be Responsible for Crisis on Korean Peninsula: KCNA Commentary\r\nPyongyang, February 13 (KCNA) -- Hostile forces are escalating their provocations against the DPRK, a sovereign state, over its satellite launch for peaceful purposes. \n\t\t\t\t\tThey are busy creating atmosphere for increased pressure after the adoption of the UN Security Council's \"resolution on sanctions\", unhesitatingly making armed blackmail against the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces are vying with each other to vociferate about what they call \"crucial measure\". Some time ago, they staged joint naval exercises in the East Sea of Korea with the U.S. nuclear submarine San Francisco equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles and Aegis cruiser and more than 10 warships of the south Korean puppet navy and antisubmarine patrol planes involved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSan Francisco was deployed in the waters off the Korean Peninsula in 1994 when the standoff between the DPRK and the U.S. was most acute. Its reappearance in the waters off south Korea 19 years later brought to light the provocative scenario of the hostile forces to bring back the situation on the peninsula to a dangerous line.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey are crying out for \"stronger reaction,\" claiming that \"simple joint exercises are impossible to break the will of the north for provocations.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. transferred two B-2 Stealth bombers to Guam from its mainland base to strike the nuclear test ground and military facilities of the DPRK. The south Korean regime is busy developing ballistic missile with a range of 800km to be deployed for actual battle earlier than scheduled.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is a blatant challenge to the international community concerned about the grave political and military situation prevailing on the Korean Peninsula at present and an open act of aggression to stifle the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs proved by the facts, the root cause of the tension on the peninsula is not the satellite launch of the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is attributable to the hostile policy and war policy of the forces which cry out for even a military counteraction over the DPRK's exercise of its legitimate right to space development for peaceful purposes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey have regarded the DPRK confidently advancing along the road of independence, refusing to meekly obey them, as a thorn in their flesh. They have never dropped their scenario to bring down the social system in the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll their hostile acts against the DPRK over its satellite launch are part of their unceasing moves to stifle it. This indicates that their moves have reached a full-scale alarming phase. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey are holding the DPRK responsible for the \"tension\" and \"regional arms race,\" taking issue with its satellite launch. But, it is nothing but a fig-leaf to cover up their war policy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe situation prevailing on the Korean Peninsula at present is so serious that even a slight accidental case may lead to an all-out war which can disturb the whole region. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThose provocateurs should behave themselves. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe army and people of the DPRK are filled with will to meet all blatant challenges of the hostile forces and defend its dignity and sovereignty. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf they run amuck recklessly, misinterpreting the will of the DPRK to defend its sovereignty, its counteraction will be beyond imagination. The provocateurs will be wholly accountable for the ensuing consequences."
