As clarified at the joint meeting, the authorities in the north and south and political parties and organizations at home and abroad should make 1999 a \"year of national independence and great unity\".\r\n   Whoever wants the reunification of the country is not allowed to break the three principles of national reunification that have been confirmed before the nation and if the north-south agreement is to be implemented, everyone should be faithful to these principles that have been reaffirmed in its preamble.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the DPRK's consistent stand to reunify the country through wide-ranging  dialogue and negotiations between the north and the south. When the South Korean authorities stop joint military exercises, abolish the \"National Security Law\" and provide the freedom of the reunification movement and activities to the south headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification, the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils and other pro-reunification patriotic organizations and personages, the door of wide-ranging dialogue and negotiations including the inter-Korean high-level political talks will be opened.\r\n   The measure taken at the joint meeting is a patriotic and realistic proposal of the Workers' Party of Korea and the DPRK government that have made every possible effort to reunify the country.\r\n   The South Korean authorities should show their will for national reconciliation and reunification by  affirmatively responding to the proposal. \r\n   \r\n"

The prospect of the north-south dialogue depends on whether they are implemented or not.\r\n   If they are carried out, the dialogue can be held any time.\r\n   So, we set the latter half of the year as the time for the dialogue, in a broad-minded intention to give enough time for the south side to do so.\r\n   We hope the South Korean authorities will seriously study our letter and strictly implement those priorities so as to provide a favourable atmosphere for high-level political talks. \r\n\r\n \r\n"

His body, his head and face pitched and his hands and feet tied up, was found in a neglected crate.\r\n   Early in the 1960s GIs in a U.S. military base in Tongduchon  cut short the hair of the two South Korean women Kim Sun Ja and Kim Jong Ae.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   More than 100,000 cases of murder, robbery, rape, larceny and other crimes committed by GIs were reported by the 1980s.\r\n   In the 1990s GI's crimes showed a rise of more than 3,500 cases on yearly average.\r\n   5 of South Koreans fall victims of the crimes a day.\r\n   Murder of a South Korean woman Yun Kum Hui by Kenneth.\r\n   Michael, a private first class of the U.S. army, and murders of 7 other women by GIs from October 1992 to January 1998  were all committed in U.S. military bases and their vicinities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In January 1996 a GI strangled a woman Ri Ki Sun to death, minced her body with a dagger, and another GI drove a military truck through a shop and a bookstore, leaving a grandma and three girls dead.\r\n   While in a military training in Rithaewon-dong, Seoul, Yankees threw a hand grenade at a dwelling house of a South Korean, enjoying murder spree.  Some 20 other Yankees raped South Korean women after forcing them to take narcotics and drug smuggled from the U.S.   An employee of the U.S. Embassy drove a car over two South Koreans. A son of an officer of the 8th U.S. army committed all kinds of outrages against a pregnant woman of South Korea. U.S. tourists and Americans commit crimes every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   From the 1970s Yankees have used the internal organs and embryos of South Koreans for the manufacture of lethal weapons and researches into germ warfare in the U.S. they killed over 1,000 South Koreans by experimenting rodenticide and other virulence on them.\r\n   The South Korean authorities stopped \"prosecuting\" a GI who killed a South Korean woman Ho Ju Yon before setting fire on her body, approving murders of South Koreans by GIs present in South Korea.\r\n   More than 300 GIs committed violent crimes over January-July last year. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Kumgang. \r\n   And, it was shameless and imprudent for him to talk about \"particular care from the north side,\" when he went back to the south.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   Owing to a resolute measure of the north side against the South Korean authorities' obstruction to the payment for tourism, the ship \"Kumgang\" boarded by Pak Ji Won had to stay all night in the east sea south of the Military Demarcation Line and the tourists had to spend more than 10 hours in agony in the ship the next day. Moreover, the ship was kept under detention for two hours before returning home late at night.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Unluckily enough, the program of the tourists was cut short by one day and, consequently, the Hyun Dai Business Group had to pay even gratuity to the tourists.\r\n   This is a due punishment to the South Korean authorities who have obtrusively poked their noses into the Mt. Kumgang Tourism pushed by the Korean Asia-Pacific Peace Committee and the Hyun Dai Business Group and have obstructed this non-governmental cooperation between the north and the south in every way from the beginning, crying that the Hyundai Business group failed to obtain the \"right to use Mt. Kumgang for 30 years\" from the north and that the \"timetable for the right to use must be specified.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  But, Pak Ji Won described his painful tourism as a \"result of particular care from the north side\" and \"achievement of his dream.\"\r\n   As a \"spokesman of Chongwadae,\"  he should have apologized to the tourists for their unexpected painful trip Caused by the South Korean authorities. Nevertheless, he was busy with justifying his poor position instead of making an apology.\r\n   Indeed, he deserves the title of \"liar of Chongwadae.\"\r\n   Pak's shame warns the South Korean authorities that if they continue to poke their nose into non-governmental cooperation, they will sustain greater misfortune. \r\n\r\n"
