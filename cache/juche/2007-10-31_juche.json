            "content": "U.S. Double Standards in Nuclear Issue Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 30 (KCNA) -- The chief executive of the United States, taking issue with Iran's nuclear activities, let loose the absurd remark that if Iran forced its nuclear armament, the third world war would break out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Urging the U.S. to prove in practice its stand against the outbreak of another world war and nuclear proliferation, if it truly stood against them, a Minju Joson analyst Tuesday says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. calls into question the nuclear activities of \"hostile countries\" while keeping mum about the nuclear weaponization of its allies. A typical example is its double-dealing act of supporting Israel's nuclear weaponization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year the U.S. signed an agreement on cooperation in the nuclear field with a country remaining outside the NPT. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such double-dealing nuclear policy of the U.S. has given rise to displeasure in the international community and its unfair approach to the issue of nuclear nonproliferation has laid a stumbling block in the worldwide efforts for nuclear disarmament. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. does not pursue a unitary standard and consistency in its nuclear policy. It only abuses it for its strategy to dominate the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Not much penetration is needed to see why it called Iran to account again for its nuclear activities, throwing together balderdash about the outbreak of the third world war. The U.S. is examining a military option as a countermeasure in case Iran's nuclear issue would not be solved as it wants. What the U.S. seeks through the spread of the rumor in the international community about Iran's nuclear weaponization and ensuing outbreak of the third world war is to use it as a pretext for a military attack on Iran. The spread of the rumor about the nightmarish third world war in the international community is also aimed to drag passive countries deeper into its intensified sanctions against Iran. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. policy in handling sensitive political issues which require responsibility in a careless manner to meet its own interests is, in fact, pushing the world into a nuclear arms race. This proves that the U.S. is a dangerous nuclear criminal bringing the era of a new nuclear arms race, the cold war which will spark off the third world war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun Calls for Holding Higher Banner of Self-Reliance\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 30 (KCNA) -- Self-reliance serves as the banner of struggle to glorify the 21st century as an era of prosperity of the country and the indomitable spirit of the Korean people valiantly advancing toward a bright future with great ambition, declares Rodong Sinmun Tuesday in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Self-reliance is a strategy consistently maintained by the Workers' Party of Korea in the economic construction in the 21st century, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The key to changing the appearance of the DPRK's economy as required by the new century is to strictly apply the principle of self-reliance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is most important for pushing forward socialist construction at present is how to apply the principle of self-reliance in keeping with the changed circumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Self-reliance pursued by the WPK in the 21st century means self-reliance based on science and technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK sets it as the basic task of self-reliance to update technology as required by the new century and accelerate the production and construction with one's own efforts on the basis of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The plan of the WPK to build an economic power is based on the firm conviction that there is nothing impossible in the world when giving full play to the inexhaustible creative power of the scientists and technicians in the DPRK firmly armed with the Songun idea of Juche and possessed of a high degree of scientific and technological qualifications. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Self-reliance called for by the WPK in the 21st century means self-reliance based on profitability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the consistent principle of the WPK to plan any work and conduct it in such a manner as to gain substantial profits by giving overriding importance to profitability in all fields ranging from economic and cultural construction to external activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Self-reliance serves as an engine reenergizing the independent economy of the DPRK in all fields. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Reenergizing the national economy as required by the WPK does not mean a simple work to restore what used to be in the past but overall technological updating. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is very important for updating the national economy to actively apply ultra-modern science and technology from other countries. It also means self-reliance if one makes world-known ultra-modern technology one's own and actively applies it. The economy in the DPRK is making dynamic progress, being steadily equipped with the advanced technology, because it has maintained such realistic stand in economic construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Self-reliance serves as a powerful weapon for resolutely shattering the imperialists' economic blockade. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unprecedented was the economic pressure against the DPRK by the imperialists in the recent period. The DPRK has been exposed to the enemy's blockade for decades but never have the imperialists applied such harsh and base sanctions against it as now in terms of their scope and strength and method. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists' moves to isolate and suffocate the DPRK have not only failed but backfired. Signal successes have been reported from various fields of the national economy and more monumental structures built at a time when the situation reached an extreme pitch of tension. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Self-reliance serves as a banner of struggle as it helped firmly maintain the socialist principle in all fields of economic construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people have never abandoned the socialist principle either in the struggle to defend socialism in the past century or in the onward march in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The advance being made by the Korean people in the spirit of self-reliance is a hope-filled advance as it provides a sure guarantee for their final victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have the strong mental spirit to valiantly pull through any adversity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This spirit reinforced in the crucible of the protracted revolution grew immensely stronger in the days of defending socialism in the closing years of the past century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have the inexhaustible creative power to bring about any epoch-making change. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Underlying their strong mental spirit and creative power are the fixed faith that one is sure to win when following the leader of the revolution and the do-or-die determination to steadfastly make long journeys of revolution, remaining loyal to the leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is a bright prospect for the Songun revolution thanks to the headquarters of the revolution headed by Kim Jong Il.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But it is imperialism, not socialism that is going to ruin and destruction in actuality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Socialism represents the desire and wish of the popular masses. This is one of the reasons why it is the historical inevitability for socialism to triumph. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The cause of socialism is a just cause of achieving independence of the popular masses. Socialism reflects their desire and wish to live and develop independently. It also guarantees the independent development of a country and nation. It represents an ideal and future of humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is a new society fundamentally different from the preceding societies that served the exploiting class. It is only the socialist society that provides the popular masses with an ample opportunity of realizing independence, their cherished desire. It is inevitable and quite natural for the popular masses to aspire after and demand socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another reason why socialism is sure to triumph is that it is a law governing the development of history that society based on individualism is sure to be replaced by a society based on collectivism, i.e. by socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fundamental difference between capitalism and socialism is that the former is based on individualism while the latter is based on collectivism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The superiority of socialism to capitalism finds its clear manifestation in the political field, above all. This superiority also finds a striking expression in the economic field, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the historical inevitability for socialism to triumph because it is a law governing the development of history that the new is certain to win while the old is bound to go to ruin, concludes the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
