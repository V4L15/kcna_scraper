            "content": "Kim Jong Un Convenes Operation Meeting, Finally Examines and Ratifies Plan for Firepower Strike\r\nPyongyang, March 29 (KCNA) -- The moves of the U.S. imperialists to violate the sovereignty of the DPRK and encroach upon its supreme interests have entered a grave phase.\n\t\t\t\t\tNot content with letting B-52 make sorties over south Korea in succession despite the repeated warnings, they made B-2A stealth strategic bomber and other strategic strike means fly from Whiteman air force base in Missouri State, the U.S. over south Korea on March 28 for the first time in history to commit such dangerous provocation as openly staging a drill for striking ground targets of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis fully proves that the brigandish ambition of the U.S. imperialists for aggression to stand in confrontation with the DPRK has reached an extreme phase defying the meaningful warning made by its revolutionary armed forces in the March 26 statement of the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn view of the prevailing grim situation, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army Marshal Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and first chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK, convened an urgent operation meeting on the KPA Strategic Rocket Force's performance of duty for firepower strike at the Supreme Command at 00:30 Friday.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPresent there were Hyon Yong Chol, chief of the KPA General Staff, Ri Yong Gil, director of the Operation Bureau, Kim Yong Chol, director of the General Reconnaissance Bureau, and Kim Rak Gyom, commander of the Strategic Rocket Force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt the meeting he first received a report from General Kim Yong Chol, who is also vice chief of the General Staff of the KPA, on the information about the nature of action of the nuclear strike means of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter receiving a report from Lieut. General Kim Rak Gyom on the technical conditions of the strategic strike means of the KPA, he made an important decision.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe said he has judged the time has come to settle accounts with the U.S. imperialists in view of the prevailing situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf they make a reckless provocation with huge strategic forces, the KPA should mercilessly strike the U.S. mainland, their stronghold, their military bases in the operational theaters in the Pacific, including Hawaii and Guam, and those in south Korea, he said. He examined and finally ratified the plan of the Strategic Rocket Force for firepower strike.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. imperialists let B-2A make sorties over south Korea in succession, indicating once again that their hostile acts against the DPRK have entered a reckless phase, going beyond the phase of threat and blackmail, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tB-2A's flight to the sky above south Korea is not a simple demonstration of forces in reaction to the tough stand of the DPRK but an ultimatum that they will ignite a nuclear war at any cost on the Korean Peninsula, he noted, underlining the need to put a definite end to the times when they could threaten and blackmail the DPRK with nukes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe declared the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK would react to the U.S. nuclear blackmail with a merciless nuclear attack, and war of aggression with an all-out war of justice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe finally signed the plan on technical preparations of strategic rockets of the KPA, ordering them to be standby for fire so that they may strike any time the U.S. mainland, its military bases in the operational theaters in the Pacific, including Hawaii and Guam, and those in south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe said the enemies are bringing dark clouds of a nuclear war testing the DPRK's self-restraint, adding the DPRK can no longer tolerate this. He ordered the KPA to blow up and reduce everything to ashes at a single strike, if an order is issued.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe said the heroic service personnel of the KPA and all other people, their hearts burning with irrepressible resentment at the reckless war provocation moves of the U.S. imperialists, are now waiting for a final order of the WPK Central Committee, hardening their will to turn out in a do-or-die battle with the enemies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe KPA will never remain a passive onlooker to the U.S. imperialists' frantic moves for aggression but do its best to defend the destiny of the country and nation, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is the truth confirmed by history that no force on earth can hold in check the people all out for the just cause, he noted, stressing if an undesired war breaks out on this land again due to the consequences of the unpardonable action of the U.S. imperialists, it will bring them a shameful ruin and the Korean nation will greet the bright day of national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe important decision made by him under the grave situation where the Korean Peninsula has been pushed to the brink of a nuclear war by the U.S. imperialists will mark a turning point in putting an end to the history of the long-standing showdown with the U.S. and opening a new phase of history."

Paektu in single mind and their high spirit to annihilate the enemies. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe puppet group seems to have lost the ability of discerning the situation being stupefied with amazement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOne month has passed since the new regime emerged in south Korea but the support ratings have been in the doldrums being forsaken by the people's mindset. The regime has not yet formed the \"government\" owing to all scandals. So, the ruffians of the puppet regime dare cry out for \"insecurity of social system\" of the DPRK though the regime is just like a house in mourning. This can not but be a laughing stock.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo sooner had the new puppet regime emerged than it shelved its dirty plight on the eve of a collapse and let loose a spate of invectives against the DPRK in a bid to tarnish the high international authority and image of the DPRK and evade its retaliatory blows. This is arousing derision of people as it acts like a mad dog barking at the sky.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe puppet group is sadly mistaken if it thinks it can hurt even a bit the unbreakable single-minded unity and the image of the dignified DPRK in which all service personnel and people have formed a harmonious whole with their leader.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe group should know that the statement of the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army and the declarations of the great Paektusan nation are the eruption of the strong faith and will of its army and people to devotedly defend the leader.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnyone who goes reckless, hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership and the social system of the DPRK, will never be pardoned but they will be destroyed as the first target as had already been declared.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK's army and people are compelled to take notice of the ever stepped-up anti-DPRK invectives by the puppet group instigated by the venomous swish of skirt of the owner of the inner room of Chongwadae.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe group of traitors pointing their fingers at the sky will never be able to evade punishment."

imperialismo norteamericano contra la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea, las cuales violan la soberania y los maximos intereses de ella.\n\t\t\t\t\tPese a las reiteradas advertencias, el imperialismo norteamericano envio uno tras otro al cielo sobre el Sur de Corea los bombarderos estrategicos nucleares B-52.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInsatisfechos de ello, mando el dia 28, por primera vez en la historia, los medios de ataque estrategico, inclusive los bombarderos tipo Stealth B-2A provenientes de la base aerea de Whiteman del Estado de Missouri, para cometer abiertamente el grave acto provocador de ejercitar el ataque a los simulados blancos terrestres de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl hecho muestra patentemente que llega al extremo la ambicion agresiva de los imperialistas yanquis que intentan enfrentarse hasta el final con la RPDC desoyendo la advertencia de profundo significado de las fuerzas armadas revolucionarias coreanas, expresada a traves de la declaracion fechada 26 de la Comandancia Suprema del Ejercito Popular de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFrente a tal situacion critica, el Mariscal  Kim Jong Un, Primer Secretario del Partido del Trabajo de Corea, Primer Presidente del Comite de Defensa Nacional de la RPDC y Comandante Supremo del EPC, convoco urgentemente a las 0:30 del dia 29 en la Comandancia Suprema la reunion operacional sobre el cumplimiento de la mision de ataque artillero de las fuerzas coheteriles estrategicas del EPC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la ocasion estuvieron presentes el jefe del Estado Mayor General del

Gyom.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnte todo, el Comandante Supremo recibio el parte del general de ejercito de fuerzas terrestres Kim Yong Chol, subjefe del Estado Mayor General y jefe del departamento general de exploracion del EPC, sobre las caracteristicas de accion de los medios de ataque nuclear de las fuerzas agresoras norteamericanas \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tActo seguido, escucho el informe del teniente general de fuerzas terrestres Kim Rak Gyom sobre el estado tecnico de los medios de ataque estrategico del EPC y tomo una decision importante.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tReconocio que la situacion dada le hace juzgar que llego la hora de ajustar las cuentas finales con el imperialismo norteamericano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tExamino y firmo finalmente el plan de ataque artillero de las fuerzas coheteriles estrategicas apuntando que si los imperialistas yanquis abren el fuego con enormes fuerzas estrategicas introducidas en suelo surcoreano, hay que atacar implacablemente las bases de ellos ubicadas en el territorio estadounidense-bastion de agresores-, Hawai, la isla Guam y las demas zonas operacionales del Pacifico y las otras en el Sur de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl hecho de que los imperialistas norteamericanos despacharon hasta B-2A al cielo surcoreano, comprueba otra vez que la accion hostil anti-RPDC sobrepaso la etapa de amenaza y chantaje y entro en la fase de accion imprudente, apunto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa presencia de B-2A no es una simple demostracion de fuerza frente a la posicion intransigente de la RPDC sino el ultimatum de provocar a toda costa la guerra nuclear en la Peninsula Coreana, asevero y agrego que hay que poner punto final a la epoca en que el imperialismo norteamericano chantajea y amenaza a la RPDC con armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSenalo que las fuerzas armadas revolucionarias de la RPDC responderan con ataque nuclear despiadado al chantaje nuclear y con guerra total de justicia a la guerra de agresion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFirmo finalmente el plan de procesos de preparacion tecnica de los cohetes estrategicos dando la indicacion de entrar en el estado de espera de la orden de fuego para poder atacar en cualquier momento las bases norteamericanas arriba mencionadas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDiciendo que los enemigos traen por fin el nubarron de guerra nuclear examinando la paciencia de la RPDC, subrayo que ya no se puede aguantar mas y ordeno en tono rotundo reducir lo todo a cenizas con el primer golpe una vez dada la orden.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn estos momentos tambien, los valientes oficiales y soldados del EPC y todos los habitantes de la RPDC estan esperando la orden final del Comite Central del PTC vibrando de indignacion por las acciones del imperialismo norteamericano para provocar la guerra y redoblando la voluntad de levantarse en la batalla de vida o muerte con los enemigos, apunto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEnfatizo que el EPC no quedara con brazos cruzados ante las demenciales maniobras agresivas del imperialismo norteamericano, sino hara todo lo posible para defender el destino del pais y la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa historia comprobo la verdad de que en el mundo no existe el que pueda detener al pueblo movilizado en su causa justa, acoto y dijo en tono energico que si estalla otra vez en este territorio la guerra no deseada como consecuencia de las acciones imperdonables del imperialismo norteamericano, estos sufriran el vergonzoso arruinamiento y la gran nacion coreana acogera el nuevo y maravilloso dia de reunificacion de la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa decision importante, tomada por el Mariscal bajo la situacion severa en que se ha encendido la mecha de guerra nuclear por culpa del imperialismo norteamericano, marcara un hito trascendental en abrir la nueva pagina de la historia poniendo punto final a la historia de enfrentamiento con EE.UU. que prosigue de siglo en siglo."
