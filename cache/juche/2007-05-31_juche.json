            "content": "21st Inter-Korean Ministerial Talks Open \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seoul, May 30 (KCNA correspondent) -- The 21st North-South Ministerial Talks opened in Seoul on Wednesday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present there were members of the north side's delegation led by Chief Councilor of the DPRK Cabinet Kwon Ho Ung and its suite members and delegates of the south side with Minister of Unification Ri Jae Jong as chief delegate and its suite members. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The head of the north side's delegation and the south side's chief delegate made speeches at the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kwon analyzed the experience and lesson, reviewing how the inter-Korean ministerial talks proceeded, before advancing proposals reflecting the principled stand of the north side to firmly preserve and thoroughly implement the idea of \"By our nation itself\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He underscored the need to abide by the principle of settling the issues related to the inter-Korean relations from the stand of attaching importance to the nation and placing it above anything else. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that the implementation of the points agreed between the north and the south is held up due to the outside forces' interference and relations with outside forces are considered more important than the inter-Korean relations, he called for implementing to the letter the agreed points reflecting the interests and wishes of the nation on the principle of attaching importance to the nation and placing it above anything else. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He also underlined the need to take decisive measures against the occurrence of any acts of provoking the other dialogue partner and endangering the inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He referred to the fact that there have been a chain of abnormal developments running counter to the main spirit of the June 15 Joint Declaration since the 20th inter-Korean ministerial talks as evidenced by the north-targeted military exercises staged by the south side together with outside forces and a spate of insolent remarks let loose by its authorities including the prime minister to slander the ideology and system in the DPRK and even negate its sovereignty and inviolable territory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Deploring that one can hardly witness the implementation of the agreed points related to such fundamental and principled matters as matters of taking practical measures to ensure that each other's ideology and system are recognized and respected, he declared that in that context it is advisable for the current talks to focus the discussion on settling the fundamental points already agreed rather than working to make new agreements. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The talks go on.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

An offensive formula would be the only correct explanation of the moves of Japan to emerge a military power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now is the time for the world community to take a serious note of Japan's dangerous moves for militaristic overseas expansion that have reached an alarming phase and take a responsible action against them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will never allow the scenario of the Japanese reactionaries for a preemptive attack in order to ensure peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world, the commentary concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The Japanese reactionaries are working hard to establish the Missile Defence System (MD) while pushing forward the moves to become a military giant with the backing of the U.S. and at its connivance. Accession to nuclear weapons by Israel and other countries is chiefly attributable to the U.S. connivance and cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue of the DPRK, however, originated from the U.S. nuclear threat toward it. But for the U.S. escalated nuclear threat to the DPRK its nuclear issue would not have cropped up. The U.S., proceeding from its double-dealing stand, found fault with the DPRK only, while defending and supporting Israel and other countries in their nuclear weaponization and cooperating with them. This is a revelation of its extreme two-faced policy and one-sided hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such countries as the U.S. and Japan say this or that about the measure taken by the DPRK for increasing its defence capacity although they manufacture latest type nuclear weapons and missiles of the next generation as they please. This double-dealing policy should not be tolerated under any circumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is self-evident that the nuclear and missile issues can hardly be settled fairly as long as countries like the U.S. cling to their double-dealing policy. The persistent application of double-dealing standards would reduce even international law and treaties to dead papers.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Koreans should achieve the reunification of the country by themselves free from any interference of foreign forces. Only then is it possible to successfully resolve the issue of reunification according to the desire and interests of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If one tries to solve the issue of national reunification, an issue of winning back the sovereignty of the nation usurped by foreign forces, in reliance upon foreign forces, it would only end up finding oneself under the yoke of slavery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of Korea's reunification pertaining to the Korean nation's right to self-determination can be successfully solved only through its concerted efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the divided Korean nation national independence precisely means reunification and vice versa. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historic Pyongyang summit and the adoption of the June 15 joint declaration ushered in an era of independent reunification, the first of its kind in the nation's history of the reunification movement. This was a shining fruition of the protracted struggle of the Koreans to achieve the reunification of the country independently. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is important for the north and the south to achieve national independence at present is to firmly maintain the stand of attaching importance to the nation. This stand precisely represents national independence and its principle can be implemented only when the above-said stand is maintained. Koreans can achieve genuine national reconciliation and accelerate the independent reunification only when they always place the will and interests of the nation above anything else and protect them and remain true to the principle of national independence under any situation and circumstances.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean Military Warmongers' Military Provocations Warned\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- The servicepersons of the Korean People's Army are following with a high degree of vigilance the military provocations of the south Korean military warmongers and will take due measures if they persist in such actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA Navy Command warned this in a press release issued on May 30 in connection with the fact that the warmongers of the south Korean armed forces perpetrated such a grave military provocation as intruding a group of warships deep into the territorial waters off the West coast of the north side on the same day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the press release, at around 11:20 on Wednesday the warmongers of the south Korean armed forces infiltrated seven warships deep into the territorial waters of the north side southwest of Ssanggyo-ri, Kangryong County, South Hwanghae Province and at around 7:45 and at around 10:40 two warships into the same waters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the north side demanded over walkie-talkie their immediate withdrawal for the purpose of preventing the situation from deteriorating, they went the lengths of making such bellicose remarks as \"they would fire\" and \"they would punish\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a serious military provocation creating a touch-and-go situation in those waters and an intolerable challenge to the high degree of patience and self-restraint exercised by KPA servicepersons, the press release noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reckless military provocations of the above-said warmongers pushed the situation in the waters off the West coast to such an extreme pitch of tension that a new armed clash may break out there any moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They would be well advised to properly understand the gravity of the situation and behave with discretion.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Lo mismo sucede en el problema de posesion de armas nucleares por Israel y otros paises. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Al contrario, el problema nuclear de la RPDC surgio por la amenaza nuclear de EE.UU. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Si el imperio no hubiera acentuado la amenaza a la RPDC con artefactos nucleares, ni habria flotado ese diferendo entre ambas partes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Entonces, la conducta de EE.UU., que mide con diferentes varas el armamento nuclear de algunos paises como Israel y el desarrollo de armas nucleares para la autodefensa por parte de la RPDC, muestra su doble cara y su politica unilateralmente hostil a esta. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Nunca son criticados EE.UU., Japon y otros paises que fabrican a su antojo las armas nucleares sofisticadas y los misiles de proxima generacion. Pero si surgen problemas cuando la RPDC toma una medida destinada a fortalecer sus fuerzas para la defensa legitima. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Mientras EE.UU. y otros paises empleen esta inadmisible pauta de doble rasero, nunca sera posible resolver correcta e imparcialmente el problema nuclear y de misiles y  resultaran invalidos cualquier derecho o tratado internacionales.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
