In this regard papers here Thursday carry signed articles demanding the immediate withdrawal of the U.S. troops from south Korea.\r\n Rodong Sinmun says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation has suffered the tragedy and disgrace resulting from the national division for over half a century due to the U.S. imperialists' occupation of south Korea and their policy to perpetuate the division and stifle the DPRK.\r\n The U.S. imperialists' occupation of south Korea was a wanton violation of the publicly recognized laws and regulations on war enshrined in international law and quite contrary to the Korean Armistice Agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has increased its military presence in south Korea and strengthened its rule over south Korea and desperately stepped up its policy to stifle the DPRK by keeping there its forces, the leftover of the Cold War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has driven the belligerent relations between the DPRK and the U.S. to the phase of explosion, escalating its offensive to pressurize the DPRK with nukes under the pretext of the \"nuclear threat\" from the latter. Due to this, the situation on the Korean Peninsula is inching close to an extreme pitch of tension. The U.S. troops in south Korea are the root cause of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under this situation the withdrawal of the U.S. troops from south Korea is more urgently demanded than ever before. It is impossible to achieve the peace and reunification of Korea nor is it possible to ensure peace and security in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world as long as there are the U.S. troops in south Korea. The U.S. forces' pullback from south Korea would bring about a phase decisively favorable for peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and peace and security in Northeast Asia.\r\n It would, at the same time, remove the root cause of war from the Korean Peninsula, defuse the tension and open a bright prospect of settling the Korean issue.\r\n If it is true that the U.S. has no intention to invade the DPRK and has the stance to ensure peace on the Korean Peninsula and improve the relations with the DPRK, it should prove it in practice by making a decision for the withdrawal of its troops without delay. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson calls upon all the Koreans to turn out as one in the struggle to force the U.S. troops to quit south Korea in order to protect the dignity and sovereignty of the nation and achieve national reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The United States bisected the Korean nation which had lived as a homogeneous nation in one and the same land for 5,000 years and has been blocking Korea's reunification for 60 long years, he said, adding: This anti-reunification act of the U.S. is the most grave crime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The chief of the mission continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is tightening its military occupation and rule over south Korea. And, after the publication of the historical June 15 joint declaration, it is resorting to mean artifices overtly and covertly to block at whatever cost the favorably developing process of inter-Korean reconciliation, cooperation and reunification with every nerve on the alert.\r\n What is also grave among the crimes committed by the U.S. is the crimes against humanity such as massacre and destructions perpetrated by it during the last Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another crime of the U.S. imperialists is that they are tenaciously seeking to \"overthrow the system\" of the independent sovereign state by every conceivable means such as nuclear threat, economic blockade and ideological and cultural infiltration, having made it their policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  History makes it unequivocal that an end must be put to the record of crimes of the U.S. forces in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans set this year as the year of the withdrawal of the U.S. forces.\r\n The chief called upon the world progressive forces to extend the scope of their activities for support to and solidarity with the Korean nation in its just patriotic cause against the U.S. imperialists' hostile policy towards the DPRK and their war moves against the north and for the expulsion of the U.S. forces from south Korea in accordance with the idea of \"By our nation itself\".    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Its founding meant the appearance of a new type socialist state in the human political history, which strives to materialize the independent idea of the popular masses, and helped the world progressive people find the most correct way of building a people's government guaranteeing the successful implementation of the cause of independence, he noted, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the outstanding leadership of Kim Il Sung the DPRK came to develop into a genuine people's government which always placed the interests of the popular masses above anything else and worked hard to meet them and turned into a socialist state of Juche type undisputably supported and trusted by them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The glorious history of the DPRK has been successfully carried forward by leader Kim Jong Il, a reliable successor to Kim Il Sung's revolutionary cause. Kim Jong Il has built the DPRK to be Kim Il Sung's state both in name and reality.\r\n He took the historic measure of legislating on holding  Kim Il Sung in high esteem as eternal President of the Republic. It was the most vivid manifestation of intense loyalty and the noblest sense of moral obligation towards the leader, unprecedented in the world's history of socialist movement, and a great deed to be specially recorded in the nation's history, which made it possible for the DPRK to steadily advance on the permanent basis of the President's Juche idea and his feats performed in the nation-building. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il has converted the DPRK into a powerful socialist state with invincible might. He has applied the fundamental idea of socialist politics and met the law-governed requirements of the Songun revolution, thus successfully building the driving forces of the Korean revolution with the People's Army as a core and main force and achieving the steel-like unity of the servicepersons and people. He, at the same time, achieved the single-minded unity of the whole party and army and all the people based on the comradeship centered on the leader with his noble benevolent politics, thus significantly consolidating the socio-political foundation of the DPRK and augmenting its politico-ideological might. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il has increased the potentials of the DPRK in all fields by enforcing the ever-victorious Songun politics. This exploit serves as the most precious treasure as it has paved the most correct way of building a socialist state in our era by embodying the Juche revolutionary principle that the government is maintained and grows stronger thanks to the army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the fundamental requirement for the development of the DPRK to firmly preserve Kim Il Sung's Juche-based idea on nation-building and his feats performed in it and glorify them, the reporter said, calling for making the DPRK shine forever as the glorious state of Kim Il Sung and upholding Kim Jong Il's Songun idea and politics with loyalty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans will foil the moves of the separatists at home and abroad by their concerted efforts and achieve the country's reunification without fail under the banner of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and certainly build an independent and prosperous reunified powerful state on the Korean Peninsula.\r\n Turning to the prevailing situation, he said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is standing in acute stand-off with the imperialist reactionaries.\r\n The army and people of the DPRK will never tolerate the enemies' moves to isolate and stifle it but mercilessly foil them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was one of the last instructions of the President and it still remains an ultimate goal of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK government has consistently maintained the stand to seek a negotiated peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue and will strive to realize the denuclearization of the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will as ever unite close with the peoples of all countries advocating independence, resolutely foil the U.S. imperialists' ambition to dominate the world and their brigandish state-sponsored terrorism and firmly preserve peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world, the premier noted, and continued: The DPRK will boost solidarity and the relations of friendship and cooperation with all the countries and peoples that respect its sovereignty and support its just cause and work hard to build an independent and peaceful new world.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The occupation was aimed to dominate the whole of Korea and the rest of Asia, using south Korea as springboard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. brought its wicked scheme for aggression into bolder relief after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration. The U.S. was the chief architect of the Korean nation's division and remains a main obstacle to Korea's reunification and a permanent source of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as daylight that it is impossible to reunify the country and ensure peace as long as the U.S. is present in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Peace on the Korean Peninsula is directly linked with peace and security in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world. The withdrawal of the U.S. forces from south Korea, therefore, presents itself as an urgent task the fulfillment of which brooks no further delay for peace and security in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world.\r\n That is why not only the Koreans but the world peace-loving people demand that the U.S. pull back its forces, a chief disturber of peace and security in Northeast Asia, from south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Irresistible is the trend of the times demanding the withdrawal of the U.S. forces from south Korea. The U.S. should take a measure to withdraw its forces for aggression from south Korea as early as possible. If it works hard to keep its forces in south Korea, they will suffer the disgrace of being driven out of there by the fierce anti-U.S. struggle of the Korean nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Among them were the North Side's Preparatory Committee for Joint Functions of Koreans in the North and the South and Overseas to Implement the June 15 Joint Declaration, the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland, the south Korean Federation of Peasants Associations, the south Korean Federation of the Poor, the Japanese Regional Headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification (Pomminryon) and the Headquarters of Koreans in Japan of Pomminryon.\r\n The statement calls for driving the U.S. forces out of south Korea by the concerted efforts of the Koreans and reunifying the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unspeakable is the harm done by the U.S. forces to the Koreans since they landed in the southern part of the Korean Peninsula under the mask of allied forces on September 8, 1945, to say nothing of the misfortune and pain the Korean nation has undergone since then, it said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even after signing the Armistice Agreement the U.S. forces converted south Korea into a nuclear arsenal and a logistic base for invading the north, far from withdrawing or cutting down the forces. They perpetrated criminal acts in ordinary times, and when Koreans demanded independence, democracy and reunification these troops ruthlessly killed them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In other words, the past 60 years of the U.S. forces' presence in south Korea have been a period in which the fate of south Koreans has been no better than that of slaves who are more dead than alive and the 60 years of national division have been a period in which the Korean nation has been exposed to the threat of war and many overseas Koreans have been prevented from traveling due to the national division and confrontation imposed by the U.S. upon them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans declared this year marking the 60th anniversary of its cursed national division as a year when they will certainly reunify the country independently and force the U.S. forces to quit south Korea and a year in which they wll wage a do-or-die struggle to foil the U.S. war hysteria. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n September 8 also marks the day when the U.S. proclaimed its occupation of the land south of the 38th parallel and went into action, the statement said, stressing that the passage of a day from that date means adding one more day to the 60 years of the U.S. forces' presence in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In a nutshell, now is the time for the Korean nation to go into action, the statement said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There would be nothing impossible for the Koreans if they go united.\r\n The 70 million Koreans with a history spanning 5,000 years will make the struggle for the U.S. withdrawal rage now that they are guided by the idea of \"By our nation itself\" on the road of independence and great unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans will successfully achieve the three forms of cooperation for national independence, peace against war and reunification and patriotism and certainly reunify the country in the present generation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
