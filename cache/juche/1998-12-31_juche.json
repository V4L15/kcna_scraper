In the railway transport diesel engine locomotives were converted into electric locomotives called \"forced march.\"\r\n   60 kilometre-odd-long railroad between Haeju and Ongjin, between singangryong and Pupho in the central area of the country was switched over to a broad-gauge one. The Pyongyang Integrated Circuits Factory, salt refineries and other industrial establishments were commissioned or completed throughout the country. As a result, a more solid economic foundation of the nation was laid.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n"

He felt the temperature of the floor of a farmhouse and went to Huichon crossing high and rough ridges at night, saying that he saw people in Huichon in his dream.\r\n   It also says that Kim Jong Il went to a coastal artillery position and listened to twin soldiers playing flutes. Also depicted in it is a story that he took a measure to make stone photos of martyrs so that they can live eternal lives.\r\n   Noting that Marshal Kim Jong Il has lived among the people as their real fathers would, all the year round, it stresses that the country and  the Workers' Party of Korea have become stronger this year thanks to his tireless efforts.\r\n   An artificial satellite was launched into orbit this year as directed by him, the poem says.   All the world looks up to the DPRK because the bright star of Mt. Paektu  spread its rays both in the sky and on the land.\r\n   1998 was a year which demonstrated the might of our revolutionary armed forces to the world and which is filled with great events rocking the earth.   In  365 days of the year, the Supreme Commander tirelessly struggled to defend and glorify socialism. Indeed, he is the iron-willed defender and fatherly leader, it stresses.\r\n   It wishes the marshal  good health and a long life for a new turn in building a powerful nation, for continued victory in the new year and for exalting the coming century as one of Korea.    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n"
