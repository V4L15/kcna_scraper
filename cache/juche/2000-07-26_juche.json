They played a great role in carrying out the nationalization of the key industries and agrarian reform as they fully reflected the desire of the workers and peasants at that time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In that period the party set out such slogans as \"Let's greet the first spring in liberated Korea with increased production and don't  let even an inch  of land lie idle \" to consolidate the success of the agrarian reform and lead all the democratic reforms to victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The slogans \"Everything for the victory of the war \", \"Let us defend every inch of the fatherland to the last drop of our blood \" and \"The rear is also the  front \" encouraged the whole army and all people to defend the country during the Fatherland Liberation War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The slogans \"Everything for the postwar rehabilitation and development of the national economy to strengthen our democratic base \",  \"Dash forward at the speed of Chollima \" and \"one for all and all for one \" Became one of the main factors of accelerating the postwar rehabilitation and construction and the socialist industrialization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The WPK laid down such slogans as \"Let us meet the requirements of Juche in ideology, technology and culture \", \"Let us produce, study and live as the anti-Japanese guerrillas did \", \"Let us live our own way \" and \"Let us powerfully accelerate the general march of socialism in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude \" to push forward socialist construction to victory without any twist and turn. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In recent years the party put forth the slogans \"Follow up the 'arduous march' with a cheerful advance\" and \"Forwards for the forced march for final victory \" under which the Korean people have made decisive breakthrough towards building a powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This year the party laid down the slogan \"Glorify this year, the WPK's 55th anniversary, with signal victory in the crucible of greatly increased activity of chollima \" which powerfully encourages the Korean people in their dynamic drive. \r\n\r\n"

This is an unpardonable criminal act of putting a brake on the implementation of the declaration and challenging the drive to reunify the country independently by the concerted efforts of our nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  This step is part of the anti-reunification, anti-national moves taken by those separatist forces at home and abroad displeased with our national unity and reunification because they are much upset by the developments today when the declaration has entered the phase of its full implementation and the anti-U.S. movement for independence is mounting in South Korea higher than ever before in the run-up to the 55th anniversary of Korea's liberation which will fall on August 15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  \r\n   All the Korean  people  desirous of national unity and reunification bitterly denounce the anachronistic step taken by the South Korean police authorities, still pursuing north-south confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The historic north-south joint declaration cannot be implemented by sincere efforts of one party alone. It can bear good fruits only when both the north and the south and all the fellow countrymen unite and come out for reunification and patriotism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  If the South Korean police authorities treat those South Korean people who  aspire after reunification as criminals and block their actions for reunification and patriotism against outside forces on charges of failure to get \"approval,\" this act cannot be construed otherwise than an anti-national, anti-reunification act as it hinders the implementation of the declaration and runs counter to the process  for improved north-south relations.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They must immediately withdraw their step of obstructing the implementation of the north-south joint declaration and refrain from cracking down upon the patriotic movement of South Korean people from all walks of life for reunification by linking them with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They must know that the entire nation and the world will follow their future attitude. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If they persistently take the road of confrontation, going against aspirations of all the fellow countrymen for great unity and reunification of the nation and the trend of the times, they will be wholly responsible for all consequences to be entailed by it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
