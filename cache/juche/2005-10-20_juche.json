Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 19 (KCNA) -- The People's Action against the Troop Dispatch in south Korea reportedly held a press conference near the building of the \"National Assembly\" on Oct. 13 to denounce the authorities' moves to railroad the \"bill on peace-keeping activities\" through the NA.\r\n A press release read out at the press conference recalled that 34 lawmakers from ruling and opposition parties submitted to the Unification, Foreign Affairs and Trade Committee of the NA on Sept. 2 the bill on dispatching overseas the south Korean troops without any approval of the NA under the pretext of rapidly meeting the UN's request for troop dispatch.\r\n The press release branded this bill as a dangerous one aimed at reducing the south Korean troops to units serving the U.S. troops dispatched overseas, going beyond the framework of peace-keeping activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The authorities sent troops to the U.S. unjust war of aggression against Iraq under the pretext of the \"UN's request\" and agreed with the U.S. to define \"peace-keeping activities and emergency rescue from disaster\" as new duties stipulated in the south Korea-U.S. \"alliance.\" These facts prove that the bill is aimed at legally backing the increasing role of the U.S. troops in south Korea according to the U.S. strategy for dominating the world. \r\n If the authorities are to genuinely contribute to the international community, they should immediately repeal the unconstitutional bill and take a substantial action for peace.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It asserted that \"there was concern about the possibility to stir up ideological disarmament in the south Korean society\" and \"it was an appeasement policy toward the north stepped up under the slogan of independence and by our nation itself.\" It went the lengths of labeling the north \"a principal enemy\" and attacking the north, branding the Workers' Party of Korea as \"an enemy-benefiting organization under the existing law\".\r\n What the newspaper said in its editorial was an unpardonable provocation to the north and a blatant challenge to the desire and wishes of the Koreans for national reconciliation and unity, peace and reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This was nothing but the last resort of the pro-U.S. conservative forces opposed to reunification to chill the desire for achieving independent reunification through alliance with the north which has become a trend of the times in south Korea and divert it in a bid to prevent their foundation from collapsing. \r\n The information bulletin recalled that this newspaper has long thrown a stumbling block in the way of the progressive development of the south Korean society and the improvement of the inter-Korean relations by slandering the dignified political system in the north and decrying the movement of the south Korean people for independence, democracy and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It continued: Though five years have passed since the publication of the June 15 joint declaration, Dong-A Ilbo remains unchanged in its treacherous behavior of advocating sycophancy and treachery and confrontation with compatriots. It would be well advised to drop its old habit of inciting inter-Korean confrontation.    \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
