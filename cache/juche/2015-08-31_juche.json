Korea\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, August 31 (KCNA) -- The Bar Association for Democratic Society filed a lawsuit against the decision of the Supreme Court that defended an \"emergency measure\", according to the Voice of People, south Korean internet newspaper.\n\t\t\t\t\t In 2013 the \"constitutional court\" ruled illegal the \"emergency measures\" dating back to the period of \"yusin regime,\" charging that they lack justifications for legislation and also seriously restricted or violated the fundamental rights of the people including the freedom of expression, assembly and demonstration and the academic freedom. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the \"constitutional court\" shunned the decision, citing a clause that prohibits lawsuit for trial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Supreme Court's decision deserves punishment as it violated the basic rights of the people by applying legislation that had already been rendered invalid by the decision of the \"constitutional court,\" the organization said."
