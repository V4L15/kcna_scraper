This means that the united states has internally designated the DPRK as the next target of its \"anti-terrorism war\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reason why the U.S. refused to accept the DPRK Government's proposal for the conclusion of a non-aggression pact between the two countries is getting clearer as the days go by. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. again raised the hackneyed charge of being a \"terrorist regime\" in a desperate attempt to mount a military attack on the DPRK at any cost. But this only proves that no pretext for attack can be found in the DPRK Government's principled stand and measure related to the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has become clearer that the U.S. is seeking to stifle the DPRK by force under any pretext and this makes more obvious where the DPRK should go.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
