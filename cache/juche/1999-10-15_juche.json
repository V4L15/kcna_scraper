            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on DCRK founding proposal\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 15 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun on Thursday carried an article saying that the proposal for founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo (DCRK) put forward by the President Kim Il Sung is the realistic and reasonable patriotic way of reunifying Korea most easily and quickly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The daily went on to say: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Different ideas and social systems have existed in the north and the south of the Korean peninsula for over half a century. Any side of them does not want to give up its own idea and system. Under this condition any side of the north and the south should not absolutize its own ideology and social system or try to force them on the other side for the peaceful reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DCRK founding proposal is based on the realistic possibility that people with different ideas can live together in a country and different social systems can exist in a unified country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A few years ago, Hong Kong reverted to China. This practically proved that the two different social systems can co-exist in a country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people can no longer allow the tragic division of the nation. They are unanimously considering it as the supreme task of the nation to reunify the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DCRK founding proposal is realistic in view of interests of the countries around Korea as well as of its nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The proposal is aimed at creating an independent neutral state and a non-aligned state which is not a satellite country of others and does not depend on any outside forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Accordingly, if a confederal state is founded in the Korean peninsula, all the foreign troops will withdraw from South Korea and foreign military bases will be dismantled. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThen there will be no confrontation or conflict in the interests of countries around the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All the Koreans will achieve the cause of national reunification in the near future by realizing the DCRK founding proposal under the wise leadership of the respected Marshal Kim Jong Il. \r\n\r\n"

B. Mukherjee, Honorary Director General of the Asian Regional Institute of the Juche Idea, made a report titled \"to advance along the road of independence is the unanimous desire of the Asian people\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He said in his report that to build an independent and  prosperous new Asia is an inevitable requirement of historic development and an urgent demand of peoples in Asian countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    In order to achieve the  independent development of each country and build an independent and prosperous new society, it is imperative to strive to defend the principle of independence in politics and build a self-supporting national economy on the principle of self-reliance, he noted, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   To realise the independence of Asia it is necessary to  intensify the anti-imperialist struggle and  strengthen the unity and cooperation among the Asian countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   For the victory of the cause of independence the Asian countries, transcending the slightest difference in interests, should firmly unite under the banner  of the anti-imperialist joint front and counter the imperialists' divide-and-crush tactics with the strategy of unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The reporter called for fully supporting and encouraging the Korean people in their  struggle to check and frustrate the imperialists' moves for isolation and suffocation and build a powerful socialist state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Speeches were made by delegates of Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India and other countries and the secretary general of the Korean Social Scientists Society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The popular masses should take an independent and creative position with the attitude  befitting masters of the revolution and construction, build a self-supporting national economy under the uplifted banner of self-reliance and build a prosperous, sovereign and independent state, they noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The collective self-reliance is a realistic way for the underdeveloped countries and the developing countries to apply the principle of self-reliance. The peoples of the developing Asian countries should expand south-south cooperation and exchange with all potentialities and possibilities on the principle of the collective self-reliance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A letter to Kim Jong Il and a declaration \"let us vigorously struggle for the independent development of Asia under the uplifted banner of self-reliance\" were adopted at the seminar. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Self-reliance, the fundamental demand of the Juche idea, is the most correct way of building an independent and prosperous new Asia. The work for social progress and prosperity can be successful only when believing in the strength of the people and depending on them,  the declaration said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Asian countries and peoples should firmly adhere to the anti-imperialist independent stand, fight against the imperialists and defend independence, sovereignty and security of their countries  and nations by their own efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Asian countries should build a developed and self-supporting national economy with the creative labour of their peoples and their resources on the principle of self-reliance, thoroughly check the ideological and cultural infiltration of the imperialists and carry forward the heritage of national culture peculiar to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Asian countries should unite and cooperate under the banner of self-reliance on a nation-wide and a world-wide scale to accelerate the building of an  independent new society and make all efforts to expand and develop the south-south cooperation in particular. \r\n\r\n"

And the brutal killing of people by the U.S. troops in different parts of South Korea before and during the war is being opened to the public in succession. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The newly disclosed massacres are no more than part of innumerable barbarities committed by the U.S. troops  against the Korean people during the Korean War, the spokesman said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In Sinchon county, South Hwanghae Province, the U.S. aggression troops killed over 35,000 innocent people in cold blood in a way that is beyond human imagination. This clearly proves that the U.S. is beasts of the 20th century who put the Nazi criminals of World War II to shame. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Today when crimes of the U.S. troops have been fully disclosed by the testimonies of witnesses and those who were involved, however, the South Korean authorities do not actively probe the cases in a bid to hush it up, kowtowing to the United States, their master, as in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  This proves once again that the South Korean authorities are the pro-American flunkeyists and traitors who are not interested in the destinies of the nation and fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We will square accounts with the U.S. for all their crimes against our people and make them pay for the blood. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If lasting peace and stability are to be ensured on the Korean peninsula and the issue of Korea's reunification is to be solved smoothly in conformity with the aspiration and demand of  our people and the peace-loving people of the world, the U.S. troops should withdraw from South Korea at an early date and the U.S.  interference in the internal affairs of Korea should be completely terminated. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
