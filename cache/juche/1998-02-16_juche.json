His on-site guidance to the province marks a turning point in leading socialist construction as a whole to a new peak and a new starting point to boost economic sectors.\r\n   The present forced march is a worthwhile struggle to carry into practice his idea and politics and it is a historical advance by his absolute authority. His plan to win the final victory is farsighted and his strategy and line are correct. When we fight as intended by him, we will emerge ever victorious.\r\n   The revolutionary spirit of Kanggye created by the workers and people in Jagang Province is the spirit of the present forced march. It is the spirit of carrying through his plan and intention through thick and thin and the spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle that helps create thing out of nothing. The Kangson spirit was the motive force of the great Chollima Upsurge during the postwar period of hard ordeals, whereas the revolutionary spirit of Kanggye at present is becoming the militant banner of the forced march of socialism.\r\n   General Secretary Kim Jong Il's way of revolution is the ever-victorious revolutionary one that sets in motion the might of singlehearted unity, political and ideological might and solves all the problems by relying on the advantages of our system and our own economic foundations. There is no better way than this for us.\r\n   The final victory is in store for us.\r\n   Minju Joson in an editorial says that all the officials and other working people, remaining loyal to the leadership of General Kim Jong Il, should advance and advance, struggle and advance, full of conviction and optimism, to demonstrate the honor of victors in socialist construction.    \r\n   \r\n"
