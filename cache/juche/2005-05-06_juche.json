The Party and the leader believe in the people and all the people follow the Party and the leader in one mind and absolutely support them. Herein lies the eternal vitality of our single-minded unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The benevolent policy of our Party is the fundamental source of the invincibility of the single-minded unity of the leader, the party and the masses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is thanks to the noble popular policy of Kim Jong Il that unbreakable blood ties have been forged between the headquarters of the revolution and the people and, on its basis, relationship of comradely love and revolutionary sense of obligation has been established among all the members of society to turn the whole country into a large harmonious family. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The close unity of our army and people around the headquarters of the revolution in ideology and will and in moral sense of obligation is the real picture of our harmonious whole and herein lies the source of the invincibility of Korean-style socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The solidness and invincibility of Korean-style socialism also lie in that it has the powerful military strength as its pillar and the popular masses regard socialism as their life and soul.

Its formation made it possible to rally the patriotic forces of workers, peasants and other strata and build up the driving force of revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is entirely thanks to the wise guidance and energetic activities of the President that the Korean people found out a  correct way for the liberation of the nation from the Japanese imperialist rule in line with the Ten-Point Programme of the ARF, defeated the Japanese imperialists and liberated the country with their own efforts, united close around him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He, on the basis of the brilliant success and rich experience gained in the efforts to closely unite broad sections of patriotic forces through the formation of the ARF, authored the \"Ten-Point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the Reunification of the Country\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tradition of the great national unity established by the President has successfully been carried forward by leader Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today all the Koreans in the north, south and overseas are making strenuous efforts to achieve the independent reunification of the country, rallied in the idea of \"by our nation itself\" set forth by the June 15 North South Joint Declaration. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
