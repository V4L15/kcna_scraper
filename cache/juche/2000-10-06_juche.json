Finally, his perseverance started him on the incline to international reputation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He came out on top on a dozen occasion in international festivals in Austria, the Czech Republic, China and elsewhere and became a twice winner of grand prize. In the 1981 Monaco Festival, he was awarded the World King of Magic Title. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He is now working as a magic lecturer at the Pyongyang Circus College. \r\n\r\n"

This is one of the first signal success achieved by both sides in seeking ways of reunification since the division of the country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the unshakable will of all the fellow countrymen to achieve the cause of national reunification in the coming few years by the concerted efforts of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The day is sure to come when all the Koreans in the north, south and abroad will live together in harmony in a reunified homeland, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Present at the meeting were Yang Hyong Sop, vice-president of the presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly, Kim Yong Dae, chairman of the c.c. of the Korean Social Democratic Party, Ryu Mi Yong, chairperson of the c.c. of the Chondoist Chongu Party, officials concerned, leading officials of power organs, public organizations and  religious organizations, and working people in the city. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
