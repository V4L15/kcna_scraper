He always found himself among the masses to grasp what they wanted and the actual conditions and reflect them in policies, thus guiding the revolution without making any error or mistake in working out lines, they noted.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Communique of KPA Navy Command \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 17 (KCNA) -- The Navy Command of the Korean People's Army Friday published a communique as regards the south Korean army's evermore undisguised moves for military provocations in the West Sea of Korea and intensified propaganda against the north.\r\n It says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already known, the south Korean army announced that a patrol boat of the north side \"infiltrated\" into the \"northern limit line\" 0.7 mile at around 5 p.m. Wednesday and combat warships of the south side fired warning shots in the air to check its intrusion after serving warning over loudspeaker. Then it released a false report that the patrol boat of the north side sailed back 14 minutes after the firing of warning shots. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is the fact that the south Korean army decided to lodge a strong protest with the north side against this at the 3rd North-South Military Working Talks expected to be held soon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north cannot but clarify its stand on the smear campaign going beyond the limit of tolerance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In a word, the south Korean army's much publicized \"case of intrusion\" by a patrol boat of the north side is nothing but a sheer lie and a deceptive farce. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There was not a single patrol boat of the north side that sailed in the waters and at the time mentioned by the south Korean military and in the surrounding waters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This notwithstanding, the south Korean military is working hard to mislead the public opinion by spreading misinformation. This improper behavior diametrically runs counter to the measure taken at the inter-Korean military talks to ease the military tension. This cannot but be construed otherwise than a sinister aim to persistently insist on the bogus \"northern limit line\" drawn by foreign forces and incite the north-south confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The false report and smear campaign against the north are nothing beneficial to the development of the north-south relations and the relaxation of the military tension between them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a matter of fact, the intrusion of south Korean combat warships into the territorial waters of the north side has not ceased but become pronounced since steps were taken by the two sides to prevent the clash of combat warships in the West Sea from June 15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is preposterous for the south Korean military authorities to intensify the military provocations that may lead to armed clashes, while vociferating about the prevention of them at the conference table. This is as foolish an act as playing with fire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is a limit to the self-restraint and patience of the navymen of the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the south Korean army persists in its military provocations, misjudging the changed situation, it will entail irretrievable serious consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north warns the south Korean military authorities not to act rashly, clearly mindful that they will have to pay a high price for their reckless moves to kick up a new row of military confrontation, toeing the U.S.line. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "End to U.S. Occupation of South Korea Urged \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 17 (KCNA) -- The U.S. military occupation of south Korea and its policy of domination over it are a stumbling block lying in the way of the independent development of the south Korean society and the root cause of all misfortunes and pain the south Korean people are suffering, says Rodong Sinmun Saturday in a signed article.\r\n By origin, the U.S. military occupation of south Korea was illegal and brigandish aggression perpetrated without any reasonable ground and a wanton violation of the sovereignty of the Korean nation, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. policy of dominating south Korea precisely means a colonial enslavement policy. The U.S. put all the fields of south Korea including politics, military, economy and culture under its control by imposing upon south Korea many shackling treaties and agreements such as \" mutual defence treaty,\" \"SOFA\" and \"agreement on economic aid.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. left no means untried to keep its colonial domination over south Korea after its military occupation. Whenever the struggle for independence against the U.S. and for democratization and national reunification mounted and the U.S. colonial fascist rule in south Korea faced a crisis it engineered an incident of usurping power like a coup, thus toppling regimes overnight. Such coups as \"May 16 military coup\" and \"December 12 army purge coup\" were carried out in the last century. The pro-U.S. conservative forces introduced a motion on \"impeachment\" before the 17th-term National Assembly\r\nelection this year, backed by the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unbearable are misfortunes and sufferings inflicted upon the south Korean people by the U.S. military occupation and colonial domination. The 50-odd-long year history of the U.S. occupation of south Korea is a history of man-slaughter and human rights abuses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Countless is the number of the cases of brutal man-killings committed by the U.S. imperialist aggression forces. They include the \"Kunsan shooting case\" in which they shot to death a young girl who was plucking edible herbs, regarding her as a \"pheasant\", the \"incident of throwing a boy in a wooden box from a helicopter\" in which they branded a shoeshine boy in Puphyong as a thief and dismembered him before putting him into a wooden box and throwing him from a helicopter, the Phaju murder case in which they shot to death a peasant who was gathering firewood, considering him as \"roe deer\" and a firing case in which they tested M-16 rifles on several peasants, killing them in cold blood. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people from all walks of life in south Korea should turn out as one in the struggle for independence against the U.S. in order to put a definite end to the U.S. policy of military occupation and domination and thus fully demonstrate the stamina of the resourceful and valiant Korean nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun Saturday says this in a signed article. It goes on:\r\n The U.S. imperialist aggressor troops killed at least 120,000 innocent civilians in Hwanghae Province alone during their temporary occupation of it. In Sinchon County, GIs and class enemies killed at least 35,000 patriots and innocent civilians or a quarter of its population in a most brutal manner for over 50 days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By the order issued by their boss to reduce everything alive and moving in Sinchon to ashes and bury them, GIs and class enemies employed every savage method beyond human imagination in killing people. They picked guiltless civilians to death, drove nails into their heads, sawed their necks, hung them on tree branches upside down before burning their heads, gouged their eyes and skinned them off and cut off the breasts of girls and women to death after raping them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The investigation team of the Women's International Democratic Federation said in a report on its field investigation into GIs' atrocities in Korea in May 1951, said that such massacre and mass torture are more horrible than what was committed by the Hitler Nazis in Europe during their temporary occupation of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists committed such monstrous mass killings not only in the northern half of Korea but in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Citing concrete facts to prove these atrocities of the U.S. imperialists, the article notes that the hard facts can neither be covered up nor erased. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The servicepersons and people of the DPRK can never forget these mass killings perpetrated by them during the Korean war but will force them to pay for the blood shed by Koreans, concludes the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
