Lurking behind this is their wild ambition to cover up the true colors of their nuclear issue and the moves to establish the missile defense system in the eyes of the international community under its pretence and push forward the scenario for turning Japan into a military giant behind the scene and thus trump up an excuse for staging a comeback to Korea and the rest of Northeast Asia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs widely known to the world, Japan had already researched and developed nuclear technology and facilities and has a stockpile of plutonium enough to produce thousands of nukes.

            "content": "Funcionario militar rechaza nuevo complot anti-RPDC\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPyongyang, 11 de agosto (ACNC) -- Tras inventar de nuevo el complot de la \"provocacion\" cometida supuestamente por el Ejercito Popular de Corea en el mar cercano a la isla Yonphyong disparando los canones, los belicistas del circulo militar surcoreano libran ahora una feroz campana anti-Republica Popular Democratica de Corea movilizando los principales medios de prensa como KBS, MBC y Yonhap TV.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn relacion con ese tema, el jefe de la delegacion de la parte Norte de las conversaciones de trabajo militar Norte-Sur de Corea dio el dia 10 la siguiente respuesta a la ACNC:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn estos dias, se libra en todas partes de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea la marcha general para construir un Estado prospero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTambien en la provincia de Hwanghae del Sur, cercana a las 5 islas del Mar Oeste, se impulsa en etapa crucial un gran proyecto de construccion para el mejoramiento de los niveles de la vida del pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el curso de esta obra, se llevo a cabo el dia 10 un dinamitazo de trabajo rutinario.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, asustados por esa explosion, los belicistas del circulo militar titere del Sur de Corea tergiversan la situacion como si el EPC hubiera cometido la \"provocacion\" de fuego artillero y pretextandola, procedieron a la bochornosa accion de respuesta militar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs absurdo que en la actual era de ciencias en que funcionan sofisticados medios de deteccion e inteligencia, ellos hayan dado la voladura de trabajo por el canonazo y localizado el punto de impacto de proyectiles, que ni siquiera fueron tirados, como en las aguas maritimas perifericas de la \"linea de limite al Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, resulta tragicomico que ellos hayan respondido con canonazos sin averiguar siquiera la verdad de lo ocurrido esta vez en el Mar Oeste de Corea, zona muy delicada donde frecuentan choques entre ambas partes coreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara convertir ese incidente en la \"provocacion\" del EPC, el circulo militar surcoreano habla con bombo y platillo de su inmediato \"ataque de respuesta\" mintiendo que se escucho en el contorno de la isla Yonphyong del Mar Oeste la detonacion de tres proyectiles y uno de estos ha sobrepasado la \"linea de limite al Norte\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara dar credibilidad a su complot, los belicistas surcoreanos enviaron urgentemente los buques de combate de refuerzo al contorno de 5 islas del Mar Oeste, movilizaron los aviones de combate y decretaron el estado de alerta conjunta a las unidades en el frente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl mismo tiempo, hicieron regresar todos los barcos pesqueros del Sur de Corea y evacuaron a los habitantes al refugio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl EPC no puede pasar por alto ese complot barato anti-RPDC que orquestaron otra vez a plena luz del dia los belicistas militares surcoreanos falsificando como canonazo la voladura normal de trabajo que se hace en el curso de construccion pacifica. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste complot militar tiene su genesis en el vicio cronico de los conspiradores que insatisfechos con la invencion del incidente de hundimiento de la corbeta \"Cheonan\", el peor caso de la historia nacional utilizado para iniciar su campana en busca de enfrentamiento fratricida en general, degradaron la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana a la coyuntura de guerra, en que se intercambia el fuego, al provocar el incidente de fuego artillero en la isla Yonphyong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIgualmente, parte del siniestro intento de los belicistas del circulo militar surcoreano de romper el clima de dialogo, que se da ultimamente en la Peninsula Coreana y su contorno, y de llevar las relaciones intercoreanas a la fase de infarto caracterizada por los enfrentamientos y choques.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo mas grave del caso es el malsano proposito de ellos de volver a poner tirante la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana al desplegar a toda costa los ejercicios militares conjuntos \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\" de este ano, pese al mensaje abierto de la RPDC enviado a nombre de la Representacion del Ejercito Popular de Corea en Phanmunjom, en que ella exigio a EE.UU. y las autoridades surcoreanas la suspension de esa maniobra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEspecificamente, en el ambito interno, fomentan la atmosfera conflictiva con la RPDC inventando el \"incidente del grupo de espias\", el \"de violacion de la ley de seguridad\", el \"de atentados de asesinato\", etc. y por parte externa, pretenden procurar la justificacion de los mencionados ejercicios militares EE.UU.-Sur de Corea fabricando el incidente de canonazos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe esta manera, quieren buscar el pretexto de la guerra de agresion a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos que cayeron en crisis estan habituados a incurrir en los complots y falsificaciones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA traves del presente caso, quedo evidenciado una vez mas que las autoridades surcoreanas, en particular, los belicistas militares son grandes maestros en tejer complots e inventar, capaces de cualquier cosa para enfrentarse con la connacional RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos criminales seran condenados severamente por todos los coreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito y el pueblo de la RPDC seguiran marchando adelante hacia el mejoramiento de las relaciones intercoreanas, la paz y la reunificacion de la nacion frustrando con audacia los complots de toda indole de los elementos conflictivos anti-RPDC."
