            "content": "Wooden plough from ancient Korea\r\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 22 (KCNA) -- Amidst a swing of discoveries of remains, a wooden plough from Kojoson, the first ancient state in Korea, was unearthed in 1992 at Juui-ri, Yomju county, North Phyongan Province in northwestern Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The L-shaped farming implement of oak has a curved blade, a beam and a stilt slanting upward from the back end of the beam. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The blade, a thick staff with a front edge cut sharp slantwise, is similar to a modern-day ploughshare. Thinner on the left side than on the right, it enables the bored earth to be removed to the left. It is 31 cm long by 18 wide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The beam is the same sort of staff cut thinner than the blade in width, and between them there are three holes for attaching a spoon for removing the earth to one side. It is 35 cm in length and 7.5 cm in diametre. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The 73 cm-long stilt tapers upward and has on the top a hole for the handle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This delicately trimmed plough was a major help to contemporary farming. \r\n\r\n"

The second of its kind on the river, it was completed in a matter of one year and a half. In the middle of it one can view the blue and clear water of the river taedong and majestic-looking structures on either banks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Ansan bridge, completed on December 24 Juche 77 (1988), connects Phyongchon and Mangyongdae districts across the River Pothong, a tributary of the River Taedong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Rungna bridge, opened to traffic in September Juche 77 (1988), runs from the east bank of the River Taedong to the Kumnung tunnel crossing over Rungna Islet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It consists of the slim-figured main bridge supported by continuous girder structures and spiraled by flyovers, providing access to the May Day Stadium that looks like a mammoth parachute.\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA blasts senior Japanese official's outburst to chill atmosphere\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 22 (KCNA) -- Tokyo metropolitan governor Ishihara was reported to have let loose a spate of anti-DPRK outbursts again at a meeting on July 19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Referring to the great Hanshin earthquake, he hurled mud at the DPRK and fanned up hostility toward it, saying \"the shock was so great that he felt as if Japan had been hit by a missile from Hokusen\" meaning North Korea in derogatory term and \"Hokusen is an annoying entity\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK can never remain a passive onlooker to such provocative remarks openly made by the senior official of Japan to get on the nerves of its dialogue partner at a time when important official dialogues for opening diplomatic relations are high on agenda between the two countries . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    It is well-known to the world that Ishihara, speaking for the ultra-right reactionaries of Japan, has for long incited militarism and ultra-nationalism, creating furore in Japan and the international community. Then who was behind him each time he was free to reel off any hostile outbursts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis is a point at issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We have already warned the Japanese authorities and media that it was because of their tacit connivance and under their patronage that such guys as Ishihara, abusing their official posts, openly called for fascistizing Japan and converting it into a military power and incited national chauvinism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This notwithstanding, more deplorable things are happening in Japan. Such guys as Ishihara are getting more vociferous in their anti-DPRK diatribe and it is echoed even by Japanese authorities and media. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the Japanese authorities have true willingness to improve relations with the DPRK, they should roll back their hostile policy towards it and, first of all, take serious measures to stop the sinister actions to vitiate the atmosphere of dialogue. \r\n\r\n"

Japan is now desperately  involved in this program to realize its old dream of \"Greater East Asia Coprosperity Sphere.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is one reason why Japan is making much ado about \"missile threat from North Korea.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Another aim of Japan is to justify its shameless moves to evade the settlement of its past by tarnishing the DPRK image in the international community through this row over \"threat from North Korea.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The world should be vigilant against Japan. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
