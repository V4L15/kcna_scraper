            "content": "Inter-Korean General-Level Military Talks Open \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 17 (KCNA) - The fourth north-south general-level military talks opened in the portion of the south side at Panmunjom Tuesday.\r\n Attending the talks was the delegation of the north side headed by Lieut. General of the Korean People's Army Kim Yong Chol.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the talks both sides continued the discussion on the agenda item of the previous talks \"On military measures for preventing clashes in the waters of the West Sea of Korea and realizing joint fishing there.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The head of the north side's delegation and the chief delegate of the south side spoke at the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The head of the north side's delegation underscored the need for the two sides to deepen the discussion on the agenda item and reach an agreement that would meet the expectations and wishes of the nation. Then he referred to the differences manifested in the stands of the two sides at the last talks and in the subsequent period. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He emphasized the following points as ways of reaching a satisfactory agreement on a series of issues related to the agenda item: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Both sides should take, among other things, the firm stand and approach to play a main role in finding an earliest possible solution to the issue of the waters in the West Sea and strictly abide by the principle of promoting the common prosperity and interests of the nation, the principle of respecting each other's  territorial rights and the principle of defining a new military demarcation line in the waters to meet the legal and institutional requirements recognized at home and abroad on the basis of boldly discarding all their assertions that may trigger off clashes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He set forth the following proposals on removing the very cause of military clashes in the waters of the West Sea of Korea and realizing joint fishing there: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Both sides should boldly discard all the divergent assertions about boundaries in the waters they have so far maintained, the very cause of military clashes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to reach an earliest possible agreement on non-aggression, both sides should fix the Military Demarcation Line in the waters of the West Sea as required by the Armistice Agreement and the publicly recognized international law and take various measures for building military confidence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The new MDL in the waters of the West Sea should be fixed on the principle of strictly respecting each other's right of territory and territorial waters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Accordingly, the north side should recognize the sovereignty of the south side over five islets in the West Sea and the issue of controlling the waters off islets around them should be defined under a reasonable agreement of both sides. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The MDL in the waters where both sides are standing in confrontation with each other closely should be fixed on the principle of halving them and the MDL in other waters on the principle of respecting each other's right of territorial waters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should have a working-level contact for fixing the MDL in the waters of the West Sea, depending upon agreeing to these principled matters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint fishing in the waters of the West Sea should be realized on the principle of strictly promoting the common prosperity and interests of both sides. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Waters for joint fishing should be fixed in the direction of realizing the wishes of fishermen of the north and the south to conduct free fishing operations, while protecting precious aquatic resources of the nation in vast waters of the West Sea fraught with the danger of clashes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Waters for joint fishing should be fixed on the premise that the new MDL is defined in the waters of the West Sea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even after the sea MDL is drawn, waters for joint fishing may be fixed in the waters under the control of the north side or in the waters under the control of the south side when both sides deem them favorable for joint fishing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In case the waters for joint fishing are fixed, both sides should opt for giving a military guarantee for joint fishing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When both sides agree to the above-said points, they should decide on the specific waters for joint fishing at a working-level contact for fixing the sea MDL and take measures for joint fishing including the method of joint fishing at a working-level contact of relevant specialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The head of the north side's delegation went on to say: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to find an early solution to the agenda item it is necessary for the two sides to focus their attention and efforts on settling their differences and to this end it is necessary to be bold enough to discard the wrong assertions that do not hold water. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is essential to give top priority to removing the very cause of clashes in the above-said controversial waters and opt for totally halting all the war exercises to be staged with the U.S. quite contrary to the atmosphere of dialogue, from the stand of defusing the tension. If the south side finds it quite hard to do so, it should take a measure of halting them for the time being while a series of dialogues are under way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the south side is interested in putting an end to clashes and wiping out distrust and sincerely stands for confidence building, it should not hesitate to opt for removing the very cause of them but take such practical measures as ensuring the direct sailing of the north side's civilian ships to Haeju Port and their safe passage through the Jeju Straits as early as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The talks go on.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Japan's moves to stage a comeback to Korea should never be allowed. The Korean people regard the Japanese militarists' moves to grab the islet as a dangerous military provocation to launch reinvasion of Korea and are strongly reacting to it. If the Japanese militarists persist in exacerbating the tension, insisting on the claim to the islet, it will entail unpredictable consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is taking a hypocritical attitude toward the issue of the past crime-woven history and apology as it is pursuing a sinister aim to repeat its past crimes. Its claim to the islet and moves to seize it are prompted by the above-said purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Sovereignty is what keeps a country and a nation alive. To shatter the Japanese militarists' moves to grab the islet is an important matter of keeping the Japanese invaders from staging a comeback to the inviolable land of Korea and defending the sovereignty of the nation. The Korean people remain vigilant against the reckless moves of the Japanese militarists to grab the islet, part of the inviolable territory of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese right-wing conservatives should discard their hypocritical attitude toward the issue of the past crime-woven history and apology and their ambition to seize the territory.    \r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Blasts Japan's Hectic Diplomacy over \"Issue of Abduction\" \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 17 (KCNA) -- Senior politicians and diplomats of Japan are busy with diplomacy at home and abroad aimed at eliciting \"international cooperation\" over the \"issue of abduction.\"\r\n They never miss the chance to raise this issue no matter what foreign VIPs they meet at home and at any international forum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This hectic diplomacy of Japan prompts everyone to think that the \"issue of abduction\" has become a topic of its politics and diplomacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In a word, Japan is using the issue as a justification and lever for playing the role of a shock force in putting into practice the U.S. plot against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Both the U.S. and Japan are colluding with each other in the smear campaign over the issue as they share interests in pursuing a hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries consider their racket over \"the issue of abduction\" favorable for pleasing their American master because they hype up this matter and work hard to build up public opinion, keeping pace with Washington's \"human rights\" row. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. Secretary of State Rice, referring to the meeting of President Bush with families of \"Japanese abductees\" on April 28, said the meeting is an indication of the U.S. commitment to settle the \"abduction issue\" and \"human rights issue\" and assured Japan that the U.S. would continue paying attention to the matter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Addressing a press conference held in its wake, she asserted that no friends are better than Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a matter of fact, no country is as sincere in helping the U.S. as Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ultra-right conservative forces of Japan are seeking various aims in the \"issue of abduction.\" The most important of them is to play a role in executing the U.S. policy to stifle the DPRK in a bid to please the Uncle Sam. Precisely for this reason no sooner had Washington cried out for \"sanctions\" than Tokyo echoed it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Japan's base behavior to solicit cheap sympathy with its racket over the issue, which had already found a solution, from other allies of the U.S., pursuant to its hostile policy towards the DPRK, once again helps the international community understand the political reality in Japan, a political dwarf. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Japan is ill-famed for its evil doings as it has not yet apologized for so many crimes though more than half a century has passed since its defeat. It is quite natural that Japan is censured by the international community for its ugly image and unlimited ambitions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's oft-repeated hue and cry over the \"issue of abduction\" reminds one of a prostitute who claims to be chaste.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Yankees go home!\" are ringing out from all parts of south Korea and mass protests demanding the punishment of U.S. criminals, withdrawal of the U.S. military bases and pullback of the U.S. forces are going on everyday in south Korea, which is now an area of stormy anti-U.S. struggle, not a tranquil zone for the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A man passing himself off as the special envoy for the north Korean human rights issue should have known this much before wagging his tongue. However, he pointed his accusing finger at south Korea, behaving like the governor-general in a colony. It is only too natural that he was put to shame by a strong protest of the south Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The shame he suffered was not a mere shame. It meant the bankruptcy of the U.S. Korea policy. The harder the Bush bellicose group tries to bar the improvement of the inter-Korean relations, while keeping south Korea under its military occupation,  openly poking its nose into the internal affairs of south Korea, and antagonizing the DPRK, the greater will be the disgrace brought to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration should make a fundamental switchover in its anachronistic Korea policy, withdraw the U.S. forces from south Korea and refrain from interfering in the affairs between the north and the south, if it does not want to face such shame again.    \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The name was derived from a legend that a lark recovered its broken leg in the spa. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Jongdal Spa is recorded in the book \"Korean Geography\" published in 1481.
