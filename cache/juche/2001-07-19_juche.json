Contending that sea provides several times larger space for strike than the ground given the natural and topographical features of the Korean peninsula and their naval strike power is \"superior\" to that of the DPRK, the U.S. and Japan seek to mount a surprise attack on the DPRK by a large-scale naval assault to seize its front and rear in a short time.  Their maneuver under the simulated conditions of an operation to rapidly sweep mines in the territorial waters of the DPRK is designed to achieve that aim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ongoing joint maneuver is, in fact, to carry out their war scenario. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In other words, they aim to start the second Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With nothing can the U.S. and the Japanese reactionaries cover up the criminal and dangerous nature of the exercise. \r\n   \r\n"

One day he visited an engineering work site to hear soldiers' comment on the shoes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He told them not to simply say that the shoes were good but point to their defects to help produce better ones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was pleased to hear their opinions and assured them that the shoes liked by them would be produced. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Early in July Juche 39 (1950) the president assigned officials in the field of education a task to recover the true records of the ri dynasty (government diary of the feudal state of the ri dynasty that existed for 519 years). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n he instructed them to recover the precious national treasure at any cost. A course to recover the books was drawn on the operational map of the supreme headquarters and orders were issued to institutions concerned and units of the Korean people's army to carry out the operation. This was how the true records of the ri dynasty were recovered amid the turbulences of the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is another anecdote telling about the greatness of the president. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One day in the Autumn of Juche 53 (1964) the president received an overseas Korean businessman. The businessman told the president that he was wrong when he intended to build a factory in South Korea, adding that he would like to build it in the north.    But the president noted with smile that there was no need to do so and it would not be bad but good for the Korean people if even one more factory was built in south Korea. And he said that the construction of the factory in South Korea would be helpful to the future development of the country. Deeply moved by his noble compatriotism and broad-mindedness, the businessman lauded the president as a god of Korea who takes care of all the people.    \r\n\r\n"
