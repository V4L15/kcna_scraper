Recently a list of at least 420,000 victims, part of those Koreans who were forcibly drafted to Japan during the Japanese imperialists' military occupation of Korea, was opened to the public, making it impossible for Japan to evade its responsibility for apologizing and compensating them and their bereaved families. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, Japan is persistently faulting the DPRK, the victim, raising unrealistic and unreasonable issues including the \"abduction issue\" that has already been settled like a thief crying \"Stop the thief!,\" far from compensating for its past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis is only doubling and trebling the crimes committed by Japan against the Korean and other Asian people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"Yasukuni Shrine\" is a symbol of the Japanese imperialists' bloody history of aggression and, therefore, has become a target of the resentment, wrath and curse of the Asian people. Yet the ruling quarters of Japan are justifying their visits to the shrine and considering it as a due \"obligation\" and \"duty\" of Japanese politicians to visit it. It is impossible for such guys to show any interest in redressing Japan's past. This reveals the impudence and moral vulgarity peculiar to Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such shameless attitude of Japan not to settle its past crimes is nothing but a revelation of its design to reinvade Korea. This hardens the Korean people's will to settle accounts with Japan to the last.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
