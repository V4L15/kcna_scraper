Korean businessman entertained\r\n  Pyongyang, June 17 (KCNA) -- The Korean Asia-Pacific Peace Committee (KAPPC) gave a reception at the Mokran House on Tuesday for Jong Ju Yong, honorary chairman of the South Korean \"Hyundai Business Group,\" and his companions.\r\n   Present at the reception were chairman of the KAPPC Kim Yong Sun, chairman of the External Economic Affairs Commission Ri Song Dae, chairman of the National Economic Cooperation Federation Jong Un Op and other officials.\r\n   Song Ho Gyong, vice-chairman of the KAPPC, in his speech warmly welcomed the visitors with compatriotic feelings,  saying Jong Ju Yong arrived here with his kinsmen, crossing the wall of division, out of love for his hometown and desire to make a contribution to the prosperity of the homeland.\r\n   Song said it is the greatest, pressing task of the Korean nation to put an end to the tragedy of territorial split and national division and achieve the unity of the nation and the reunification of the country.\r\n   \"In the period of the anti-Japanese war President Kim Il Sung provided a great tradition of the unity of the entire nation,\" Song said. \"When the country was divided, he called on all the people to turn out in the building of a new country under the banner of great national unity, those with strength giving strength, those with knowledge dedicating knowledge and those with money donating money, and devoted his whole life to the prosperity of the country and national reunification.\"\r\n   Song noted that in his historic works General Kim Jong Il clarified policies of national reunification and laid down a five-point policy of great national unity.\r\n   Song expressed the belief that Jong Ju Yong's current visit will be a model of non-governmental exchange as part of solidarity and collaboration for the country's reunification.\r\n   In his speech Jong Ju Yong said his heart was filled with emotion over his visiting the north again. He voiced the belief that Panmunjom would turn back into a peaceful zone as it was in the past so that compatriots in the north and the south may visit each other freely through it and take a good rest there.\r\n   It is high time that the era of north-south confrontation was terminated, he said. Reconciliation and cooperation are badly needed for the sake of each other's interests.\r\n   He sincerely hoped that his visit will be a foundation for inter-Korean reconciliation and unity, not merely an individual's hometown visit.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n"

It has a long history and has been used as an important rhythmic instrument for concert or ensemble. It has a great artistic beauty. It is double-headed and you feel like playing it. \r\n   The left hand striking head and the right stick-striking head are cord-tensioned with the wasp coupler at the centre. \r\n   The stick-striking head is a little smaller than the hand-striking head and its skin is thin and it produces high sound. The hand-striking head produces soft low sound but the stick-striking head produces higher, elastic sound.\r\n   Janggo produces the effects of two drums in one, makes the character and representation of music pieces more distinct and greatly helps play a variety of rhythms of national music.\r\n   Hand and stick striking heads have different playing methods and have their own playing methods.\r\n   There are also drums, which are rather small and are used as solo instruments, player in a standing position. Strings are tied to the heads and rings and drums are shouldered and played in some rhythms.\r\n   The playing methods of Janggo are used in artistic combination with the playing of all musical tunes.\r\n   This drum is widely used as an important rhythmic instrument of national music in close combination with Korean people's optimistic life.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
