            "content": "Foreign Ministry spokesman on DPRK-U.S. talks\r\nPyongyang, August 13 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry was interviewed by KCNA today as regards high-level talks to be held between the DPRK and the United States.\r\n   The spokesman said:\r\n   DPRK-U.S. high-level talks will be held in New York in mid-August.\r\n   With the date of the talks yet to be decided, however, there have been rumours that the talks are \"part of negotiations\" between nations concerned in the \"four-way talks.\"\r\n   The forthcoming talks have a different meaning from high-level talks the DPRK and the United States agreed to regularize.\r\n   As was already reported, the DPRK suspended the storage of spent fuel rods at the final stage in April because of a serious imbalance between the DPRK and the United States in the implementation of the bilateral framework agreement. It decided to wait until the United States takes an appropriate step concerning the implementation of the agreement.\r\n   In fact, all our nuclear activities have been frozen and the safekeeping of spent fuel rods has reached a final stage in accordance with the DPRK-U.S. framework agreement. But the U.S. side has not taken substantial steps for lifting sanctions as part of efforts to renounce the hostile policy towards the DPRK. Though nearly one year has passed since the groundbreaking ceremony of light water reactors, the project has not begun on a fullscale. The insufficient supply of heavy oil has plunged our economy into a great confusion.\r\n   Now that the two sides are obliged to perform their duties simultaneously under the DPRK-U.S. framework agreement, w could not continue unilateral performance of our duty.\r\n   Accordingly, we could not but stop the safekeeping of spent fuel rods.\r\n   Later, the U.S. side worked to some extent for the supply of light water reactors and heavy oil and proposed to have DPRK-U.S. high-level talks and  discuss problems arising in the implementation of the framework agreement. We, therefore, decided to respond to the proposal.\r\n   We will sincerely appproach the talks with a constructive stand and make every possible effort to keep the framework agreement in effect. \r\n   We will decide our future action according to the results of the talks.\r\n   As far as the \"four-way talks\" are concerned, we have declared more than once that our consistent position is to make every effort for peace and security on the Korean peninsula.\r\n   It was due to different views between the DPRK and the U.S. That the second round of \"four-way talks\" in march came to a standstill. Removal of different views between the two countries is urgently essential for resumption of the \"four-way talks.\" in this regard, a third party has nothing to do.\r\n   As long as the main problems between the two countries remain unsolved, no big progress can be expected from the \"four-way talks\" even if the talks are resumed.\r\n   We hope the two sides will settle the problems smoothly at the upcoming DPRK-U.S. high-level talks lest we should have to make an undesirable option.    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n"
