The U.S. has already lost any right to say this and that about religious freedom.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is the most superior socialist state that legally guarantees the freedom of religions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To us who have accomplished the great historic cause of perfecting the national nuclear forces with confidence in the final victory in the showdown with imperialism and the U.S., the stereotyped talk of \"religious freedom\" by the U.S. is nothing more than a scream of a loser."
