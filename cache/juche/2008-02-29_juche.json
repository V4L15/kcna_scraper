It is the ulterior motive of Japan to intensify its moves for military invasion of Korea by grabbing the islet. Japan's wild ambition for aggression remains unchanged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's move to seize the islet is a prelude to staging a comeback to Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is, however, sadly mistaken.
