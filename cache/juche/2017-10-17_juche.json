And the revolutionaries of the rising generation trained by the DIU became the backbone for founding the party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The WPK has won victories as it has consistently adhered to the ideology of the DIU in each period and at each stage of the developing revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the lines and policies advanced by the WPK after the liberation of Korea from the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule (August 15, 1945) have been carried out, displaying their tremendous vitality. Among them are the policy on agrarian reform, the policy of agricultural cooperativization, the basic line of socialist economic construction and the line of simultaneously developing the economic construction and defence capabilities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Despite many-fold difficulties and trials in the closing years of the last century, the WPK gave full play to its ever-victorious might under the guidance of leader Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As it is holding respected Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un in high esteem, the WPK is strengthening into the great party adhering to the line of Songun (military-first) revolution and the powerful and militant party with strong sense of unity and rich experience, true to the ideas and intentions of the preceding leaders."
