Though the north and the south have the differing ideologies and systems, nothing is dearer to the Koreans responsible for reunification than ardent patriotism that should be placed above any ideology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when all the thinking and activities are based on patriotism is it possible for the north and the south to unite as one and the same nation and carve out the destiny of the nation independently. \r\n\r\n"

It is possible to provide a sure military guarantee for the implementation of the joint Declaration only when these principles are observed, he added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Serving a strong warning to the south side upon the authorization, he recalled that the \"Ministry of National Defence\" of the south side in the \"white paper on national defence for 2000\" on December 4 defined the north, the other party to the dialogue, as the \"principal enemy\" and Declared it at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the joint declaration signed by the heads of the north and the south both sides agreed to independently settle the issue of national reunification by the concerted efforts of the nation and shared the view at the first round of the north-south defence ministers' talks, too, that the fellow countrymen should never fight each other. Nevertheless, the south side defined the north as the \"principal enemy.\" This is an undisguised perfidy to and an unpardonable challenge to the inter-Korean agreements already Declared at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He strongly protested and denounced such hostile policy of the south side, branding it as a declaration of all-out confrontation between the armies of both sides and a grave criminal move to preserve the conception of confrontation in the Cold War era and thus chill the fellow countrymen's desire for reunification and bring the inter-Korean relations back to those in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This act of inciting confrontation compels the north side to doubt whether it is possible to agree upon and implement such important matters as removing the military demarcation line and opening the demilitarized zone, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In conclusion he strongly demanded that the south side withdraw the anti-national conception of \"principal enemy\" as soon as possible if it is truly willing to sincerely \r\nImplement the joint declaration. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
