This is one instance of its old game taking issue with the north as a stopgap measure to get out of the crisis whenever it finds itself at the end of its rope. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is most detestable is that the GNP connected its motion with the north in a far-fetched manner. But this is as foolish an act as lifting the axe to cut one's own foot.\r\n The GNP is resorting to every conceivable trick to save its destiny from the crisis of dissolution, but it does not work with anybody. Suffice it to recall that even the Democratic Party, which had been cooperating with the GNP, is turning its back on the\r\nmotion, saying it feels no need to call \"an extraordinary, National Assembly session\", and different social circles of south Korea are lifting louder voices demanding the demolition of the GNP, a corrupt party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people should never give a favorable chance to the GNP, a group of corrupt traitors pursuing the idea of confrontation and division, in the \"National Assembly election,\" but pass a stern judgement on it in the name of the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It, therefore, does not allow the U.S. to interfere in it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. interference in the internal affairs of the Korean nation is a wanton violation of the international convention and international law calling for respecting the sovereignty of each country. This is another form of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is that the U.S. obstructions were prompted by a plot to bring a disaster of a nuclear war to the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts go to prove that the U.S. pressure on the south Korean authorities to adjust the process of improving the inter-Korean relations is meant to make pre-arrangements to start military actions to invade the DPRK and the Bush bellicose forces are close tolaunching a new war on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans who are concerned about the destiny of the country and the nation should clearly see through the grave consequences to be entailed by the U.S. arrogant moves for intervention and aggression over the nuclear issue and resolutely meet its outrageous challenge through nationwide resistance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation has the invincible Songun policy and a will to enjoy an independent and dignified life. All the Koreans should give full play to the self-confidence of the nation to carve out their life and the future of the nation with their own efforts,resolutely foil the U.S. moves for a war of aggression against the reunification of Korea and honorably defend the peace of the country and the security of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Arms in the era of Songun know no mercy. If the Bush group, being overconfident of its strength, dares to mount a preemptive attack on the DPRK, looking down upon the DPRK, it will suffer a miserable ruin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people in the northern half of Korea will in the future, too, never tolerate the anti-peace, anti-reunification moves of the U.S. but accelerate the onward march for independent reunification together with all other fellow countrymen under the uplifted\r\nbanner of Songun.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Blasts Japan's Claim to Tok Islet\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 16 (KCNA) -- Recently Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi openly asserted that Tok Islet is part of \"Japan's territory\", while Taro Aso, minister of Public Management, Home Affairs, Post and Telecommunications, made provocative remarks at a ministerial meeting that Japan would \"publish a stamp carrying Tok Islet\", according to a news report.\r\n It is not the first time that the ruling quarters of Japan let loose such outbursts. In 1977, the then Prime Minister Fukuta made a territorial claim to Tok Islet at a meeting of the House of Councillors and the then Prime Minister Mori made the same claim at apress conference in 2000. Their outcries triggered off public furor and were bitterly denounced by the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Koizumi made the same brigandish assertion instead of drawing a lesson from this. This clearly shows how far the Japanese reactionaries have gone in their wild ambition for territorial expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This, at the same time, clearly indicates that the Japanese reactionaries are steeped in hostility towards Korea and consciousness of confrontation to the marrow of their bones and their aggressive nature still remains unchanged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the last century, Japan carried out unprecedented wars of aggression and plunder to realize its wild ambition for territorial expansion, bringing horrible disasters to humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n History still accuses Japan of its crime-ridden past when it ignited the Russo-Japanese war, invaded Manchuria and provoked the Sino-Japanese war and the Pacific war to massacre innocent people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan, however, has reappeared on the international arena as a chieftain of aggression with dangerous political and military potentials in a bid to realize its old dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\" it failed to do in the last century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This can not but touch off the anti-Japanese sentiment of the Korean and other Asian people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Emphatically speaking, Tok Islet is part of the inviolable territory of Korea from the historical and geographical point of view and in the light of international law. This is an undeniable hard fact. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the Japanese reactionaries have falsified the historical truth, painting Tok Islet as one belonging to Japan for scores of years. They have long looted a large quantity of marine resources there and used it for a military purpose of invading thecontinent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Koizumi visited the \"Yasukuni Shrine\" on the New Year's Day, openly revealing Japan's attempt to restore militarism and made a territorial claim to Tok Islet. This was a revelation of Japan's black-hearted design to actively step up its moves for the reinvasion of Korea and the rest of Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Reinvasion means destruction and it will lead Japan to a miserable ruin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people and the army of the DPRK will heighten their revolutionary vigilance and foil every move of the Japanese reactionaries for reinvasion with the might of Songun.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It also brought more than 10,000 pieces of equipment including latest-type tanksand armoured cars to south Korea and stockpiled some 700,000 tons of ammunition as of 1997. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States already deployed some 1,000 pieces of nuclear weaponry in south Korea, turning a half of the peninsula into the world's largest arsenal and an advanced base for a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Yong Chun, chief of the General Staff of the Korean People's Army, told KCNA that all the Korean servicemen were keeping a close eye on the U.S. arms buildup in south Korea, while fully preparing themselves to cope with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the unswerving position of the Korean army and people to answer the enemy's rifle with gun and meet the enemy's hardline policy with tougher measures, he added.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
