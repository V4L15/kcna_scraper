They abandoned their plan for lone-wolf invasion and sought an \"ally\" for carrying it out. Japan was fit for this alliance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"Taft-Katsura Treaty\" fabricated by the U.S. and Japan in 1905 was no more than a product of criminal conspiracy between brazen-faced gangsters. The U.S. imperialists who helped the Japanese imperialists cook up the \"Ulsa (1905) Five-point Treaty\" turned their faces away from the resistance of the Korean people against the treaty but zealously patronized the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule over Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was none other than the U.S. which withdrew its legation from Korea before any other countries, claiming that the diplomatic right of Korea was transferred to Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean War in the 1950s was a scenario worked out by the U.S. in the early period of its occupation of south Korea to turn the Korean Peninsula into a bridgehead for invading the continent. Japan, which was revived and rearmed with the strong backing of the U.S. after the Second World War, regarded the war as a golden opportunity and actively participated in it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. singled out the Asia-Pacific region as the pivot of its military strategy, noisily talking about \"Pacific state\" and \"guarantee of security.\" It expects its satellite countries, Japan, in particular, to play a pivotal role in carrying out its strategy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese militarists are keen to realize their long-pursued wild ambition for reinvasion at any cost, zealously pursuant to the U.S. policy of aggression. Japan is now working hard to modify its \"defense programme guidelines\" in line with the new defense strategy of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Due to the U.S. policy of aggression and war and Japan's policy toeing it, the Korean Peninsula has been pushed to the brink of a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The aggressors should bear in mind this land is no longer the distress-torn land in the past when it was subject to the saber-rattling of big powers."
