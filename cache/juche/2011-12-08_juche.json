Korea\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPyongyang, December 8 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA on Thursday as regards the fact that traitor Lee Myung Bak of south Korea praised those human derelicts who dared to insult the dignity of the DPRK supreme leadership:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTraitor Lee recently sent a \"letter of encouragement\" to the human scum, who wrought a nonsensical novel viciously slandering the dignity of the DPRK supreme leadership, and revealed his true colors as a confrontation element once again only to touch off the anger of all people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the letter Lee expressed \"thanks\" for the novel, making disgusting remarks that it, a compilation of fabrications, fiction and daydream, informs people of the north's reality and implants the will for \"unification\" in their mind. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNobody showed interest in the absurd talk by such lunatic, but only the chief executive of south Korea hailed the writer with \"encouragement\". This clearly shows where he is. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs nominal \"president\", he should have minded his honor, though he is narrow-minded and driven into a tight corner by attacks at home and abroad and chaos in south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWithout feeling disgrace, the traitor could not but depend on such human derelicts cold-treated and forsaken even in south Korean society. It shows well his meanness and poor situation \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat should not be overlooked is the reckless behavior of the traitor who would unhesitatingly slander the DPRK over anything whether it is fabrication or fiction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe reality goes to prove he is the very one that incites confrontation with fellow countrymen. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHow can the north-south relations improve and how can the Koreans achieve national reconciliation and unity when the south Korean chief executive is obsessed with conception of confrontation and is always scheming to hurt fellow countrymen?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe recent behavior of the traitor convinced us once again that there was and would be no change in his real intention to go for confrontation to the last in disregard of the trend of the times and the public sentiment. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe people of the DPRK will never pardon anyone who hurts the inviolable dignity of the DPRK supreme leadership even a bit."
