            "content": "Japan's Criminal Participation in Last Korean War under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 26 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article lays bare Japan's zealous participation in the last Korean war.\r\n The article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No sooner had the U.S. imperialists started a war of aggression against the young DPRK than Shigeru Yoshida, the then boss of the Japanese militarists, convened the socalled cabinet meeting which adopted it as its government policy to actively cooperate with the U.S. forces in their military actions in Korea. Pursuant to this policy, Japan directly dispatched its forces to the Korean front in a concealed manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As soon as former officers of the imperial Japanese army arrived in Korea, they acted \"advisers\" and \"military experts\" as staff members at units of various services and arms of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces. They, at the same time, played the role of scouts after joining reconnoitering and search teams or while taking a direct part in offensive operations from the forefront. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarists sent former airmen of the imperial Japanese army including Kamikaze pilots to the Korean front to assist the U.S. forces in airlifting operations. A hundred percent of the mine sweepers and mine sweeping forces of Japan were dispatched to the front in top secrecy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They took an active part in the U.S. imperialists' germ warfare. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Air force bases in the Japanese archipelago from Hokkaido to Kyushu and naval ports including those in Yokosuka, Sasebo, Kure and Maizuru and various trading ports in Yokohama, Kobe and other areas turned into ports for a military purpose so as to enable the U.S. imperialists to use them in the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan produced most of the war supplies including weaponry, combat and technical equipment and ammunition and provided them to the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces. During the war Japan manufactured or repaired various kinds of military materiel on their \"special orders\" worth more than 2.5 billion U.S. dollars. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan can never conceal or justify its criminal participation in the last Korean war because this doubled the crimes it committed against the Koreans by invading their country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its aggressive nature still remains unchanged. The Japanese militarists seized by their wild ambition for overseas aggression are whetting their swords to stage a comeback to Korea, zealously pursuant to the U.S. imperialists' policy of aggression against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Should the Japanese militarist forces, the sworn enemy of the Korean people, embark upon the re-invasion of Korea, the servicepersons and people of the DPRK will surely force them to pay for the blood shed by them for a century.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

However, the threat of the foreign forces to stifle the DPRK by force of arms is reaching a dangerous stage as the days go by and, owing to this, inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation and the movement for independent reunification have undergone difficulties and all the Koreans are exposed to the danger of sustaining an irretrievable disaster of a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the danger of a new war is impending over the Korean Peninsula, it is high time for the Koreans to wage a nation-wide struggle to prevent the war of aggression and defend national dignity and peace of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should arm ourselves more firmly with the Songun idea of the Workers' Party of Korea and uphold the Songun politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun politics is a treasured sword of sure victory for preventing aggression and defending national dignity and sovereignty and a shield of patriotism for firmly guaranteeing the peace of the country and the security of the whole nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the fellow countrymen should support, defend and uphold the Songun politics in one mind of patriotism, bearing the absolute conviction that national dignity and the peace and reunification of the country are guaranteed by Songun, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an important task for the Korean nation to wage a vigorous nationwide anti-aggression and anti-war struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans should flare up the flame of the just anti-aggression and anti-war struggle with their transparent consciousness of independence against the foreign forces and their will for peace against war. They should resolutely reject the arms buildup moves and war drills against the north of those forces who do not want the peace and reunification of Korea but pursue a war. They should wage a vigorous nation-wide struggle to force the U. S. troops out of south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should conduct a vigorous struggle to implement the historic June 15 joint declaration and achieve national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans should hold higher the idea of \"By our nation itself\" despite difficulties and trials and actively apply it to defending peace against the outside forces and to striving for independent reunification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The last Korean war was a war of aggression carefully prepared by them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They instigated the south Korean forces to conduct armed provocations in areas north of the 38th parallel since 1947 in order to examine their war posture and bolster their capacity to fight an actual war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. dispatched presidential special envoy Dulles, Defence Secretary Johnson and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Bradley and others to south Korea and Tokyo under the signboard of discussing issues related to \"peace treaty\" with a view to examining the war preparations on the spot and taking necessary measures. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. set June 25 as the day to start the war from the calculation that, it being Sunday,  no one would believe the U.S. and south Korea would launch the war on Sunday because Christians in both countries did not work on the Sabbath. This was aimed to cover up their true colors as a provoker of the war. Based on the detailed operation plan worked out in advance and meticulous military preparations for the war, the U.S. imperialists started attacks against the DPRK on the whole front all of a sudden at the dawn of June 25, 1950. At the same time, the U.S. ordered its air force to carry out large-scale air raids on the front and all areas of the northern half of Korea.\r\n The Korean war was a war of barbarous genocide aimed to exterminate the Korean nation and wreck peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. crimes against peace and humanity will be cursed and censured by history and human conscience generation after generation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
