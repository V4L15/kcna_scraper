Korean ruler's \"carrot and stick\" strategy \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 28 (KCNA) -- The \"carrot and stick\" strategy is the core of the South Korean authorities' policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The present South Korean chief executive, in an appearance on a special CNN program at the outset of the month, asserted that \"both carrot and stick should be used, that is to say if the north keeps its promise, the south will give corresponding aid to it, if not, the latter will make the former pay a bitter price.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  His \"carrot and stick\" strategy is just like both sides of a coin. It is, in essence, nothing but a reactionary and criminal stratagem to serve a sinister politico-military purpose to destabilize the north and destroy it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His \"carrot\" strategy is aimed to lead the north to \"reform and opening\" in a bid to achieve the above-said aim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean warmongers do not bother to threaten that if the \"carrot\" strategy does not work on the north, they will use  a \"stick to make it pay a bitter price.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But, flourishing a \"stick\" is as foolish an act as lifting an axe only to drop it on one's own foot. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As seen above, the \"carrot and stick\" strategy means a strategy of confrontation with the north intended to bar national reconciliation and unity and a treacherous and criminal move to bring all sorts of misfortunes and sufferings to the compatriots. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This strategy is an offspring of the \"engagement policy\" or the \"sunshine policy.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities borrowed the \"engagement policy\" from the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean chief executive, in his \"special lecture\" given on June 30, 1998, said that the United States had escalated its engagement with the soviet union for 19 years, maintaining an unshakable security posture, which resulted  in leading the Soviet empire to collapse without a single gunshot and bringing democracy  to eastern Europe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAnd he did not conceal the fact that the \"sunshine policy\" was a copy of such policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S., on the basis of its experience in leading the former soviet union to breakdown, has followed the \"carrot and stick\"  policy toward the DPRK in recent years in a bid to bring the same tragedy to the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As the South Korean authorities are apt to parrot what their American master says, they exactly copied the U.S. \"carrot and stick\" strategy to make it the core of the policy of confrontation with the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   For its reactionary nature, the U.S. dictated \"carrot and stick\" strategy is bound to go awry and to be thrown into the dustbin of history. \r\n\r\n"
