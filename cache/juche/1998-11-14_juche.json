It, therefore, cannot be allowed at all.\r\n   The recent adoption of a \"resolution\" against the DPRK is, in the final analysis, a foolish act of impure elements ignorant of the essence of the \"nuclear issue\" of the Korean peninsula.\r\n   The \"nuclear issue\" should be settled through negotiations between the DPRK and the U.S., not at the UN. \r\nThe adoption of the \"resolution\" which is not helpful to the settlement of the issue at all is a product of the unreasonable anti-DPRK campaign of the U.S. and impure elements of the IAEA. It only resulted in endangering the fate of the framework agreement between the DPRK and the U.S. and doing harm to the dignity of the UN General Assembly.\r\n   As already known to the world, the U.S. has introduced nuclear arms into South Korea, invented \"nuclear suspicion\" against the DPRK and tried to use the fiction for isolating and stifling the DPRK. Worse still, impure elements of the IAEA, instigated by the U.S. poked their nose into the \"nuclear issue,\" internationalising the issue.\r\n   The DPRK-U.S. framework agreement adopted in October 1994 eloquently proved that the \"nuclear issue\" is a political and military problem that should be solved between the DPRK and the U.S. it also made it clear that the U.S. and impure elements of the IAEA are to blame for the special status of the DPRK in the implementation of the \"nuclear safeguards accord.\"\r\n   The strict implementation of the framework agreement is basic to the settlement of the \"nuclear issue.\" \r\nThe implementation of the framework agreement, therefore, should not be an unilateral obligation.\r\n   The U.S. has so far discharged none of its obligations under the framework agreement.\r\n   It is obvious to anyone that without the U.S.implementation of the framework agreement, there cannot be the DPRK's unilateral full implementation of the safeguards accord.   \r\n   If one truly wants to see the settlement of the \"nuclear issue\" and the complete implementation of the safeguards accord, he should not put pressure on the DPRK, but urge the U.S. responsible for the \"nuclear issue\" to implement the framework agreement.\r\n   Turning his back on this will result in playing into the hands of the U.S. and impure elements of the IAEA. Such an act cannot be construed otherwise than a foul and unreasonable act of towing the line of big countries.\r\n   Attempts of  the U.S. and impure elements of the IAEA who want to  continue using the UN as a lever of putting pressure on the DPRK, ignoring its sovereignty, will make the DPRK take a necessary countermeasure.\r\n   They should be aware of this. \r\n\r\n \r\n"

These are unprecedented things.\r\n   The U.S.-Japan joint exercise which was held from Nov. 2 was participated in by almost all U.S. units that had taken part in the \"'98 Foal Eagle\" joint military exercise. And F-16 fighter planes, AWACS planes, air refueling tankers flew to Japan from South Korea for the U.S.-Japan joint exercise.\r\n   It is all the more serious that warships of the Japanese marine \"self-defence force\" staged a joint military drill with warships of the South Korean Army in seas off Pusan on October 16.\r\n   These facts prove that the U.S. and Japanese authorities are trying to finally examine and round off the preparations for a war against the DPRK at the last stage through the joint military exercise. They also show that the military tie-ups between the United States and South Korea, between the U.S. and Japan and between South Korea and Japan have been linked with one another and that these relations are actually operating.\r\n   The U.S., Japanese and the South Korean authorities had better ponder over consequences to be entailed by their moves for war of aggression and act with discretion. \r\n\r\n"
