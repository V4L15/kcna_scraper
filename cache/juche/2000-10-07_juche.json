We can never remain a passive on-looker to these moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A spokesman for the CPRF said this in a statement issued Friday as regards reckless arms buildup and war preparations in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The statement continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities talk about \"sincere implementation\" of the June 15 joint declaration and \"peace-building\" before us but are getting frantic in their moves for arms buildup behind us. This goes to prove that they have no willingness to implement the joint declaration but are still working hard to attack their dialogue partner in collusion with outside forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A promise made between the two sides can be kept only when both sides strive for its implementation with good faith. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the noble mission and right of the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK to check a war of aggression and defend the security of the country and the lives of its people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the South Korean authorities persist in their war moves despite our repeated warnings, the DPRK will have no option but to take a corresponding self-defensive measure. \r\n\r\n"

To be involved in the drill that will last for about 15 days are tens of thousands of troops, scores of warships and hundreds of planes, reported Sankei Shimbun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What cannot be overlooked is that it is the first military exercise to be staged after the legislation related to the updated \"Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation Guidelines\" was put in force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As already known, the \"guidelines\" and the legislation related to them, which were concluded and adopted last year, are an adventurous and reckless aggression plan to hurl all human and material resources of Japan as well as its armed forces into war of aggression in emergencies in the areas surrounding Japan, in the event of contingency on the Korean peninsula in particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In a nutshell, the projected joint military drill is a field maneuver intended to examine Japan's capabilities of reinvasion of the Korean peninsula and the rest of Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Officials of Japan's Defence Agency are now asserting that this drill of \"SDF\" is of totally defensive nature as it is aimed at support to the transport of supplies for the U.S. troops and rescue of \"Japanese overseas\" in emergencies in the areas surrounding Japan. But it is no more than sheer sophism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan has the world second largest military spending. And she is building the most powerful naval and air forces in Asia. This clearly shows that Japan seeks to realize its old design for \"Greater East Asia Coprosperity Sphere\" through war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries are engrossed in brinkmanship for overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The facts evidently tell that it is an undeniable sovereign right for Asian nations to increase their defence capabilities, especially the striking force against Japan's reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Asian people should frustrate Japan's design for reinvasion with heightened vigilance. \r\n\r\n"

It was full reflection of the unanimous will and desire of the whole party and army and all the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Jong Il has strengthened and developed the WPK to be a revolutionary party of Juche type and an ever-victorious iron-willed party unshaken in any storm and stress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He has strengthened and developed the party to be a party of the great leader Kim Il Sung. This is the greatest exploit Kim Jong Il has performed for the cause of party building of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Jong Il has successfully provided army-first revolutionary leadership, a unique political mode of Korean style, thereby firmly defending the socialist cause of Juche and remarkably increasing the overall national power including the country's defence capability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His immortal leadership exploits are shining more brilliantly because he successfully accomplished the cause of perpetuating the memory of Kim Il Sung even in the most difficult period of the Korean revolution and brought about a decisive turning-point in the  building of a powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He represents the destiny of our party, the revolution and the country and a banner for all victories and glory. It is the foremost duty and the greatest mission of a revolutionary of Juche type to devotedly defend the leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His army-first revolutionary leadership is vital to the Korean revolution and an invincible political mode firmly guaranteeing the final accomplishment of the cause of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is a sure guarantee for the victory of the revolution to strengthen the party and increase its leadership role, the reporter stressed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
