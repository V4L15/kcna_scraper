Accordingly, there is nothing doubtful about this.\r\n   The launch is a fruition of painstaking efforts of the Korean people to use the space for the peaceful purpose. \r\n   Therefore, there is no reason for Japan to hurl slanders at this.\r\n   The Japanese right-wing gangsters must clearly know that to provoke Chongryon, a dignified organisation of overseas citizens of the DPRK, is an act of infringing upon the sovereignty of the DPRK and stop acting rashly. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
