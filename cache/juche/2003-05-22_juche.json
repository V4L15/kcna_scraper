Any \"further steps\" mentioned in the \"joint statement\" are bound to entail unpredictable consequences on the Korean Peninsula. In that case the U.S. and the south side will have to be held fully accountable for them.    \r\n\r\n"

In the meantime Fleischer, a spokesman for the White House, said that \"it is the longstanding policy of the U.S. not to take all options off the table including the plan for preemptive attack upon North Korea.\"\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun today says in a signed commentary: these are dangerous war outcries driving the situation on the Korean Peninsula to an explosive point as they undisguisedly revealed the U.S. attempt to launch a preemptive military attack upon the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK can not but take a serious note of a whole string of provocative war outbursts let loose by U.S. high-ranking officials in the wake of the Beijing talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is paying lip-service to \"diplomatic settlement\", \"peaceful settlement\" of the nuclear issue. Some days ago U.S. President Bush made a commitment in the so-called \"joint statement\" to settle the nuclear issue in a peaceful way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the grave situation created by the U.S. on the Korean Peninsula proves that such remarks of the bush team are nothing but hypocrisy and a trick camouflaged with the veil of peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. persistently pursues the military confrontation with the DPRK, the situation will lead to a catastrophic phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An option does not reside only with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK, too, has its own option. The U.S. plan to mount a military attack upon the DPRK compels it to take strong counter-measures. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the DPRK's invariable mode of retaliation to counter the U.S. hardline policy with the toughest stand.    \r\n\r\n"
