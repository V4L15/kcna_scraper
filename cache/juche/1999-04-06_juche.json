He was accompanied by director of the KPA general political department Jo Myong Rok, chief of the KPA general staff Kim Yong Chun and staff members of the KPA supreme command. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He arrived at the headquarters situated on the forefront.

Branding this as an action intended to start a war of aggression on the DPRK, a news analyst of the paper says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bills on \"guidelines for Japan-U.S. defense cooperation\" are under consideration at the diet of Japan.   Synchronizing with this, it was disclosed that in 1994, the Defense Agency of Japan examined the issue of offering Japan's civilian airports and seaports to the U.S. troops in the \"event of contingency\" on the Korean peninsula.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Recently, a drill for evacuating American civilians from South Korea to Japan through Japan's civilian airports was held under the simulated conditions of \"emergencies\" on the Korean peninsula. And civilian companies of Japan and the U.S. troops promised to cooperate with each other in \"case of emergency.\"   By \"emergencies\", the U.S. and the Japanese reactionaries mean to provoke a war of aggression against the DPRK.   What the Japanese reactionaries envisage in the war of aggression is to leave the whole territory of Japan to the tender mercy of the U.S. aggression forces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is only too clear that, if bills on the \"Japan-U.S. defense cooperation guidelines\" are endorsed, the military tie-up between the two countries will be stepped up on a full scale and it will develop into a war of aggression against the DPRK.   It is a foolish miscalculation if Japan thinks it can go scot-free when it serves the U.S. troops as a sortie, logistics and rear base in case of war on the Korean peninsula.   Japan could get off unhurt although it played a big criminal role in the past Korean War. But, it will never go scot-free this time.   The Japanese reactionaries would be well advised not to ignore the warnings of the DPRK but ponder over them. \r\n \r\n"

There are only the people who defected to the north in accordance with their faith and will.   I am one of the defectors who came to the North Korea that boasts genuine human dignity, unable to live any longer in South Korea subjected to outside forces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nI was born in Jijuk-ri, Tohwa-myon in Kohung county, South Jolla Province.   My parents made desperate efforts to eke out their life by digging out big shell-fishes, but the living conditions went from bad to worse.   Gradually, I came to be disillusioned with the unfair South Korean society and defected to the north of my own accord in search of a worthy life in the northern society, people's paradise.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nafter the defection, I graduated from Pyongyang University of construction and building materials according to my choice and is now working at a construction enterprise in Pyongyang.   I am enjoying a happy life with my wife and two kids in a three-room flat of a high apartment.   I have no intention to return to corrupt South Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authority's insistence on \"exchanging\" the north-born unconverted long-term prisoners for \"those abducted by the north\" is an intolerable insult to us defectors to the north as well as a human rights abuse.   It is preposterous to insist on \"exchanging\" the defectors to the north, who are unwilling to return to South Korea, for unconverted long-term prisoners, who earnestly hope to leave South Korea for the north where their families live. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Pyongyang, where the nation's homogeneity formed and human civilization originated is the birthplace of the Koreans.   No city in the world can match Pyongyang in its time-honored history and beauty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Pyongyang has been a fortress to save the nation as transparent patriotic soul has been alive from ancient times and the spirit of fighting against aggression sky-high here.   In the absence of a famous man, Pyongyang could not avoid a grief-stricken history.

He was the builder of the holy city of sun who created a new history of Pyongyang marked by dignity and honor.   Pyongyang has become the world famous holy city  because it is inspired by the spirit of patriotism of Kim Jong Suk, who was an anti-Japanese heroine, and blessed with the greatness of General Secretary Kim Jong Il.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the great fortune of Pyongyang to hold in high esteem Kim Jong Il, a peerlessly great man, who is carrying forward the cause of President Kim Il Sung.   Having Marshal Kim Jong Il, Pyongyang remains shining as the cradle of Juche, as a symbol of dignity and independence.   The United States, that projects itself as the only superpower, dare not impair the dignity of Pyongyang.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Noting it is the world's only holy land of sun, the article stresses Pyongyang, where President Kim Il Sung, the great sun of the nation and mankind, is preserved in state, and there is Kim Jong Il, who carries forward the cause of sun, is the center of the earth and the axis of the times to which mankind is looking up.   Pyongyang where Kim Jong Il is leading the sacred cause of national reunification, considering it  as the most pressing and greatest patriotic task of the nation is a beacon of reunification.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Holding President Kim Il Sung and the leader Kim Jong Il in high esteem, Pyongyang is shedding its brilliant rays as the nation's eternal holy land and as the prospering capital city of sun. \r\n\r\n  \r\n"
