This is because the DPRK has sticked to the independent politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The independent politics of the DPRK with which it concluded the 20th century with pride will more dynamically demonstrate its validity and vitality in the 21st century. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Remark of JDP heavyweight under fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 8 (KCNA) -- Hatoyama, heavyweight of the Japan Democratic Party, in a recent television appearance on diet affairs insisted that the \"Self-Defence Forces\" (SDF) should be clearly stipulated as an \"army\" in the Japanese constitution.\r\n He went the length of asserting that to do so is to prevent Japan from starting another war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard rodong sinmun today in a signed commentary dismisses his remark as sheer sophism revealing craftiness peculiar to Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By this assertion he means that Japan may opt for war if the SDF is not stipulated in the constitution as an \"army\" and to do so is the only way for it to go in for peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese constitution bans Japan from having armed forces and using forces against other countries and participating in similar military actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This notwithstanding, Hatoyama claimed that preserving the \"peace constitution\" may cause \"something disturbing\". What a nonsense  Hatoyama styled himself a \"peace champion\" wishing to see Japan going in for peace but he self-exposed that he is fanatical militarist keen on re-conquest by taking the lead in the moves to revise the constitution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are well advised to drop their daydream of overseas aggression.    \r\n\r\n"
