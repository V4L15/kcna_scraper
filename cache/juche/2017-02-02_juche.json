This was a conclusion drawn by the international judicial circle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the U.S. worked out in 1966 \"sanctions resolution\" 232, the first of its kind in UN history, under the pretext of Article 39 of the UN Charter to avenge former Rhodesia which declared its independence from Britain, the international judicial circle clarified the illegality of the \"resolution,\" citing paragraph by paragraph, and took issue with the UN Security Council's act of going beyond its mandate.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now the U.S. continues to cook up \"resolutions\" by abusing authority of the UN Security Council in defiance of universally recognized international law. In this regard, the DPRK requested the UN Secretariat to organize an international forum of law experts for clarifying the legal ground of those resolutions either in New York or in Geneva.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the U.S. let experts on Korean affairs who lack knowledge about international law still spout hackneyed sophism that the UNSC is entitled to take appropriate measures if an act of specified country is seen as a threat to peace under Article 39 of the UN Charter and that the UNSC can impose sanctions because other countries do not accept the DPRK's withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Article 39 of the UN Charter can not become a legal ground for the \"sanctions resolution\" as it provides for common authority of the UN Security Council, and no international law stipulates that nuclear test or satellite launch of a specified state constitutes threat to peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Moreover, the DPRK's withdrawal from the NPT was legitimate as it went through necessary procedures under Article 10 of the treaty and there is no paragraph in the treaty that specifies that withdrawal has to be recognized by other countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Flurry of sophism let out by so-called American experts on Korean affairs clearly proves the necessity of open discussion on legal grounds for \"sanctions resolution\" at an international forum of legal experts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The UN advocating abidance by international law and regulations has to fulfill its responsibility and mission before the international community by organizing a forum immediately, properly meeting the just demand of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean Jurists Committee hopes that the international community and legal organizations valuing justice and truth would positively respond to the DPRK's proposal for organizing an international forum for open discussion on the legal grounds for \"sanctions resolution\"."

Therefore, it was aimed at swallowing up the whole of Korea and dominating Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. occupied south Korea under the pretext of \"disarming\" the Japanese imperialists to meet its aggressive interests in the middle of the last century, bisecting the nation and territory into two parts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Owing to the U.S. forces' occupation of south Korea the Koreans have suffered unimaginable misfortune and pain and horrible tragedies are taking place there even at this moment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their ceaseless drills for a nuclear war have turned the Korean peninsula and region into the biggest hotspot in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The withdrawal of the U.S. forces from south Korea is indispensable prerequisite to achieving the reunification of the Korean nation, peace and security in the region and the demand of mankind which was reflected in the resolution adopted at the 30th UN General Assembly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. forces' presence in south Korea is not in line with the realistic interests of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is of criminal and anachronistic nature in the light of the demands of the Korean nation and the international community and the changed strategic structure in Northeast Asia and is nothing beneficial to the American empire either.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. would be well advised to properly face up to the trend of the times and make a decision to pull its forces from south Korea as early as possible."

Korean Conservatives' Racket for \"Declaration of Martial Law\"\r\n Pyongyang, February 2 (KCNA) -- The south Korean ultra-right conservative forces are getting all the more reckless in their wild act against the public mindset.\n\t\t\t\t\t Shortly ago, a group of conservative gangsters held a rally against the impeachment of Park Geun Hye where they called for \"declaration of Martial Law\" and swayed spears and helmets reminiscent of the \"crusade\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They shouted \"All Reds have to be removed\", \"Insurgents holding candlelight have to be killed under Martial Law\" and \"Only Martial Law will work. Army, rise up\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This rowdyism, reminding one of the bloody fascist violence in the days of the May 18 Kwangju resistance, touches off the surging wrath of all the fellow countrymen and the international community as it was pursuant to the puppet conservative forces' organized and planned plot to open a way-out of the on-going situation calling for the impeachment of Park.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of conservatives is making desperate efforts to prop up the declining conservative regime while defending the traitorous policy of Park, root cause of all disaster.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From the outset of the year, traitor Park instigated the conservative media to totally deny her crimes. And she, openly inciting military coup, let the puppet military gangsters float the story of \"insecurity\" and \"threat from the north\" in a bid to create the feelings of crisis in society on purpose.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She let the die-hard conservatives, who insulted the bereaved families of Sewol disaster as \"corpse vendors\" and branded progressive labor organizations as \"forces following the north\", trumpet about \"nullification of impeachment\" and \"elimination of leftist forces\" and vociferate about the \"attempt of north-defending group to seize 'power'\", threatening and blackmailing the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The move of the ultra-right conservative group to drench the whole south Korean land with blood in order to prolong the dirty remaining days of the \"yusin\" witch is a dangerous act that can be done only by the descendents of the military fascist dictators who mangled the April 19 popular uprising and the May 18 Kwangju resistance with bayonet.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The racket for \"declaration of Martial Law\" kicked up by the conservative group, repeating the great tragedy of history which turned south Korea into a theatre of fascism and wasteland of human rights and democracy, is a fin de siecle act of those without future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of traitors can never check the dynamic advance of the people desirous of new politics and new society and can not evade the miserable fate of perishing in the sea of candlelight."

Entonces, el circulo juridico internacional cuestiono fuertemente al abuso de autoridad del CS de la ONU, enumerando una tras otra las ilegalidades de aquella \"resolucion de sancion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn relacion con que EE.UU. sigue inventando las \"resoluciones\" injustas abusando de la facultad del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU en desprecio a las leyes internacionales reconocidas, la RPDC demando al Secretariado de la ONU organizar en Nueva York o Ginebra un forum internacional de los especialistas en ley para aclarar el fundamento juridico de las \"resoluciones de sancion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, EE.UU. presento a unos personajes fingidos como especialistas en el problema de Corea, ignorantes de la ley internacional, para seguir presentando las sofisterias caducas de que el CS de la ONU puede tomar las medidas correspondientes si se decide una accion de un Estado determinado como amenaza a la paz segun el articulo 39 de la Carta de la ONU y el CS puede dar las sanciones a la RPDC porque su retirada del Tratado de No Proliferacion no lo reconocen otros paises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl articulo 39 de la Carta de la ONU que determino la facultad general del CS de la ONU no puede ser un fundamento juridico de la \"resolucion de sancion\". Tambien, ninguna ley internacional estipulo como amenaza a la paz una prueba nuclear o un lanzamiento de satelite de un Estado determinado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTambien, la retirada de la RPDC del Tratado de No Proliferacion fue legitima por pasar todos los procesos segun el articulo 10 del Tratado, y ningun parrafo del Tratado estipula que la retirada debe ser reconocida por otros paises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas sofisterias de los llamados especialistas norteamericanos en el problema de Corea demuestran fehacientemente la necesidad de organizar un forum internacional de los especialistas juridicos para discutir oficialmente el fundamento legal de las \"resoluciones de sancion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa ONU que habla tanto de la gobernacion constitucional y la observacion de los reglamentos internacionales debe organizar sin demora el foro en vez de dar espalda a la justa demanda de la RPDC, de manera que tiene que cumplir su responsabilidad y deber asumidos ante la sociedad internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Comite de Juristas de Corea desea a la sociedad internacional y las entidades juridicas que aprecian la justicia y la verdad responder activamente a nuestra propuesta de organizar el foro internacional para debatir oficialmente la base juridica de las \"resoluciones de sancion\"."
