The conference discussed ways to draw lessons from the shortcomings and thoroughly rectify them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Criticism was also made of officials for their shortcomings reflected in perfunctorily implementing the Party's decision, not giving priority to the work for firmly arming themselves with the Party's line and policies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There was criticism of failing to conduct the drive for implementing the Party's line and policies in a do-or-die spirit and of failing to meticulously organize the party life among officials and other party members and guide it to suit the characteristic features of relevant units.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the light of self-criticisms and criticisms measures were taken to firmly build up the primary committees of the whole party into the militant units with strong organizational and executive capabilities and bring about a revolutionary turn in the ideological viewpoint and work traits and style of the chairpersons of the primary party committees.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Speakers evinced their resolutions to firmly consolidate the primary party organizations as outposts for devotedly defending the leader and carrying out the Party's policies to the letter by creditably fulfilling their responsibility and role as direct organizers, information officials and implementers in executing the Party's policies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conference goes on."
