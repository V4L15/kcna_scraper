This marked a landmark event which paved the way for putting an end to the abnormal relations between the DPRK and Japan in conformity with the aspirations and interests of the two peoples and the need of the times because they have been locked in discord and confrontation for one whole century though they are geographically near from each other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The relations of confrontation that have existed the DPRK and Japan due to the unpleasant past in the 20th century are beneficial to no one in any way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The two peoples wish to see their countries to remain on good terms as near and close neighbours not as near yet distant countries and realize co-existence and co-prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe declaration reflects this desire and requirement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The talks for establishing diplomatic relations between the DPRK and Japan slated to resume in October should not turn out under any circumstances to be talks only wasting time without any progress as what happened in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the belief of the Korean people that a new page will be recorded in the history of the relations between the two countries thanks to their common will and joint efforts to improve them.  \r\n\r\n"
