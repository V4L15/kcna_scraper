It is right to say that since then, the Korean nation's history of independence and the era of independence of humankind have developed.\r\n   The President, with an independent position and standpoint centred on the people, formed the anti-Japanese guerrilla army, liberated the country, founded a new-type independent party guided by the Juche idea, established Korean-style Democratic People's Republic suitable to the actual conditions of the country and built regular armed forces by founding the Korean People's Army which inherited the brilliant traditions of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle.\r\n   As he guided the people and the country with independent politics in his whole life, the north of Korea could develop as a powerful socialist state, independent, self-reliant and self-supporting in national defence, a state with great potentials.\r\n   The article lauds General Kim Jong Il as the incarnation of independent politics.\r\n   It says:\r\n   The cause of independent politics pioneered by President Kim Il Sung has been successfully carried forward by General Kim Jong Il.\r\n   The General's political faith and political creed boil down to the word \"our style.\"\r\n   The north has maintained independence without making a slightest concession in confrontation with powers, undaunted by outsiders' monstrous pressure, thanks to the independent politics of General Kim Jong Il, who is never yielding to any storms.\r\n   It can be said that the world's political axis has changed from the Soviet-U.S. confrontation to the DPRK-U.S. confrontation. \r\n   U.S. President Bill Clinton exceptionally sent General Kim Jong Il a letter officially promising the implementation of the DPRK-U.S. framework agreement, using the nomenclature of the north and calling him the supreme leader.\r\n   General Kim Jong Il is taking the van in creditably defending socialism of the north with the faith and will of independent politics.\r\n   The forced march for the final victory offers a glimpse of the spirit of his independent politics.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Mt. Jongbang\r\n  Pyongyang, April  23 (KCNA) -- From olden times Mt. Jongbang has been well known in Korea for its unique beauty and its abundance of historic relics.\r\n   This 481 m-high mountain, situated in North Hwanghae Province south of Pyongyang, was created as a result of the weathering of quartzite and mica slate in the form of square (Jongbang means square in Korean), from which the name came.\r\n  In spring the mountain is all ablaze with sweet-scented pink azalea, apricot, peach, pear and cherry blossoms. The summer greenery and the autumn maples are truly attractive.\r\n   Many animal species, such as roe deer, Korean water-deer and pheasants, live in the woods. Walking through the forest one sees grand views of wall-like rocks, green pines rooted in the sheer cliffs, the roaring cascade and acrystal stream.\r\n   The mountain preserves many valuable relics of the Koryo dynasty (918-1392). The outstanding relic is the Jongbang fortress. The fortress with a circumference of 12 km along the ridges and over the hills, covers an area of 2 square kilometres. It hands down many stories about our ancestors' heroic struggle aganist the invaders.\r\nDuring the Imjin patriotic war, the righteous army and people camped in the fortress beat the Japanese who invaded as far as Hwanghae Province. The incredible valour displayed by our  soldiers terribly scared the enemy. One soldier, for example, though heavily wounded, plunged single-handed into the enemy camp and beat them down.    Our soldiers dug lakes near the fortress and when the munitions ran out they fought by showering stones and water upon the enemy.\r\n   The Rojok (pile of grains) peak has this story: greatly exhausted in the battle, the enemy attempted to starve the soldiers in the fortress to death by tightening the encirclement. But seeing through the enemy's trick, our soldiers covered the peak with rush-mat and straw overnight to be seen as a large stack of grain. Seeing it, the enemy became dispirited and finally gave up.\r\n   Mt. Jongbang boasts of the Songbul temple built in 898. \r\nIt was seriously damaged by the agregssors' bombing during the Fatherland Liberation War but was restored after the war. The hip-saddle roofs and the columns of the temple make a charming balance.\r\n   One of the temple's six buildings is the Sansin Pavilion. \r\nOur forefathers frequented this pavilion to pray for their future welfare in the heaven. The pavilion was the haunt of the poor.\r\n   But the welfare our ancestors so aspired to has become a reality today. President Kim Il Sung visited the mountain many times and gave specific tasks to build it up as a fine holiday resort for the working people. Now the mountain provides a fine pleasure ground for people to enjoy their holidays.\r\n   The Jongbang teahouse, equipped with modern dining facilities indoor and outdoor, the angling sites covering 8,300 square metres, the sightseeing routes, stone tables and chairs and clean springs all were built newly to provide comfortable recreation.\r\n    The mountain is a tourist attraction. This year people had gala may day celebrations there. That day General Kim Jong Il, who is carrying into effect President Kim Il Sung's plan, gave personal guidance to provide more comforts at the pleasure ground for people. Looking around the ground General Kim Jong Il studied the progress made in building up the ground and five highly important instructions for turning the mountain into a better holiday resort soon the cultural equipment for use in sports, amusement and mountaineering will be installed.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
