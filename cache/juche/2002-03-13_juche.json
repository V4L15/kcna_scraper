Attending there were researchers of the academy of medical science of the DPRK and members of the group for probing the truth behind GIs' crimes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Professor and doctor Kim Song Jung recalled that during the Korean War the U.S. imperialist aggressors dropped a lot of germ bombs across the country including South Phyongan and Kangwon provinces, killing many Koreans, and cited concrete facts to prove the truth about the barbaric germ warfare committed by the U.S. troops. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Academician, professor and doctor Kim Rak Je and professor and doctor Hyon Chang Bu disclosed the fact that the U.S. troops used chemical weapons, suffocating and poisoning innocent civilians to death, and urged the U.S. to make an apology and compensation to the Korean people for the crimes committed in wanton violation of the international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Underscoring the need to roundly expose the monstrous germ and chemical warfares committed by the U.S. troops in Korea, they expressed hope that members of the investigation group would let the Americans as well as other people of the world know about GIs' crimes and bitterly denounce them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Brian Willson, head of the group and representative of the \"veterans' organization for peace\" of the U.S., said he could not but be stunned at the barbaric biological and chemical warfares committed by GIs, adding that these crimes should be known to the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He underlined the need to set up a new international tribunal to try GIs' crimes and make the testimonies made today be known to the public.     \r\n\r\n"

Korea joint military exercises under fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 13 (KCNA) -- The U.S.-South Korea \"combined forces command\" recently announced that it would stage two joint military exercises called \"reception, staging, onward movement and integration exercise\" and \"foal eagle\" from March 21 to 27.\r\n In this regard, papers here today in signed commentaries observe that the projected joint exercises are, in fact, operations aimed at a full-scale attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through various forms of joint military exercises to be staged under the unified command the domestic and foreign warmongers seek to finally complete their preparations for a war and get fully ready to go into actions against the DPRK at any time, says Rodong Sinmun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The announcement of this plan came right after the South Korea visit of Bush, warmonger who was busy fanning up confrontation with the DPRK, and war hysteria, clamouring about the \"axis of evil\". This is an outright challenge to the DPRK and a premeditated provocation to it. It is little short of a declaration of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The projected joint military exercise, a replica of \"team spirit\" joint military exercise, a test nuclear war, which had to be suspended for being targeted against the DPRK, is prelude to a very dangerous war of aggression aimed to plunge the Korean nation into a scourge of a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality goes to more clearly prove that \"dialogue\" called for by the U.S. is a sheer lie, the U.S. imperialists' policy of aggression against the DPRK has reached a stage of its reckless implementation and their wild design to stifle the DPRK by force of arms remains unchanged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of Korea are following with high vigilance the adventurous moves of the domestic and foreign enemies keen to ignite a war of aggression against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson says that the U.S. is grossly mistaken if it thinks it can bring the Korean people to their knees by force of arms. If the U.S. imperialists finally opts for military confrontation with the DPRK despite Korean and foreign public's unanimous protest and denunciation, they will face only a bitter defeat and death, it warns.    \r\n\r\n"
