The Korean Peninsula can be nuclear-free only when it is completely free from the U.S. nuclear threat.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the measures taken by the DPRK were prompted by its desire to protect its sovereignty and dignity and ensure peace and security on the peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The UNSC would be well advised to think twice, bearing in mind that the increased pressure on its part would only compel the DPRK to take stronger counter-actions against it, the statement warned."
