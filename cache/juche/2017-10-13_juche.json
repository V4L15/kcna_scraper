Meanwhile, the U.S. staged nocturnal flight exercises with Japan Air \"Self-Defense Force\" and the south Korean puppet airforce fighters after introducing two B-1B nuclear strategic bombers into the sky above the East Sea of Korea at night on the same day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Trump group is also inciting military pressure on the DPRK while introducing nuclear submarine Michigan into the Pusan Port of south Korea and planning to dispatch nuclear carrier Ronald Reagan into the waters around south Korea in mid-October to hold \"high-intensity\" joint exercises with the puppet forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is that such military moves have been conducted at a time when the Trump group posted on twitter such letters reading that the U.S. failed to handle north Korea for the past 25 years and only one thing will prove effective, while frequently hinting at \"military option\" backed by such rubbish as \"a calm before a storm\" and \"total destruction\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Trump team is trying to provoke the DPRK through such reckless military provocations as dispatch of B-1B, nuclear submarine and nuclear carrier into the waters around the Korean peninsula.
