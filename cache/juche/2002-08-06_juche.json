            "content": "KCNA on dangerous revival of Japanese militarism \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 6 (KCNA) -- 57 years have passed since the Japanese imperialists' defeat in the Second World War.\r\n In this regard, the Korean Central News Agency on Monday issued a report condemning the Japanese reactionaries for rushing headlong towards overseas aggression while reviving militarism that faced the stern judgment of history and seeking to turn Japan into a military giant and a nuclear power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The report reads in part: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reactionaries of Japan are working hard to foster militarism and fever of reinvasion among its people above all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently Japan adopted an unprecedented resolution on forming a special committee to build a \"Memorial to the Second World War Dead\". This reveals the Japanese reactionaries' criminal attempt to call back in real earnest the departed soul of those militarists who are entombed in the Yasukuni Shrine in central Tokyo, in the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The shrine is now visited by the prime minister and cabinet ministers, dietmen and other Japanese of broad segments and the right-wing gangsters have gone the length of staging a military parade in uniforms of the imperial Japanese army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Various right-wing reactionary groups of Japan are conducting noisy propaganda about militarism at the tacit connivance of the authorities. These groups reportedly number several hundreds and there are over ten large organizations, each grouping hundreds of thousands of members. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A particular mention should be made of the fact that they have distorted historical facts in the revised textbooks to embellish Japan's past history of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, many reactionary films have been produced and screened in Japan to prettify the past history of aggression and call back the departed soul of militarists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In August 1999, the Japanese reactionaries legalized Hinomaru and Kimigayo, symbols of militarism, as the national flag and anthem. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have also stepped up the moves to reorganize the self-defense forces (SDF) as regular armed forces and turn Japan into a military power and a nuclear power in a bid to establish its domination over Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over the past decades Japan has systematically increased military spending to develop the SDF into regular armed forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAt present it is the world's largest nation next to the united states in military expenditure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a result, the military muscle of the SDF has been sharply increased. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nuclear weaponization is the most important aim of Japan's policy to turn itself into a military giant, a policy intended to dominate Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reactionaries of Japan vie with each other in claiming that Japan should possess nuclear weapons in disregard of its \"three non-nuclear principles\" banning manufacture, stockpile and introduction of nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to recent information available from greenpeace activists, Japan has stockpiled 38 tons of plutonium and plans to possess 110 tons by 2020. Its future goal is to stockpile 400 tons of plutonium. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits one more attention in the build-up of the SDF is moves to militarize the space. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan launched into space H-2A no. 1, a large carrier rocket, in August 2001 and no. 2 on February 4 this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this way it has secured a huge amount of plutonium enough to produce thousands of nuclear bombs and high nuclear technology. It possesses even large long-range carrier rockets, which is a great threat to peace and stability in Asia and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reactionaries of Japan are coming out in overseas aggression in real earnest while putting spurs to the establishment of wartime system to put the country on a perfect military and fascist system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are keen to pass through the diet at any cost the \"emergency legislation\" such as orders for wartime general mobilization, which invest the government and the SDF with unlimited power in contingency. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan adopted the law on overseas dispatch of troops in 1992, the law on emergency in areas surrounding Japan in 1999 and the anti-terrorism special law in October 2001 to lay a legal ground for the SDF's overseas dispatch. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the basis of wartime laws, which legalize overseas dispatch of the SDF, Japan officially and drastically expanded the sphere of its overseas activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After expanding the sphere of SDF operations, Japan has launched into full-scale overseas operation to repeat its past history of aggression, throwing away its slogan of \"exclusive defence\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's overseas dispatch of troops is being openly made under the signboard of the UN Peacekeeping Forces and intensified under the pretext of logistic support for the U.S.-led anti-terrorism military operations after the September 11 incident. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is also stepping up the overseas dispatch of its troops allegedly to protect its vessels from pirates' attacks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such moves are intended to contain other Asian countries by force. Meanwhile, Japan has staged various forms of military exercises to round off its preparations for reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It began to dispatch SDF warships to the U.S.-led RIMPAC joint military maneuvers in 1980. Involved in RIMPAC 2002 naval exercises, which started on June 25 this year, were some 1,120 troops, five warships, eight anti-submarine patrol planes and other combat forces of Japan, which even testfired missiles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan stages various large-scale military exercises every year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nJapan-U.S. joint naval maneuvers are conducted 30-40 times on an annual average. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The SDF has frequently staged war exercises for reinvasion of Korea in the sky, land and waters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such madcap exercises staged under the simulated conditions of an attack on the DPRK in the event of contingency on the Korean Peninsula included landing operation, exercise on maps, surprising attack exercise, commanding staff exercise, transport exercise, rescue exercise, computer simulation exercise and anti-submarine special exercise. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's war drills for comeback to Korea have been further intensified since the emergence of the bush administration in the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Moves to militarize Japan and convert it into a military giant are getting all the more pronounced to make the 21st century another century of aggression and plunder and drive humankind into a holocaust of war. This is the gravity of the revival of Japanese militarism now censured by the world public. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the lesson and review of human history that aggression and war are bound to bring destruction to a war criminal state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan unleashes a war of reinvasion, oblivious of the historical lesson and the changed reality today it will not be able to go scotfree but meet an inescapable tragic end.     \r\n"
