All this is attributable to the U.S. outrageous state-sponsored politically-motivated terrorism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak group of traitors in south Korea spearheaded the attempted operations to blow up statues in the DPRK under the manipulation of the U.S. only to be discovered and frustrated. This was the most typical state-sponsored politically-motivated hideous terrorism, a gross violation of international law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Declarations, international law and conventions on combating international terrorism adopted at international meetings including UN General Assembly brand any practices to organize, encourage and agitate the acts of destroying or destabilizing socio-political systems of other countries as grave international crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is also the worst violator of freedom of religion and religious belief.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"anti-terror war\" launched by the U.S. is a cruel war to abuse human rights as it brutally suppresses freedom of religion and religious belief behind the curtain of \"liberal democracy.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Terming Islam a war-like religion, the U.S. claims that the only way for stamping it out is to \"transform all Muslim forces and lead them to Western democracy\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pursuant to this brigandish sophism, the U.S. is forcing various countries and regions believing in Islam to fall victim to its \"war on terrorism\" and seriously infringing upon religious freedom.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Does the U.S. have the face to take issue with other countries over terrorism and religious issues despite the fact that it is so bitterly condemned by the international community for those crimes?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the steadfast stand of the DPRK government to ensure freedom of religious faith and combat all forms of terrorism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is talking a lot about the improvement of \"human rights record\" and cooperation in \"combating terrorism\" while running the whole gamut of moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK, feigning ignorance of its own ill-practices. This reminds one of a guilty party filing suit first and a striking manifestation of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. persistent pursuance of its hostile policy toward the DPRK would compel the DPRK further bolster its nuclear deterrent."

This suffices to show the danger of the projected military drills.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ulji Freedom Guardian is obviously drills for a war of aggression and an escalation of the adventurous nuclear war maneuvers against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will never pardon the U.S. and the rat-like Lee group escalating the provocations through madcap war drills, far from making apology for their attempted state-sponsored and politically-motivated hideous terrorism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Invaders are fated to meet only death."

            "content": "ACNC comenta informes anuales del Departamento de Estado de EE.UU.\r\nPyongyang, 4 de agosto (ACNC) -- En el \"informe anual sobre la libertad de religion internacional\" y el \"informe anual sobre el terrorismo\", publicados los dias 30 y 31 de julio, el Departamento de Estado de EE.UU. volvio a acusar a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea calificandola como \"pais sin libertad de religion que causa preocupacion especial\" y \"pais que no coopera en el antiterrorismo\".\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto es un producto de conspiracion politica para aislar en la escena internacional a la RPDC al internacionalizar como \"problema institucional\" la situacion de DDHH de la RPDC tras tergiversarla a sus caprichos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. no tiene calificacion para discutir la libertad de la religion y la prevencion del terrorismo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. es el caudillo de terrorismo internacional y estado ejemplar en la violacion de la libertad de religion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la historia, se registraron muchos atentados terroristas de Estado, ideados y ejecutados por el imperio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA citar solo los casos del nuevo siglo, las guerras desatadas por doquier del mundo por EE.UU. fueron flagrantes atentados terroristas politicos y violaciones de derechos estatales de los paises agredidos. El objetivo de esas guerras \"antiterroristas\" estuvo en derrocar el regimen de los Estados soberanos y establecer el orden de dominacion al estilo norteamericano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo resultado, se cambiaron uno tras otro los regimenes de algunos paises de Africa del Norte y sigue siendo complicada la situacion de otras zonas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl recien revelado atentado de destruccion de las estatuas de bronce erigidas en la RPDC, que impulsaba la banda traidora de Lee Myung Bak bajo el control trasero de EE.UU., es el caso mas representativo del terrorismo politico de Estado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas declaraciones, las leyes y los convenios internacionales sobre las medidas para la eliminacion  del terrorismo internacional, aprobados en la Asamblea General y otras reuniones internacionales, estipulan como serio crimen la organizacion, el fomento y la agitacion de los actos destinados a destruir o desestabilizar el sistema sociopolitico de otros paises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. viola flagrantemente la libertad de la religion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa \"guerra antiterrorista\" de EE.UU. acaba con los DDHH violando flagrantemente la libertad de religion y cultos detras del vistoso cartel de \"democracia liberal\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs precisamente EE.UU. el que definio el Islam como religion belicosa y dijo que el unico remedio para eliminarlo es \"reformar todas las fuerzas islamicas y conducirlas a la senda de democracia occidental\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun esta doctrina de bandido, varios paises y regiones del mundo islamico se convierten en las victimas de la \"guerra antiterrorista\" de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido a sus abiertos actos profanos, EE.UU. es criticado por la sociedad internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsegurar la libertad de la religion y rechazar todas las formas de terrorismo son la invariable posicion del gobierno de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHaciendo vista gorda de esa actitud de la RPDC, EE.UU., que hace todo lo posible para aislar y asfixiar a la primera, habla tanto con gran hipocresia del mejoramiento de la situacion de \"DDHH\" y la cooperacion en el \"antiterrorismo\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi el imperio continua con su politica hostil a la RPDC, crecera mas el disuasivo nuclear de esta."
