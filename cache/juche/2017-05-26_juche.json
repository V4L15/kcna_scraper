But it has not yet received any answer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is all the more problematic is that the few countries failed to utter even a word about the nuclear carrier task forces and strategic nuclear subs brought by the U.S. to the waters off the Korean peninsula to push the situation to the brink of a war, even though they talk much about peace and stability on the peninsula and the region while \"faulting\" and expressing \"concerns\" about the DPRK's rocket launches.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They do not dare mention the U.S. moves when talking about the situation on the Korean peninsula, the most typical characteristics of vassal states bereft of independence and courage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has bolstered the nuclear deterrence for self-defence in every way to tackle the U.S. extreme hostile policy and nuclear threat and blackmail.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To turn away from the root cause of the escalation of tensions but to denounce the DPRK's inevitable option for self-defence caused by it is just an act of \"flattering\" and \"brown-nosing\" to the backstage manipulators, rather than an expression of stand prompted by the respect for international law and regulations and the aspiration for world peace and stability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If these countries are truly interested in international peace and stability, they should not toe the U.S. line but take the lead in realizing international justice."

Agrego que \"por esta razon, EE.UU. y los medios de prensa occidentales hacen todo lo posible para describir a la RPDC como un monstruo\" y la \"guerra es lo que desea EE.UU.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos elaboradores de la politica de EE.UU. deben tomar en consideracion tales opiniones de los especialistas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa sancion y presion sobre un Estado soberano no pueden ser nunca la voluntad general de la sociedad internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde mucho antes, la RPDC es victima de la amenaza y chantaje nucleares y sancion de EE.UU. y otros imperialistas y de la presion de toda indole de los chovinistas de gran potencia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi ella se hubiera rendido ante la presion de los imperialistas y los chovinistas, ya se habria convertido en una colonia o protectorado de ellos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos incidentes tragicos ocurridos en varios paises ensenan la seria leccion de que un pais debil, aunque sea honesto y justo, no puede decir lo que quiera en la arena internacional ni defender la justicia y la conciencia siendo materia de regateo de las grandes potencias. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo es casual que muchos paises del mundo rechacen la aventura de EE.UU. que agrava la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana y la region y obligo a la RPDC al incremento de las fuerzas armadas nucleares. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy dia, la voluntad general de la sociedad internacional esta en lograr el desarrollo independiente de los Estados soberanos y hacer valer la genuina justicia internacional."
