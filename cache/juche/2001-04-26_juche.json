They should turn to national cooperation, not cooperation with outsiders.    \r\n\r\n"

Korea joint military drill assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 26 (KCNA) -- Political parties, organizations and figures of Syria, Italy, Peru and Guyana released statements in protest against \"Reception, Staging, Onward Movement and Integration\" (RSOI) exercise of the United States and South Korea.\r\n The Socialist Unionist Party of Syria in a statement on April 18 said that the joint military drill the U.S. imperialists are going to stage together with the South Korean military authorities clearly shows their aggressive nature and intention to strain the situation, not seeking peace on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The movement for peace and socialism of Italy, the struggle for the peace and socialism of Italy, the People's United Democratic Left Wing of Italy and the Italian Committee for Reunification and Peace of Korea in their joint statement on April 13 noted that the Korean peninsula is now exposed to a serious military threat of the imperialists and the peace process between the north and south of Korea is beset with the danger of rupture. They expressed their determination to strongly oppose the belligerent maneuvers of the U.S. administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Asian Regional Committee for Supporting Korea's Reunification in a statement on April 18 said the U.S. should bear in mind that if it unleashes a war on the Korean peninsula it will suffer a more miserable defeat than that in the Korean War in the 1950s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Peruvian Committee for Supporting the Independent and Peaceful Reunification of Korea in a statement on April 19 noted that if the U.S. truly wants disarmament and peace on the Korean peninsula it should take practical measures for the withdrawal of its forces from South Korea before talking about the issue of \"reduction of conventional weapons\" in the DPRK. If the South Korean authorities follow the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK it will be a perfidy to the north-south joint declaration, the statement said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The chairman of the Guyanese Committee for Supporting Korea's Reunification in a statement on April 19 disclosed that through the RSOI drill the U.S. seeks to check Korea's reunification and create a situation favorable for the achievement of its ambition to dominate the whole of Korea. \r\n\r\n"
