General Goro Miura as the chief of the assassination operation and appointed him as the Japanese diplomatic minister in Korea after a Cabinet meeting.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Shortly afterwards, the Japanese government and Miura discussed the plan to assassinate Min and reached an agreement on granting Miura unquestioned right to have all conditions and means provided for putting the plan into practice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After working out an assassination plan, Miura made a final decision at a secret meeting room of the Japanese legation and specified an action program on October 3.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At dawn on October 8, hundreds of Japanese murderers gathered near the Kwanghwa Gate. They hurled training forces into a fierce exchange of fire with royal guards before setting up ladders against the wall of the royal palace and jumping down to fling open the Kwanghwa Gate.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These man-killers stabbed to death court ladies at random when they were running helter-skelter in screams for shelter as it was not easy to find Min even though they familiarized themselves with her image on a photo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, they could finally confirm that a woman who fell down after being stabbed by a Japanese military police was Min after getting a tip-off from Min's adopted daughter planted by Miura in the palace. They covered Min still alive with a single-layer quilt and carried her to a nearby forest of pine trees in Mt. Rok where they poured petroleum on her body and set her on fire. Not content with this, the murderers threw her scorched remains into a pond.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This cruel murder of the queen of a country was a serious infringement upon the sovereignty of the country and an unpardonable violation of the dignity of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This hideous unethical crime of the Japanese man-killers was perpetrated under the manipulation of the Japanese government from A to Z. The Japanese authorities ran the whole gamut of intrigues to hush up the case and evade the responsibility for it at any cost from the outset even though it was an unpardonable criminal act in view of its motive and objective and the course in which it was perpetrated. But the truth of history can never be written off.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean people always keep tabs on the human rights abuses committed by Japan and will certainly force Japan to pay dearly for its thrice-cursed crimes."

This is nothing but a petty trick of the Japanese political heavyweights to prolong their remaining days by using the issue as a bargaining chip and, at the same time, divert elsewhere the attention of the international community demanding Japan redress its past crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In a word, the behavior of Japan is intended to create the impression that it is interested in the settlement of the \"issue of abduction\" in a bid to win popularity, recover from its policy failures and, at the same time, paint itself as \"a victim\" and thus evade the responsibility for its past crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries implored for what they called \"cooperation\" and \"support\", peddling \"the issue of abduction\" in different countries though it had already been settled. The recent row kicked up by them even in the international arena, not content with that solicitation diplomacy, only brings into bolder relief Japan's shamelessness and moral vulgarity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan owes too much to the Korean people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They always keep tabs on the vicious forcible drafting of Koreans, allurement and abduction and mass killings committed by the Japanese imperialists in the past and will force them to pay for those crimes any time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Any mean sleight of hand employed by Japan to persistently shun the settlement of its past crimes would only bring it to moral ruin.

Despues de la reunion del gabinete, nombro al teniente general terrestre Miura como ministro japones acreditado en Corea considerandolo como persona adecuada para ejecutar el plan de asesinato de Minbi. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPoco despues, el gobierno y Miura discutieron ese plan y acordaron facilitarle al segundo las condiciones para aceptar el complot y darle la autoridad absoluta para movilizar todos los medios necesarios. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMiura, que elaboro el plan de asesinato, lo confirmo finalmente el 3 de octubre en la sala de reunion secreta de la legacion japonesa y lo detallo para la ejecucion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Centenares de matones se reunieron a la madrugada del 8 de octubre en las cercanias de la puerta Kwanghwa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Mientras que la unidad de entrenamiento de los japoneses cruzaba los tiros con la unidad de escoltas coreanos que defendia el palacio real, la banda de asesinos brinco la muralla y abrio la puerta Kwanghwa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Aunque ya habian visto a Minbi por la foto, los asesinos incursionados a tropel en el palacio real no pudieron encontrarla facilmente porque muchas doncellas de la corte huian por todas partes pidiendo el socorro. Por eso, ellos mataron a sablazo a todas las que salian a su encuentro.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Con la ayuda de una espia que habia infiltrado como hijastra de Minbi por la indicacion del japones Komura, los gangsteres japoneses confirmaron finalmente que una coreana caida al suelo por el sablazo de un policia militar japones era precisamente la reina.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Envolvieron con manta acolchada a Minbi no muerta todavia y la llevo al bosque de pinos donde la quemaron con queroseno y tiraron sus restos mortales en una laguna.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esto devino intolerable violacion de la soberania del pais y la dignidad nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Este crimen antietico de los asesinos japoneses fue ejecutado bajo el control del gobierno japones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Sin embargo, desde el principio, las autoridades japonesas recurrieron a todas las artimanas para silenciar ese incidente y eludir la responsabilidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Pero, la verdad de la historia no puede ser borrada de ninguna manera.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El pueblo coreano no olvidara nunca los crimenes antieticos de Japon y saldara la cuenta sin falta de las nunca perdonables barbaridades de los agresores japoneses."
