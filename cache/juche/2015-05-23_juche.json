            "content": "Kim Jong Un Gives Field Guidance to Breed-fish Ground and Fish Farm\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, May 23 (KCNA) -- Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army (KPA) Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and first chairman of the National Defence Commission, gave field guidance to the Sokmak Atlantic Salmon Breed-fish Ground and Raksan Offshore Salmon Fish Farm under KPA Unit 810.\n\t\t\t\t\t The first leg of his guidance was the Sokmak Atlantic Salmon Breed-fish Ground.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round hatchery, fry breeding room, fry fattening room, water filtering place, indoor and outdoor ponds and other places of the ground to learn in detail about the work there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"It is great that the ground is capable of hatching more than 4.3 million fishes in a year\", he said, adding that this has laid a solid foundation for breeding offshore salmon in a big way with a high ambition.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"What is the most important in fish breeding is to solve the water problem and it is good for the ground to have built the processes for filtering water and disinfecting and oxygenating it on the basis of cutting-edge technology to ensure the most ideal water temperature and quality and establish a scientific and general water supply and recycling system\", he stressed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the ground is breeding fishes of various species such as rainbow trout in the indoor and outdoor ponds by letting even the water used for hatching and breeding fries flow into indoor and outdoor ponds, he said this was the example to be followed by all other fish breeding units of the country in introducing water-saving style fish-farming.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Calling on the ground to work hard to attain a higher goal on the basis of the achievements already made, he gave important instructions which would serve guidelines in its management and operation such as the issue of rounding off Korean-style hatching method, the issue of deepening the research into preventing the degeneration of breed salmon and the issue of updating fish-breeding facilities on a higher level.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The next leg of his guidance was the Raksan Offshore Salmon Fish Farm.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He looked round the net ring fishing ground, aquiculture tank, salmon processing room and other places of the farm to learn in detail about the production and fish processing there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  He said that it was an untrodden path for the farm to conduct offshore salmon breeding but officials and employees of the field concerned and the farm have opened a prospect for offshore salmon breeding through a dynamic drive.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"It is praiseworthy for the farm to have made success in breeding not only salmon but also freshwater rainbow trout by acclimatizing it to sea water,\" he noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that he was pleased to see processed salmon including smoked salmon, pickled salmon roe and slices of boiled salmon at the salmon processing room.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He noted that it is necessary to push forward the fish breeding and aquiculture in a big way in order to develop the fishing industry and channel great efforts into offshore fish breeding and aquiculture in particular, adding that the prospect and future for them lie in going out to the sea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pointing out that the seas of the country are not contaminated and their ecological environment is clean, he stressed the need to make the best use of the conditions favorable for the fish breeding and aquiculture and thus make the country proudly rank itself among the advanced countries in the offshore fish breeding and aquiculture.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that well begun is half done and the farm has made a good start, calling on it not to give up offshore salmon breeding halfway with depression and hesitation but dynamically push ahead with it in order to implement the behest of leader Kim Jong Il and live up to the expectation of the people without fail. He encouraged the officials and employees of the farm, promising to settle everything arising in the work of the unit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had a photo session with officials and employees of Unit 810 of the KPA, Sokmak Atlantic Salmon Breed-Fish Ground and Raksan Offshore Salmon Fish Farm.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Hwang Pyong So, Ri Jae Il, Jo Yong Won and Jang Chang Hwa."

This is an unprecedented human rights abuse, an act of national discrimination and an unpardonable provocation against the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The General Association of Koreans in China and all Koreans in China bitterly denounce the brutal arrest of officials of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon). \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries should properly understand the will of the whole Korean nation and behave themselves. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean nation which still bear grudge against the Japanese imperialists, the sworn enemy, will certainly force them to pay for the blood shed by Koreans and for the crimes they are still committing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese authorities should clearly see the daily mounting hostility of Koreans towards Japan and stop at once the reckless anti-DPRK and anti-Chongryon moves and release the arrested officials of Chongryon immediately. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They have to make an unconditional apology for the unprecedented violence against humanity."
