            "content": "U.S. Accused of Its Rampant Gun-related Crimes\r\n Pyongyang, August 10 (KCNA) -- Mass Shootings Tracker, a website in the U.S., made public the number of gun-related crimes that occurred throughout the U.S. this year.\n\t\t\t\t\t According to it, 210 gun-related crimes had taken place in the U.S. for the 212 days from January to July this year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This number seems to sharply contrast with the actual number of gun-related crimes in the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Americans are living in extreme uneasiness and fear due to a series of gun-related crimes occurring on a daily basis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For example, three gun-related crimes on a daily average were reported in New York in 2013.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In New York police troops are deployed more densely than in any other cities as it is awash with headquarters of financial giants and monopolies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, its daily gun-related crimes numbered three. This might help one easily guess the number of gun-related crimes throughout the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t And one cannot but be skeptical about only one crime on a daily average in the U.S. cited by the above-said website.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., a cesspool of robbers, is a corrupt and ailing society under the reign of mammonism and the jungle law. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Cases of murder and robbery can never decrease but increase in that country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In 2013 when Obama announced a proposal for gun control, the first of its kind, public demand for guns drastically increased, which led to production of 10.8 million small guns or more than twice 4.5 million in the year before.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Increase in gun production and purchase inevitably leads to rampant gun-related crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is well illustrated by the analysis of 2008-2012 gun-related crimes published by the VPC, a non-profit body in the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to it, there occurred in that period 1,108 cases of gun-related murders of self-defense (just 2.5 percent) while those of heinous gun-related crimes numbered 42,419 (97.5 percent).\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This indicates that guns possessed by Americans are used mostly for robbery and killings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The number of hooligans is on the steady increase and more than three hundred million guns are in the hands of Americans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Therefore, it doesn't make sense that only one gun-related crime occurred in the U.S. every day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The curtailed number of gun-related crimes released by the above-said U.S. website is no more than fraud to cover up the worst human rights abuses in the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The website published statistics after specifying only the \"cases that left more than 4 people injured\" as shooting spree.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to this false statistics, the actual number of gun-related crimes in the U.S. sounds \"less terrible.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Worse still, the U.S. administration regards the \"case in which more than three are killed by shooting\" as a shooting spree.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a result, even the case in which many people are hurt and one or two of them are killed by a criminal is not recognized as a shooting spree.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is just the American criterion for judging social vices and dealing with human rights performance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This not withstanding, the U.S., with this brazen-faced and twisted criterion, has painted wrong pictures of other countries where genuine human rights are ensured, describing them as \"human rights abusers\", while embellishing its worst human rights abuses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With no rhetoric can the U.S. put under the carpet its worst human rights abuses."
