            "content": "Disgraceful act\r\n   Pyongyang, February 1 (KCNA) -- Japanese Prime Minister Hashimoto at \"talks\" with  Kim Young Sam some time ago agreed to maintain a \"cooperation system\" to do harm to the DPRK at the request of the South Korean puppets, according to a report.\r\n   If the Japanese authorities have a sincere intention to normalize relations with the DPRK, they must neither read another's face nor dance to another's tune but boldly rectify the hostile policy toward the DPRK and make a decisive resolution to liquidate the past, says Rodong Sinmun in a commentary today.  The daily goes on:\r\n   Kim Young Sam's trip to Japan was aimed at keeping Japan from normalizing relations with the DPRK in step with the active movements for the improvement of DPRK-U.S. relations. The Japanese authorities' agreement to this request of the South Korean puppets shows what their intention to \"Normalize relations with the DPRK\" is like.\r\n   By the maintenance of the \"cooperation system\" the Japanese authorities mean to intensify the manoeuvres against the DPRK, aboard the same boat with the South Korean puppets.\r\n   Japan dreams of becoming a political power and advocates \"independent diplomacy\". It is disgraceful for this country to dance to the tune of the south Korean puppets. By doing so, Japan is trying to win them over and use them as henchmen for its reinvasion of Korea.\r\n   If Japan continues to pursue a hostile policy to the DPRK, dancing to the tune of the South Korean puppets, it will get nothing but scorn and criticism from people around the world. The Japanese authorities would be well-advised to behave themselves, deeply mindful of this. \r\n \r\n"

The pamphlet in its preface said:\r\n   Secretary Kim Jong Il made public his historic work on December 25, 1995. \r\n   He in his work says that the history of the world socialist movement provides the serious lesson that a revolution advances victoriously when revolutionary forefathers are respected and their accomplishments are preserved and developed, and that a revolution is abandoned and frustrated when revolutionary predecessors are betrayed and their accomplishments are negated.  He further says:\r\n   Our people respect the revolutionaries of the previous generations as their revolutionary seniors, set great store by their spirit and achievements in the struggle, and are carrying faithfully forward and developing the revolutionary cause pioneered by them. This is a basic factor that ensures the steady, triumphant development of our revolution even in the most complex situations. \r\n\r\n"
