            "content": "Rodong Sinmun Terms U.S. Worst Human Rights Abuser \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 8 (KCNA) --The Bush ruling quarters legalized the setting up of secret prisons and harsh methods of interrogation and cruel torture. This is a very dangerous action to legally revive fascism and establish a fascist system in the U.S.  It is, therefore, the most cursed empire of evil and the worst human rights abuser in the 21st century.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bush recently signed \"2006 U.S. Defense Authorization Bill\" allowing the setting up of secret prisons and harsh methods of interrogation of \"suspected terrorists\" and Cheney asserted that such torture as dunking \"suspected terrorists\" is necessary.\r\n There are many countries in the world but the U.S. is the only country that legalizes the setting up of secret prisons and allows the brutal methods of interrogation and openly permits cruel torture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the Second World War fascist Germany won an ill-fame for operating a lot of concentration camps and prisons not only at home but in other European countries under its occupation and arrested everyone opposed to its fascist system, irrespective of nationality, and brutally tortured and killed them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is perpetrating the same horrible fascist crimes in the new century.\r\n As already disclosed, the U.S. built up secret prisons in European countries and operated them in a cunning manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The vicious human rights abuses such as maltreatment, torture and killings of those detained in the prisons of the U.S. forces including the prison of the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo are little short of atrocities committed by the fascist German law-enforcement agents. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush group has walked away, lured and abducted anti-U.S. figures and combatants in all the regions of the world to which it has stretched its tentacles before throwing them into secret prisons. They cruelly interrogated and tortured and even sent them to military tribunals as they pleased in a bid to crack down upon the anti-American forces and calm down the anti-U.S. sentiment worldwide.\r\n History will sternly punish the U.S. for its human rights abuses.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It warned that the \"Intelligence Service\" will be held fully accountable for the consequences if its operation to falsify facts is confirmed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also urged the conservative media to stop at once spreading misinformation intended to falsify truth by use of stereotyped phraseology of \"spy ring case.\"\r\n At the end of the press conference, the participants and families of the victims of the \"case\" submitted to the Seoul District Prosecutor's Office an indictment exposing the injustice of the \"spy ring case\" and the false propaganda. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, 14 media organizations of south Korea called a press conference in Seoul on Nov. 3 to denounce the desperate agitation offensive launched by the conservative media over the \"spy ring case\" cooked up by the \"Intelligence Service.\"    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It should, therefore, develop into a nation-wide struggle without fail.\r\n All the Koreans' turnout in the above-said movement is an important issue in pulling through difficulties and achieving independent reunification, peace against war and great national unity. There will be a bright prospect of independent reunification when all the Koreans turn out in the movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans at home and abroad are called upon to stage a more dynamic patriotic movement for independent reunification, peace against war and great national unity with firm conviction and optimism about national reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
