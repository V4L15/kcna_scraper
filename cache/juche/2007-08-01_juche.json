On this occasion, the Korean people are looking back with deep emotion upon her brilliant life which was dedicated to the cause of building the Juche-oriented army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Firmly convinced that only Songun was the way for the liberation of the country and the freedom and happiness of the people, she exerted all her efforts to uphold President Kim Il Sung's idea of attaching importance to arms at the dawn of the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She handed over to her son two pistols left by his father Kim Hyong Jik. The pistols were associated with the father's firm will that the country should be won back without fail generation after generation. She devoted herself to implementing the President's line on armed struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She organized and mobilized members of the anti-Japanese women's association to secure military uniforms, shoes, supplies and others for the Anti-Japanese People's Guerilla Army and looked after the lodging and boarding of the youth people who came from various areas to fight with arms in their hands. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Seeing the reliable figures of guerillas just after the foundation of the first Juche-oriented revolutionary armed force of the Korean people and stroking this or that rifle, she said in earnest: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"I am proud of you. Now we have our own army! That's what we needed. You must destroy the Japanese and win back the country without fail.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Prior to the expedition to south Manchuria, the President came home to inquire after his sick mother. She, with the lofty intention, did not scruple to send him to the Songun revolutionary struggle, saying that a man with the determination to win back the ruined country should think of the country and people above the apprehension for household affairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President had kept the lofty image of the upright mother on the day in his mind as one of a teacher. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President, always remembering the words and last image of his mother, accomplished the historic cause of national liberation through the protracted bloody anti-Japanese war and built a powerful socialist country, independent in politics, self-supporting in economy and self-reliant in national defense.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In other word, it is intended to realize its ambition to dominate the world by exercising high-handed military power. To this end, it is pushing ahead with the arms buildup and straining the situation under the signboard of coping with a \"new threat\" and \"new challenge.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those countries with their sovereignty being exposed to the grave threat by the U.S. are channeling great efforts into bolstering their military power. If a country is to beat back U.S. aggression, it should have in place military means strong enough to cope with it. Many counties are, therefore, increasing investment in the field of national defence. Now dozens of countries are keen to have access to nukes worldwide. This fact alone clearly indicates that the U.S. arms buildup is sparking a new arms race, a nuclear arms race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With nothing can the U.S. hide its true colors as a chieftain of the global arms race. The U.S. would be well advised to stop the adventurous arms buildup and moves to provoke a war swimming against the trend of the times.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is unthinkable apart from Songun politics of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK's Songun politics is one resolutely safeguarding the sovereignty and dignity of the country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Regarding it as the paramount issue of principle for defending the supreme interests of the state and the basic interests of the revolution to safeguard the sovereignty and dignity of the country and the nation, this policy relentlessly strikes back any attempt to provoke or infringe upon the sovereignty and dignity of the DPRK, without the slightest concession and compromise. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Songun is, immediately, independence and dignity. It is owing to the great Songun politics that no one dares provoke the dignity of the DPRK and the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The WPK's Songun politics is the one solving all the problems arising in the revolution and construction in its own way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Basing itself on the principle of independence, the WPK decisively rejects the interference and pressure of any outsiders and resolves all the questions arising in the revolution and construction in its own way in conformity with the interests of the Korean revolution and the situation of the country, not wedded to any ready-made theory and formula. This is why the WPK's Songun politics is the most authoritative and viable politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK gives a steadfast continuity to independence in the external relations, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It resolves all the problems arising in external relations fairly and squarely in accordance with its opinion and will. In the international arena, the DPRK pushes through its intention, saying what it wants to say, neither reading other's face nor bound by any fetters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Songun politics of the WPK is the most steadfast politics of independence which makes it possible to highly display the dignity of the nation and bring only brilliant victories.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Imperialists' Disintegration Strategy Assailed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 31 (KCNA) -- The countries and peoples struggling for independence should clearly see through the reactionary nature and danger of the imperialists' moves to disorganize them from within and cope with these moves with sharp vigilance today when the imperialists are still persisting in them, urges Rodong Sinmun in a signed article Tuesday, which reads in part: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists are getting more desperate in their attempts to establish their domination over and commit looting in the anti-imperialist independent countries and those situated at strategic vantages. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a hackneyed strategy of the imperialists to disintegrate the progressive countries from within. They run the whole gamut of means and ways to apply this strategy against the anti-imperialist independent countries. They resort to an extensive smear campaign and false propaganda against the political systems, policies and leadership of those countries which do not meekly obey them in an effort to whittle away confidence in the leadership. And they employ non-governmental organizations to give money to ideologically wavering people so they may blight society, violating the state law and orders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is typical of this strategy these days is to drive a wedge between political forces in order to divide them and set them at each other's throats. These maneuvers of the imperialists give rise to disputes between political forces and complicated situation in no small number of countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists also resort to the stratagem of sowing the seed of discord and creating antagonism between different nationalities, races and religious sects under one state system for their internal disintegration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There will be grave consequences if high vigilance is not maintained against the imperialists' moves to disorganize other countries from within and they are not thwarted in advance. Former socialist countries collapsed because their peoples were fooled by the imperialists' disintegration strategy.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Por eso, muchos paises aumentan la inversion en el sector de defensa nacional. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Actualmente, en el ambito mundial llegan a decenas los paises que tratan de poseer las armas nucleares.
