            "content": "National Meeting Marks 64th Birthday of DPRK\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, September 8 (KCNA) -- A national meeting was held at the April 25 House of Culture on Saturday to celebrate the 64th birthday of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t Present there were senior party, state and army officials including Kim Yong Nam, Choe Yong Rim and Choe Ryong Hae, officials of the party, armed forces, power organs, social organizations, ministries and national institutions, chairpersons of friendly parties, servicepersons of the Korean People's Army and the Korean People's Internal Security Forces, officials in the fields of science, education, literature and arts, public health and media, labor innovators and other people in Pyongyang. Overseas compatriots and the chief of the Pyongyang mission of the Anti-imperialist National Democratic Front also attended.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Present there on invitation were diplomatic envoys of different countries, members of the military attaches corps and representatives of international organizations here and foreign guests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Choe Yong Rim, member of the Presidium of the Political Bureau of the C.C., the Workers' Party of Korea and premier of the DPRK Cabinet, made a report.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The founding of the DPRK on Sept. 9, 1948 by President Kim Il Sung was a solemn declaration of the birth of people's Korea, the first people's country in the colonial East, and a great event which opened a new era of building the socialist state centered on the popular masses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The founding of the DPRK made the country which had been eclipsed on the world map emerge as a legitimate independent and sovereign state in the international arena and enabled the Korean people to become masters of the country and the society for the first time in the history. It also helped them have a powerful political weapon to victoriously accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Leader Kim Jong Il who remained loyal to the President's idea and cause of nation-building put forth the original theory of nation-building based on the revolutionary outlook on the leader and led the drive for carrying them out, thus strengthening the DPRK into the country of the President in name and reality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il made sure that Kim Il Sung was held in high esteem as the eternal President of the DPRK and led the efforts to solve all the problems arising in nation-building and activities the way the President did and as intended by him. This was a distinguished feat that provided a firm guarantee for glorifying the DPRK as the state of Kim Il Sung and accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche to the last.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il put forward the Songun politics as the basic political mode of the DPRK in the most grim period of the Korean revolution and established the state mechanism with a main emphasis on national defence. He also increased the nation's capabilities and smashed the imperialists' moves for aggression, thereby firmly defending the destiny of the country and the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The dear respected Kim Jong Un named patriotism personally showed by Kim Jong Il on the road of devotion to defending the country and the prosperity Kim Jong Il's patriotism and aroused the army and the people to embody it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean people will meet vicious challenges and obstructions of anti-reunification forces at home and abroad and certainly achieve the historic cause of the country's reunification by the concerted efforts of all compatriots under the banner of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and the October 4 declaration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the principled stand and firm will of the DPRK to answer the provocation and the war for aggression with immediate counter-attack and the sacred and just war for the country's reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If a war breaks out again on this land against the will of the Koreans due to the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppet forces, the army and the people of the DPRK will not miss the chance but promptly deal deadly blows at them and lead it to a sacred war for national reunification. By doing so, they will realize the greatest desire of the nation and remove the stronghold of imperialism from the earth, the reporter concluded."

He expressed this view at the budget committee of the House of Councilors on Aug. 27.\n\t\t\t\t\t This was a barbarous action of rubbing salt into the wounds of the victims of the sexual slavery which still remain unhealed though a long period has passed since then and, at the same time, a dastardly act to hide the issue of the sexual slavery at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese imperialists forcibly took away women of different countries including 200 000 Korean women to their battlefields for aggression and committed all sorts of sordid acts against them, mercilessly violating their dignity. These crimes have already been disclosed before the whole world through the historical data, witnesses and victims' testimonies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kono made the above-said statement at a time when Japan was in a position not to dodge the blame any longer as the issue of sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army was under hot discussion worldwide and there were growing voices demanding its official apology and reparation for the crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This being a hard historical fact, Japan is trying hard to retract Kono's statement nearly 20 years later, stunning the world community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such action is a reckless one intended to totally deny the sexual slavery, discarding even the spurious signboard of inheriting Kono's statement though Japan has so far put up ostensively.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is not the first time that Japan expressed its intention to retract his statement, displeased with it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"Dietmen's League for Japan's future and education in history\", Japan's right-wing conservative body, asserted the need to verify the statement, claiming that the statement reflects the view of an individual and there are not a few Dietmen who are skeptical about it and it is good to let the new chief Cabinet secretary issue a statement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is nothing but part of a sinister trick to keep its past crimes buried into oblivion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said sexual slavery was the unprecedented organized and institutional crime against humanity as it was perpetrated by Japan with government and military power involved, pursuant to its war-time state policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how desperately the Japanese reactionaries may try to whitewash the crime-woven past and cover up their sexual slavery, the worst human traffic in the 20th century, this is a historical fact which can neither be ignored nor written off.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That is why not only Asian countries but the rest of the world consider this as serious crimes and strongly demand Japan make an apology and reparation for its crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is an extremely abnormal thing that the above-said crimes of Japan remain unsettled even in the new century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's stance towards this issue sharply contrasts with the attitude of some countries including Germany towards the reparation for their past wrongdoings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan will always remain a brazen-faced country in history and in the eyes of mankind as long as it is unwilling to redress its past crimes."

General of the Japanese army who was director of the academy said that \"Okamoto was a man rare to be found even among Japanese as he was so devoted and loyal to the emperor of Japan.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The history records the facts that Park served as officer of the Imperial Japanese Army, shouting: \"I vow to fall down like cherry flowers\". He participated in more than 110 \"punitive operations\" against patriots of Korea, earning an ill-fame as \"commander of the Okamoto shock brigade\".  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the defeat of the Japanese imperialists, Park disguised himself as a stooge of the U.S. imperialists after vowing to \"share his destiny with the Stars and Stripes.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He as a special agent demonstrated his skill in putting down the soldiers mutiny in Ryosu waged by patriotic soldiers of south Korea in 1948. He brutally suppressed the people's struggle for the country's reunification in south Korea after the April 19 Popular Uprising. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When south Korean people turned out in a nation-wide struggle for the country's reunification in May 1961, loudly shouting \"Let us go to the north, come to the south and meet at Panmunjom!\" the Park military junta arrested, detained and killed more than 130 000 patriotic people, dissolved 23 political parties and 238 social organizations and forcibly closed many media organizations in less than one month. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Yusin dictator Park blustered \"he could never pardon anyone freely talking about unification as tragedy of unification is bigger than that of division.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He fabricated the criminal \"south Korea-Japan agreement\" with the Japanese reactionaries, bringing again Japanese aggressor forces, his old masters, to south Korea. He thus threw greater obstacles in the way of the country's reunification and reducing south Korea to a dual colony of the U.S. and Japan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This cannot but be a tragedy of history and shame on the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"yusin system\" should be judged down through generations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, south Korea is now witnessing such tragedy as praising Park and whitewashing the \"yusin\" dictatorship. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Running in the vein of the \"Saenuri Party\" is the blood of \"the yusin\" dictator steeped in fascist dictatorship, treachery and anti-reunification crimes.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean nation still remains divided into two though nearly 70 years have passed since its split. This is attributable to the successive descendants of such despicable \"yusin\" in power who have worked hard to perpetuate the division and pursued confrontation with compatriots, colluding with outside forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Consequently, the Korean nation has lost decades in its development, suffering untold hardships, misfortune, sacrifices and losses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The remnants of \"yusin\" who stake their fate on the forthcoming \"presidential election\" are making desperate efforts to realize their dirty scenario to stay in power. The clan of the \"Saenuri Party\" is keen to cover up its true colors as despicable traitors under the motto of \"revamping.\" But its sycophantic and unpopular nature can never change no matter how many times it may disguise itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Unless the ultra-right conservative forces greedy for power are ousted, the north-south confrontation will be escalated and a war is bound to break out, much less expecting the realization of the aspiration of the people for progress and reforms in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nation should force the \"yusin\" dictators, predecessors of the \"Saenuri Party\", to pay for all their monstrous crimes committed in the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the Koreans will never allow the appearance of the second \"yusin regime\" in south Korea."

Corea, Primer Presidente del Comite de Defensa Nacional de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea y Comandante Supremo del Ejercito Popular de Corea, recorrio con su esposa   Ri Sol Ju el Parque Folclorico de Pyongyang a punto de inauguracion. \n\t\t\t\t\tEl Parque, enclavado en un vasto terreno alrededor de las ruinas del Palacio Real Anhak del monte Paektu, es un museo de historia al aire libre que permite ver y experimentar directamente la historia de la nacion coreana y sus costumbres.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe divide en la zona de educacion general en la historia, la de exposicion de vestigios historicos, la contemporanea, la folclorica, la de juegos folcloricos, la de parques de los montes Paektu y Kumgang y la de administracion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Mariscal recibio el parte sobre la finalizacion exitosa de la construccion del Parque y recorrio varios lugares. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la zona de educacion general en la historia, situada en la entrada del Parque, vio la tabla grafica en forma de pintura mural de gran tamano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa excelente nacionalidad la adquirio el pueblo coreano en el largo periodo historico de su desarrollo independiente, dijo el Mariscal y agrego que cuando lo sepan bien, las generaciones venideras podran guardar en lo profundo del corazon el espiritu de dar primacia a la nacion coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la zona de exposicion de vestigios historicos paso revista a los dibujos y chozas que muestran la vida de los hombres primitivos, la tumba de Tangun, los dolmenes y el punal de forma de Pipha (instrumento musical coreano parecido a mandolin) de la era de Cojoson (Corea Antigua), la tumba del rey Tongmyong, la lapida del Mausoleo del rey Kwanggaetho y la pagoda del templo Kumgang de la era de Coguryo, la pagoda del templo Miruk de Paekje, la del templo Hwangryong de Silla y la lampara de piedra de Sanggyong del periodo de Palhae. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLlegado a la zona contemporanea, el Mariscal vio de cerca y de lejos las miniaturas de la Plaza      Kim Il Sung, el Palacio de Estudio del Pueblo, el Museo de la Revolucion Coreana, el Teatro de Arte Mansudae, el Complejo Hidraulico del Mar Oeste, etc. escuchando con satisfaccion que han sido corregidos los defectos senalados por el durante su visita realizada en enero pasado. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tViendo la maqueta de la casa natal del Dirigente Kim Jong Il en el campamento secreto del monte Paektu, resalto la necesidad de plantar los arboles adecuados al edificio para reproducir el ambiente periferico y demarcar bien los edificios.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnte la miniatura del Museo de la Revolucion Coreana, dijo que los visitantes al lugar pensaran primero en las estatuas de bronce de los Generalisimos Kim Il Sung y Kim Jong Il en la colina Mansu y apunto que deben instalarlas aqui tambien y describir mejor los conjuntos escultoricos de temas secundarios. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay que acondicionar Phanmunjom, simbolo de division nacional, para que los visitantes redoblen la decision de reunificar sin falta la patria en nuestra generacion, puntualizo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Parque Folclorico tiene gran dimension y por eso, hay que construir la Exposicion Permanente de las Tres Revoluciones, el Teatro del Pueblo y otros edificios nuevos o faltantes, indico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la zona folclorica, se mostro satisfecho de que se hayan reconstruido in statu quo los edificios arquitectonicos representativos de la era primitiva, Cojoson y la edad media y de los periodos de Coguryo y Coryo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEntrado en el edificio gubernamental de Coguryo, el Mariscal aprecio que este edificio se ha construido bien en el principio historicista, diciendo que si colocan en la entrada las miniaturas de soldados en uniforme militar de Cocuyo, los visitantes podran imaginar la sociedad de aquel entonces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLuego, el Mariscal recorrio el Museo Folklorico de Corea trasladado al Parque Folclorico de Pyongyang. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDespues de pasar por el Palacio de Palhae, vio las reliquias historicas descubiertas en el curso de construccion por los militares de la gran unidad combinada 630 del EPC participantes en la obra y los bosquejos creados por ellos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn este parque a punto de inauguracion, se me hace mas fuerte la anoranza al General Kim Jong Il, dijo y agrego que cuan magnifico habria sido, si hubiese venido con el que propuso personalmente la obra. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDestaco la necesidad de gestionar bien el parque para infundir en los habitantes, los jovenes y ninos escolares el espiritu Juche y la nacionalidad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs preciso construir la zona mundial para que los visitantes puedan ver los edificios arquitectonicos de varios paises del mundo y tomar ricos conocimientos sobre la historia y las tradiciones de los paises extranjeros, enseno. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEse dia, el Mariscal vio el concierto con pipiritanas \"Cancion de defensa a ultranza al lider interpretada dirigiendose al Palacio del Sol de Kumsusan\", ofrecido por los militares de la gran unidad combinada 630 del EPC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Mariscal expreso agradecimiento del Comandante Supremo del EPC a esa unidad, que en la construccion del parque, puso de pleno manifiesto el espiritu revolucionario de los militares y el de materializacion a ultranza, calificandola del gran destacamento que realizo brillantes meritos laborales en el frente avanzado de la construccion socialista. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl fue acompanado en esta ocasion por Choe Ryong Hae, Jang Song Thaek, Kim Jong Gak,
