It also manifested its official position calling for the abrogation of the \"NSL.\"\r\n   With the \"NSL\" left unscrapped, freedom and genuine democracy and human rights can never be ensured in South Korea, nor can inter-Korean reconciliation and confidence be achieved.\r\n   The U.S. policy of maintaining its military presence in South Korea and supporting the \"NSL\" is obstructive to defusing military confrontation on the Korean peninsula and achieving its reunification.\r\n   The United States wants to execute its Asia strategy, persistently taking hold of South Korea as its colony and military strategic foothold. It is an invariable design of the United States. What is important in its design is to stifle the DPRK by military force and dominate the whole of Korea. For this purpose, the United States has reinforced armed forces, strengthened its occupation and escalated military exercises in South Korea.\r\n   If the United States truly hopes for peace and stability on and around the Korean peninsula, it should do something favorable to Korean reunification.\r\n   Doing so is in the interests of the United States.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

That is why the Korean people call the train a \"Train for the People.\"\r\n   General Kim Jong Il made sure that the train used by the president is preserved as a relic on display in the Kumsusan Memorial Palace. The train on display was made best by General Kim Jong Il.\r\n   In Juche 63 (1974) he was resolved to make a new train in which the President could board and lodge and have consultative meetings and talks. And he planned a model and  compasing of the train and directed its manufacture. He worked heart and soul to have the train built with no vibration in any railway condition and suitable to the taste of the president who always enjoyed a simple life. The train was manufactured on the occasion of the 70th birth anniversary of the President in Juche 71 (1982).\r\n   Examining the speed of the train and its equipment and technology, General Kim Jong Il said that he did not feel relieved whenever the President visited foreign countries by plane but from now he felt at ease. And he noted with satisfaction that his wish came true and that the President would feel more comfortable.\r\n   Thus, the train is associated with the deep loyalty and filial piety of General Kim Jong Il to the President.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
