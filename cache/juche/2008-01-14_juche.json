The advantages and the invincible might of socialism are guaranteed by the socialist idea. Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The socialist society is the one which develops by dint of the might of ideology and the independent and creative activities of the people who are armed with socialist idea, quite different from all the preceding societies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The consolidation and development of the socialist society and its destiny depend on how to conduct ideological work and prepare the people ideologically. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The victorious advance of the cause of socialism would be unthinkable without the development in depth of the socialist theory and unremitting ideological work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nothing is more primary and important than the ideological education for the party struggling for the cause of socialism and it is a fundamental requirement for defending socialism and victoriously advancing it to hold fast to the ideological education as a lifeline. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an invariable aim of the imperialists and the reactionaries to completely obliterate socialism on the earth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The confrontation between socialism and imperialism is, in essence, the confrontation between the two ideologies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The struggle to shatter imperialists' cunning and tenacious bourgeois ideological and cultural poisoning at present is an ideological confrontation with imperialism and war without gun-fire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historical lesson drawn from socialist construction and the reality show that it is an important issue related to the fate of socialism and its future to firmly arm the people with socialist ideology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history of socialist construction of the people of the DPRK is the great history in which they have firmly defended the ideological and cultural front of Juche and steadily strengthened it while smashing the imperialists' ideological and cultural poisoning and their psychological warfare. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people of the DPRK are dynamically advancing along the road of socialism under the uplifted banner of the great Juche idea and Songun idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The socialist ideology, life of socialism, will win a final victory.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
