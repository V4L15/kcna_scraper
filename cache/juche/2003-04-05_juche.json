They unleashed the war for the reason that Iraq \"sponsored terrorism\" and proliferated \"mass destruction weapons\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But what they really seek is to set up a pro-U.S. regime in Iraq and seize its abundant oil resources and, therefore, put the world economy under their control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the termination of the cold war the United States has been engaged in high-handed practice in the international arena, terming those nations out of favor with it \"axis of evil\" and \"sponsors of terrorism\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When it ignited the Iraqi war, it left the United Nations out of account. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts indicate that the U.S. military action has no justification.    \r\n\r\n"

It is open secret that the DPRK is the next target of U.S. attack after the Iraqi war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The madcap large-scale joint military exercises staged in South Korea against the north suggest that the U.S. may provoke a war of aggression against the DPRK in the near future. The national assembly's passage of the motion on the troop dispatch against this backdrop is little short of encouraging the U.S. in its moves to invade the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean authorities and politicians will certainly be cursed and condemned by the nation for considering foreign forces as more important than the nation and being more interested in \"cooperation\" with foreign forces than in national cooperation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Washington declared that it would apply sanctions against the DPRK for this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is nothing but a ridiculous and unjustifiable action that does not deserve even a passing note as it is Washington's trite trick to charge the DPRK with missile proliferation and nuclear development and put international political and diplomatic pressure upon it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the missile issue is concerned, the DPRK has not acceded to the missile technology control regime and, therefore, it is an independent sovereign state which is not legally bound to anything in terms of missile export and the transfer of its technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., ignorant of such elementary principle of international law and common sense, unreasonably accused the DPRK of violating this regime. This only indicates that the u.s. is a de facto lawless state that defies international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. action is little short of admitting itself that it is a rogue state which interprets law as it pleases and imposes its view on value upon those countries which incur its displeasure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Explicitly speaking, it is an indisputable sovereign right of the DPRK to produce and deploy missiles to protect its sovereignty and supreme interests and export them to other countries within the framework of normal military cooperation and exchange. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's missile program is of strictly peaceful and defensive nature and it, therefore, does not pose any threat to those countries which respect the sovereignty of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration had better have a proper view on other countries of the world before talking about sanctions against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. have used thousands of weapons of mass-destruction including tomahawk cruise missile in the Iraqi war, reducing cities and villages in Iraq, a sovereign state, to ashes and killing innocent civilians. The U.S., the chieftain of such typical state-sponsored terrorism, is, however, calling for applying sanctions against the DPRK. This is like a thief crying \"stop the thief\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration should clearly know that it will never succeed in diverting elsewhere the international community's condemnation of the U.S. and its war no matter what sanctions it may apply against the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
