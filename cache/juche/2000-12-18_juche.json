And the revolutionary commanding system and military discipline have been established and the strong sense of organization and discipline has prevailed within the people's army. All these would have been unthinkable without his distinguished leadership ability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Benevolent and army-first politics is his peculiar political mode. What attracts particular attention is the policy of giving priority to the army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He is, indeed, an ideal statesman and fascinating leader perfectly possessed of literary and military accomplishments. \r\n\r\n"

It is the trend of the times to demand the reunification of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We have had the proposal for reunification by a federal means which enjoys full support and sympathy at home and abroad. The proposal conforms with the interests of the countries surrounding Korea and the desire of the world peace-loving people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Peace and reunification of Korea is a pressing issue directly related to peace and stability of the Asia-pacific region. The United States and those countries should clearly see the developments on the Korean peninsula and act with discretion. They should do nothing harmful to the reunification of Korea, though they do not make a substantial contribution to it. \r\n\r\n"

The film tells a true story about a security officer who on a train detects an enemy spy infiltrating into Pyongyang  to destabilize the socialist system and dies a heroic death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The film \"Son Comes Back Home\" portrays a soldier of the Korean People's Security Forces who is arrested by the enemy while drifting about in rough storm in the sea on military duty but remains true to his revolutionary faith and comes back to the homeland. The film \"White Smoke\" depicts a young researcher who succeeds in his study of an important subject related to the power production at a thermo-power plant. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"A Soldier with No Epaulette,\" \"Wives of Officers\" and other feature films are of great cognitional and educational significance as they represent those who think of others more than themselves and devote themselves to society and the collective. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many other films portray young people who give a steadfast continuity to the revolution. \r\n\r\n"
