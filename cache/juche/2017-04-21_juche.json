They are crying out for settling the issue with the help of someone, seeking to bring nuclear aircraft carrier strike groups one after another to the waters off the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such intimidation and blackmail can never frighten the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The invincible revolutionary Paektusan army, closely following the maneuvers of the U.S., is waiting for an order only after rounding off its full preparedness to counter them immediately.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is an unshakable will of the DPRK to go to the end if the U.S. wants to remain unchanged in its confrontational stance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army of the DPRK has already clarified that its heaviest counteractions include a sudden preemptive attack involving maneuvers on the ground, in seas, under waters and in the air and various other methods and the Korean-style tough counter-actions will be promptly taken to cope with the provocations of any forms and levels from the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world will clearly witness this time the fact that gone are the days never to return when the U.S. forced its will upon other countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK, a peace-loving socialist state, is setting great store by peace. But it neither fears a war nor wants to avoid it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is a nuclear power capable of countering any option and means of the U.S. and will not avoid any option made by it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the DPRK had access to a powerful nuclear deterrent to protect itself from the U.S. nuclear threat, the DPRK will react to a total war with an all-out war, a nuclear war with nuclear strikes of its own style and surely win a victory in the death-defying struggle against the U.S. imperialists."

They have gone desperate while talking about intensive large-scale joint exercises together with the U.S. nuclear carrier task force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying the present situation proves that the U.S. and the puppet forces are a kingpin seriously threatening and harassing the peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and the region and that they are war fanatics obsessed with provocation and aggression, the spokesman clarified the following stand:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a peace-loving socialist state, the DPRK values and loves peace more than anyone else but is neither afraid of war nor is going to avert it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will not rule out any special option in order to defend peace on the Korean peninsula and the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has to understand that it is not only the U.S. that is invested with option, and it should be serious in making the final option at a crucial moment decisive of the destiny of the American empire.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will bolster up the nuclear deterrence for justice in every way to foil the U.S. high-handed and arbitrary practices and thus more reliably defend the sovereignty of the country, the right to existence of the nation and the peace and security of the Korean peninsula and the region."

Y se portan insolentemente picoteando que desarrollarian un intenso entrenamiento conjunto de gran envergadura junto con la flotilla de portaaviones nuclear norteamericano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa situacion actual deja conocer claramente que EE.UU. y los titeres surcoreanos son autores que amenazan y perturban gravemente la paz y estabilidad de la Peninsula Coreana y la region y los maniacos de guerra enloquecidos por la provocacion y agresion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC, Estado socialista amante de la paz, aprecia y ama mas que otros la paz, pero no teme jamas la guerra ni quiere evitarla.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi necesitan para preservar la paz de la Peninsula Coreana y la region, el ejercito y el pueblo coreanos no vacilaran en tomar todas las opciones especiales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe tener presente de que el derecho a opcion no lo tiene solo el, y tiene que hacer una seria opcion ultima en el momento importante en que se decidira el destino de imperio americano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito y el pueblo coreanos fortaleceran por todos los medios su disuasivo nuclear justo para destruir el despotismo y arbitrariedad de EE.UU. y defenderan mas fidedignamente la soberania del pais, el derecho a subsistencia de la nacion y la paz y la seguridad de la Peninsula Coreana y la region."
