It has thus laid a stumbling block in the way of the Koreans' movement for national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said declarations are programmes for reunification common to the nation as they clarified the fundamental principle for developing the north-south relations and ways for doing so.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently the south Korean rulers talked about \"dialogue,\" claiming that \"they have never denied them\" for fear that they may be held accountable for the bedeviled north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group has committed too hideous crimes to redress them with a few words of excuses. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No sooner had the conservative Lee Myung Bak regime come to power in south Korea than the cooperation projects for national reconciliation, unity and reunification, which had been brisk in all fields including politics, economy, military affairs and culture and the inter-Korean relations, which had favorably developed, were brought to suspension overnight.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The farce for \"total reexamination of the policy toward the north\" was staged and the story about \"the lost decade\" and the theory of \"preemptive strike\" designating fellow countrymen as \"principal enemy\" were openly advocated. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was none other than the Lee group which took part in co-sponsoring the \"resolution on the human rights issue in north Korea\" aimed at doing harm to fellow countrymen on the international arena and begged the U.S. not to delist the DPRK as a \"state sponsor of terrorism.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is due to this group that the north-south relations have been brought back to those before the publication of the June 15 joint declaration at present and the nationwide reunification movement that had advanced under the banner of \"By our nation itself\" is facing a stern trial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With nothing can the Lee group redeem the huge crimes it has committed against the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group is now jabbering that \"it is now willing to properly start the south-north relations, though it is hard to do so, in order to have solid ones.\" This is aimed to evade punishment by history as it is nothing but shameless nonsense.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration serve as groundwork for developing the north-south relations. Even the slightest improvement of the above-said relations is unthinkable unless there is a proper stand and attitude toward them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite illogical to talk about \"the improvement of the relations\" without adhering to the fundamental principle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t How ridiculous it is to trumpet about \"dialogue\" while hiding a dagger behind one's belt.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such form of \"dialogue\" would produce nothing constructive.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is because such nonsense was talked by those who stood against national harmony and scuttled the dialogue themselves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their rhetoric about \"dialogue\" and \"cooperation\" is little short of putting up a precondition for renewed campaign for confrontation with the DPRK. It is clearly evidenced by their grumbling that the DPRK is not responding with \"sincerity\" to their call for \"dialogue\" and \"cooperation.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities' anachronistic confrontational policy is facing total bankruptcy and the anti-reunification forces are being driven into a tight corner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee regime's political gambling on which it stakes the fate of the nation has touched off censure not only among the Koreans at home and abroad but of the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group is trying to find a way out of its political crisis in the so-called \"improved policy toward the north\" but it will get the group nowhere. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With nothing can the group of traitors evade the responsibility for having thrown a stumbling block in the way of national reconciliation, unity and reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The desire and wishes of the fellow countrymen can never become a plaything of the political philistines who have turned their backs on the nation."

            "content": "ATCC critica anacronica politica de enfrentamiento de Lee Myung Bak\r\nPyongyang, 8 de enero (ATCC) -- El editorial conjunto de los periodicos Rodong Sinmun, Joson Inmingun y Chongnyon Jonwy publicado con motivo del Ano Nuevo emitio advertencia a la politica de enfrentamiento fratricida de las fuerzas conservadoras surcoreanas en el \"poder\".\n\t\t\t\t\t En menos de un ano de su mandato, Lee Myung Bak y su banda pusieron graves escollos en el movimiento nacional por la reunificacion de la patria lanzando la frenetica campana de confrontacion con la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea tras negar la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio y la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Estas dos declaraciones devienen programas comunes de la nacion para la reunificacion que aclaran el principio fundamental y remedios para el desarrollo de las relaciones Norte-Sur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En estos dias, los politicastros surcoreanos dicen que \"nunca habian negado dichos documentos intercoreanos\" y hablan tanto del \"dialogo\", porque temen la responsabilidad por la ruptura de las relaciones Norte-Sur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pero, son demasiado graves los crimenes de esa horda para ser excusados con unas palabras.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Despues de la aparicion del \"poder\" conservador de Lee en el Sur de Corea, fueron paralizadas de repente las labores de cooperacion con miras a la reconciliacion, la unidad y la reunificacion de la nacion, que marchaban vigorosamente en varios dominios como la politica, la economia, la esfera militar y la cultura, y las  relaciones Norte-Sur que se desarrollaban favorablemente. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Se llevo a cabo la \"revision total de la politica al Norte\" y surgieron publicamente la teoria de \"10 anos perdidos\" y la del \"golpe preventivo\" que fija como \" enemigo principal\" a los connacionales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Para colmo, los compinches de Lee se ofrecieron como \"co-proponente\" del \"proyecto de resolucion de los derechos humanos del Norte\" contra los connacionales y cometieron la locura de rechazar la exclusion de la RPDC de la lista de los \"paises que apoyan el terrorismo\" por parte de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Por culpa de ellos, las actuales relaciones Norte-Sur volvieron a la situacion antes de la aprobacion de la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio y tropieza con graves pruebas el movimiento pannacional por la reunificacion, que ha venido avanzando bajo la bandera del ideal de \"Entre nosotros, los connacionales\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La banda de Lee no podra liberarse por nada de sus enormes crimenes antinacionales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ella dice que \"aunque es dificil, comenzaremos correctamente para las solidas relaciones Sur-Norte\", lo cual no pasa de ser un disparate descarado para evadir el castigo de la historia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Las declaraciones arriba mencionadas devienen el fundamento del desarrollo de las relaciones Norte-Sur. Por lo tanto, sin tomar la correcta posicion y actitud en cuanto a ellas no se puede hablar ni del mas minimo desarrollo de las relaciones intercoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t ?De que dialogo estara hablando la banda de Lee que tiene el alma de vibora?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Aunque se entable el \"dialogo\", no habra nada que conseguir porque ella misma lo habia llevado al fracaso rechazando la unidad nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El \"dialogo\" y la \"cooperacion\", de que habla esa banda, resultan la premisa de la nueva campana de confrontacion anti-RPDC. Por eso, esta insistiendo ya en que la RPDC no tiene \"sinceridad\" en cuanto a las \"conversaciones\" y a la \"cooperacion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ahora, la anacronica politica de enfrentamiento de las autoridades surcoreanas esta a punto de la bancarrota total y las fuerzas opositoras a la reunificacion estan cayendo en el atolladero sin salida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El juego de azar politico, que hace el \"poder\" de Lee apostando a la nacion, es censurado y rechazado unanimemente por la nacion y la sociedad internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A estas alturas, la banda de Lee trata de buscar su salida politica en la \"mejora de la politica al Norte\", pero esto no le sera la salvacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La camarilla traidora no podra liberarse por nada de su responsabilidad criminal por haber obstaculizado seriamente la reconciliacion y la unidad nacionales y la reunificacion de la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La aspiracion y la demanda de la nacion coreana no pueden ser manipuladas de ninguna manera por los politiqueros que dieron espaldas a ella."
