Commenting on this fact, Minju Joson today says it is a base act of a person who is obsessed with subordination, sycophancy and treason.\r\n   The daily goes on:\r\n   The \"invitation\" to South Korea of a descendant of the special-class criminal who committed immeasurable crimes against the Korean people will revive the nightmare of the Japanese imperialist aggression on Korea. It will also hurt national feelings of the Korean people.\r\n   The Japanese authorities have not yet made any apology and compensation for the unprecedented crimes against the Korean people and are acting brazen-facedly. At this very time, the South Korean ruler \"invited\" the Japanese \"Emperor\" to South Korea. This is a petty act of a person who has no iota of self-respect and dignity.\r\n   What they seek in the \"invitation\" is to tighten tieup with Japan, bridge over their ruling crisis and prolong their days with the backing of their master. \r\n   His is a traitorous act tantamount to that of the Ulsa (1905) Five traitors who sold out the country and sought their personal end. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They have completed all preparations for the production of nuclear weapons and are developing and possessing even delivery means of nuclear weapons.\r\n   What they pursue in their attempt to become a nuclear power is to conquer Asia and dominate the world by dint of nuclear weapons.
