It is now spearheading the implementation of the UN Security Council's \"resolution on sanctions\" in a bid to hurl more satellite states than those in the 1950 Korean war into a new Korean war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMore countries are participating in blocs including a military alliance under this or that pretext, to say nothing of countries and regions hostile to the DPRK after the demise of the Cold War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOn the contrary, the DPRK has neither joined any military bloc nor received any guarantee for military protection such as \"nuclear umbrella\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is only the DPRK that is countering the imperialist allied forces by itself outside bloc. As a result, a serious military and dynamic imbalance has been created in the international relations surrounding the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe anti-DPRK moves of the U.S. and its allies are escalating as the days go by as evidenced by the high-handed sanctions and pressure they put on it by setting in motion a hand-raising machine inside the UN while branding the DPRK's satellite launch, the legitimate right of a sovereign state, as a \"provocation\". This saliently reveals the reality in which only the law of jungle prevails, to say nothing of the elementary impartiality and principle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSuch imbalance cannot be removed as long as there remains AA and there is a limit to the capacity of neighboring big powers to defuse the continuing instability and tension on the Korean Peninsula. This has been fully proved by the past six-decade-long history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNowhere in the world is such war zone as the Korean Peninsula where huge nuclear strategic forces are massively deployed and military actions including joint war maneuvers are taking place almost every day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPeace on the peninsula is linked to world peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA new Korean war will mean a regional war and world war which will involve major states in the Asia-Pacific region and the region. World peace is unthinkable apart from peace on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe existence of the fragile AA would not be of  any help to ensuring peace on the peninsula and in the rest of the world but create only a vicious cycle in the relations among regional countries including big powers and hinder their development. This is truth proven by history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe constant source of war exists in the Asia-Pacific, the largest center of world political, economic and military activities in the 21st century though they are aimed at peace and development. This is not in line with the basic trend of the development of the present times and not beneficial to anyone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe state of ceasefire on the peninsula should not be allowed to go on in the light of the trend of the times and the prevailing situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe nullification of AA shows once again the iron will of the DPRK which set it as the main task for defending the sovereignty to ensure peace on the peninsula and has made every possible effort to do so.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe option of the DPRK has become clear now that the moves of all hostile forces to encroach upon its sovereignty and dignity are reaching a dangerous phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe army and people of the DPRK have launched a decisive battle for national reunification and peace of mankind, keenly aware of the noble responsibility for protecting the destiny of the country and the nation and convinced of the final victory in the all-out action against the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is their invariable stand and the mode of the counteraction of Mt.

The U.S. forces having the right to control wartime operations of the puppet army pretended to be \"a guardian of peace,\" rejecting its request or employing a delaying tactics. However, the U.S. signed the above-said war scenario, revealing its true colors as crafty aggressors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. seeks to minimize its forces' loss by putting forward the south Korean puppet army as a shock force in a war against the north and thus realize its ambition to invade it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIts ulterior objective is to intervene under the pretext of \"prompt assistance\" in a local war to be launched by the puppet forces and go over to an all-out war against the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs a matter of fact, the above-said war scenario took effect against the backdrop of the on-going large-scale Foal Eagle military drills against the north.

The on-going north-targeted war maneuvers of the U.S. and south Korean warmongers have completely deprived the peninsula of a mechanism to deter a war.
