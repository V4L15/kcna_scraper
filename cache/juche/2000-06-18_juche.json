Korea denounced \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, June 18 (KCNA) -- The U.S. decided to resume the strafing drill in the bombing ground in Maehyang-ri, Hwasong county, Kyonggi Province, from June 19, according to a radio report from Seoul. It was suspended for the time being in face of the strong protest from South Korean people from all walks of life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This decision is a challenge to the South Korean people as it chills their daily mounting desire for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In order to justify this criminal step the U.S. instigated the authorities of the South Korean \"Ministry of National Defence\" to assert that the U.S. military and the South Korean military have agreed to resume the drill as the suspension of the drill \"seriously affects the combat readiness\" of the U.S. forces in South Korea. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Struggle against modern imperialism called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 18 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article calls on the world people to escalate the anti-imperialist struggle, deeply aware of the crafty and despicable colors of modern imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The daily says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   General Secretary Kim Jong Il likened modern imperialism to an old wolf, thus bringing into bolder relief its true colors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   By nature modern imperialism is as cunning as a wolf. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Disclosing its crafty and despicable nature, the article says it finds its manifestation, above all, in that modern imperialism is behaving hypocritically, while more zealously resorting to double-dealing tactics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Modern imperialists are pursuing their policy of aggression and war more craftily under the guise of \"peace champion\" and \"guardian of liberty\", the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Whenever opportunity presents itself, the United States clamors about \"peace\", \"disarmament\" and \"detente\", but it has an axe to grind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Its loudmouthed \"peace\", in fact, means a ballad of war and its talk about \"disarmament\" and \"detente\" respectively means arms buildup and tensions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. imperialists pretend to be interested in peace and detente on the Korean peninsula. However, all their acts only result in increasing the danger of war and escalating the tensions on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The crafty and base nature of modern imperialism also finds its expression in the fact that it is taking a high-handed and outrageous approach toward small and weak countries and resorts to open armed invasion of them and interference in their internal affairs, while trying hard not to worsen the relations with big countries as far as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is evidenced by the fact that the U.S.-led NATO carried out military aggression on Yugoslavia under the cloak of \"humanitarian protection\" and is going ahead with air raids on Iraq under the pretext of \"non-compliance with inspection of arms\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The vicious and crafty aggressive nature of modern imperialism is manifested in the fact that it is working hard to intensify its domination and plunder of other countries  and attain its aggressive aim in such a more concealed and crafty manner as ideological and cultural poisoning under the signboard of \"globalization\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The world people should never allow themselves to be fooled by this art of disguise of imperialists but put up a more vigorous struggle against them. Only by doing so can they protect their destiny and the dignity and sovereignty of their countries and nations and save humankind from the tentacles of imperialism. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
