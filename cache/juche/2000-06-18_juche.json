Korea denounced \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, June 18 (KCNA) -- The U.S. decided to resume the strafing drill in the bombing ground in Maehyang-ri, Hwasong county, Kyonggi Province, from June 19, according to a radio report from Seoul. It was suspended for the time being in face of the strong protest from South Korean people from all walks of life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This decision is a challenge to the South Korean people as it chills their daily mounting desire for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In order to justify this criminal step the U.S. instigated the authorities of the South Korean \"Ministry of National Defence\" to assert that the U.S. military and the South Korean military have agreed to resume the drill as the suspension of the drill \"seriously affects the combat readiness\" of the U.S. forces in South Korea. \r\n\r\n"
