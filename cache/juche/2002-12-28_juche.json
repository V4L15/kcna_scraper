            "content": "Joint symposium on changing English name of country\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 27 (KCNA) -- The Linguistic Society and the History Society of the DPRK held a joint symposium on changing the English name of the country in Pyongyang on Dec. 26.\r\n The symposium called for holding in Pyongyang or a third country at an early date a joint symposium of scholars in the north and the south and overseas on correcting the wrong English name given to the country by the Japanese imperialists, expressing the hope that all the scholars and fellow countrymen at home and abroad would positively respond to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Speakers said at the symposium that \"Corea\", the English name of the peninsula, had been used since the mid-13th century and our country and all other nations in the west used the same English title. The Japanese imperialists, however, committed such an unpardonable crime as changing it into \"Korea\" in a crafty and base method early in the 20th century, they noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to even historical data that have been discovered and ascertained so far, Corea had been publicly recognized as the English name for the country in the international community  irrespective of any European languages from the 1250s to the end of the 1800s and the feudal government of the country also used \"Corea\" on its diplomatic documents and treaties signed with other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the Japanese imperialists changed \"C\", the first letter of \"Corea\", into \"K\", prompted by their wicked contention that our country should always come after Japan on the international arena as it was their colony. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An appeal to the scholars and fellow countrymen in the north and the south and overseas was adopted at the symposium. \r\n The appeal said that correcting the English name of the country is an important issue of regaining the history of the Korean nation that was trampled down by the Japanese imperialists, doing away with their colonial leftovers and defending the dignity of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It expressed the hope that governments and public circles in different countries of the world and international organizations would express positive support and solidarity for this just appeal.  \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA blasts U.S. warmongers' outbursts\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 27 (KCNA) -- The U.S. bellicose forces have become more undisguised in their moves to mount a preemptive attack upon the DPRK in a bid to contain it by force of arms under the pretext of its \"nuclear issue.\"\r\n U.S. Defense Secretary Rumsfeld asserted on Dec. 23 that even the use of force against the DPRK would not be ruled out, blustering \"The U.S. is perfectly capable of taking military action against Iraq and North Korea at the same time.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nMeanwhile, Richard Perl, chairman of the U.S. Committee for Defense Policy, on Dec 17 said that the Bush administration should not rule out even a military option to settle the nuclear issue of North Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This whole string of bellicose remarks made by U.S. warmongers betrays their black-hearted design to threaten the DPRK militarily and, at the same time, topple its system at any cost through preemptive attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is by no means fortuitous that the Dec. 25 issue of the newspaper Asahi Shimbun described such remarks as ones revealing that the hard-line logic aimed at toppling North Korea's system is deeply rooted in the U.S. Government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. much publicized assertion that North Korea should scrap its nuclear program first is nothing but a pipe-dream as it calls for disarming the DPRK under the absurd pretext of its \"nuclear program\" and then launching a surprise attack on it to overthrow its political system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has consistently maintained the stand to settle the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula through the DPRK-U.S. dialogue and especially through the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the U.S. is turning away from the DPRK's proposal for concluding a non-aggression treaty, the most realistic proposal to prevent the present crisis from inching close to the brink of a war. It is rushing headlong into extremely dangerous confrontation with the DPRK, saying that it would neither have dialogue with the DPRK nor rule out a war against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ceaseless war outcries are heard in the wake of the recent U.S.-South Korea annual security consultative meeting held in Washington which decided to take a measure of military sanctions, little short of a declaration of a war against the DPRK, under the pretext of its \"nuclear issue.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This situation compels the DPRK to cope with it with highest revolutionary vigilance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK neither wants nor avoids a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean People's Army is fully combat-ready and closely following the U.S. moves to start a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the DPRK's stand to meet force with force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. bellicose forces, ignorant of its rival, recklessly ignite a war, the people's army and people of the DPRK will resolutely turn out to mete out a decisive and merciless punishment to them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This was a landmark event as it glorified Korean-style socialism as socialism based on national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will resolutely defend and steadily glorify the immortal feats Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il performed by building people-centred socialism, socialism based on national independence, in the country and ushering in a new era of building a powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The editorial calls for steadily consolidating the state social system, true to Kim Jong Il's army-based policy, and thus firmly defending and further glorifying the socialist system of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson calls for giving full play to the superiority of the socialist constitution to strikingly demonstrate the dignity and might of Juche Korea.    \r\n\r\n"
