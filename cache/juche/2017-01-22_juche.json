He stressed the need for the commanding officers and combatants to thoroughly implement the behests of Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un went round the lecture room of O Jung Hup Political University.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After learning in detail about the education of O Jung Hup Political University, he underscored the necessity to give effective lectures as required by the mentality and characters of soldiers. To this end it is necessary to properly work out an education program, steadily improve the education contents and methods and ceaselessly raise the level of teachers and, at the same time, fully provide material and technical means for education, he said. He showed loving care for the unit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is nothing to fear when people remain strong in idea and the army is powerful, he noted, adding that the standoff with the enemy is the confrontation between arms and arms and between the idea and faith of the KPA and those of the enemy. He called for beating back the enemies armed to the teeth with the political and ideological superiority of the soldiers fully equipped with that idea and faith.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He looked round the mess hall and soy bean store of the unit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He learnt about the combat duty, combat readiness and training of the unit at the military lecture room.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He set forth the tasks facing the unit which would serve as guidelines for rounding off its combat preparations and bolstering up its combat capability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He gave service personnel a pair of binoculars and an automatic rifle as gifts and had a photo session with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by KPA Vice Marshal Hwang Pyong So, director of the General Political Bureau of the KPA, and Army Col. General Ri Yong Gil, first vice-chief of the General Staff and director of the General Operational Bureau of the KPA."

            "content": "DPRK Newspapers Urge Japan to Settle Its Past Crimes\r\nPyongyang, January 22 (KCNA) -- The Japanese imperialists poisoned Emperor Kojong of the Korean feudal government who had strong anti-Japan feelings on Jan. 22, 1919.\n\t\t\t\t\t In this regard, newspapers of the DPRK carry articles on Sunday.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This thrice-cursed crime clearly shows that the Japanese imperialists are the sworn enemy of the Korean people and barbarous killer disregarding even international law, Rodong Sinmun in an article says, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reason behind Japan's plot to poison the Emperor was to dethrone him, cover up the truth behind the fabrication of the \"Ulsa Five-point Treaty\" and turn Korea into its complete colony. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese imperialists calculated that as long as the Emperor was left alive he would have adverse effects on their colonial rule over Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t So they hatched a plot to kill him. Afraid of the Korean people's and the international community's condemnation of them, they plotted to let the pro-Japanese lackeys execute their plan to dethrone the Emperor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Against this backdrop, three special envoys of the Emperor including Ri Jun were present at the Second International Peace Conference in 1907, where they exposed the invalidity of the \"Ulsa (1905) Five-point Treaty\" and the Japanese imperialists' blatant encroachment on the Korean sovereignty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The crafty Japanese aggressors shifted the blame for the Hague Special Envoy Incident onto the Emperor and illegally deposed him and killed him by poison.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is not even feeling a sense of sin and responsibility for its crimes, far from repenting and apologizing for them. Instead it works desperately to pave a way for reinvasion, openly crying out for revival of militarism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson in an article says that the army and people of the DPRK will certainly force Japan to pay a dear price for its crimes, stressing that the Japanese imperialists who killed even the Emperor of Korea, not content with turning Korea into its colony in a brigandish way, are matchless barbarians."
