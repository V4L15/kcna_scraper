In the reports delivered at the conference and session, he advanced a line of setting up a legislature through the all-Korea general elections without delay to enact the constitution of the DPRK, in order to build an all-Korea government.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thereupon, the general elections for founding the Supreme People's Assembly took place and the First Session of the SPA was held in Pyongyang in September 1948. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In reflection of the unanimous desire of the entire Korean nation, the session elected Kim Il Sung prime minister of the DPRK Cabinet and head of the state, and he declared the birth of the DPRK as a unified independent and sovereign state for the Korean people."
