Korea under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 12 (KCNA) -- The south Korean military recently staged a farce to erect a \"monument to the Korean War\" on Wolmi Islet as part of its commemoration of the U.S. Inchon landing operation during the war.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Thursday in a signed commentary observes that this criminal plan lashes all the Koreans into fury as it openly indicates the south Korean military authorities' intention to go in for war against reunification pursuant to the U.S. policy of hindering the implementation of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. conservative hardliners are grumbling that the war hard fought by the U.S. forces is being buried into oblivion in south Korea. The pro-U.S. conservative forces in south Korea conceived the idea of erecting the monument as a last resort and through this they seek to create impression that they do not forget the solicitude shown by the U.S. but set store by the alliance with the U.S. in a bid to relieve it of its \"damaged feelings.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean military's recent farce to erect the monument is an act going against the history as it tampers with the truth of the war of aggression committed by the U.S. imperialists against Korea more than 50 years ago and an anti-national criminal act intended to bring confrontation and war to this land again swimming against the trend of the nation's history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The commentary urges the anti-reunification forces of the south Korean military to bear deep in mind that the war moves to incite confrontation with the DPRK are intolerable as they go against the era of reunification after the publication of the joint declaration and are intended to quell the nation's desire for independent reunification and that is little short of a suicidal act.    \r\n \r\n\r\n"
