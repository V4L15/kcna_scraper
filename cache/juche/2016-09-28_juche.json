Herein lies the danger of the scenario.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. staged madcap firepower strike rehearsals of various forms under the simulated conditions of actual battle against the DPRK by openly introducing strategic nuclear carrier to waters off south Korea and letting strategic nuclear bombers fly in the air over it as part of the preparations for carrying out this war scenario with the involvement of triad strategic nuclear strike means. By doing so, the U.S. has made overall arrangements for the preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK and modified, supplemented and rounded off them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Of late it let two B-1B strategic nuclear bombers take off the Andersen Air Base on Guam and make shuttle flights in the air over south Korea along the Military Demarcation Line for the exercise of dropping nuclear bombs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t One of them was deployed in the U.S. Osan Air Force Base and Ronald Reagan nuclear carrier task force is sailing to the waters off the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and south Korean warmongers are also openly blustering that the proposal for making a preemptive attack on the north's nuclear capability by use of precision guided weapons will be put into practice and that they will take high-profile actions to cope with the nuclear threat from the north by using effective and powerful means.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their nuclear offensive plans aiming at a preemptive nuclear strike at the DPRK have reached the phase of their implementation, increasing the danger of a nuclear war on the peninsula and in the region day by day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prevailing situation proves once again that the DPRK was absolutely just when it opted for bolstering up its nuclear deterrence in every way under the banner of the line of simultaneously developing the two fronts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and south Korean warmongers' implementation of their scenario for preemptive nuclear strike is an extremely dangerous gambling risking their lives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. attempts to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK, the U.S. mainland and other bases for aggression will face a merciless retaliatory strike of the Korean People's Army before it is made.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park Geun Hye group keen on prolonging their remaining days under the patronage of the U.S. will have to pay a high price for being involved in the attempt."
