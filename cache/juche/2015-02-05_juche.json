Paektu put up the slogan \"A-Match-for-a-Hundred\". \n\t\t\t\t\t President Kim Il Sung visited snow-covered Taedoksan Post situated on the forefront and put up the militant slogan \"A-Match-for-a-Hundred\" for the Korean People's Army (KPA) on February 6, Juche 52 (1963). \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That day leader Kim Jong Il said that the slogan put up by the President reflected the need for all the service personnel to become each  \"A-Match-for-a-Hundred\" not only in defence but also in attack, indicating the way to do so. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The validity and vitality of the slogan have been clearly proved in the glorious course of the KPA which has firmly defended the lifeline of the Juche revolution with arms and carried forward the victorious history and tradition in defence of socialism and standoff with U.S.-led imperialists. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the anti-party, counter-revolutionary elements blatantly challenged the party after the war, the service personnel defended the party and the leader at the cost of their lives and they carved the slogan on a natural rock and invariably upheld the idea and line of the party as the unshakable revolutionary faith and will when the undesirable elements opposed the party's military line for self-defence and the slogan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The enemy's Escort Craft 56 was sunken and the U.S. spy ship Pueblo was captured while intruding into the inviolable waters of the DPRK. And the U.S. large-sized spy plane EC-121 was shot down while intruding into the territorial air of the DPRK in April 1969. These miserable ends of the aggressors showed the world the might and spirit of the KPA equipped with the spirit of \"A-Match-for-a-Hundred\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t KPA service personnel crushed GIs in this spirit during the Panmunjom incident provoked by them in August 1976. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. helicopter OH-58A/C was shot down when it intruded deep into the territorial air of the DPRK in December 1994. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the enemies fired bullets and shells at the DPRK to kick up a war racket in July 1997, the KPA promptly took a measure for self-defence, blowing up the enemy's den in a twinkle. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Seamen and coastal artillerymen of the KPA destroyed enemy warships and showed the enemy what the strike of the powerful Paektusan revolutionary army was like in several skirmishes on the West Sea and the shelling on Yonphyong Island caused by the enemy's provocations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Satellite Kwangmyongsong-2 was successfully launched into space, demonstrating the invincible might of Songun Korea in April 2009. It is also associated with proud feats of the Korean revolutionary armed forces led by the great brilliant commanders of Mt. Paektu. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The KPA has steadily grown stronger to be a reliable scouting party of the Songun revolution and strong pillar firmly guaranteeing the party's cause with arms, upholding Supreme Commander Kim Jong Un who is ushering in the greatest heyday of bolstering up the military muscle."

Korean Regime of its Moves to Revise Fascist Law for Worse\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, February 5 (KCNA) -- Shortly ago, the minister of Justice of south Korea cried out for revising the \"Security Law\" (SL) in such a manner as to forcibly dissolve the \"anti-state organizations\" and \"those benefiting enemy\", adding he would push ahead with it as his top priority task this year.\n\t\t\t\t\t The chief executive of south Korea supported his plan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an unpardonable criminal act of totally stamping out the pro-independence, democracy and reunification forces and pushing the north-south relations to the worst catastrophe.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The SL fabricated by the Syngman Rhee clique in 1948 is an unheard-of fascist law that brands the DPRK as an enemy. It has been in force to mercilessly suppress south Korean people's patriotic and democratic activities and struggle for national reunification and even trifling acts of political opponents after labeling them \"anti-government ones sympathizing with the north.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Chief executives were replaced by others in south Korea many times but the SL has remained in force and more than one million people had been severely punished by the law until 2013.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is as clear as a pikestaff that there would be neither democracy in south Korea nor repaired north-south relations as long as there is such mechanism for harsh dictatorship and institutional barrier that brands compatriots in the north as enemy and incriminates even meeting with them and talking to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has never forced its ideology and system upon south Korea but staged the movement for reunification in the idea of the joint declarations the north and the south agreed upon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korean people have also staged actions in line with the common aspiration of humankind for democracy and in the idea of the programmes for reunification being supported by all Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t So, the DPRK should not be considered as an enemy of the south Korean authorities nor south Korean people be punished on the charge of \"sympathizing with the north.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a mere commonplace that dialogue and cooperation are taking place between countries with differing ideologies and social systems in the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the light of not only misfortune and pain all Koreans have suffered but also the global trend, there is neither ground nor justification for the SL to remain in force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the south Korean authorities are working hard to revise the SL for the worse, not content with brutally suppressing the legitimate organizations and personages calling for national reconciliation and reunification by invoking it from the outset of the year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their move is an open challenge to all sincere efforts made by the DPRK to bring about a great turn and change in the north-south relations and an unpardonable act of trampling down the ardent desire and expectation of all Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The SL is now not only rejected by all Koreans but censured as an anti-human rights law by international organizations such as the UN and even the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The SL should be repealed at once."
