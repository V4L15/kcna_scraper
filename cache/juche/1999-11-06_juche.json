We will certainly make the South Korean authorities and the Chosun Ilbo pay for their criminal insult sometime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean puppet authorities must immediately stop the false reports and intrigues that go against inter-Korean reconciliation, great national unity and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As long as they resort to the anti-DPRK intrigues that aggravate the north-south confrontation, we will be compelled to have no contact with them and they will have to be held wholly responsible for all the consequences. \r\n\r\n"

It warned the \"government\" side that if it refuses to meet these demands, they will launch an \"anti-government\" struggle by  holding  workers rallies across South Korea on November 21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It also stated that it, together  with the South Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and other civic and social organizations, would stage big rallies and other solidarity struggles and call a nationwide general strike. \r\n\r\n"

The Japanese reactionaries are seeking to massively hurl their \"Self-Defense Forces\" into South Korea under the pretext of an \"emergency\" on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They have already  secured the \"SDF's\" right of belligerency and the right to participate in a war through the adoption of bills related to the \"Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation Guidelines\" to cope with an \"emergency\" on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What Japan has not yet done is to invent a pretext to hurl the \"Self-Defense Forces\" into South Korea. The newly-hammered out \"non-combatant rescue plan\" represents a green light to the move to attain that aim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan drew up a new plan to stage a comeback to the Korean peninsula against the backdrop of the unprecedentedly intensifying bilateral and multilateral military cooperation and joint war drills with the United States and South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis is an undisguised challenge to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the firm will of the Korean people to return fire for fire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries should clearly know this and give up their wild design for reinvasion. \r\n\r\n"

The latest war equipment including nuclear weapons are targeted at the DPRK, while military exercises against it are being staged almost everyday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The open call of the U.S.  conservative hard-liners for  the development and  deployment of the \"TMD\" stemmed from the U.S.  strategical design to have an overwhelming \"military edge\" and establish a military domination over East Asia and, furthermore, gain world supremacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"TMD\" is not for protecting the U.S. and its allies from someone's \"threat.\" It is a product  of the U.S. ambition for world domination. It is the unchangeable  design of the U.S. to realize its plan for world domination by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is well advised to give up its attempt to dominate the world by a military  edge. \r\n\r\n"
