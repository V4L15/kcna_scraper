Korean Police Intensifies Crackdown upon Trade Union \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 8 (KCNA) -- The south Korean police authorities are intensifying the suppression of the Railway Corporation Workers' Union, according to the south Korean MBC.\r\n Much upset by the daily intensified strike of the union, the National Police Office issued an instruction to strongly deal with it and arrest the strikers.\r\n By this instruction at least 7,000 policemen were deployed in 175 major scenes of strike across south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On March 3 alone, more than 410 unionists were walked away in Taejon, Phaju of Kyonggi Province, Yongyang of North Kyongsang Province and other areas.\r\n On the same day, the police searched the office of the union in Ryongsan, Seoul, and seized computers and documents related to the strike. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Although the union decided to discontinue the strike on March 4, the police announced that it would arrest 26 leading members of the union for whom warrants of arrest had been issued. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In another development, 58 civic and public organizations including the People's Solidarity of south Korea held a press conference at the Seoul Office of the union on March 4 at which it made public a statement denouncing the police authorities' reckless suppression of the union, according to the south Korean KBS.\r\n The organizations in the statement strongly demanded the \"government\" authorities immediately halt the suppression of the union including the arrest of unionists.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan Urged to Settle Its Crime-woven Past \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 8 (KCNA) -- Over 100 years ago, the Japanese imperialists illegally occupied Korea by mobilizing aggression armed forces to threaten and blackmail it and fabricate the \"Ulsa Five-point Treaty\". Since then they had enforced the harshest colonial fascist rule in history for more than 40 years, bringing untold pain, misfortune and disasters to the Korean people.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such crimes can never be forgotten nor concealed no matter how much water may flow under the bridge, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists caused too heavy human and material losses to the Korean people in the past that Japan can hardly expiate for all ages. Japan should have adequately repented of and atoned for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, Japan has not yet made honest apology and compensation for the never-to-be-condoned past crimes though 60 years have passed since the defeat of the Japanese imperialists. On the contrary it is persistently working hard to deny and embellish the crimes and evade the responsibility for redeeming them.\r\n Japan is whetting its sword to stage a comeback to Korea and escalating its hostile moves against the DPRK, seized by the old ambition for \"greater East Asia co-prosperity sphere\". It seeks to grab Tok Islet, part of the inviolable territory of Korea, and, furthermore, occupy the whole of Korea. Such actions are little short of adding to the hideous crimes perpetrated by it in the past. This is a blatant challenge to the Korean people and a heinous criminal act of violating the Korean nation's dignity and sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan remains the sworn enemy of the Korean people because it is still doing huge damage to them as it did in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will surely force Japan to pay dearly for the blood shed by them due to the Japanese imperialists in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should properly understand this unshakable will of the Korean people and opt to settle its past as soon as possible.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They should live as required by the socialist way of living and wage a staunch fight against all shades of corrupt and non-socialist elements. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the women should fully display the beautiful and noble traits of helping and leading each other forward, thinking others first and sacrificing themselves in today's gigantic general march. The bright future of the great prosperous powerful socialist nation depends on the future generations. The women should give birth to many children and rear them to be dependable men and women to shoulder upon themselves the great prosperous powerful nation with a noble sense of responsibility for the future of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the women should work hard to accomplish the historic cause of national reunification, holding Kim Jong Il in high esteem, and constantly intensify militant solidarity with the world progressive women struggling for social progress and women's emancipation against imperialism and colonialism.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Calls for Making U.S. Imperialists Pay Thousand-fold High Price for Blood Shed by Koreans \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 8 (KCNA) -- The brutal massacres of civilians committed by the U.S. imperialists in south Korea are the heinous crimes of exterminating the Korean nation for which it should make the U.S. pay generation after generation. \r\n Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists killed more than one million innocent people for five years after they occupied south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The massacres of civilians climaxed during the Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialist aggression troops have perpetrated more than 2,000 murder cases in south Korea every year after the war,killing or wounding over 100,000 innocent people. Therefore, the south Korean people sustained casualties in peacetime as many as in a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the massacres of civilians in south Korea were the organized and planned crimes on orders by bosses of the aggression troops. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the U.S. imperialists have never apologized for their crimes in south Korea with consciousness of guilt but rather resorted to all sorts of schemes to cover up the truth and evade the legal responsibility. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Not content with the massacres so far, the U.S. imperialists are rendering the situation of the Korean Peninsula extremely strained under the pretext of the nuclear issue in an attempt to bring the dark clouds of a nuclear war over the Korean nation. \r\n It is the firm will of the Korean people to probe the crimes of the U.S. imperialists who have stained the Korean territory with the blood and corpse of fellow countrymen and make them pay a thousand-fold high price for them, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This would be unthinkable without the Party's ideological work which has been steadily developed in depth under the guidance of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and the people in the DPRK have grown stronger in idea and faith and the DPRK has vigorously advanced toward the high eminence of a great prosperous powerful nation under the banner of Songun despite the vicious moves for aggression, isolation and suffocation, ideological and cultural poisoning of the enemies of revolution including the U.S. imperialists since the \"Arduous March\", in particular. This is the fruition of the wise guidance of Kim Jong Il who has consolidated the political and ideological position of the Korean revolution by improving and strengthening the Party's ideological work as required by the Songun era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He has provided wise guidance to the development of the Party's ideological work in the era of Songun. He clarified the aim and orientation of the ideological work by developing in depth the Songun idea of Juche to be guidelines of our era and saw to it that the People's Army set an example in improving the form and method of the ideological work and it was followed by the society.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Recently it raised \"threat from China\" in addition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's vociferation is identical to the essence of the U.S. doctrine on \"threat from China\". It is no more than a revelation of Japan's wild design to speed up the drive for turning itself into a military power under the pretext of China's increased national strength, increased military capability in particular, and hold hegemony in Asia.\r\n Japan is now badly straining every nerve to the increase and development of China's national power and running for \"competition\" to deter it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It announced a plan to launch two more spy satellites by March 2007 to intensively monitor the Korean Peninsula and Taiwan straits. Recently it launched in succession satellites of different missions including Multifunctional Transport Satellite 2.\r\n Japan's consciousness of confrontation, policy for supremacy, is very dangerous as it exerts immense negative influence on peace and security of East Asia.\r\n Japan's ambition for supremacy in Asia is a daydream which is unable to come true.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
