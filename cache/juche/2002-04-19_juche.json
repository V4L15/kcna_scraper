It is the ulterior intention of Japan to have access to lots of nuclear weapons at any cost, claiming that it was defeated in the second world war because it was weak and it did not possess any nuclear weapon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is not a non-nuclear state but a very dangerous nuclear war force. The Japanese reactionaries are pulling up their neighbouring countries over \"arms build-up.\" This is nothing but a subterfuge to justify their moves to convert Japan into a military power and step up its nuclear weaponization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is keen to realize its ambition for overseas aggression with nuclear weapons any moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The first target of its nuclear attack is the DPRK. Japan is vociferating about a \"nuclear threat\" from the DPRK in a bid to start a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's nuclear weaponization leads to its self-destruction.     \r\n\r\n"

They were built and managed by Japanese businessmen with an approval of the military. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Women who were forced to serve the Japanese army as their sexual slaves at those \"stations\" were Korean women whose age averaged 15 to 30 and most of them were from the southern part of Korea such as Kyonggi, Jolla and Kyongsang provinces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They were not allowed to speak in Korean and go out but were practically detained there, subject to rules of \"comfort stations\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Not a few women were murdered due to the Japanese soldiers' sexual abuses or committed suicides unable to live anymore as shameful \"comfort women.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Phunggol \"comfort stations\" appeared to be operated by non-governmental businessmen but they were managed and controlled by the military in reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Police boxes were built at the entrance of the \"comfort stations\" and mps intensified their patrol as part of their strict watch and control of the stations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these facts go to clearly prove that the sexual slavery by the Japanese imperialists was enforced in top secrecy in Korea on which the Japanese imperialist aggression army first set foot and that they adopted it as part of their policy and committed organized sexual abuses in the course of their invasion of the continent.     \r\n\r\n\r\n"
