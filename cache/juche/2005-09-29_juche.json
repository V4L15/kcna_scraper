            "content": "Rash Anti-Reunification Moves in S. Korea under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 28 (KCNA) -- A tourist company and the headquarters of the ground force in south Korea are reportedly contemplating a joint development and trial sale of a tourist program for inviting foreigners to tour the \"second tunnel\" and \"the delta of iron,\" etc. in the area where the sixth division of the south Korean army is stationed and experience a barrack life there. It is said that they would extend the tourist course depending on business profits. \r\n Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says: This is nothing but rowdyism that can be perpetrated only by schizophrenic patients. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their much touted \"tunnel\" is nothing but a fiction concocted by the successive dictators of south Korea to incite confrontation with the north and bring the situation under control by slandering it whenever they found themselves tight-cornered by the crisis of their fascist ruling system, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through the projected foreign tour of \"tunnel\" the south Korean authorities and bellicose forces seek to tarnish the authority of the DPRK and build up international opinion favoring the continued division of Korea into the north and the south.\r\n It is a wrong way of thinking for the south Korean authorities to try to make use of the tragic partition of the Korean Peninsula for money making. Nothing is more heartbreaking than the tragedy in which the homogeneous Korean nation with a history spanning 5,000 years has been forced to undergo the pain resulting from the division for more than six decades due to outsiders. However, the south Korean authorities are becoming so shameless as to use the \"tunnel,\" a product of the racket for confrontation with the north, along with the military demarcation line symbolic of national division, as international tourist destinations. This disgraceful behavior of the authorities has touched off towering indignation among the Koreans.\r\n Should the south Korean authorities have willingness to implement the June 15 joint declaration, they should unconditionally cancel their plan for \"tour of tunnel,\" which would throw one more stumbling block in the way of improving the inter-Korean relations, and fill them up.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The idea calls for thoroughly rejecting \"cooperation\" with the aggressive foreign forces in war and paving the way for peace and reunification through national cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the south Korean authorities are talking about \"implementation\" of the joint declaration and \"national cooperation\" in one hand and showing such a double-dealing attitude as dancing to the tune of war of the foreign forces in the other. This is a perfidy to the idea of \"By our nation itself\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea is the basic guidelines to defend peace of the country and develop the inter-Korean relations on the principle of national independence.\r\n Only when the north and the south remain loyal to the idea is it possible to defend peace, promote reconciliation and cooperation and step up the cause of reunification against the war moves of the foreign forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Cooperation\" with the foreign forces and war rackets in league with them, going astray from the idea, are a dangerous adventure which may drive the inter-Korean relations to a crisis again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Steadfast is the will of the Korean nation to achieve national unity and the peace and independent reunification of the country by its concerted efforts under the uplifted banner of the June 15 joint declaration. No force can arrest the dynamic advance of the Korean nation toward the reunification of the country in the idea of \"By our nation itself\".    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
