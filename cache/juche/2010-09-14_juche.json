His strong sense of international obligation, true and comradely, turned the friendship between the two countries into a special and unbreakable one. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the Chiang Kai-shek clique was trying hard to put the northeast area under its control in league with the U.S. imperialists behind the scene of peace talks with the CPC just after the Japanese imperialists' defeat in August 1945, Kim Il Sung made a decision to help the Chinese people in their revolutionary struggle. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He, who had called for strengthening revolutionary unity between the Korean and Chinese peoples on several occasions, made public the historic talk \"Let Us Actively Support the Chinese People in Their Revolutionary Struggle,\" to manifest his revolutionary position of supporting the Chinese revolution at the cost of blood.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the talk he noted that the Chinese revolution was part of the Asian people's national liberation struggle and that defending the northeast area was of weighty importance in promoting the victory of the Chinese revolution. He also said if the CPC occupied the area, it would play a great role in the Chinese revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He put forward it as a primary task to actively help with organization of armed units and called for cooperating with the Chinese people in the establishment of a democratic government and the formation of party and mass organizations and a united front in the northeast area and directing great effort to cementing the unity between the Korean and Chinese peoples.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His idea and intention concerning the unity between the Korean and Chinese revolutionaries and peoples which he had mentioned on many occasions including some historical meetings during the hard-fought anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle were implemented on a new, higher level after the publication of the work.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to his decisive step to fully aid the Chinese people in their revolutionary struggle, lots of fine military and political cadres and members of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army (KPRA) were dispatched to Northeast China.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The area was a point of strategic importance in the Chinese revolution. Addressing the 7th Conference of the CPC, Chairman Mao Zedong said if the northeast area were seized even though all of the existing bases were lost, the Chinese revolution would have its foundations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOfficers of the KPRA armed tens of thousands of young Korean people and enrolled more than 120,000 people in a paramilitary organization, forming many armed units of Koreans throughout the area.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They also formed party and mass organizations and united front organizations, launched democratic reforms including agrarian reform. At the same time, they cleaned up the counterrevolutionary forces -- remnants of the defeated Japanese army and puppet Manchukuo, wealthy landowners, rebels and lackeys -- to provide favorable conditions for the liberation of the northeast area.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThough Korea was in hard time right after the liberation, Kim Il Sung allowed the CPC to move or transport large quantities of materials and lots of personnel via Nampho, Rajin and other places of Korea and sent it some 100,000 guns, munitions, explosives, medicines, cloth for military uniforms, shoes and many other military supplies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tZhou Bao-zhong, a leading officer of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army, said the aid materials sent by Korea in two and a half years from summer of 1946 to 1948 were as much as over 2,000 railway vehicles and that the Chinese people should not forget the selfless internationalist assistance of the Korean people led by Kim Il Sung for the Chinese liberation struggle. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whenever the northeast liberation war faced harsh ordeals, Kim Il Sung gave the Chinese friends strategic and tactical advices and opinions to make a tangible contribution to victory in the Chinese revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A Chinese book says that his advices based on foresightedness and scientific penetration greatly helped with military operations of the Chinese army and that from this point of view the victory in major operations in the northeast liberation war was closely linked with his name.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Loyal to his leadership hundreds of thousands of young Korean people distinguished themselves, displaying matchless heroism and self-sacrificing spirit, in battlefields in the northeast area including Siping, Jilin, Shengyang and Changchun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At that time the commander of the Northeast People's Liberation Army sent a gift to Kim Il Sung, highly appreciating his advises and unsparing assistance for the victory in the Siping liberation battle. Other commanding officers of China said the gift was a token of their feeling that they would like to repay his favor by making shoes with their hair.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As Kim Il Sung expected, the Korean revolutionaries' joining in the war radically changed the balance of forces between the revolutionary forces and the counterrevolutionary forces, helped liberate the northeast area to turn the situation favorable to victory in the Chinese revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Korean units also rendered heroic services in the liberation war in mainland China, bringing the flowers of friendship between the two countries into bloom in many areas including Beijing, Tianjin, Changjiang and even the southern tip of China. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Chinese leaders said the five-star red flag was permeated with blood shed by Koreans, while the Chiang Kai-shek clique said they were defeated due to Kim Il Sung's strategies and tactics and the dispatch of troops by Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Chinese revolutionaries and people made sincere effort for the development of the friendship between Korea and China, praising Kim Il Sung as a great internationalist and the closest friend of the Chinese people who assisted the Chinese revolution with all sincerity for many years.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The armies and peoples of the two countries, carrying forward the tradition of the joint fighting in the anti-Japanese war in Northeast China and the Chinese liberation war, joined hands in the Korean war, too, to inflict a disastrous defeat upon the United States, the first of its kind in the U.S. history, and creditably defended the precious gains of the revolution in the two countries and peace of Asia and the rest of the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The traditional friendship provided by Kim Il Sung together with the Chinese leaders of the elder generation has ever developed through generations and centuries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The two rounds of unofficial China visit by Kim Jong Il this year marking the 65th anniversary of the publication of the afore-said work and the 60th anniversary of the entry into the Korean front of the Chinese People's Volunteers fully demonstrated that the DPRK-China friendship will never be affected by the passage of time and alternation of generations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through the recent unofficial visit of Kim Jong Il the revolutionary history and feats of Kim Il Sung recorded in Northeast China became dearer to the Korean and Chinese people and the unshakable will of the Workers' Party and government of Korea to steadily develop the bilateral friendship and cooperation was fully demonstrated. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Il Sung's life shining with great internationalist obligation will be remembered in all ages along with the everlasting friendship between the DPRK and China and their common cause will surely be accomplished under deep care and close cooperation of the two parties, two countries and the two peoples."

They even massacred more than one million Koreans in cold blood.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The crime of sexual slavery was the most hideous crime against humanity among all the crimes the Japanese imperialists committed against the Korean people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese imperialists reduced not only girls in their teens but even married women, 200 000 in all, to sexual playthings of the Japanese imperialist aggressors, violating their youth and chastity at battlefields. They went the lengths of making no scruple of killing them in a brutal manner in order to cover up their monstrous crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese government, however, has tried hard to shirk off the responsibility for those hideous crimes beyond human imagination in a bid to hoodwink the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan has persistently turned a deaf ear to the strong demand of the victims who have suffered from moral and physical pain for scores of years after the war due to the Japanese imperialists and the just voices of the international community calling for the probe into the truth against the past crimes and state apology and reparation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese ultra-right conservatives unhesitatingly let loose such brigandish sophism that the Japanese imperialists' military occupation and colonial fascist rule over Korea were \"legitimate\" and they did \"many good things in Korea\". Not content with this, they deleted contents dealing with such past crimes as forcible drafting of Koreans and sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army from history books.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan has persistently denied its past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present chief executive of Japan in a statement recently issued on the occasion of the centenary of the fabrication of the \"Korea-Japan Annexation Treaty\" did not mention at all the issue of handling and making reparation for above-mentioned hideous crimes against humanity committed by the Japanese imperialists against the Korean people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What merits serious attention is that the Japanese ultra-right conservatives busied themselves calling for publishing a statement in protest against the statement of the prime minister and the right-wing media joined them, crying that they can never allow the personal opinion of the prime minister.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This was nothing but hysteric outburst of the Japanese reactionaries getting hell-bent to totally deny the crime-woven history and evade the settlement of the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Voices demanding Japan's redemption of its past has grown stronger among Asian countries and on several international arenas in recent years. This represents their non-confidence in Japan and indictment against it as it has desperately tried to distort and conceal its past crimes and flee from the responsibility for them at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No statute of limitations is applicable to the crimes against humanity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The further Japan delays the settlement of its past, the much more debt it will have to face."

Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says this in a signed commentary. \n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists have frequently hurled aircraft carriers and nuclear-powered submarines into waters off south Korea and its vicinity.

            "content": "ATCC exige la liquidacion del pasado criminal de Japon\r\nPyongyang, 14 de septiembre (ATCC) -- La liquidacion del pasado criminal de Japon es hoy un problema internacional muy serio.\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ultimamente, con motivo del 65o aniversario de la derrota de Japon en la Segunda Guerra Mundial, suben de tono en varios escenarios internacionales las voces que demandan la liquidacion total de los crimenes antieticos cometidos en el siglo pasado por los imperialistas japoneses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Al unirse a tal corriente, la Amnistia Internacional hizo publica hace poco una declaracion demandando al gobierno japones que indemnice a las ex consoladoras sexuales para el viejo ejercito japones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esta nota significa la condena al que hizo caer el mundo en la conflagracion, y refleja la fuerte demanda de la sociedad internacional de que no se repitan mas nunca los crimenes ensangrentados del pasado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Como esta conocido por todos, la agresion a Corea por los imperialistas japoneses y su dominacion colonial militar y fascista sobre ella, que duro mas de 40 anos, son crimenes estatales mas barbaros sin precedentes en la historia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Durante su dominacion colonial, los imperialistas japoneses arrestaron forzosamente a mas de 8 millones 400 mil jovenes y adultos coreanos para obligarles el trabajo esclavista de la Edad Media y lanzarlos como carne de canon a las guerras de agresion y asesinaron cruelmente a mas de un millon de coreanos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Lo peor de los crimenes de lesa humanidad de Japon fue el de consoladoras sexuales para las tropas japonesas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Los imperialistas japoneses convirtieron a 200 mil coreanas, desde las ninas de unos diez anos hasta las casadas, en esclavas sexuales para los agresores y violaron su juventud y virginidad llevandolas consigo a los campos de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Y para encubrir este crimen, cometieron la fechoria de asesinarlas salvajemente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Pero, el gobierno japones esta enganando al mundo eludiendo la responsabilidad por esos inimaginables e irrefutables crimenes de lesa humanidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  No quiere escuchar el clamor de las victimas, que sufren todavia, a mas de varios decenios desde el fin de la guerra, las secuelas espirituales y fisicas de los crimenes de Japon, y la voz justa de la sociedad internacional en demanda del esclarecimiento de estos delitos, la disculpa e indemnizacion de nivel estatal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Anteriormente, las fuerzas conservadoras ultraderechistas de Japon pronunciaron sin escrupulos unos disparates tan cinicos como que la ocupacion militar y la dominacion fascista colonial de los imperialistas japoneses sobre Corea fueron \"legitimas\" y \"estos hicieron muchos favores\" en Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el mismo contexto, eliminaron de los libros de historia los hechos criminales del pasado como el arresto forzoso de coreanos y el citado sistema de esclavitud sexual.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Japon sigue negando hasta la fecha sus crimenes del pasado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En su reciente declaracion publicada en ocasion del centenario de la falsificacion del \"Tratado de Anexion de Corea a Japon\", el actual mandatario japones no hizo referencia alguna al tratamiento ni a la indemnizacion de los referidos crimenes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Sin embargo, las fuerzas conservadoras ultraderechistas de Japon armaron escandalos publicando la nota de protesta por esa declaracion superficial del premier y los medios de prensa derechistas se unieron a ellas sosteniendo que no pueden permitir jamas tal criterio privado del premier.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esto parte del fanatismo de los reaccionarios japoneses por rehusar totalmente su historia criminal y eludir obstinadamente la liquidacion de ella.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En los ultimos anos, en los paises asiaticos y varias escenas internacionales se elevan mas las voces que demandan la liquidacion del pasado criminal de Japon. Esto deviene la expresion de desconfianza y condena a Japon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Los crimenes de lesa humanidad no tienen prescripcion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Mientras Japon dilate la liquidacion de sus crimenes del pasado, seran cada vez mas grandes sus deudas."
