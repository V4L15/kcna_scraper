Worse still, some of the right-wing politicians are asserting that a solution of the \"suspected abduction\" issue should be a prerequisite to the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such arguments are carefully hatched political plots to disguise the assailant as \"victim.\" So to speak, through this they seek to evade the liquidation of the past, an outstanding issue that can never be turned aside from political, moral and legal points of view. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The core of the outstanding issues between the DPRK and Japan from those points of view, is for Japan to make an apology and compensation for the political, moral, material and human losses it imposed upon the Korean people as well as the heinous crimes it committed against the Korean nation during its occupation of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The history of relations between Korea and Japan evidently proves which of the two countries has been an assailant or victim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   During the occupation of Korea the Japanese imperialists abducted or walked away over six million young and middle-aged Koreans, murdered more than one million innocent people and took away nearly 200,000 Korean women as \"comfort women for the Japanese army.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They also plundered Korea of a huge amount of gold, iron ore, lead, zinc, magnesite, anthracite and other resources and a lot of cultural wealth and, during the \"Pacific War,\" deprived each family of Korea of even spoons and chopsticks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such unprecedented atrocities in the 20th century as murder, kidnapping, raping and plunder can never be denied or erased though Japan plays tricks, raising the issue of some Japanese who had been reported missing in their territory without reason. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We don't care about whether Japan will have diplomatic ties with us or not. However, Japan, an assailant, must make clear apology and adequate compensation to the Korean people, a victim. This is the primary outstanding issue between the DPRK and Japan, whose solution brooks no further delay and which can never be turned aside. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is preposterous to argue about other issue without a solution to this basic issue. Such mode of thinking and argument only reveals a short-sighted mode of politics and poor diplomacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The right-wing forces of Japan must not act rashly, mindful that dialogue channels arranged with so much effort may be cut off if they persistently raise other matters than the outstanding issues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We will keep tabs on Japan's attitude. \r\n\r\n"

It is quite natural and unavoidable for the corrupt philistines, going against the aspiration and desire of the people, to face a stern trial by history. \r\n\r\n"

This is nothing but a nonsensical sophism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They have secured a legal basis on which the Japanese \"SDF\" can participate in military actions for aggression in the \"event of contingency in areas surrounding Japan\" under the cloak of \"cooperation\" with the U.S. forces. They are now keen on readjusting and reinforcing the commanding systems and enhancing efficiency of military operations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their plan to organize a patrol helicopter corps aboard escort ships is part of the moves to beef up the marine forces of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They are acting rashly, obsessed with the design for overseas aggression. But it will bring only disgrace and destruction to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They are foolish enough to designate the DPRK as the first target of their overseas aggression. But this only enrages the Korean People's Army and people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If they unleash a war of aggression against the DPRK, our people's army and people will deal merciless blows to the aggressors to give vent to their pent-up resentment and hatred.
