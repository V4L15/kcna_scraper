This was followed by their bombing of the Novi Sad TV Broadcasting Station. A flagrant violation of the UN Charter and an international law, this barbarism lays bare the aggressive and brutal nature of the U.S. and NATO forces. The U.S. and NATO air raids on Yugoslav media organs can never be justified, the statement stresses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It bitterly denounces the United States and NATO for their despicable and shameless acts to conceal their aggressive nature and muffle the just voices of the Yugoslav people fighting to protect sovereignty and territorial integrity.   It goes on:   The Kosovo issue is entirely an internal affair of Yugoslavia. Therefore, it can not be settled through military intervention or pressure. Moreover, their air raids on such civilian  objects as broadcasting stations  are an unethical war crime  which will only add to their crimes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The statement demands NATO immediately stop bombings which are in contravention of the UN Charter and international law and guarantee broadcasting stations and  other mass media and journalists security, life and free activities.  \r\n\r\n"

He went to readjusted paddy-fields to see tractors and other farm machines at work and acquainted himself with the rural mechanization in detail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  He said that a granite foundation has been laid for a new upsurge in agricultural production through accelerated rural mechanization.   Then he advanced highly important tasks which would serve as guidelines in realizing the comprehensive mechanization of the nation's rural economy.\r\n   He noted that a large number of modern farm machines were supplied to the socialist countryside over the past years, opening a new era of doing farmwork with the help of machines.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Saying that to carry out land rezoning well is a revolutionary work to free farmers from difficult and arduous labour, he urged all the provinces, cities and counties to push ahead with land rezoning through a nationwide drive on the basis of the achievements and experience gained in land rezoning in Kangwon Province and thus change the appearance of the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He stressed the need to produce more machines for land rezoning.\r\n   In order to realize the mechanization of the rural economy, he said, production of farm machines of various types suited to the specific conditions of the countryside should be increased.   Enough spare parts should also be supplied there to increase the operation rate of those machines and repair and service them in time, he added.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He said it was necessary to provide conditions favourable for mechanization, including improvement of the land cultivation system.\r\n   He urged the province to concentrate all efforts on farming for increased grain output in order to fully display the vitality of the land rezoning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHe was accompanied by vice-chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission Ri Yong Mu and general officers of the Korean People's Army.\r\nIncluded in the party were secretary Kim Yong Sun and first vice department director Jang Song Thaek of the WPK Central Committee. \r\n\r\n"
