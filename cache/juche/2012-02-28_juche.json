Australia has already seconded it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. is negotiating with Philippines on the issue. The U.S. laid down an orientation of dispersing and deploying U.S. marines in Okinawa in the Asia-Pacific region in a joint document agreed with Japan recently.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis reveals the criminal scenario of the U.S. to contain potential rivals and maintain and strengthen its military domination over the region by ensuring the \"strategic flexibility\" of its forces deployed in the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe relocation of the U.S. marines is not only the transfer of aggressor forces in accordance with the new military strategy of the present U.S. administration but their forward-deployment for starting a new war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter shifting the centre for carrying out the strategy for world domination to the Asia-Pacific region in the new defence strategy in January this year, the U.S. is busy concentrating its forces in the region in the wake of its reduction of its forces in Mideast and Europe. It is stepping up the dispersal and deployment of its marines, in particular.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe aim of the U.S. is to make an effective and proactive use of its forces for aggression in countries of the region by increasing its maneuverability, flexibility and deployment speed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe transfer of U.S. marines is an extremely dangerous military move to fan up the atmosphere of a Cold War in the region and go unchallenged in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat should not be overlooked is that south Korea is not exception in the above-said strategy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis can be illustrated by the widespread world public opinion that \"a proposal for relocating some of U.S. marines in south Korea is now under examination\" and \"Lee Myung Bak had already okayed it\" and so forth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs a matter of fact, the U.S. has markedly increased the number of joint military exercises with the south Korean puppet army, and their intensity since the announcement of the new defence strategy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tU.S. marines and the south Korean puppet marine corps are set to stage the largest-ever joint landing drill and field maneuvers in the waters around the five islands, the biggest hotspot in the West Sea of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis goes to prove that U.S. marines may be deployed in south Korea any time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn case the forward-deployment of U.S. marines in south Korea in addition to the huge aggressor forces present there becomes a reality, it is bound to further strain the situation on the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. is the arch criminal escalating the tension in the peninsula and the rest of Asia-Pacific."

It envisages a drastic reduction of military spending for ten years, the transfer of U.S. forces in EU and Mideast to the Asia-Pacific region and replacement of its previous military strategy which calls for waging two wars simultaneously by a strategy for carrying out a single war. It also calls for implementing the plan for dispatching more than 690 000 U.S. reinforcements to the Korean Peninsula in \"contingency\", pursuant to the \"OPLAN 5027\".\n\t\t\t\t\tRodong Sinmun Tuesday observes in a bylined article in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. new national defense strategy is, in essence, aimed at gratifying its unlimited ambition to dominate the world through aggression and war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe report, worked out in a more crafty way in its form and contents, is no more than a policy for showdown as it seeks domination and subjugation, aggression and war. It is also the most reactionary and dangerous document for the declaration of a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe reactionary nature and danger of the report lie in that it was laid down as a policy to steadily maintain and strengthen a nuclear strategy as a key lever for dominating the world and the Asia-Pacific region was designated as a center for overseas military operations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. has sustained its repeated failures in its moves for building a unipolar world but it is set to do so by means of nuclear weapons. \"Provocation\", deterrence and the like on its lips are no more than chicanery to beef up nuclear forces for aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat is the biggest danger of the report is that the U.S. intends to ignite the second Korean war, a nuclear war on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is the U.S. strategic scenario that it will put the whole of Korea under its control at any cost in a bid to put Asia under its domination and only when it seizes the whole of Korea is it possible to carry out its Asian strategy and, furthermore, world strategy with ease.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. imperialists stake the destiny of the Asia-Pacific strategy on putting the peninsula under their control. That is why they are keen to invade the DPRK by force of arms and occupy the whole of Korea and, furthermore, dominate Asia and the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf a nuclear war breaks out on the peninsula, it will quickly spill over to other countries."

This is an all time high in 52 years since a survey of the poor was made public in the country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWith that number on the steady increase, the poor numbered as many as 49.10 million as of early in November last year. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat is noticeable is the fact that the living of the middle class population deteriorated, joining the ranks of the poor. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is the common view of the U.S. economists that it is the first time since the worldwide economic crisis from 1929 to 1933 that the average income of middle class families reached the lowest level. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe ever-deepening crisis of unemployment is leading to a vicious cycle of poverty. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAccording to data available, the number of the unemployed who remained without any job for more than one year is 4.5 million or almost one third of all the unemployed. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYoung people, in particular, are hard hit by joblessness. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. is now witnessing ceaseless strong protest of people from all walks of life against the corrupt society bringing only poverty and inequality to the overwhelming majority of toiling masses and the misrule of the ruling class. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThat is why the scream of despair that \"a class struggle is going on\" is now heard from the U.S. ruling quarters. Even the U.S. chief executive deplored that this is an expression of feelings of frustration about the American society."

En ese documento, esta anotado que se cumplira como previsto el plan de envio de mas de 690 mil uniformados norteamericanos de refuerzo en el \"tiempo de emergencia\" de la Peninsula Coreana segun \"OPLAN 5027\". \n\t\t\t\t\tEl diario Rodong Sinmun, en un articulo individual de este martes, califica la nueva estrategia de defensa nacional de EE.UU. de la de agresion y guerra para realizar su insaciable ambicion de dominar el mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl informe de la nueva estrategia de defensa nacional refleja la politica norteamericana de dominar, subyugar y agredir a otras naciones y constituye el texto de declaracion de guerra, senala el articulo y prosigue: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSu caracter reaccionario y peligrosidad reside en que EE.UU. politizo el mantenimiento de la estrategia nuclear como factor fundamental para la supremacia mundial y fijo la region de Asia-Pacifico como escenario principal de las operaciones militares en ultramar. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa que fracasa repetidamente su intento de unipolarizar el mundo, EE.UU. pretende cumplirlo con armas nucleares. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas \"provocaciones\" y la \"cohibicion\" aludidas por el imperio no pasan de ser una artimana para mantener y fortalecer sus fuerzas armadas nucleares. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo mas grave del caso es que EE.UU. intenta provocar la segunda guerra coreana, o sea, la nuclear en la Peninsula Coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara tomar el control sobre Asia, es necesario apoderarse de Corea y de esta manera, se puede implementar facilmente las estrategias sobre Asia y el resto del mundo, esto es el calculo estrategico de EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa guerra nuclear que se desate en la Peninsula Coreana se extendera facilmente a otros paises."
