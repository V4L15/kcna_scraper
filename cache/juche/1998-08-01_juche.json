Pieces of bowl and stone spear dating back to Tangun's Korea were also discovered there.\r\n   It has been confirmed that one of the two belongs to the early period of Tangun's Korea (5,000-4,500 years ago) and the other to the late period of Tangun's Korea (4,000-3,500 years ago).\r\n   The altars are three times as large as the one in Yonthan county which has so far been known to be the largest.\r\n   The site of a village covers an area of 150,000 square metres. There were discovered some 40 house sites as old as the new stone age and the ancient period. They date back as far as between the latter half of the fourth millennium BC and the first half of the second millennium BC, all in the period of Tangun's Korea.\r\n   There were also discovered carbonized rice and beans that show the nation's long history of grain cultivation. The rice and beans are 4,980-4,680 years old. They prove that irrigation farming already began when Tangun's Korea was founded.\r\n   The recently unearthed relics show once again that Tangun's Korea was founded as a state in the early period of the third millennium BC and that Pyongyang was the capital of ancient Korea. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
