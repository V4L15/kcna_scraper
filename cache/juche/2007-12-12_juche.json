Paektu showed a brilliant model in defending the leader at the cost of her life from the first days of her revolutionary activities till the last moments of her life. She devoted herself to the liberation of the country and the victory of the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the past, the Koreans have erected her statues and busts in various parts of the country including Kim Jong Suk County, the Revolutionary Martyrs' Cemetery on Mt. Taesong and the Hoeryong Revolutionary Site and given her august name to ten-odd units. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In Juche 70 (1981) Sinpha County and Sinpha town of Ryanggang Province were named after her. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Hoeryong Revolutionary Museum opened in Juche 63 (1974) was reconstructed on an extension basis in Juche 71 (1982) and was called the Museum of the Revolutionary Activities of Comrade Kim Jong Suk. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Among the units named after her are Kim Jong Suk Nursery, Kim Jong Suk Girls' Senior Middle School (present Kim Jong Suk Middle School), Kim Jong Suk Middle School No. 1, Kim Jong Suk University of Education and Kim Jong Suk Teacher Training College. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Her august name was also given to a naval staff college, a general military academy and sanatorium in Kyongsong County, North Hamgyong Province. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Various units of foreign countries have been named after her. Among them there are the Group for the Study of Kim Jong Suk's Revolutionary Activities in Peru, Kim Jong Suk Kindergarten in Mongolia and Kim Jong Suk Class in Tunisia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As many units of Korea and foreign countries were named after her, her priceless revolutionary exploits performed in the flames of the revolutionary struggle will shine long along with the Korean revolution.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

A soldier is allowed to capture Koreans after collecting one sho of noses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On this order, a naval unit of Japan slaughtered tens of thousands of Koreans in 10-odd days, while the boss of the unit, Wakizaga, killed more than 2,000 people single-handed and cut their noses, boasting his \"excellent performance.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Privates also killed Koreans right and left, irrespective of sex, to render \"military services\". They murdered even babies and cut off their noses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Toyotomi nominated seven nose-collecting officers and dispatched them to Korea. They issued a note of confirmation. To cite one example: \"3,487 noses in total taken over.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the noses were salted and packed in big wooden barrels, pots and straw bags by 1,000-3,800, they were carried to Nagoya by sea and then to Osaka. They were reloaded to horse or ox carts and carried to Kyoto through a highway. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Toyotomi gave instructions to drag out villagers and make them welcome the carts along the road, lauding the \"military achievements,\" and bury the noses in the \"nose grave\" after checking and confirming them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this way 185,738 noses of Koreans were buried in the grave. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the later period, the Japanese rulers renamed the \"nose grave\" \"ear grave\", trying to throw the ferocity and brutality of the Japanese into oblivion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the \"nose grave\", without a parallel in the history of aggression, tells that the Japanese invaders were the most brutal man-slaughters.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's Moves for Preemptive Strike at DPRK under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, December 11 (KCNA) -- The Japanese reactionaries are now putting spurs to boosting the capability to defend the metropolitan area from missile strikes, blustering that it is essential to form a dense network for intercepting missiles in order to cope with the \"missile threat from north Korea.\" These outbursts come under fire by a signed commentary of Minju Joson Tuesday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind the noisy call made by the Japanese reactionaries for establishing a missile defence system (MD) while taking issue with missiles of the DPRK is a sinister intention which should not be overlooked, the commentary observes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is provided with a \"nuclear umbrella\" by the U.S. according to the \"Japan-U.S. Security Pact\" and a series of other agreements. An atmosphere of peace and detente is strongly felt on the Korean Peninsula, Japan's neighbor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is, therefore, neither need for Japan to worry about its security nor any justification for it to accelerate the modernization and deployment of weaponry and equipment of strategic nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the very point that makes the Japanese reactionaries feel uncomfortable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is their calculation that only when the situation in the surrounding areas remains unstable and security concern increases, can Japan round off the moves for emerging a military giant, a material guarantee for overseas militarist expansion, at a high level under that pretext. But the situation is developing quite contrary to their expectation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That is why they continue making much ado about \"missile threat from north Korea\" which can convince no one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is paying particular attention to building the MD to protect the metropolitan area for the purpose of rounding off its capability to mount a preemptive attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the real purpose of the Japanese reactionaries' establishment of the MD to neutralize the DPRK defence capability and secure military conditions for making preemptive strikes at the DPRK any time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has already built the military force for overseas invasion targeted not only against the Korean Peninsula but the Asian continent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries would be well advised to be prudent, bearing in mind that their military overseas expansion leads to their self-destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Coinciding with this movement, a nuclear-powered submarine of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces entered the Pusan Port of south Korea, and it is bustling around in surrounding waters for the DPRK-targeted operation exercises. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such moves are a part of the U.S. conservative hardliners' invariable hostile policy towards the DPRK and a reckless criminal act of chilling the denuclearization process in the Korean Peninsula and driving the situation into the brink of war, says Rodong Sinmun Tuesday in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We cannot but take a serious view of the fact that the U.S. bellicose forces are intensifying anti-DPRK nuclear war moves after introducing the nuclear-powered submarine with high performance, in particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said deployment and frenzied nuclear war exercises by the U.S. are evidently an open challenge to the DPRK, its dialogue partner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is contrary to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and the September 19 joint statement. Such reckless moves cannot be construed otherwise than a sinister scheme to obstruct and frustrate the progress of the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The acute political and military situation around the Korean Peninsula convinces the DPRK that there is no other option but to increase the military capabilities for self-defence in every way under the uplifted banner of Songun politics in order to reliably defend the sovereignty and security of the country.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Cada nariz cortada puede significar una baja de parte de los coreanos porque todos los hombres tienen dos orejas, pero una sola nariz. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Entonces, autorizo que cada efectivo atrape a los coreanos vivos solo despues de que llene su bolsa determinada para recoger las narices\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Segun ese mandato, una unidad de la marina de guerra de Japon mato en mas de 10 dias a decenas de miles de coreanos y el jefe de ella Wakizaga mostro sus talentos de maton al arrancar la nariz a mas de 2 mil coreanos. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Para acumular tales \"meritos\", los peones tambien asesinaban a los coreanos sin distingos de sus sexos y edades y recogian las narices hasta de los bebes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Para colmo, Toyotomi nombro a 7 recolectores de nariz y los mando a Corea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Llegados a Corea, ellos expidieron los \"comprobantes\" al estilo de \"Recibidos perfectamente 3 mil 487 narices en total\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Estas narices ensaladas para evitar el podrimiento fueron empaquetados en cajones de madera, cantaros y sacos de paja (cada uno de ellos contenia de mil a 3 mil 800 unidades) y se transportaban por el mar a Osaka via Nagoya. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Desde ahi se trasladaban a Kyoto a bordo de carretas de caballo o de buey. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  A las ordenes de Toyotomi, cuando pasaba el convoy, los aldeanos japoneses acudian a la carretera para elogiar los \"meritos\" y dar la \"bienvenida\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ademas, se realizaba un control sobre esos \"trofeos\" antes de enterrarlos en la \"tumba de narices\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  De esta manera, en esa \"tumba\" tan extrana fueron sepultadas 185 mil 738 narices de los coreanos. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Luego, los gobernantes japoneses cambiaron su nombre por la \"tumba de orejas\" para atenuar el salvajismo y atrocidad de los samurais. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Sin embargo, esa tumba sin precedente en la historia de agresion de los imperialistas transmite a todo el mundo que el imperialismo japones es la banda de verdugos y matones de pesima calana.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
