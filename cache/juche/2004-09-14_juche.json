Korea and U.S. Refuted \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 13 (KCNA) -- South Korea is making much ado that there was a big explosion in Kim Hyong Jik County, Ryanggang Province of the DPRK, on Sept. 9, according to a radio report from Seoul.\r\n It first claimed that the explosion was presumed to be a nuclear test or a forest fire and the explosion took place in Kim Hyong Jik County and then asserted that it might happen in an area along the Military Demarcation Line, not in Ryanggang Province. This is a preposterous smear campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There has been no such accident as explosion in the DPRK recently. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Probably, plot-breeders might tell such a sheer lie, taken aback by blastings at construction sites of hydro-power stations in the north of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The story about the explosion is nothing but a sheer fabrication intended to divert elsewhere the world public attention focused on the nuclear-related issue of south Korea for which they are now finding themselves in a dire fix.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
