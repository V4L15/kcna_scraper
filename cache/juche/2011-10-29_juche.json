            "content": "Kim Jong Il InspectsIndustrial Establishments in Jagang\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\t Pyongyang, October 29 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il gave field guidance to Jagang Province, helping it raise higher the flame kindled in South Hamgyong Province.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Kim Jong Un, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission of the WPK, Ri Yong Ho, member of the Presidium of the Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee and chief of the General Staff of the Korean People's Army, Kim Kyong Hui, member of the Political Bureau and department director of the WPK Central Committee, Jang Song Thaek, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee and vice-chairman of the NDC, Pak To Chun, alternate member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the WPK Central Committee, Ri Jae Il and Pak Pong Ju who are first vice-department directors of the WPK Central Committee and KPA Generals Pak Jae Gyong and Hyon Chol Hae.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The first leg of his guidance was the Kanggye General Tractor Plant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  After being briefed on the technological updating of the plant at the combined production control room, Kim Jong Il went round several shops and watched new products, learning in detail about the production.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching lines of CNC press and other machines and processed goods at each worksite, he expressed satisfaction with the fact that all the production processes have been put on a CNC basis and new technologies have been actively developed to produce quality goods.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the processed plastic goods shop he carefully learned about the use and quality of goods produced during trial operation and listened to the feedback from users. Praising the patterns and value of use of those goods he urged to keep the production afloat with a main emphasis put on improving the quality of goods so as to satisfy the demand of customers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He admired the modern renovation of previous equipment, highly estimating the officials, workers and technicians of the plant for solving scientific and technical problems by their own efforts and updating lots of latest equipment in a brief span of time in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and creation, thereby opening up a prospect for increasing the production.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He dropped in at a sample exhibition room where he said the exhibits help know better about the history of the development of the plant and its might. Learning about the performance of new machine made by the plant, he was greatly satisfied with the successful development of the machine by our own efforts and with our own technology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He watched fire sensor made by the employees of the plant by pooling efforts with teachers and researchers of Kim Chaek University of Technology true to the instructions given by him during his April visit. He praised them for having made the gear urgently needed for extinguishing fire.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also went round a library newly built by the plant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He watched coal briquettes made by mixing coal of low-calorific value with additive as well as the production process chart that were put on display at the library. He gave valuable instructions about it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed great expectation and conviction that the workers of the plant would perform miracle and feats in their drive to put the country's machine-building industry on a higher level. He had a photo taken with labor innovators, scientists and technicians of the plant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The next leg of his guidance was the Jangjagang Machine Tool Factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Going round unmanned process of the machine processing shop equipped with CNC machine tools, robotized flexible production cells, unmanned carrier trucks and automatic warehouse, he acquainted himself in detail with the modernization and production of the factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The unmanned process is a production mode befitting a rich and powerful country as one production cycle lasts 8 hours with the production efficiency several times as much as that in the past even though the work requires complicated processes including technical preparation, production preparation and change of products composition, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He personally proposed awarding Kim Il Sung Order to the factory that has put itself on a high modern and scientific basis true to the party's idea of pushing back the frontiers of the latest science and technology and Kim Il Sung Prize to the unmanned process design and high state commendations to officials, scientists, technicians and workers who performed feats in it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He watched a performance given by the traveling art propaganda troupe of the factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He advanced tasks for the factory, saying it holds an important position in developing the country's machine-building industry. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He then went over to the February 8 General Machinery Plant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Conducted by plant officials, he went round the revolutionary museum.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching relics and historic data, Kim Jong Il recalled with deep emotion the glorious path of development covered by the plant that has turned into a modern machine and equipment manufacturing plant under the wise guidance of President Kim Il Sung.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round several places of the plant he learned about the production and newly produced machines.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Carefully learning about the structure, principle of operation and performance of ultramodern machines produced by the workers of the plant in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, he expressed satisfaction, speaking highly of those machines and the workers who made them. People will surprise if they see them, he added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The people in Jagang Province have produced modern and new type machines as required by the age of knowledge-based economy by giving full play to the spirit of Kanggye. This proves that the country's machine-building industry has been put on a cutting-edge level, he noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also watched new metal material researched and developed by the plant. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He gave precious teachings to introduce the latest scientific and technical successes to the production, underscoring the need to increase the production of new machines and raise their utility rate on the basis of the successes already made by the plant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The next leg of his guidance was the Huichon Ryonha General Machinery Plant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Touring CNC 1 and CNC 2 Shops and other places of the plant, he acquainted himself in detail with the production and development of new products.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching 3-axis, 4-axis and 5-axis and other CNC machine tools being churned out in an endless stream at each modern worksite smacking of industrialization which is bigger than several football stadiums, he expressed great satisfaction over the leaping progress made by the plant in the production of the latest CNC machine tools. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The workers of the plant and scientists and technicians of the Ryonha Machine Management Bureau have produced spare parts of CNC machine tools including main shaft, tool rest, hydraulic booster and ball screw, which had previously been imported, by their own efforts and with their own technology. Therefore, they massively increased the proportion of local production of spare parts in a matter of less than one year and sharply increased the competitiveness of the DPRK-made CNC machine tools at international markets. He highly estimated their efforts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Workers processed products with not much difficulty with the help of newly developed 6-axis CNC grinder, the products whose precision was difficult to provide even though they went through complicated processes with the use of various machines in the past. He admired them and expressed his great pleasure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is something surprising that they completed spare parts processing in the main in the wake of finishing the design of 11-axis composite processing center, a mother machine for processing the main body of machine tool, and entered into their assembling as taught by him during his field guidance last year, he noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also highly estimated the fact that they newly developed geothermal pump, which is easy to make and has low cost and very high heat efficiency, and manufactured modern bottle machines to be sent to the Nampho Glass Bottle Factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He learned about the details of the efficiency of geothermal cooling and heating system introduced to the plant last year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the recent achievements made in the plant hold as great significance as the industrial revolution in the new century, he said that the plant serves as national treasure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that the plant holds an important position in developing the machine-building industry of the country, he set forth the tasks to be fulfilled by the plant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underscored the need for the plant to increase the CNC machine tool production based on the already achieved successes and, at the same time, wage a dynamic drive to develop and produce more high performance CNC equipment of high speed, precision and intelligence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed the particular need to produce at an early date the mother machine for processing the main bodies of CNC machine tools.  He promised to come back to the plant with bouquets of congratulations upon the news of the production of the mother machine.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The officials, labor innovators, scientists and technicians of the Huichon Ryonha General Machinery Plant and the Ryonha Machine Management Bureau who performed distinguished feats in CNC realization are the most valuable assets of the country, he noted, personally inviting them to come to Pyongyang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  He also visited the Huichon Precision Machine Plant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After being briefed on the updating of the newly renovated fuel pump workshop at the general control room of the plant, he toured production site.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Very pleased to see production processes furnished with CNC equipment of high performance and newly-manufactured products, he said: Basing themselves on the latest science and technology, the workers of the plant opened up a bright prospect for radically increasing the production by successfully finishing the difficult and knotty technological updating project that requires high technology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is good that the workers have used such advanced test apparatuses as air measuring instrument and three-dimensional measuring instrument to gauge the quality of their processed products, thus definitely ensuring the quality of products, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said it has become possible to smoothly ensure the accessory processing, which had been done with other countries' help because of imperfect production processes, with domestic equipment at domestic plant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is innovation and rapid progress in developing the nation's automobile industry onto a high level that the plant made it possible to ensure the processing of vehicle accessories requiring the highest degree of precision satisfactorily with its own efforts, he noted, saying with pride: There is nothing impossible to do when determined.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Being told that every production process, including management of manpower and equipment, production guidance, designing and technological process, is controlled by computer after the establishment of combined production control system, he noted with high appreciation that the officials and workers of the plant did great thing in cooperation with Three-Revolution team members.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Praising again the plant for having become able to supply more quality accessories of not only lorry and tractor but also various vehicles requiring the supreme precision amid the high-pitched drive to push back the frontiers of latest science and technology, he urged it to make redoubled efforts for world competition, not conceited with the present success.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality in which vehicles grow rapidly in number needs more accessories, he said, advancing the concrete tasks and ways to satisfy the growing demand for accessory parts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Busy as he was with his field guidance to Jagang Province, leader Kim Jong Il sent a gift to the family of Kim Song Nyo working as road-mender on Kubong Pass."

But it is nothing but sophism to cover up their belligerence and deceive the people at home and abroad critical of them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Hoguk exercises are a very dangerous preliminary war for invasion of the DPRK as they may go over to an actual war anytime in view of scale and content of armed forces involved and their intensity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality clearly shows that the U.S. and the south Korean authorities talk about \"dialogue\" but, in actuality, are watching for a chance to ignite a war by aggravating the situation on the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No one can guess when the puppet warmongers' reckless war exercises and military provocation would spill into what crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As there is the saying \"Curses come home to roost\", their frantic moves for confrontation and war against the DPRK will only hasten their own destruction. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should stop at once the reckless military actions, clearly mindful of catastrophic consequences to be entailed by their scheme to provoke a war."

Estos productos tienen buenas formas y son muy utiles, dijo y anadio que se debe activar la produccion enfocandola en el mejoramiento cualitativo para satisfacer a los demandantes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs loable que los equipos viejos hayan sido modernizados, expreso y aprecio altamente el espiritu revolucionario de apoyarse en las fuerzas propias y el modo de creacion de los funcionarios, obreros y tecnicos de la fabrica, quienes abrieron las perspectivas de aumento productivo al resolver por cuenta propia los problemas cientifico-tecnicos y renovar en un corto plazo muchos equipos como los sofisticados. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la sala de exhibicion de muestras, dijo que aqui se puede conocer bien la historia de desarrollo y el poderio de la fabrica. Y al averiguar las especificaciones de las maquinas fabricadas nuevamente segun sus instrucciones, se puso muy contento de que ellas hayan sido desarrolladas con las fuerzas y tecnicas nacionales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara materializar las instrucciones dadas por el Dirigente durante su visita de orientacion en abril pasado, los empleados fabricaron el sensor de fuego en cooperacion con los profesores e investigadores de la Universidad Politecnica Kim Chaek. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Dirigente encomio a ellos por haber fabricado bien ese aparato indispensable en la extincion de incendios. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEse dia, el recorrio la biblioteca recien construida en la fabrica. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDio valiosas instrucciones viendo las briquetas hechas con carbon de baja caloria e ingredientes agregados y el plano del proceso de produccion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tExpreso gran esperanza y conviccion de que los obreros del combinado realizaran milagros y meritos en la

\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Dirigente estuvo a continuacion en la Fabrica de Maquinas Herramientas Jangjagang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRecorrio las celulas de produccion flexible compuestas de maquinas herramientas CNC y robots, y el proceso teledirigido del taller de elaboracion de maquinas formado por los vehiculos no tripulados de transporte, el deposito automatico, etc., cerciorandose de los detalles de modernizacion y produccion de la fabrica. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste proceso de produccion es el apropiado al Estado prospero porque ha multiplicado la capacidad productiva y fijado en 8 horas el ciclo de produccion sin usar ninguna mano de obra aun en las complicadas condiciones de trabajo, tales como preparativos tecnicos y productivos y alteraciones de la composicion de productos, destaco.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPropuso otorgar la Orden Kim Il Sung a la Fabrica de Maquinas Herramientas Jangjagang, que ha sido modernizada en alto nivel cientifico en acato a la idea del PTC de

\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDijo que la fabrica ocupa una posicion importante en el desarrollo de la industria de maquinaria del pais e indico las tareas que incumben a ella. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl proximo destino del Dirigente fue el Combinado de Maquinaria 8 de Febrero. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGuiado por los funcionarios de la fabrica, el visito el museo de la historia revolucionaria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPasando revista a los objetos y datos exhibidos, recordo con emocion el glorioso trayecto de desarrollo de la fabrica transformada en una moderna base de maquinaria bajo la sabia guia del Presidente Kim Il Sung. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstuvo en varios puntos de la fabrica donde hizo conocimiento del estado de produccion y de las nuevas maquinas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl averiguar la estructura, el principio de funcionamiento y la eficacia de las maquinas sofisticadas fabricadas por los obreros de la fabrica usando el espiritu revolucionario de apoyarse en las fuerzas propias, las califico de excelentes y se mostro muy satisfecho diciendo que ellas son una gran sorpresa. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos obreros fabricaron estas maquinas modernas de nuevo tipo, convenientes a la epoca de economia basada en intelectualidad, manifestando plenamente el indoblegable espiritu y el modo de trabajo de los habitantes de Kanggye, provincia de Jagang, dijo y agrego que esto comprueba que la industria de maquinaria de nuestro pais ha llegado al nivel sofisticado. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEse dia, el Dirigente examino nuevos materiales metalicos desarrollados por la fabrica. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA base de los exitos ya alcanzados, la fabrica debe aumentar la produccion de nuevas maquinas y al mismo tiempo, elevar el rendimiento de ellas, apunto y dio preciosas instrucciones referentes a la aplicacion en la produccion de los logros cientifico-tecnicos de punta. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tActo seguido, el Dirigente visito el Combinado de Maquinaria Ryonha de Huichon. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn varios lugares de la fabrica, incluso los talleres CNC no. 1 y no. 2, se dio cuenta del estado de produccion y del desarrollo de nuevos productos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs muy espectacular el panorama de estos talleres modernos y de belleza industrial, cuya dimension supera la de 4 canchas de futbol juntos, donde se producen mucha cantidad de maquinas herramientas CNC como las de 3,4 y 5 ejes, dijo mostrandose muy satisfecho por el desarrollo vertiginoso registrado en la produccion de esos equipos mecanicos ultramodernos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAprecio mucho el hecho de que los obreros de la fabrica y los cientificos y tecnicos de la Direccion de Maquinaria Ryonha aumentaron mucho en menos de un ano el porcentaje de produccion de accesorios con recursos nacionales y la competitividad mundial de las maquinas herramientas coreanas, al fabricar con fuerzas y tecnicas propias las piezas de maquinas herramientas CNC como el eje principal, las portaherramientas, etc., que eran renglones de importacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe quedo muy regocijado al ver la nueva pulidora CNC de 6 ejes elaborando un producto cuya precision era muy dificil de garantizar antes aunque se usaban varias maquinas en un complicado proceso. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, segun las tareas asignadas por el Dirigente durante su visita de orientacion del ano pasado, la fabrica concluyo el diseno de la elaboradora combinada con 11 ejes, maquina matriz para la elaboracion del cuerpo de maquinas herramientas, termino principalmente la elaboracion de sus accesorios y entro en el montaje, lo cual fue calificado por el de exito sorprendente. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAprecio tambien el hecho de que la fabrica desarrollo nueva bomba geotermica que resulta facil de fabricar con menor costo y tiene alta eficiencia termica, y fabrico modernas moldeadoras de botella a ser enviadas a la Fabrica de Botellas de Vidrio de Nampho. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Dirigente averiguo en detalles la eficacia del sistema de calefaccion y refrigeracion geotermicas establecido el ano pasado en la fabrica. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos ultimos exitos de esta fabrica son tan significativos como una revolucion industrial del nuevo siglo, dijo y agrego que el Combinado de Maquinaria Ryonha de Huichon es una empresa con valor de patrimonio nacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl combinado ocupa una posicion importante en el desarrollo de la maquinaria del pais, subrayo e indico las tareas que debe cumplir esa fabrica. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa fabrica debe aumentar mas la produccion de las maquinas herramientas CNC basandose en los exitos ya alcanzados, y activar el desarrollo y la produccion de equipos CNC de gran velocidad y alta precision e inteligencia, instruyo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, tiene que fabricar cuanto antes la maquina matriz para la elaboracion del cuerpo de maquinas herramientas CNC, dijo y prometio volver en ese caso con ramos de flores para felicitar. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos funcionarios, innovadores laborales, cientificos y tecnicos del combinado y de la Direccion de Maquinaria Ryonha, que realizaron grandes meritos en la aplicacion de la tecnologia CNC, son tesoros del pais para quienes no hay nada que escatimar, apunto y los invito a Pyongyang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor ultimo, estuvo en la Fabrica de Maquinas de Precision de Huichon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLuego de escuchar en la sala de control combinado las explicaciones sobre el estado de modernizacion de la fabrica filial de bomba de combustible reconstruida recientemente, el Dirigente recorrio los talleres de produccion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tViendo los procesos de produccion con eficientes equipos CNC y nuevos productos, se mostro muy satisfecho de que los obreros de la fabrica hayan abierto las perspectivas de aumento trascendental de la produccion, al concluir con exito la obra de reconstruccion tecnica tan dificil y complicada aplicando los exitos cientifico-tecnicos de punta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs loable que se haya hecho posible garantizar la calidad de productos al facilitar a los obreros medir exactamente el estado cualitativo de sus productos con modernos equipos de control y medicion incluyendo el instrumento de medicion de aire y el medidor tridimensional, dijo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAntes realizabamos el procesamiento de accesorios con la ayuda de otros porque nos faltaba un perfecto y moderno proceso de produccion, pero desde ahora podemos hacerlo magnificamente en nuestra fabrica y con nuestros equipos, enfatizo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta fabrica puede elaborar satisfactoriamente los accesorios de medios de transporte que requieren de gran precision, dijo y agrego que esto significa una innovacion y salto que permiten situar en alto nivel la industria automovilistica del pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tApunto con seguridad que desde ahora se puede hacer sin miedo cualquier cosa que se proponga.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInformado de que todos los procesos de produccion, inclusive la administracion de mano de obra, el cuidado de equipos, el mando de produccion y los procesos tecnicos y de diseno, se controlan automaticamente con los ordenadores gracias al establecimiento del sistema integral de produccion y administracion, lo aprecio mucho diciendo que los funcionarios y obreros de la fabrica cumplieron un gran trabajo en cooperacion con los miembros del Grupo por las Tres Revoluciones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tVolvio a elogiarlos altamente destacando que en el fragor de la lucha por conquistar las tecnologias de punta, esta fabrica puede producir en lo cualitativo y cuantitativo los accesorios de autos, tractores y otros vehiculos de alta precision.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLes encomendo que compitieran con el mundo con sus productos redoblando los esfuerzos sin ufanarse de los exitos ya logrados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl incremento brusco de los medios de transporte demanda mayor cantidad de accesorios, expreso y presento las tareas y remedios detallados para satisfacer la creciente demanda de esas piezas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi bien estuvo muy ocupado por sus visitas de orientacion sobre la provincia de Jagang, el Dirigente no olvido a los familiares de Kim Song Nyo, cuidadora de la carretera del pico Kubong, y les envio regalos."

Pero, esto es una sofisteria para encubrir su caracter belicoso y enganar a la opinion publica interna y externa. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tomando en consideracion la dimension, el contenido y la intensidad, los ejercicios \"Hoguk\" resultan una guerra de ensayo contra la RPDC que pueda convertirse en cualquier momento en una guerra real. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La realidad muestra claramente que EE.UU y la banda titere surcoreana hablan del \"dialogo\", pero, de hecho, intentan agravar la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana y su contorno y acechan la oportunidad de provocar la guerra. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Las autoridades surcoreanas deben poner de inmediato fin a sus imprudentes acciones militares, dandose clara cuenta de la consecuencia catastrofica que emane de ello."

            "content": "Resultado de elecciones refleja opinion publica, insiste Minju Joson\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPyongyang, 29 de octubre (ACNC) -- El resultado de las elecciones suplementarias efectuadas en el Sur de Corea refleja la opinion publica de los habitantes surcoreanos aspirantes a la independencia, la democracia, la reconciliacion, la unidad y la reunificacion de la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi subraya el periodico Minju Joson en un comentario individual difundido este sabado y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta vez, las fuerzas conservadoras surcoreanas se valieron de todos medios y metodos para ganar en las elecciones para el alcalde de Seul. EE.UU. tambien  dijo que serian peligrosas las \"relaciones de alianza\" si el campo de izquierda gana en las elecciones,  y apoyo de modo abierto a la banda conservadora.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pero, las viles maniobras de EE.UU. y sus seguidores causaron una gran reaccion de los habitantes surcoreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl candidato a las fuerzas de reforma democratica presento los compromisos politicos de cambiar el mundo en reflejo de la opinion publica. Las entidades de jovenes y estudiantes, las de movimiento por la reunificacion y otras organizaciones civiles y sociales, asi como los partidos de oposicion se incorporaron al comite de medida de las elecciones del candidato a las fuerzas de reforma democratica y libraron dinamicamente sus actividades para echarle papeletas a favor. De esta manera, eligieron a su candidato como alcalde de Seul frustrando el despotismo y arbitrariedad, la estratagema y la ardid de la banda conservadora.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA traves de las presentes elecciones, los habitantes surcoreanos aprendieron las preciosas experiencias de que si se unen no habra nada irrealizable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEllos demostraron nitidamente su deseo y voluntad de la independencia, la democracia y la reintegracion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl balance importante de esta vez es que no habra futuro para quienes recurren freneticamente al servilismo pro-EE.UU., la represion fascista y la confrontacion fratricida en contrapelo de la opinion publica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor mas que maniobre desesperadamente, la banda conservadora no puede detener la lucha de los habitantes aspirantes a la nueva politica y la nueva vida independientes y democraticas sino acelerara su autodestruccion."
