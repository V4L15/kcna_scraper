This is a brilliant embodiment of President Kim Il Sung's idea of great national unity. \r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. It goes on:\r\n This idea is the most just idea of great national unity as it calls on all classes and social strata to place the common wishes and interests of the nation above anything else and unite close irrespective of ideology, ism, political view, religion, property status and social position in order to uphold and achieve national independence. \r\n The above-said movement is a national patriotic movement for defending and realizing the national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is based on the Korean nation's unshakable faith and will to struggle to the last for independence and dignity. For this reason the movement is now strengthening the driving force of the nation, increasing the might of national unity while putting a powerful impetus to the overall movement for independent reunification. \r\n This movement requires all Koreans to unite close as one for meeting the common wishes and interests of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Patriotism is the ideological basis of the movement. It is the movement that helps heighten the atmosphere of national reconciliation and unity nationwide, reenergize the activities for solidarity and unity being conducted by the organizations of the reunification movement involving people of different circles and increase the role of the \"June 15 national joint committee\", a nationwide solidarity organization of the reunification movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The movement also helps meet the vicious challenge of the anti-reunification forces with the might of national unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The pro-U.S. conservative forces in south Korea are now colluding with each other to usurp power through the next presidential election and bring back the era of confrontation between the north and the south. The above-said movement is strong enough to frustrate the ambition and challenge of the anti-reunification conservative forces.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
