And on a secret order, a company consisting of 1.2 times as many soldiers as the fixed number was formed in each province of South Korea. Then battalions and regiments were organised. \r\n   In this way the South Korean puppet army was enlarged to eight regiments as of April 1946.\r\n   The \"coast guards\" was founded in November 1946.\r\n   Meanwhile, they set up a \"military english school\" in December 1945 and a \"naval school\" in January 1946.\r\n   Early in December 1947, the U.S. and the South Korean puppets formed three brigades with regiments already enlarged in each province so that they could assume an \"aspect of the army.\"\r\n   Seven regiments were additionally formed into two brigades from January to May 1948.\r\n   Ordnance, engineer and communications units were organised.\r\n   The U.S. made a \"Law on 'ROK' Army Organization\"  at the end of November 1948 and reinforced the South Korean puppet armed forces into eight divisions in June 1949.\r\n   With the formation of the army, they founded the puppet air force and marine corps in South Korea.\r\n   By such moves of arms buildup, the numerical strength of the South Korean puppet army, air force and navy reached 160,000 including 50,000 police in 1949.\r\n   In the year alone, the U.S. provided the South Korean puppet army with dlrs 190 million worth of weapons and military equipment, which included more than 105,000 rifles and carbines, over 2,000 heavy and light machine guns, 50,000,000 rounds of ammunition, guns of different calibres and shells, 5,000 military trucks, 50,000 mines and other blasting agents, 79 vessels and 20 odd planes. They also enlisted and trained 1,250,000 young and middle-aged South Korean people and students as reserve forces for the war.\r\n   They entrusted the commander of the U.S. Forces in South Korea with training of the puppet army and command of operations in order to take the prerogative of the supreme command over the puppet armed forces.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"
