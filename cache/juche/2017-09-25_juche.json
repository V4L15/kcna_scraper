This is an intensive act of the revelation of the \"U.S.-first principle\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Trump threatened to totally destroy the DPRK, dignified independent and sovereign state and nuclear power.

The real enemy the nuclear force of the DPRK tries to match is a nuclear war itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the DPRK expresses belief that parliaments of different countries in the world loving independence, peace and justice would take this opportunity to fulfill their due missions and duties in realizing human desire for international justice and peace with sharp vigilance against the heinous and reckless moves of the Trump administration trying to drive the world into the horrible nuclear disaster."

            "content": "CRC califica a Trump de gangster que perturba la paz\r\nPyongyang, 25 de septiembre (ACNC) -- El Consejo de Religiosos de Corea publico el dia 25 una declaracion denunciando al viejo loco de EE.UU. que pronuncio el inaudito disparate de la \"destruccion total\" de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t En la actual epoca de civilizacion, completamente diferente a la tenebrosa Edad Media, no hubo ningun mandatario que haya prometido como Trump la \"destruccion total\" de un Estado soberano a plena luz del dia y a la vista del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Asi subraya el documento y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Sufriendo los desastres de la guerra coreana provocada por el imperialismo yanqui, los religiosos de la RPDC calificaron hace mucho tiempo de satanicos y diabolicos a los agresores norteamericanos que destruyeron millares de instalaciones religiosas y mataron a cientos de miles de creyentes inocentes mediante el bombardeo indiscriminado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Tan pronto como ocupara la Casa Blanca, foco del mal, Trump intranquiliza mas que nunca el mundo entero amenazando y chantajeando a todos los paises. No hay duda de que el carece de cualidades propias de un politico y es un bribon y gangster que siente aficion por la guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El disparate de Trump significa la tonteria del psicopata que se halla asfixiado en el abismo de arruinamiento tragico y el ultimo pataleo de los asustados ante el avance vigoroso de la RPDC hacia el futuro radiante.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La justicia y la injusticia son incompatibles al igual que la luz y la oscuridad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La realidad de hoy demuestra claramente que mientras existan Trump y sus lacayos, el mundo no podra vivir tranquilo ni se realizara la aspiracion de nuestros religiosos a la justicia y la paz.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Nuestros religiosos, que aprecian el amor, la paz y la justicia, no pueden tolerar nunca la locura antietica de Trump que actua con frenesi para destruir totalmente el terreno de vida religiosa quitandose la hipocrita mascara de \"apostol de la paz\" y negando la existencia del digno Estado soberano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Todos los religiosos de la RPDC, estimulados por la declaracion del Presidente del Comite de Estado de la RPDC, desarrollaran con mayor coraje junto con todos los militares y habitantes la sagrada guerra pannacional para domar implacablemente con el fuego de justicia a Trump, caudillo de agresion, destruccion y asesinato."
