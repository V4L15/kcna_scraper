But it is no more than a sophism to justify its moves for a new war to stifle the DPRK by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. moves for arms buildup behind the curtain of dialogue indicate that it has no interest in the six-party talks for a solution to the nuclear issue and no willingness to improve the DPRK-U.S. relations through dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration is resorting to third-rate disguised peace tactics, talking about a \"landmark proposal\" and \"wonderful reward\", but it can no longer cover its aggressive nature to stifle the DPRK by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK will build up deterrent force of justice qualitatively and quantitatively to defend the sovereignty of the nation and the right to existence against the U.S. preparations for a preemptive nuclear attack.

            "content": "National Reunification Institute Issues White Paper \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 1 (KCNA) -- The National Reunification Institute made public a white paper Saturday to lay bare the deceptive nature of the U.S. cutdown of imperialist aggression troops in south Korea and bring their aggressive nature home to the people at home and abroad.\r\n The U.S. has staged several farces of troop cutdown since its military occupation of south Korea on September 8, 1945. But history has never seen any drastic reduction of the U.S. imperialist aggression troops in south Korea. On the contrary, the U.S. have bolstered its troops of aggression and escalated its war moves and brought dark clouds of a nuclear war to hang over the Korean peninsula, the paper said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The first round of the U.S. arms reduction between 1948 and 1949 left its imperialist aggression troops in south Korea in the name of the \"U.S. military advisory group\" and all the military equipment of the U.S. forces was handed over to south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. offered 2,627.61 million U.S. dollar worth military aid to south Korea between 1948 and 1950. In less than one year after the U.S. staged the farce to withdraw its troops from south Korea the U.S. instigated the south Korean military to start the war of aggression against the DPRK. The U.S. committed at least 360,000-strong troops more than five times as many as the already withdrawn troops and huge amount of latest type weapons and equipment of all kinds to south Korea under the pretext of fighting a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It set the stage for the second round of reduction between 1954 and 1958. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBut the U.S. 8th Army Command was replaced by the U.S. 8th Army Forward Command and the U.S. 5th Air Force Command by the U.S. 5th Air Force Forward Command. The U.S. 8th Army Command, which had been withdrawn to Japan and merged with the U.S. Command in Far East, was brought back to south Korea only six months later along with the UN Command. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A particular note should be taken of the fact that the U.S. has introduced nuclear weapons into south Korea under the pretext of \"arms reduction\" and buckled down to the work to put into practice its plan to convert south Korea into a nuclear advance base. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has shipped nuclear missiles, nuclear artillery pieces and backpack nuke and other nuclear weapons and units for fighting a nuclear war into south Korea under the pretext of withdrawing GIs that had served during the Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the third round of cutdown between 1970 and 1971 the U.S. deployed nearly 700 nuclear weapons and their delivery means in south Korea under the pretext of making up for the gap and worked out a new scenario for a nuclear war of aggression against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The third round resulted in reducing south Korea to a nuclear base and increasing the danger of a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Between 1977 and 1978 the U.S. staged the fourth round of arms reduction but by the end of the 1970s it scrapped the withdrawal plan itself and conducted Team Spirit and RSOI joint military exercises with south Korea, thus leaving the Korean nation vulnerable to the catastrophic nuclear holocaust. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the 1990s the issue of withdrawing the U.S. imperialist aggression troops from south Korea became controversial at home and abroad and this issue was even brought to U.S. Congress. The fifth round of cutdown was conducted between 1990 and 1992 against this backdrop, but it has been completely shelved under the pretext of the \"nuclear issue of the north\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Particularly, the U.S. has taken the issue with DPRK over its \"nuclear issue\" from around 1993 to find a pretext for a war of aggression against the north and its arms buildup and thus sparked off the worst nuclear crisis on the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This has created a touch-and-go situation on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent farce orchestrated by the Bush administration to cut down its troops in south Korea assumes more dangerous nature than the previous in aggressive and rash nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The arms cut farce of the Bush administration is a product of an extremely dangerous plot to escalate its aggression and war moves worldwide and realize its strategy to dominate the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent measures taken by the U.S. to cut down and reorganize its troops in south Korea do not mean that it downplays the strategic position of south Korea. Instead, they were taken to improve their strategic position and grant more comprehensive mission of aggression to the U.S. troops in south Korea and they are nothing but a sort of strategic and tactical redeployment for a new scenario for a war of aggression and a modern war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is now planning to massively ship latest weapons into south Korea behind the curtain of \"cutdown\" as it did in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration announced it would ship into south Korea a large amount of latest war hardware worth 13 billion dollars for three or four years to come under the pretext of filling the \"military vacuum\" caused by \"cutdown\" and \"redeployment.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. gave military aid worth 10,483,710,000 dollars to south Korea for over 40 years till 1986. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is conducting exercises of promptly committing striking brigades and missile units based in the mainland to south Korea or shipping them into it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And it is also working hard to deploy in south Korea special weapons of new type which were tested in the Iraqi war or are being developed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its plan for a war against the DPRK is being revised and completed in accordance with its new military strategy and \"cutdown\", \"relocation\" and \"redeployment\" of its troops. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aggressive nature of the Bush administration was brought into bolder relief in the \"10-30-30\" operation plan made public by the U.S. Department of Defense in April this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As regards such strategy for a war of aggression, the U.S. is pushing ahead with a plan to establish a U.S. command in Northeast Asia by integrating its imperialist aggression forces in south Korea and its troops in Japan for the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Finally, the U.S. intends to turn south Korea into not only a base for a war against the DPRK but a base for launching a war of aggression worldwide, thus making the Korean peninsula a dilapidated land for a global war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The paper demanded the U.S. withdraw its troops and equipment from south Korea in a comprehensive and irreversible manner and refrain from fooling and deceiving public opinion at home and abroad and resorting to its aggression and war moves, while doing magic tricks of \"cutdown\" and \"redeployment\" of its imperialist aggression troops in south Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

But it made an about-turn in its attitude a month later. It announced that it would put off the timetable for \"cutdown\", talking about the readjustment of its plan for the \"cutdown.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis clearly indicates that the U.S. is using the \"cutdown\" issue as a leverage for a sort of pressure to calm down the anti-American sentiment in south Korea and strengthen its colonial domination over it  The spokesman went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since May the U.S. has deliberately peddled \"threat to its security,\" much publicizing its plan to \"cutdown\" of forces as a playing card for perpetuating their military presence in south Korea and colonial domination over it and making the south Korean authorities meekly accept its demands including additional troop dispatch to Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had, in actuality, no intention to reduce its forces in south Korea. It has been brought to light, therefore, that the U.S. hasty decision to \"cut down\" its forces in south Korea was nothing but a deceptive ruse to achieve its sinister purpose of creating \"security unrest\" in south Korea in a bid to save its position from shaking to its very foundation there. \r\n The U.S. move to delay \"the planned reduction\" of its forces while putting spurs to the arms buildup in south Korea only glaringly reveals its true intention to pursue a war, not dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities' act of joining the U.S. in such dangerous move is a crime against the nation, reunification and peace as it betrays the dignity and interests of the nation to serve the foreign forces and brings dark clouds of a war to hang over the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The spokesman called upon the people from all walks of life in south Korea to clearly see through the nature and gravity of the readjustment of the plan to \"cut down\" U.S. forces and turn out in a more dynamic struggle to get all its forces withdrawn from south Korea to build a new world free from those forces and make a new history of independence and reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But this is nothing but a ruse to use the \"nuclear issue\" of the DPRK for hiding the root cause of the international instability and grievance towards the U.S., a product of its \"anti-terrorism war.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBy building up world public opinion on the \"danger of the nuclear issue\" of the DPRK the present U.S. administration seeks to dodge the world criticism and condemnation of it and use it as a pretext for creating an international atmosphere for pressurizing the DPRK. Its immediate goal is to use this nuclear issue for turning the situation before the presidential election slated for November favorable for it. In a word, the Bush group is keen to meet its political interests at the sacrifice of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But this foolish trick can never work on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the DPRK clarified its goal for denuclearization, the U.S. should commit itself to abandon its hostile policy towards the DPRK and, as the first phase measure for it, should lift the economic sanctions and blockade against the latter, delist it as a \"sponsor of terrorism\" and directly take part in the undertaking to provide energy aid of 2 million kw to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. attitude towards the principle of \"words for words\" and \"action for action\" will serve a touchstone proving its true stance towards the settlement of the nuclear issue.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

An RC-135 took off a military base in Japan on July 1 and 20 and made shuttle flights in the sky above the Taebu islet and Yangphyong and the area 30 km east of Yangyang to spy on the targets in the depth of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The number of cases of aerial espionage by U-2, RC-135 and E-3 reached more than 30 in July. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n 8 tactical reconnaissance planes including RC-12, RC-7B and RF-4C were involved to spy on military targets in the DPRK on July 6, 21 and 23 each and 7 on July 22 on the same mission. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The daily escalating moves of the U.S. imperialists to stifle the DPRK by force of arms increase the need for it to further bolster its military capability.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
