They also took away nearly 200,000 Korean women as \"comfort women for the army\" and forced them into sexual slavery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities should apologize and compensate for such unprecedented shameless crimes committed against the Korean people in the past, it held. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The centre of Indian trade unions in a statement on May 23 disclosed the above said crimes and condemned as a shocking outrage the Japanese authorities' approval of history textbooks in which most of the crimes were deleted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The centre, the statement said, scathingly denounces Japan's moves to twist history and extends its full support and solidarity to the Korean people in the campaign to expose its past crimes.    \r\n\r\n"

It is fully equipped with feed processing facilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The modern milk processing shop produces an average of 2.5 tons of sour milk and 500 kg of cheese and yogurt every day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The increase of production of meat and milk resulted in a several-fold rise in the farmers' cash income. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Kubin-ri was once known as an area unfit for crop cultivation as 80 per cent of it consists of steep mountains and soil is shallow in depth and barren. But today it has turned into a rich farm widely known for successful stock-breeding. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Leader Kim Jong Il sent to the farm superior breeds of goats and more than 10 species of good grass seeds and modern facilities to produce cheese and sour milk. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The prospect of the farm is very good.    \r\n\r\n"

This is little short of defending the Japanese imperialists' past aggression and even covering up crimes related to the \"comfort women for the army\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ulterior aim of the U.S. is to give a shot in the arm of Japan now in the soup over the issue of liquidating its past in a bid to draw Japan closer to its side and use Japanese as a \"shock brigade\" in implementing its Asia-Pacific policy for the realization of its strategy for world domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. unwarranted attitude can never be tolerated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Defending war crimes is as good as instigating them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is also well advised to come to its senses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan continues clinging to the U.S. apron-strings, openly evading the liquidation of its past, it will only bite the dust. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson in a commentary says that the U.S. decision to dismiss the collective suit is an expression of its criminal attempt to woo Japan to play the role of a shock brigade in realizing its strategy for world domination at any cost, giving no consideration to the issue of the \"comfort women for the army.\"    \r\n\r\n"

When the Korean nation fails to maintain the principle  of national independence, it cannot solve the issue of national reunification any time, get rid of foreign domination and subordination and avoid the fate of a ruined nation.\r\n In any case the Korean nation should firmly maintain the principle of national independence. Only then, can it achieve national reunification on which its destiny depends and its prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The banner of national independence is a touchstone which distinguishes between patriotism and treachery and between reunification and division. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National reunification is the greatest patriotism. The Korean nation's patriotic will for reunification should be displayed in subordinating everything to the cause of national reunification  under the uplifted banner of national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is no more than word-juggling to talk about reconciliation, unity and reunification, pursuing dependence on foreign forces without consciousness of national independence. dependence on foreign forces is a treachery to the nation and an anti-national act which makes havoc of the destiny of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The stand of national independence at present should be shown in conducting a vigorous movement for independent reunification under the banner of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article calls upon all Koreans in the north, the south and overseas to wage a more powerful movement for national independence  and reunification in the spirit of the joint declaration so as to achieve independent and peaceful reunification of the country in the near future.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
