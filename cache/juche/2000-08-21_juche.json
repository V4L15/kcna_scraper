Chonma and Mt. Songgo, Kaesong, it is widely known together with Kuryong falls on the world's famous Mt. Kumgang and Taesung falls on Mt. Solak. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is 37 metres high. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At the foot of the waterfalls there is Komo pond 40 metres across. It has been coned out by the cascading water and over which protrudes a round rock called Ryong rock at the western shore of the pond. On a hill east of the Komo pond stands the Pomsa pavilion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At the head of the waterfalls there is Pakyon pond 8 metres across. As a large rock stands high strangely in the middle of the pond shaped like a calabash, water rushes against the rock before falling down. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Sound of waterfalls is reminiscent of thunder. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The waterfalls presents a superb scenery in all seasons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAll species of flowers are in full bloom on rocky cliffs surrounding the waterfalls in spring, it is covered with green foliage in summer, maples turn red in autumn and frostwork is seen in winter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There are over the falls famous historic remains including a 10-kilometre-long wall, the Kwanum Temple and the Taehung Temple dating back to the period of Koryo dynasty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The President Kim Il Sung visited there in August Juche 46 (1957). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Touring the falls, Pukmun (north gate) and the Kwanum Temple, he said that the Pakyon falls is a famous site with splendid historic remains and instructed that it should be built well into a place for the cultural recreation of working people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Pakyon falls and its surrounding area serve as a recreation ground for working people. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA on Sankei Shimbun's mud-slinging at DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 21 (KCNA) -- Recently the Japanese Sankei Shimbun malignantly slung a spate of mud at the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It asserted that the DPRK has \"repeated international outrages\" and \"began striding across the world without liquidating any of them on the occasion of the inter-Korean summit talks\". It was ridiculous enough to express even \"apprehensions,\" saying \"indeed, situation in East Asia remains extremely threatening.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Sankei Shimbun's commentary does not deserve even a passing note as it is nothing but outbursts let loose by those who are much upset by the ever growing might of the DPRK and, at the same time, a foolish and despicable attempt to put a brake on the process for improving the DPRK-Japan relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is disgusting to note that there exists in the civilized society at the turn of the 21st century such base newspaper as Sankei Shimbun which is neither progressive nor conservative but hell-bent on making groundless diatribes and playing tricks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the world press there are mediapersons who style themselves conservatives or media institutions which call themselves conservatives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But there is no such newspaper as Sankei Shimbun which, misleading public opinion with a twisted view of value and logic intended to profoundly confuse right and wrong and speaking for the reactionary forces, has turned into a disgraceful political waiting maid. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Sankei Shimbun can neither be called a newspaper reflecting public opinion nor a conservative one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the mission of the press to carry true reports and convey truth and this is vital to its activities. Any newspaper cannot escape objective censure as a reptile and deceptive paper, if it ignores truth and spreads false stories. This is true of Sankei Shimbun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As everyone knows, whenever the DPRK faced an ordeal in recent years Sankei Shimbun persistently spread stories about \"crisis\" and \"collapse,\" thus delighting ultra-right reactionary forces. Did the DPRK really collapse as this paper predicted? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   On the contrary, the international dignity of the DPRK as a member of the international community is rapidly rising and \"striding across the world\" as admitted by the group of hack writers of Sankei Shimbun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   After all, they have become amaurotic persons who neither discern realities nor analyze developments as they have been engrossed only in base mud-slinging and plot-breeding. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   No malicious slander and calumny can conceal truth. \r\n\r\n"

Threat to the anachronistic presence of U.S. troops in South Korea\" published on August 17 asserted that it is a big mistake for the U.S. to seek the permanent presence of its forces in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Now that the relations between the north and south are improving at a speed beyond one's expectation, \"the U.S. seems to aim at keeping its troops in South Korea at any cost\", he noted, adding that the U.S. logic calling for the permanent presence of its forces in South Korea is little convincing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He stressed that the \"north-south relations should be decided by the two sides.\" \r\n\r\n"
