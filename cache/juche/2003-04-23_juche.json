All this is aimed at executing its policy of aggression toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the U.S. imperialists' attempt to stifle the DPRK has gone beyond the danger line, the process of peace and reconciliation on the Korean Peninsula has been blocked and the danger of a nuclear war is increasing hour by hour. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' attempt to stifle the DPRK is a sheer daydream. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK is the heroic army and people who inflicted a bitter defeat upon the U.S. imperialists who boasted of being the \"strongest in the world\".

It is monstrous that such country talks about the \"human rights situation\" in the DPRK, the news analyst says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the U.S. seeks in raising the \"human rights issue\" as well as the \"nuclear issue\" is to cripple the Korean people's trust in their socialist system and violate the DPRK's sovereignty while impairing its international prestige and increasing the international pressure upon it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Human rights mean national rights and sovereignty is the most vivid manifestation of human rights. This is the truth evidenced by the historical practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nothing can break the Korean people's confidence in the DPRK and its socialist system. steadfast is the singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though the U.S. persistently plays the old tune about \"human rights\", nobody pays attention to it as it will only reveal more faults of the U.S. as a violator of human rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised not to engage itself in such vain efforts.    \r\n\r\n"
