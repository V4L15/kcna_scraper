The DPRK is one of these victims. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Underscoring the need to strengthen the role of the UN through a more positive and correct reform of the UN and decisively increase the authority of the UN General Assembly, he went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The 30th UN General Assembly in 1975 adopted a resolution calling for dismantling the \"UN Command\" in south Korea and forcing foreign forces to withdraw from south Korea and replacing the Armistice Agreement with a peace treaty as a measure to defuse tension and preserve lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 35 years have passed since then, but the state of ceasefire, which is neither war nor peace, is going on in the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the resolution of the UN General Assembly is not implemented, the DPRK's efforts to protect sovereignty and achieve peaceful development are exposed to a constant threat and infringed upon and there periodically prevails on the peninsula an explosive situation that pushes it to the brink of war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK proposed to the signatories to the Armistice Agreement an early start of the talks for replacing the AA with a peace treaty this year which marks the lapse of six decades since the outbreak of Korean war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the talks take place, the UN General Assembly will witness the historic resolution adopted 35 years ago enter into the phase of its implementation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the DPRK remains unchanged in its stand of opposing a nuclear war, nuclear arms race and nuclear proliferation, the head of the delegation clarified that as a responsible nuclear weapons state the DPRK is willing to join all other nuclear weapons states in the efforts to realize international nuclear non-proliferation and safely manage nuclear substance on an equal footing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He categorically refuted the provocative remarks made by a \"delegate\" of south Korea who raised again the \"Cheonan\" case while misinterpreting even the presidential statement of the UNSC dated July 9, 2010 and urged the south Korean authorities to immediately come out for north-south dialogue to solve pending issues mentioned in the presidential statement."

Korea-US \"Treaty\" Demanded\r\n Pyongyang, October 2 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Saturday carries a signed article on the lapse of 57 years since the U.S. and the south Korean ruling quarters concluded the treacherous \"mutual defense treaty\" for aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t On Oct. 1, 1953, right after the ceasefire, the U.S. imperialists instigated the Syngman Rhee clique to sign the south Korea-U.S. \"mutual defense treaty\" in a sinister bid to realize their criminal scenario to put Korea under their control. Pursuant to this \"treaty\", the U.S. has kept its aggression forces in south Korea and established a military control over the puppet forces, turning south Korea into its military base and using the puppet forces as a shock brigade for carrying out its war of aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"treaty\" is a shackling and unequal military pact for aggression as it legalized the U.S. imperialist aggression forces' permanent presence in south Korea and their moves for the provocation of a war against the DPRK and, on this basis, hamstrung the efforts for inter-Korean reconciliation, unity and reunification and brought only submission, disgrace, misfortune and disaster to the south Koreans, the article says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. stipulated in the \"treaty\" the \"right to deploy the three services of its forces in south Korea and its vicinity\" and \"its indefinite validity\", legalizing the U.S. imperialist aggression forces' permanent presence in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"treaty\" made it possible for the U.S. to emerge a de facto ruler of south Korea and intensify its domination not only over the military field but over political, economic, cultural, diplomatic and all other fabrics of its society.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Much upset to see its military presence and the system of colonial rule over south Korea shaking in face of the dynamic advance of the June 15 era of reunification, the U.S. is seeking a way out in tightening the politico-military alliance with south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean conservative authorities' moves to provoke a war of aggression against the DPRK in collusion with the U.S. created such a tense situation on the Korean Peninsula that a war may break out any moment. Their moves also seriously obstructed the development of the inter-Korean relations and threw a stumbling block in the way of the movement for independent reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is no justification whatsoever for such unequal \"treaty\" for aggression as the above-said \"treaty\" to exist at present, the article notes, stressing that it should have been abrogated long ago in the light of international law and the desire of the Korean nation."
