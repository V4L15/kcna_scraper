            "content": "KCNA Commentary Stresses Need to Have Proper Understanding of DPRK\r\n Pyongyang, January 14 (KCNA) -- A sign of acute China-U.S. confrontation is clearly seen in the run-up to Trump's presidential inauguration. And there is awkward rumor afloat in the world that China would use \"north Korea\" as a playing card in its confrontation with the U.S. in the future.\n\t\t\t\t\t The Wall Street Journal and American Interest of the U.S. and the Financial Times of Britain and many other media of the world are carrying articles to the effect that there is increasing possibility for the DPRK and China to jointly counter the Trump administration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A keynote of those articles is that conflict and confrontation between China and the U.S. would have an impact on the situation on the Korean peninsula and that it seems it would be impossible to rule out a switchover in China's DPRK policy including its acknowledgement of the DPRK's access to nukes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This can not be construed otherwise than a unilateral viewpoint of media ignorant of the universal principle concerning the sovereignty of countries and the true picture of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Explicitly speaking, it is illogical to say that the DPRK can be used as a \"playing card\" of others as the country is demonstrating its might as a political and ideological power and a nuclear power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t One has to face up to the reality of the DPRK clearly and squarely, if one wants to know about it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hotspot in which the interests of big powers are intertwined and the issues of international nature have historically accumulated is the Northeast Asian region centered on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Historically, the tense situation on the Korean peninsula and the war atmosphere fanned up on it have been attributable to the U.S. and other hegemonic forces' diplomatic and political purposes and the Korean nation has been the biggest victim of the tension on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the DPRK had not bolstered up and defended its sovereignty, it would have already faced the miserable fate of modern day slaves in the 21st century, not just ending in the \"color revolution\" and Mideast situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Today the sovereignty of countries and nations is wantonly violated in different parts of the world due to the hegemonic forces' high-handed and arbitrary practices and appeasement, and the U.S. and its vassal forces' sanctions and blockade against the DPRK have reached the extremes. Even under such situation the DPRK towered as a nuclear power and a military power in the East no formidable enemies can dare to provoke.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is not an entity sandwiched between neighboring powers. For its treasured nuclear sword of justice it has emerged a powerful force that can spearhead the regional situation as a strategic stronghold in which the vital interests of big powers are intertwined.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A new dynamic structure has been set up with the DPRK as an absolute parameter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nothing can bring down the position of the DPRK that has ranked itself with dignity among the nuclear powers with a firm hold on the treasured nuclear sword of justice in order to defend the sovereignty of the nation and its rights to existence and development and safeguard the regional peace and stability. It remains strong regardless of someone's recognition.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now is the time for the DPRK to steer the solution of the issue of peace and stability in Northeast Asia as it has undergone a fundamental change in its strategic position.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will as ever safeguard its peace and security by its own strength and make a positive contribution to defending the world peace and stability."
