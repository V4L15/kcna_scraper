There you will find people living in smile, though things are difficult.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In light of the NSL its composer would be a violator of the law on incitement and encouragement of infiltration into \"the anti-state organization\" and escape from south Korea, propaganda and praise of the organization, he said, hoping that he would be the last victim to the NSL, the evil law of the era.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Ostrich-like Act of S. Korean Authorities Flailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 10 (KCNA) -- It is said that in the \"defense white paper\" expected to be published this month in south Korea after its suspension from the year 2000, the phraseology \"principal enemy\" indicating the north will be struck out and be replaced with the words \"direct and biggest threat.\"\r\n Commenting on this, a Rodong Sinmun analyst Monday says: This is an anti-national and anti-reunification act which is extremely hostile to the north, the dialogue partner and same nation, and this clearly proves that the south Korean authorities are swimming against the era of the June 15 joint declaration, not awakened from the nightmare of confrontation and war with the fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   These words are little different from the \"principal enemy\". The phraseology \"principal enemy\" can no more be allowed in the June 15 era for reunification in which the idea of \"By our nation itself\" is dominant. That is why the whole nation strongly demanded its renunciation. This compelled the south Korean military authorities to hold off the publication of \"defense white paper\" for several years. They, however, are seeking to maintain the concept of \"principal enemy\" in practice by replacing it with the words \"biggest threat\", far from rooting it out. This is an act of perfidy against the nation, denying national cooperation and challenging point-blank the June 15 joint declaration, which reminds us of an ostrich with its head buried in the sand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the south Korean authorities designate the north as the \"biggest threat\" in the expected \"defense white paper\", it will be an act of denying the nation of the same blood and dialogue with them and it will be as good as announcing the renunciation of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should unconditionally give up the planned publication of the \"defense white paper\" hostile to the fellow countrymen and pursuant to confrontation, mindful of the grave consequences to be entailed by its publication.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S. move to build a unipolar world is bound to go bust when the world progressive people energetically wage a joint struggle.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday says this in a signed article in connection with the voices of the world public getting more cautious about the U.S. unilateralism and arbitrary practices. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is becoming crafty in its moves to cover its ambition to build a unipolar world dominated by it with a veil of \"democracy.\" But this is futile because it is an essential demand for achieving the human cause of independence and the main trend of the present times for the world to head for multipolarization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The arrogant moves of the U.S. to build a unipolar world are now creating a lot of complicating problems in the international arena and triggering off contradiction, confrontation and clash in the international relations. The U.S. invaded and occupied Iraq in a bid to put it under its control as it is of great economic and strategic importance and expand the sphere of its domination over the Arab world, Asia and Africa. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the above-said U.S. move is allowed, it will result in overturning the basis of international law, to say nothing of the development of human civilization, and bring mankind the greatest sufferings and misfortune in its history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality raises it as an urgent task common to humankind to smash the U.S. policy of unilateralism and hegemony as it seriously threatens the development of human civilization in the new century and world peace and stability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should never be allowed to build a unipolar world as it goes against the desire of humankind and the trend of the times in the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The international situation remains complicated and the balance of forces is seriously intertwined, but the struggle of the people for independence against domination and subjugation is getting further intensified day by day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is becoming desperate in its moves to dampen the desire of the world progressive people for independence and arrest their struggle and realize its ambition for domination, but with nothing can it stem the main trend of the times towards independence.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the guidance of President Kim Il Sung, the first generation of the Korean revolution, on the revolutionary principle of arms with arms and blood with blood, accomplished the historical cause of national liberation through the long and hard-fought war against the Japanese imperialists armed to the teeth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is unthinkable apart from the President's wise leadership and Juche-oriented, tough countermeasures that the Korean people won victory in the Korean war (from June 1950 to July 1953) against the U.S. imperialists who had boasted of being the \"strongest\" in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the postwar period, the U.S. continued provoking such incidents as Pueblo, spy plane EC-121 and Panmunjom cases to bring the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war. Each time, however, it could not but drink a bitter cup of water. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tradition of tougher counter-action established in the anti-Japanese war has been carried forward by leader Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the 1990s the DPRK, with such tougher stand, frustrated the wicked plan of the U.S. to completely disarm it and unleash a nuclear war under the pretext of \"nuclear suspicion\" and exposed in all nakedness the falsity of its allegation that the DPRK would \"collapse within three years\" and \"within five years\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration, calling the DPRK a part of \"axis of evil\", designated it as a target of nuclear attack. The U.S. ruptured the DPRK-U.S Agreed Framework and replied to the DPRK's efforts for a DPRK-U.S. non-aggression treaty with \"blockade\", threat of \"military punishment\" and arrogant stand that it might have contact but no negotiations with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAnd it set the International Atomic Energy Agency in motion to internationalize the campaign to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK government thwarted such moves of the U.S. with the statement dated January 10, 2003 on its withdrawal from the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean peninsula still remains the most dangerous hot spot in the world.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
