            "content": "FM Spokesman Denounces U.S. for Taking Issue with DPRK over Flesh Traffic \r\n Pyongyang, July 29 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK Wednesday gave the following answer to the question raised by KCNA as regards the fact that the U.S. recently took issue with the DPRK over flesh traffic:\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. Department of State in its 2015 report on flesh traffic on July 27 slandered the DPRK, referring to the flesh traffic in different countries. It termed the DPRK \"a source of flesh traffic,\" asserting that many of trespassers are sold off to flesh traffickers of other countries and it has made no effort to prevent the practice. The report went the lengths of citing misinformation about forced labor and concentration camps in a sinister bid to malignantly slander the dignified DPRK as it did in the past. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., the worst abuser of human rights and biggest flesh trafficker in the world, shamelessly talked rubbish over the \"human rights issue\" in the DPRK as if it were \"a human rights judge\". This is just like a guilty party filing the suit first and a vivid expression of its hostile policy towards the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has got corpulent through hundreds of years-long slave trade as it was founded as a result of genocide.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is vociferating about any \"flesh traffic,\" telling sheer lies, but no one would pay heed to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is cooking up a flurry of such false documents as it found it hard to bring down the DPRK by force. This is a revelation of its cynical ploy to internationally isolate the DPRK by such poor method of hurling mud at its social system and a carefully worked out scenario to realize the ambition for bringing down the system at any cost. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is an unbearable insult and mockery of the DPRK that the U.S. is trumpeting about any \"flesh traffic\" which can never exist under the former's socialist system whereby the people are fully exercising the independent right as masters of the country and realizing their beautiful dreams and ideals. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The undisguised hostile intention of the U.S. to bring down the social system of the DPRK will only further harden the will of its service personnel and people to defend the socialist system, their cradle, firmly adhering to the Songun politics and the line of simultaneously developing the two fronts as treasured swords."

Based on those war scenarios, the U.S. provoked the Korean war in June 1950.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During the Korean war, Japan turned itself into a military and logistic base for the U.S. and, not content with this, dispatched its troops to Korea and took active part in the U.S. germ warfare.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Later, the U.S. has patronized and rendered assistance to Japan's moves for a military power and reinvasion.
