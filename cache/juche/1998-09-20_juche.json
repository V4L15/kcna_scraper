Among them are ways of easing tensions on the Korean peninsula and creating a peaceful circumstance for national reunification, of pulling down the barrier of division and realizing free visit and total opening between the north and south, of developing external relations on the principle of creating international circumstances in favour of the independent and peaceful reunification of the country and of forming a nationwide united front for reunification.\r\n   The policy speech is also a revolutionary banner to defend and advance the socialist cause and realize global independence.\r\n   Included in it are the way of smashing the imperialists' moves to disintegrate socialism and defending the socialist banner, the question of achieving the unity of the world progressive people in the struggle to prevent war and defend peace and the question of strengthening friendship and solidarity among the world people for global independence.   \r\n \r\n"

However, the South Korean authorities have clamoured about \"help\" in an insidious attempt to destroy pomminryon and Hanchongryon and, furthermore, all the reunification movement forces in South Korea.\r\n   Their harsh suppression of patriotic activities for national reconciliation and unity shows that \"dialogue and reconciliation\" and \"cooperation and exchange\" on their lips are only a sham and a doctrine for confrontation with the north.\r\n   What the South Korean rulers seek in this is to find a way out of the political and economic crisis caused by their sycophantic and treacherous policy of dependence on outsiders and eliminate the progressive pro-reunification patriotic forces against them.\r\n   They must know that they will face a miserable end for their challenge to the people's desire for national reconciliation, unity and reunification.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"
