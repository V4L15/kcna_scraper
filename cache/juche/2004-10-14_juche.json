            "content": "KCNA Blasts U.S. Senate's Passage of \"North Korean Human Rights Act\"\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 13 (KCNA) -- The U.S. was reported to have railroaded through Senate \"North Korean Human Rights Act\" full of articles supporting the administration's hostile policy toward the DPRK, despite domestic and foreign public concern and opposition to it.\r\n The U.S. passed the controversial act through Congress, crying out for \"improved human rights performance\", \"freedom\" and \"democracy\" in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis goes to prove that the U.S. has become most desperate in its efforts to politicize and internationalize the non-existent human rights issue of the DPRK and thus tarnish its dignified international prestige and image and bring down its socialist system come what may. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. regards the nuclear issue and the human rights issue as the two mainstays of its policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK. So, it is making every desperate effort to realize a regime change in the DPRK under the pretext of human rights performance there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is by no means fortuitous that senior officials of the U.S. administration are getting increasingly assertive that human rights and other issues as well as the nuclear issue must be solved for the normalization of overall relations between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Human rights mean state sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Human rights issue is not an issue which allows U.S. interference because under what a political system and by what lifestyle Koreans should live is a matter to be decided by themselves under any circumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the name of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea implies the working people are genuine masters of the state and society and its system is a genuine man-centered socialist system in which everything serves the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the true picture of the society in the DPRK that all the people help and lead forward each other and form a big harmonious family enjoying genuine democratic freedom and rights to the full in all fabrics of social life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for the human rights issue, it is none other than the U.S. which should be sternly judged by humankind for its serious abuses of human rights. Yet it is behaving as if it were a human rights judge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. invaded other countries by force of arms on the basis of misinformation and plot-breeding operation and did not hesitate to shower bombs on innocent and defenseless peaceable civilians including children. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThese monstrous crimes clearly prove that the U.S. is the world's worst violator of human rights and rights to existence. \r\n The U.S., killer of so many civilians, is still crying out for the defence of human rights and world security only to be cursed and censured by the world people as the arch violator of human rights. It is disgusting, indeed, for the U.S. to try to do harm to the inviolable DPRK, talking about its human rights issue, oblivious of its deplorable situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has no justification to sit with the U.S. at the moment, to say nothing of the six-party talks for the solution to the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality clearly proves that the U.S. administration has neither intention to roll back its hostile policy toward the DPRK nor any willingness to co-exist with the DPRK. It indicates that the U.S. talk that it has no willingness to invade the DPRK is nothing but sheer hypocrisy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This fact only hardens the determination of the people in the DPRK to counter the U.S. with strength to the last as it regards force as an all-powerful weapon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will defend Korean-style socialism, their life and soul, as their eyeball and never allow anyone to defile it.    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea, Cancer of Peace and Reunification of Korean Peninsula\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 13 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialist aggression forces present in south Korea to implement the policy of dominating Korea, are the root cause of all the sufferings, misfortunes and disasters of the Korean nation and a cancer-like being to the peace and reunification of the Korean peninsula, says Rodong Sinmun Wednesday in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. military occupation of south Korea was prompted by its aggressive design to dominate the whole of Korea and Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From the first days of their occupation of south Korea, the U.S. imperialists have steadily reinforced their armed forces for aggression there and ceaselessly staged large-scale nuclear war exercises against the DPRK including the Team Spirit joint military exercises, thus increasing tensions on the Korean peninsula and driving the situation to the brink of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Talking much about a \"peaceful solution\" to the nuclear issue between it and the DPRK, the U.S. is on the run day in and day out in arms buildup and war maneuvers against the DPRK behind the scene and is getting overheated in the relocation of its aggression troops. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From the beginning of its military occupation of south Korea, the U.S. has resorted to intrigues to make the Koreans in the north and the south distrustful and hostile to each other and is now becoming all the more undisguised in such moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., not wanting the reunification of Korea, is engaging itself in the anti-reunification moves by manipulating its aggression forces present in south Korea, displeased with the climate of reconciliation of the Korean nation based on the June 15 joint declaration. It is mainly attributable to their interference and obstruction that the inter-Korean reconciliation, exchange and cooperation which had been going on smoothly are now undergoing setbacks and throes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As made clear by facts, the U.S. imperialist aggression forces present in south Korea are the main obstacle in the way of peace and reunification of the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to clearly face up to the trend of the times, promptly abandon its confrontation moves and criminal hostile policy against the DPRK and pull its aggression troops and lethal weapons out of south Korea without delay so that the Korean nation could achieve reconciliation, cooperation and reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
