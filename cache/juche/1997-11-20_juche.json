Korean defector Jong Min welcomed\r\n Pyongyang, November 20 (KCNA) -- Pyongyang citizens met on Nov. 19 to welcome a south Korean Jong Min, who came over to the northern half of Korea.\r\n   Hailing from Mokpho City, south Jolla Province, he, 46, was a director of the Ansan City Sports Society and a member of the \"National Congress for New Politics\", engaging himself in business in ansan, kyonggi province, before defecting.\r\n   An order of the DPRK and prize were awarded and souvenirs were conveyed to him at the meeting.\r\n   Sin An Bang, vice-chairman of the Pyongyang Municipal Administrative and Economic Committee, said in his welcome address that Jong Min's defection to the northern half of Korea is an expression of his longing for the Korean-style socialism centred on the popular masses. He warmly welcomed Jong Min in the name of the Pyongyang citizens.\r\n   He expressed the hope that Jong Min would devote himself to the prosperity and development of the socialist homeland and the reunification of the country.\r\n   Jong Min in his reply said that his defection from south Korean society was aimed at enjoying a true life in the socialist north where the independent and benevolent politics of General Kim Jong Il is being enforced.\r\n   Through his experiences he could clearly know that the south is a society where money is almighty and a corrupt and ailing society where irregularities hold sway, he noted.\r\n   He said:\r\n   \"The leader and the people are united in one mind in the relations of love and trust,  respect and confidence in the socialist north that has General Kim Jong Il as the true father of the people. There is no such country in the world, I believe.\r\n   \"Remembering the deep favours shown by General Kim Jong Il, I will devote my efforts to the generous socialist system and the reunification of the country together with the people in the north, upholding him for all ages.\"     \r\n \r\n"

A \"reform faction\" was formed within the party. Siding with this faction,  intellectuals within the party shook it to its very foundation and were the first to break with it.\r\n   The socialist renegades took such measures as reinstatement of reactionary elements, issuing of anti-socialist reactionary books, \"openness\", \"pluralism\" and plural election, above all, for intellectuals.\r\n   Intellectuals of the former Soviet Union, who had ardently advertized the advantages of socialist economy, completely changed their position and slandered the socialist economic system. They went the length of \"theorizing\" the \"shocking remedy\" in economy, \"benefits from reforms\" and \"happy life in capitalism\", making loud advertisements about them.\r\n   They also took the lead in destroying culture, while press media played a role as \"standard bearers of openness\".\r\n   As seen above, they, failing to penetrate into the counter-revolutionary intention of the socialist renegades, sympathized with them in ideology and took the van in its implementation. By doing so, they weakened the party and state, made havoc with economy and culture and created social confusion and disorders.\r\n   As a result, the former Soviet Union collapsed.\r\n   Realities teach us serious lessons that if efforts are not made to revolutionize and working-classize intellectuals, they are powerless to the capitalist ideology and, finally, they fall victims to the counter-revolutionary acts.\r\n   They also show that if intellectuals abandon socialism, failing to have an unshakable faith in it, they will be destined only to miserable fates.\r\n   There is no boundary in science and technology. But, intellectuals should have their motherland and faith.\r\n   The intellectuals of the former Soviet Union had no such faith, the article stressed.     \r\n\r\n"
