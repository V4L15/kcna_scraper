He showed up at a powder depot in Wonam-ri and told his soldiers to keep women and their children separated from each other so as to make the detainees feel very much troubled and vexed to death, adding that they might be happy to be detained in the same place.\r\n   The Yankees separated the mothers from their children before pouring gasoline at the children and babies who were crying for drinking water and milk. When the children and babies sucked  gasoline and were crying, feeling great pains, the Yankees threw flaming torches to kill them. They also threw explosives at the mothers.\r\n   The American soldiers drowned over 2,000 innocent people by dropping them from Soktang bridge. They also drowned more than 1,000 women in Sowon reservoir. Upwards of 1,200 patriotic-minded people detained in an ice warehouse were bitten to death by military dogs.\r\n   The head of master Yun Hae Won of Jungsan Primary School was sawed up alive. The eyeballs and breasts of chairwoman Pak Yong Gyo of the women's union of the Sinchon Tobacco Factory were gouged out. The enemies disembowled a pregnant woman to hold up a 9 month-old embryo on the end of a bayonet, laughing aloud.\r\n   The yankees massacred 35,383 innocent Koreans, or a quarter of the population of Sinchon in 52 days of their occupation of the place.   \r\n   Exhibited in the Sinchon Museum are 6,465 items of evidences and some 450 pictures showing the man-hunting of the U.S. imperialist brutes.\r\n   A survey group of the International Association of Lawyers published a joint communique in 1952 bitterly denouncing the U.S. imperialists' massacre in Sinchon as an unprecedented-in-scope murder.\r\n   The Korean people will remember the massacre for all ages and requite blood with blood.    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n"

I extend thanks to the agricultural workers, servicemen and helpers throughout the country who successfully finished rice-transplanting with devoted efforts, upholding our party's agriculture-first policy.\r\n   2. All the agricultural workers, servicemen and helpers should, in the same spirit as in rice-transplanting, weed paddy and non-paddy fields four times before the election of deputies to the 10th Supreme People's Assembly, take measures to prevent possible damage in the rainy season and properly manure and tend crops so as to greet the 50th anniversary of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with increased production of rice, vegetable, fruit and meat.\r\n   3. Deeply aware that rice is precisely socialism and that defending socialism reliably is essential for the prosperity of Kim Il Sung's nation, the agricultural workers should perform their duty as the very one responsible for agricultural production, and the whole party, the entire army and all the people should actively assist socialist rural communities, thus reaping a bumper harvest this year without fail.    \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n"

And it will join hands with all the organizations and personages who want reunification, so as to hold the rally with large attendance, it declared.\r\n   Kang Hui Nam, in an open letter to the South Korean chief executive on June 24, said activities of the south headquarters of Pomminryon and Hanchongryon for reunification conform with the interests of the nation and should not be a target of suppression but be encouraged and protected.\r\n   He demanded that the new regime not follow in the footsteps of the  preceding anti-national dictatorial regime but take a turnabout step for the participation of the Pomminryon south headquarters and Hanchongryon in the festival.    \r\n\r\n"

Korea cannot be justified\r\n Pyongyang, July 3 (KCNA) -- On June 29, U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen told the Los Angeles consultative council on foreign affairs that the United States would continue to station its troops in South Korea even after the north and the south of Korea are reunified.\r\n   Commenting on his outbursts, a news analyst of Rodong Sinmun today says:\r\n   This reveals the U.S. brigandish design of aggression to realise domination over the whole of Korea with strength.\r\n   We cannot but take a serious view of the fact that at an official meeting, the chief of the U.S. military unfolded the U.S. plan to keep its troops in South Korea for an indefinite period and use them as major means to invade the DPRK.\r\n   The U.S. troops present in South Korea are military forces which have been deployed on the forefront in order to bring the DPRK under control with strength and realise the U.S. design for aggression on Asia.\r\n   The United States has continuously reinforced its armed forces in South Korea and mobilized them in war manoeuvres as the main force. These forces are wreckers and disturbers of regional stability.\r\n   It is ridiculous and preposterous to describe them as an important factor in \"regional stability.\"\r\n   The U.S. aggressive Korea policy has not changed at all.\r\n   The United States must discard the outdated viewpoint and war psychology and make a switchover in its policy toward the DPRK. What is the most important is the withdrawal of the U.S. troops from South Korea.\r\n   Without the withdrawal of the U.S. troops, the state of truce  and hostilities between the DPRK and the United States cannot be terminated nor can detente and peace on the Korean peninsula be expected.\r\n   If the United States is truly interested in stability and peace in the Korean peninsula, it must take a practical action to withdraw its troops from South Korea.    \r\n\r\n"

However, no one can vouch that the \"institute\" will not be a source of instability in the Korean peninsula and northeast Asia.\r\n   In the past, there were similar \"institutes\" in Japan where plans of invasion of Korea and the Chinese mainland and the pacific war were worked out. In 1948 and 1949 just before the outbreak of the Korean War the United States set up institutes with Kawabe, Hattori and other officers of the defeated Japanese military so that they might work out plans of Korean War and aggression on the far east.\r\n   Japan has historically worked out plans of aggressive war on the plea of \"studies.\"\r\n   The \"institute\" set up by the Defence Agency recently has no ground to deny that it is designed to find a way of staging a comeback to the Korean peninsula and northeast Asia and examine pre-emptive strike. Its mission includes the work to \"guarantee security\" in northeast Asia, rennovate Japan's military technology, adjust defence capabilities and study concrete ways of preventing nuclear proliferation.\r\n   Thus, Japanese reactionaries pave the way for reinvasion stage by stage.\r\n   Without keeping Japan from working for reinvasion no one can expect peace in northeast Asia and the rest of the world.\r\n   It is necessary to sharpen vigilance against Japan. The Korean people are keeping a close eye on every movement of Japan. If Japan dare take the road of reckless military challenge, they will determinedly provide against it.    \r\n \r\n\r\n"

In particular, they have paid no reparation to the DPRK.\r\n   Such behaviour of Japan is very different from that of other nations that were defeated in the Second World War.\r\n   The Japanese government must honestly admit and liquidate its past crimes.\r\n   This will bring benefits to Japan itself.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
