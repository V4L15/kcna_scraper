They are precious cultural wealth of the Korean nation showing its time-honored history and wisdom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tombs were built on hills and on flat areas. Murals were painted on ceilings and walls of loculus. A tomb consists of a loculus and a corridor leading to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The floor of the tombs was tamped with river stones, sand, charcoal and lime. They have drainages. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The walls of the loculus were laid with well-trimmed stones, each weighing several tons at maximum. The outside walls were filled with small stones and covered with mixed clay, line and charcoal. The inside walls were plastered with slaked lime. The walls of some tombs were made with well-trimmed big stones or several plain rocks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe loculus sizes are different, the biggest covering 40 square meters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The shapes of ceilings are vaulted, octangle and quadrilateral. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Buried in the tombs were bodies and their favorites. Seen on the walls and ceilings are figure and genre paintings and  four guardians. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are no cracks between flat stones and no change in the color of murals though a thousand and hundreds of years have passed. They clearly show the distinguished stone-processing and drawing skill of Koguryo people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koguryo tombs with murals serve as valuable historical materials reflecting the then society. They are of great significance in studying the development of oriental culture in the Middle Ages, too.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "New Historical Relics Unearthed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 19 (KCNA) -- A research group of the Institute of Archaeology of the Academy of Social Sciences recently unearthed new historical relics in Richon-ri, Sungho District of Pyongyang.\r\n It has conducted an extensive work to discover relics and remains dating back to the period before and after the establishment of Tangun Korea in the River Taedong basin centred on Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Richon-ri relics have been unearthed in this course. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They were found in the alluvial plain formed between the River Taedong and its branch River Nam. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The research group confirmed the distribution of the relics in a wide area covering 300,000 square meters. It has extensively surveyed and unearthed an area covering 50,000 square meters for the last several years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It finally succeeded in unearthing clayware-pot sites dating back to the Neolithic age, tile pot sites belonging to the period from late Koryo to the early days of Ri Dynasty, house sites dating back to the period from the Neolithic age to the era of Tangun Korea, dolmens, brick tombs and more than thousands of pieces of remains. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The clayware-pot sites looked like dugouts. Found in the center of each round room shape dugout floor is a big hollow for making fire 1 meter in diameter and 0.8-0.9 meter in depth.. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Findings around the hollow included relics tantamount to ten pieces of calcified clayware. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Archaeologists assume that the newly unearthed pot sites are much older than those clayware-pot sites dating back to the Neolithic age about 6,000 years ago in Honam-ri, Samsok District of Pyongyang, judged by the structure of sites and shape of clayware discovered there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, each of the tile-pot sites belonging to the period from late Koryo to the early days of Ri Dynasty found in a row has a main structure of a pot including fireplace, calcination room. Convex and concave tiles are kept in their original state in the calcination room. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The new important discovery of clayware-pot sites dating back to the Neolithic age, the oldest in Korea up to date, and the tile-pot sites belonging to the middle ages in the Taedong River basin close to the central area of Pyongyang offers another clear proof of the historical position of Pyongyang as a cradle of human civilization and a cultural hub. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Sites of big villages dating back to the period of Tangun Korea were also unearthed in Richon-ri. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The relics unearthed there and the stratigraphic layers of sites of houses serve as an important yardstick whereby to scientifically prove the respective age of the sites of houses belonging to the period of top shape earthenware believed to be used in the Taedong River basin and provide another basis for systematizing the law-governed process of cultural development in the period of Tangun Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Various kinds of weapons such as stone dagger, spearhead and arrowhead and tools including stone axe, adze, plane, chisel, sinker of net and ancient spinning-wheel were found in sites of houses. They bear witness to the then very delicate and high skill of making stone tools.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
