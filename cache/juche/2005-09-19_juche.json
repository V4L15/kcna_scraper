This is an open provocation to Syria and a vicious military threat to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is using the \"war against terrorism\" as leverage to infringe upon the sovereignty of those countries that fall out of its favor and interfere in their internal affairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., displeased with Syria's anti-U.S. and independent stand, is working hard to overthrow Syria's progressive regime, which is exercising influence on the Mideast, and make it \" second Iraq\" after the U.S. forces' occupation of Iraq. \r\n It is the trite trick of the U.S. to shuffle off the responsibility upon others and seek a new pretext for aggression when it is driven into a tighter corner.\r\n By labeling Syria a \"terrorism sponsor\" the U.S. seeks to shift the responsibility of the U.S. forces in Iraq and the Iraqi authorities for failing to control the Iraqi border onto Damascus, cover up Washington's setback in maintaining security in Iraq and stifle Syria. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With no machination can the U.S. stifle Syria advancing along the road of independence and progress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. moves to stifle Syria are bound to miscarry.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is too naive to demand such a thing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our stand is that the U.S. had better not even dream of this. \r\n It is said that even at this time the U.S. Department of Defense is contemplating making its doctrine of preemptive nuclear attack official. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under this situation we can never accept its demand that we dismantle our nuclear program first. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We demanded the provision of LWRs, deeming it as a basic benchmark for confidence building between the DPRK and the U.S. and said it would put their operation under a joint control and receive inspection, too, in consideration of the latter's concern. \r\n Our demand , therefore, is not far-fetched. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. persistently insists that it would not provide LWRs, a basic benchmark for confidence building, we will not be able to suspend even a moment the peaceful nuclear activity of our own style. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is, therefore, our position that the U.S. may provide LWRs to us or not. \r\n We are free to go our own way in accordance with our Songun line.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Only when the Koreans in the north, the south and overseas firmly unite as one can they emerge a powerful engine and a decisive force for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Great national unity is aimed at protecting and achieving national independence under any circumstances. The Koreans should achieve the great unity of the whole nation whereby they regard the principle of national independence as their life and soul and thoroughly reject flunkeyism and dependence on foreign forces. They should invariably put up the idea of \"By our nation itself\" as that of the era and consolidate the solidarity and unity under its banner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is essential for the movement for national reunification to remain true to the June 15 joint declaration and implement it to the letter. The 70 million Koreans, a driving force for national reunification as it is directly responsible for it, should take the lead in the vigorous nation-wide struggle to thoroughly implement the declaration. This is the only way of accomplishing the cause of national reunification, the greatest and cherished desire of the nation, as early as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans should find the worth and pride of their genuine life in devoting themselves to the sacred cause of national reunification, linking their own destiny with that of the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
