He held even the post of the chairman of the personal affairs committee of Chongwadae and let those who curried favor with him hold the important posts of Chongwadae and the Administration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than Kim Ki Chun who made sure that Mun Chang Guk, a heinous pro-Japanese traitor, was designated as puppet prime minister.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim engineered the operation for the nomination of Mun who worked as director of the \"Park Chung-Hee Memorial Foundation\" when he was active as its director general, and patronized Mun to the last despite public opposition.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is also none other than Kim who had his clans hold the posts of the chief prosecutor and the director of the Board of Audit and Inspection at the time of personnel changes last year, sparking a big furor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim is a heinous anti-reunification confrontation maniac who openly called for \"unification of social systems\" while malignantly slandering the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration and labeling the north-south cooperation undertakings as \"drain on resources\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The inter-Korean relations are being driven into a serious catastrophe and the situation is being extremely aggravated because such villains as Kim are commanding all the conspiratorial rackets of the anti-reunification ultra-right conservative forces for escalating confrontation with the DPRK while having the final say on \"the policy toward the north\" at the important posts of Chongwadae.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If such a guy is allowed to stay in power, the south Korean people can not avoid disaster and the inter-Korean relations will go bankrupt.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Opposition parties and people from all walks of life in south Korea are strongly demanding the resignation of Kim, and media and experts on the situation are warning that if Park Geun Hye continues to take him under her wing, it will cause bigger misfortune.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park should lend an ear to public mindset and voices and understand that it is the way of tiding over the worst crisis, a way beneficial to her.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If not, Chongwadae will face greater people's resentment and the most disgraceful ruin, the information bulletin warned."
