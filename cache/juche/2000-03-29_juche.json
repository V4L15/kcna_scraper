Paektu for several days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He looked round the secret camp on Mt. Paektu, the Sajabong secret camp, the Chongbong camping ground and other historical battle sites where the President Kim Il Sung conducted brisk military and political activities during the anti-Japanese armed struggle after advancing into the homeland, commanding the Korean People's Revolutionary Army, and acquainted himself in detail with the management of the revolutionary battle sites and the education of people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He noted with great satisfaction that the officials, party members and other people of the management offices of the revolutionary battle sites have established a flawless system for the permanent preservation of valuable relics, arranged battle sites well and carried out the effective education of people and soldiers in the revolutionary tradition and highly praised their deeds. And he showed deep loving care for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Going round the log cabin of the headquarters, barracks, slogan-bearing trees and other relics preserved at the secret camp, he said that the President was a legendary hero and peerlessly great man. The undying revolutionary exploits performed by the President will always remain in the hearts of the Korean people, he stressed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The brilliant revolutionary tradition established by the President during the protracted anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle are strong roots of the Worker's Party of Korea and revolution of Korea, he said, adding that to intensify the education in the revolutionary traditions is a basic guarantee for accomplishing the revolutionary cause started by the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the steadfast will and determination of the WPK to defend, inherit and develop the revolutionary tradition for ever and accomplish the Korean revolution on the basis of these great traditions, he noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He set forth highly important tasks which will serve as guidelines in improving the management of the battle sites and intensifying education through them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He called upon all the party members and other working people to glorify this year, the WPK's 55th anniversary with signal victory in the crucible of greatly increased activity of chollima by comprehensively and thoroughly applying in their life and work the revolutionary and militant spirit and way of life of the anti-Japanese guerrillas under the party's slogan, \"Let Us Produce, Study and Live as the Anti-Japanese Guerrillas Did \"   he appreciated an art performance given by lecturers and keepers of the secret camp on Mt. Paektu and noted with great satisfaction that they gave a lively and truthful performance the way the anti-Japanese guerrillas did. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHe was accompanied by secretary of the WPK Central Committee Kim Yong Sun, director of the party history institute Kang Sok Sung and first vice department directors of the WPK Central Committee. \r\n\r\n"

It is 15 to 20 cm in length and weighs 0.13 to 0.16 kg. Its fur color varies according to the season: Light maroon in summer and gray in winter. Its furs are soft and thick but lacking on the pads. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It does not hibernate, so it gathers in green grass for winter food and spreads it for drying, before piling it up just inside its burrow.

Another origin is that dance was performed whenever a process of farm operation was over in order to set their minds at rest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHence the name. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Shoulder dance was one of the favorites among the farmers. It is that its rhythmic character makes their heavy burdens on the body and mind lighter and spurs them to renewed vitality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It was universally practiced in every part of Korea, the typical of which was found in the Unryul area in South Hwanghae Province. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The dancer's body has a natural appetite for rhythm, sometimes moving his or her shoulders in one place and sometimes by means of stylized movements, while walking. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nShoulders are drawn up alternately, which is peculiar to this area. When practiced, children will look very pretty, the middle-aged awkward and the elderly funny. The dance stimulates the watchers to vibrant response or provokes laughter. Unryul people used to have this dance to relieve their fatigue in leisure times and holidays. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Shoulder dance still gains popularity with the Koreans, acquiring a broader mass basis, spiced with local flavor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt has been enlarged into a form suitable for stage presentation by professional art organizations, including the Wangjaesan Light Music Band. \r\n\r\n"

This should be implemented as a measure for simultaneous action,  the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But the LWR project, one of the U.S. commitments, is delayed and expected to be completed in 2007 or later. This is entirely attributable to the U.S. wrongdoings for which it is to blame. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Now that it has become clear the lwr project will not be completed by 2003, the U.S. Has to choose between two options: To complete the LWR by 2003 as it promised in the U.S. president's message of assurance or  take a step to compensate for the loss of electricity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the issue of compensation for the loss of electricity is not settled, the DPRK will be left with no option but to restart the nuclear power industry of its own style. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Whether the U.S. compensates for the loss of electricity or not is vital to the implementation of the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK will not remain a passive onlooker if the U.S. fails to take any measure for compensation for the loss of electricity caused by the delay of the LWR construction. \r\n\r\n"

It is not the stand for the improvement of relations to sidestep this issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The talks should not be subject to coercion or assertion of one side. They can succeed only when their partners share understanding and views on the pending issues and stand for settling them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The soon-to-be resumed talks should not take the same course as covered by the past talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the talks are to succeed, they should take up the pending issues as the topic of discussion and other issues which are nothing in common with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is obvious that success or failure of the talks depends on Japan's attitude and stand on the talks.   Japan is well advised to bear this in mind and approach the talks from the stand to push them and settle the issues. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Check of Japan's preaching of militarism called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 29 (KCNA) -- a Japanese history book titled \"history of the people\" recently published by Sankei Shimbun is aimed at training Japanese as fanatic fascists and militarists and using them as cannon fodder for overseas aggression in future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The book does not deal with a complete history of Japan from its ancient history to its modern history. It is like a collection of papers which deal with relevant historical facts under 34 sub-titles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It preaches ultranationalism, tampering with its history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt openly advertise the strength-is-all-powerful logic and dominationism based on the jungle law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The strength-is-all-powerful logic and dominationism assert, among other things, that Japan's aggression and colonial rule in the past were required by the laws of history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe book describes Toyotomi's invasion of Korea in the 16th century as a \"dispatch of forces\", not aggression, asserts that it was prompted by its \"plan to build a world state\" and justifies it with the nonsensical words of Japan's \"expression of awareness of modern times.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It was an intolerable criminal act that Japan ceaselessly invaded Korea in the past and finally occupied it by a brigandish method. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan's imprudent assertion that it committed crimes to meet the requirements of the law of history is just like a homicidal robber insisting that what he has done was required by the law governing the human survival. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This logic and dominationism also advocate that there is no need for Japan to feel guilty about its past crimes but approach everything from a stand of the strong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The book says one must neither feel guilty about what happened in the past as an inevitable requirement of history nor apologize for it but remain calm. This means that the monstrous crimes committed by the Japanese in the past were necessitated by the law of history and accordingly, Japan is not to blame for them and there is no need for it to apologize for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese militarists make a subjective interpretation of all aspects of the history of Japan in their favour, arguing that the objective history is nothing but illusion and history is not a science but made by words. However, this is a day dream. History is not decided by the bellicose outcries of the militarists but exists as a stark objective reality and develops along its own track. \r\n\r\n"
