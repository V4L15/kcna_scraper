And he said that the hall is well built with locally available materials and its soundproof is admirable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also went round the greenhouse without a heating system, mushroom cultivation room and breed-fish ground.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the academy is good at bean growing, mushroom cultivation and fish breeding, as demanded by the Party, he said that it is cultivating many agaric funguses at the greenhouse by solving the issue of substrate by use of bean straw and breeding such various species of fishes as grass fish, Ryongjong fish and catfish after building breed-fish ground and feed production base on its own efforts and even planted frijol on non-farming land. This shows that its officials use their own brains and work hard to carry out the policies of the Party, he added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The teaching staff of the academy have done good things, fully implementing all of what the Party instructed, he said, stressing that such eye-opening achievements could be made as the academy worked on the Party's idea and line, regarding them as standards and yardstick of its activities. He estimated the academy as a brisk unit thorough in implementing the Party's instructions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Expressing his pleasure over the inspection of the academy, he repeatedly praised it as an exemplary unit for the entire army as well as the whole country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He gave an instruction to widely introduce and generalize the successes and experience of the academy to the entire army and the whole country and launch a vigorous campaign of modeling after it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had a photo session with its teaching staff and servicepersons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accompanying him were Hwang Pyong So and Pak Jong Chon."

However, all proposals for resuming dialogue were neglected and turned down. Under this situation the DPRK cannot but interpret all the U.S. 'peace declarations' as nothing but fig-leaf to cover up its sinister intent. Therefore, the DPRK has no other choice but to focus on increasing the defence capability. To this end, the DPRK is bolstering up its nuclear deterrence, among other things.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an objective and fair observation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A British expert on Korean affairs in an article dedicated to the UK paper Guardian asserted that north Korea's access to nukes is an established fact and north Korea will never give up its nuclear program, adding diplomacy is the only way for settling the nuclear issue of north Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was known that the U.S. Department of Defense in an annual report in 2008 termed the DPRK nuclear weapons state, creating a stir. It was reported recently that the bill on national defense right now under discussion at the U.S. Senate contains an expression that the DPRK is a \"nuclear weapons state,\" sparking sensation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is opinion in the U.S. about whether its Congress began to recognize north Korea as \"a de facto nuclear weapons state\". There are even assertions that the nuclear issue of north Korea should be dealt with after recognizing it as \"a de facto nuclear weapons state.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the final analysis, this means the DPRK's access to nukes became an established fact long ago and the international community recognized the DPRK as a nuclear power standing against the U.S. nuclear blackmail and threat, no matter who recognizes it or not.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said facts prove with added clarity that the DPRK was quite just when it insisted on the stand that nuclear weapons have to be countered in kind and that the nuclear stick of the aggressors must be broken with a treasured nuclear sword of justice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Clear is the reason why the DPRK opted to bolster the nuclear force, not just content with its access to nukes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is because the U.S. has persistently pursued its anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK and the countries concerned responsible for it are not making efforts for the detente on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An international internet site headquartered in London in a recent article said north Korea showed off its military muscle through the test of SLBM early in May. Some countries said it gave a shock to regional security. But north Korea's traditional rivals are resorting to all the more threatening acts. Neighboring countries are not making any effort for detente even though they are well aware of this. It is impossible to settle the nuclear issue without defusing tension on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is by no means fortuitous that the Russian Foreign Ministry said the resumption of the six-party talks and the diplomatic solution to the issue can be possible through the defusing of the tense military and political situation on the peninsula and in its vicinity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is self-evident that the greater threats the U.S. and its followers pose to the DPRK by resorting to all sorts of muscle flexing, the stronger the self-reliant defence capabilities of the DPRK will grow with main emphasis on the nuclear force. This can never be subject to controversy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Action is bound to invite reaction and the DPRK's reaction is stronger countermeasure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Taking this opportunity, we would like to solemnly warn the U.S. and its followers once again that those who step up their hostile policy toward the DPRK will only face self-destruction."

Para ese fin, ella consolida el disuasivo nuclear.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs la estimacion objetiva e imparcial sobre la posesion de armas nucleares y la consolidacion de las fuerzas armadas nucleares de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOtro especialista en asuntos coreanos insistio en su articulo publicado en el periodico britanico Guardian que es un hecho consumado la posesion de armas nucleares de la RPDC. Y apunto que la RPDC no renunciara nunca las armas nucleares y que la solucion del problema nuclear del Norte de Corea depende de los medios diplomaticos\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor otra parte, el Departamento de Defensa norteamericano registro en su informe anual de 2008 la RPDC como pais poseedor de armas nucleares. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY hace poco, el articulo intitulado \"Estimacion sobre el ambiente nuclear del mundo\" del \"proyecto de ley para autorizacion de defensa nacional\", que esta en analisis en el  senado estadounidense, fijo a la RPDC como \"pais dotado de armas nucleares\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el interior de EE.UU. se preguntan si el congreso comienza a reconocer el Norte de Corea como \"pais con armas nucleares\" y se presenta hasta la insistencia en que hay que tratar el problema nuclear del Norte de Corea reconociendolo como \"pais poseedor de armas nucleares\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo vemos, la posesion de armas nucleares de la RPDC se hizo un hecho consumado y la sociedad internacional la reconoce como disuasivo para hacer frente a la amenaza y chantaje nucleares de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo se necesita cuestionar mas la posesion de armas nucleares de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY se ha comprobado otra vez que es justa la posicion de la RPDC de responder a las armas nucleares con las armas nucleares. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNos vemos obligados a consolidar de continuo las fuerzas armadas nucleares, debido a la anacronica politica norteamericana de hostilidad a la RPDC y al desprecio de los paises interesados al alivio de la tension de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl sitio web internacional con sede en Londres \" Global Risk Insides \" transmitio que a principios de mayo pasado el Norte de Corea manifesto sus fuerzas armadas a traves del lanzamiento de prueba de proyectil balistico de submarino. Continuo que algunos paises lo describieron como un \"impacto\" a la seguridad regional, pero los tradicionales paises hostiles muestran acciones mas amenazantes y los  paises perifericos no hacen esfuerzos por el alivio de la tension aunque lo conocen. Enfatizo que es imposible resolver el problema nuclear sin el alivio de la tension de la Peninsula Coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn tal circunstancia, el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Rusia expreso la posicion de que la reanudacion de las conversaciones a 6 bandas y la solucion diplomatica de este tema son posibles solo por la distension de la situacion politica y militar de la Peninsula Coreana y su contorno. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuanto mas EE.UU. y las fuerzas hostiles intensifiquen la amenaza contra la RPDC recurriendo a la provocacion de guerra y a las intrigas de toda indole, mas consolidaremos la capacidad de autodefensa nacional mediante las fuerzas armadas nucleares. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn esta oportunidad advertimos de nuevo a EE.UU. y las fuerzas hostiles que las fanaticas maniobras de hostilidad a la RPDC les llevaran al arruinamiento."
