Those years have witnessed achievements unprecedented in the north-south relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There were twists and turns owing to the moves of foreign forces to obstruct the reconciliation, cooperation and reunification of the Korean nation. But the north and south have held more than 140 talks and contacts including 21 rounds of ministerial talks and 13 rounds of meetings of the north-south committee for the promotion of economic cooperation. Both sides have briskly pushed ahead with the national economic collaboration such as the tourism of Mt. Kumgang and the construction of the Kaesong Industrial Zone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this period the severed railway lines and roads were relinked, air and sea routes opened and reunification activities of the north and the south held with large attendance on the occasion of the commemoration days common to the nation including August 15 and June 15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the functions held in Pyongyang, Seoul, Mt. Paektu, Jeju Island and other parts of the north and south of Korea, fellow countrymen raised cheers calling for reunification all over the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The scenes showing joint entrance of the athletes from the north and the south with the Korean peninsula flag in their van and the joint cheering in international sports competitions stirred up the enthusiasm of the Korean nation for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present stirring realities in which the Korean nation is glorifying the June 15 reunification era, attaching importance to the nation, defending peace and achieving unity, clearly show the validity and tremendous vitality of the three charters.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Marking the East Sea of Korea as \"Sea of Japan\" was a product of the Japanese imperialists' policy of colonial occupation and domination over Korea. Japan's persistent insistence that the East Sea of Korea be marked as \"Sea of Japan\" though 60 years have passed since the defeat of Japanese imperialism is little short of calling back the departed soul of the Japanese imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's sophism that the marking of the East Sea of Korea as \"Sea of Japan\" is \"internationally recognized\" is nothing but a sheer distortion of the reality and a foolish ruse to justify its brigandish act.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And it has been massively deploying latest attack weapons and war equipment in and around south Korea while ceaselessly staging such large-scale war exercises against the DPRK as RSOI, Foal Eagle and Ulji Focus Lens joint military maneuvers in an attempt to carry out the preemptive nuclear attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But for the strong war deterrent built up by the DPRK for self-defence, another war would have already broken out on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The main link in the struggle for peace against war is to get the U.S. imperialist aggression forces withdrawn from south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The forces are a field executor of the U.S. policy of aggression on the DPRK. Today when the atmosphere of reconciliation and unity is growing stronger and \"Our nation by itself,\" the idea of national independence, serves as the idea of nationwide reunification and patriotic movement on the Korean Peninsula, there is no justification for the U.S. to keep its aggression forces in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The pro-American conservative forces in south Korea supporting the outsiders' aggression and war moves become a main target of the anti-war peace struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said forces including the Grand National Party of south Korea are a group of traitors and warmongers seeking to bring disasters of war to the peninsula by toeing the U.S. policy of aggression on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people from all walks of life in south Korea should intensify the anti-GNP struggle under the banner of the great alliance against the conservatives and thus deal a telling blow of history to the pro-American reactionary conservatives who are hell-bent, in collusion with foreign forces, on the anti-reunification confrontation moves and maneuvers for war against the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
