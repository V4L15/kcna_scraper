Korea and Its Vicinity Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 24 (KCNA) -- The United States is massively deploying its troops equipped with ultra-modern weapons in and around south Korea.\r\nThis is a forward-deployment of U.S. troops to provoke the second Korean war, observes Rodong Sinmun Friday in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. claims that this action is aimed to fill up a vacuum caused by the cutdown of U.S. troops. But this is, in fact, nothing but a reckless measure for putting into practice its scenario for another war of aggression and a full-dressed drive for a military operation for the second Korean war as it means reinforcing troops equipped with modern weapons to fight a war, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The massive redeployment of the U.S. troops in and around south Korea is in pursuance of the U.S. war strategy to wage a blitz warfare in Korea through a preemptive attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. massive shipment of ultra-modern war means and supplies into south Korea and areas around it is aimed to carry out the military operation pursuant to this strategy. The U.S. bellicose forces seek to preempt an attack on the DPRK any moment after deploying aggression troops in south Korea, Japan and other areas around the Korean peninsula in the Asia-Pacific region. The core force in the U.S. military deployment for carrying out the second Korean war is a nuclear attack force. The nuclear attack force constitutes the backbone of the U.S. troops deployed in the areas. It is the U.S. intention to conclude the Korean war by preemptive nuclear strikes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. policy of aggression against the DPRK has become all the more pronounced as the days go by and this pushes the situation on the Korean peninsula to the worst phase. The \"cutdown\" of the U.S. troops and the \"filling of vacuum\" much touted by the U.S. is nothing but a gimmick to cover up the true dangerous nature of its criminal hostile policy against the DPRK and round off the preparations for the second Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. ruckus over the nuclear issue in the DPRK is aimed to disarm the DPRK and invent a pretext for starting a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. imperialists ignite the second Korean war of aggression at any cost, the army and people of the DPRK will take the opportunity to finally settle accounts with the U.S.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
