            "content": "International Seminar on Juche Idea closes\r\n  New Delhi, April 14 (KCNA) -- The International Seminar on the Juche Idea for Independence and Peace in the Present World which opened in India with the approach of Sun's Day closed on April 12.\r\n   Many prominent figures made speeches at the seminar.\r\n   Secretary General Vishwanath of the Juche Idea Study Society of India said President Kim Il Sung's revolutionary idea, which is an integral system of ideology, theory and method of Juche, is the greatest idea in history of human thought. The exploits he performed for the times and humankind will shine long with human history, he added.\r\n   Prof. Kamakura of Saitama University in Japan said the great viability and historic significance of the Juche idea are firmly guaranteed as the idea is developed in depth by General Kim Jong Il.\r\n   First secretary P. G. Bilevski of the Young Communist League of Russia said comrade Kim Jong Il performed an undying exploit by developing and consummating the Juche idea of President Kim Il Sung as mighty guidelines in the era of independence with his rare wisdom and creative ideological and theoretical activities. As there is comrade Kim Jong Il, the new century will open a new, high phase of the human cause of independence, he said.\r\n   Secretary General Guy Dupre of the International Liaison Committee for Reunification and Peace in Korea said for the reunification of Korea President Kim Il Sung put forward the three principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity, the 10-Point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation and the proposal for founding a Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo which firmly guarantee the realisation of the three principles,  and this is his valuable exploit which will shine long in history of the nation.\r\n   Former member of parliament of Madagascar  Andria Belonandro said the respected comrade Kim Jong Il indicated the principle and concrete ways of building the independent national economy. Experience proves that the line based on the Juche idea is very instrumental in upgrading the nation's economy in keeping with the trend of the developing times, he said.\r\n   A faculty dean Alba Chavez of Guayaquil University of Ecuador said President Kim Il Sung's idea and theories are encyclopedic, original and  popular. The President is immortal in the hearts of the progressives of the world as the great father of the people, he added.\r\n   Secretary General Kenich Ogami of the International Institute of the Juche Idea (IIJI) said:\r\n   Cowards, go away if you want to, and we will stand true to the banner of the Juche idea, the banner of independence. \r\n   This is the preparedness of faith and an appeal of conscience of the progressive figures in our era.\r\n   He vowed to defend and propagate the Juche idea with such preparedness and will.\r\n   A letter to General Kim Jong Il was adopted at the seminar.\r\n   A declaration of the seminar was also adopted there.    \r\n  \r\n"
