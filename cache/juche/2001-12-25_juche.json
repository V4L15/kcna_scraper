Personages from all walks of life in Japan said in their speeches that the search conducted by use of state power is an encroachment upon human rights and national discrimination against the Koreans in Japan and part of the undisguised anti-DPRK hostile policy pursued by the present Japanese government subservient to the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They stressed the need to conduct a nation-wide movement to protest against the Japanese authorities' political crackdown upon Chongryon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A committee for probing the political suppression of Chongryon was inaugurated at the rally.    \r\n\r\n"
