Since the seizure of Korea by the U.S. will considerably increase the latter's position and there is no doubt that the former is of political importance for the latter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such aggressive aim of the U.S. was confirmed by the opinion the then President Truman gave to a report on \"views, conclusion and recommendation in relation to the situation of Korea.\" He said most of the proposals related to the clear-cut action guidelines were included in the reexamined plan of the U.S. Korea policy. To carry out this task the U.S. will stay in Korea for an adequate period and he asked for the provision of personnel and adequate fund needed for it, he added. (\"Memoirs of Truman\" 2 and the 1967 edition of the Japanese \"Kobunsha\") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It was because of this aim that the U.S. had never regarded itself as \"liberator\" even when some of South Korean inhabitants in delusion welcomed its troops as such just after the liberation of the country from the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Having set foot on Seoul, the U.S. troops announced order no. 21 of the U.S. military government office saying the head of office would exercise all the existing rights done by the Japanese governor-general in Korea, and thus made it clear that they were new masters in place of the Japanese imperialists.    \r\n\r\n"

The deployment has considerably increased the air \"SDF's\" capability of controlling airspace over the waters surrounding Japan, especially waters off the Korean peninsula, foreign news reports said.\r\n   What cannot be overlooked is the fact that such deployment was made at a time when the adoption of \"a declaration on renouncement of war\" was under discussion at the Japanese house of representatives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This clearly shows that Japan's declaration on \"renouncement of war\" is sham and how recklessly the Japanese reactionaries are stepping up the moves to turn Japan into a military giant behind the curtain of peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In this way Japan is inching closer to its conversion into a military power and rounding off the fascistization of society and wartime system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As known, the Japanese reactionaries restored the right of belligerency and the right to participate in war by railroading legislations related to the \"Japan-U.S. defence cooperation guidelines\" last year. And they are speeding up militarization of Japanese society by persistently egging ultra nationalists such as Tokyo metropolitan governor Ishihara on to spread militarism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All the facts prove that Japan's moves to turn itself into a military giant and realize its militarization have already gone beyond a danger line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Asian nations will never tolerate such moves of Japan.    \r\n\r\n"
