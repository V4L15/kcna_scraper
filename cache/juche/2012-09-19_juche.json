Their attitude is so groundless and black-hearted, says the commentary, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries are seeking to realize their old dream of the \"Greater east Asia co-prosperity sphere\" by realizing their wild ambition to stage a comeback to Korea, backed by the U.S. which tries hard to stifle the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a Korean proverb says that he who digs a pit for others falls into it, only shameful destruction awaits the Japanese reactionaries running amuck, steeped in the wild ambition for reinvasion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries should draw a serious lesson from their bitter defeat in the past and immediately give up their foolish thought to realize their purpose for aggression by slandering others."

            "content": "KCNA Commentary Slams Lee Myung Bak Group's Act of Brain-washing Soldiers\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, September 19 (KCNA) -- The Lee Myung Bak puppet regime of south Korea is conducting an extreme education for brain-washing soldiers into having the consciousness of confrontation with fellow countrymen. \n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean military recently presented more than 120 \"questions for the recognition and evaluation of entities following the north\" and let officers and men of the army sit for the compulsory \"examination concerning the forces following the north\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ever-more undisguised mental education within the military in recent years is attributable to the heinous plots for confrontation with fellow countrymen by the Lee Myung Bak regime to use the army as a bullet shield at a time of invading the north and a tool for fascist suppression of pro-reunification progressive forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The military bosses including Kim Kwan Jin, minister of Defense, called it an essential and natural mental education of the army. This reflects the policy-oriented nature of the education.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From the outset of its taking office, the regime has prioritized the \"education concerning forces following the north\" while asserting that raised consciousness of security is more important than the modernization of the army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Calling for setting right the \"left-leaning soldiers' outlook on enemy\", it set up again the school for mental education in defense, which was operational during the past dictatorial regime, in the Defense University. It also expanded and reorganized the action-oriented scientific research institute into the all-out mental and action-oriented scientific research institute. It is creating \"security park\" in each place the army is stationed, and brain-washing soldiers into having the consciousness of hostility toward the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The former and incumbent chiefs of general staff of the ground force are blaring that the north constitutes \"a direct and serious threat\" and \"principal enemy\". The DPRK is also defined as the \"principal enemy\" in the \"white paper on national defense\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group is zealously conducting mental education to instill \"the steadfast outlook on enemy\" into cadets and soldiers of all military academies and units.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the last two years the Lee group increased the budget for \"security lectures\" ten times and made sure that almost all the lectures were consistent with the content of inciting antagonism against fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such \"lectures concerning forces following the north\" were given 152 times in units above division between January and June and nearly 8 600 times in units of battalion level in the 2011-2012 period.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Before receiving training and going on watch-out duty at the units, officers and soldiers have to recite written oath and pledge containing a phrase that \"our enemy is the army of the north.\" It has become the duty of officers to instill the \"outlook on enemy\" into soldiers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Circulated among the foremost line units were videos which described the Jejudo Popular Uprising, case of the People's Revolutionary Party, 2008 candlelight resistance, etc., as ones by the \"agitation of the pro-north forces.\" Set up in all places where the army serves are slogan boards and posters which define the DPRK as the \"enemy.\" Firing targets in training grounds and areas simulating north's territories under occupation have marks symbolizing the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There have been intentional provocations such as writing or hanging slogans and large suspension posters slandering the social system and army of the DPRK at a great number of barracks, posts, military facilities of the frontline units, guide boards on surrounding roads and walls.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean military, steeped in the idea of the confrontation with the DPRK, is committing heinous provocations one after another while conducting indiscriminate firing drills targeting the DPRK's flags and even images representing the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK. This grave situation goes to fully prove how reckless the mental education of the puppet regime has reached. But the Lee regime is seriously mistaken.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No move for mental education can ever conceal justice and truth and save the group from the crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean nation will certainly deal most merciless punishment to the Lee group which is going all the more reckless before its ruin."

Media vied with each other to make special reports. World's attention focused on him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hot wind of Kim Jong Un is sweeping not only among the people in the north but in the south and overseas Koreans' community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A small wooden boat was sailing in the West Sea where clouds of a war were hanging low. Who would have thought of Kim Jong Un, supreme leader of the DPRK, taking such a simple wooden boat!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by only some people. It gave delightful and pleasant feelings to watch him talking with them. His appearance amounted to the affectionate look of a parent going to meet his sons and daughters living in far away places.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In fact, many people do not know where such small islets as Jangjae and Mu islets are in the West Sea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But Kim Jong Un went to the island defence detachments in the biggest hotspot in the world where KPA soldiers are always standing in acute confrontation with hostile forces. War maneuvers for aggression are being staged in the nearby area of the south side almost every day. He went to soldiers who are standing guard over this foremost post.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His appearance was, indeed, one of their real father and the great leader.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But it was not always smiles that he had on his face. When he stepped on the islet and watched the enemy's trench in the opposite side, his eyes were alight with fire.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"If even a single shell is fired to our territory, promptly deal deadly strike and lead it to a great war for national reunification!\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un issued a stern order while inspecting the island defence detachments that day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hearing this news on TV, all the service personnel and people of the north shouted hurrah at the top of their voices, looking up to him.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They were full of the conviction that they would certainly reunify the country under his leadership.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The moment, his congratulatory speech which I heard at Kim Il Sung Square on the morning of the Day of the Sun this year came across my head. He said, \"I will become a comrade-in-arm sharing the destiny always with comrades on the sacred road of the Songun revolution and discharge my obligation for the country and the revolution true to the behests of Comrade Kim Jong Il.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The people across the country who were hearing his speech at that time and all other Koreans in the south and abroad who heard this news were overwhelmed by inexpressible excitement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Jangjae Islet! Mu Islet! They are islets whose names they have never heard before but they were greatly excited.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These islets not well known among the people are now called islets where Kim Jong Un's love for the people has been brought to bloom like a legend and mysterious islets which would mercilessly shatter the provocation of aggressors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His image on the documentary film was affectionate and generous. One could feel that he has magnanimity big enough to embrace all the Koreans. It was the appearance of the great leader who would embrace 70 million fellow countrymen in the north and the south and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He held a child in his arms. This was a scene of human sincerity which is more valuable than millions of tons of gold.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His appearance was so simple and ordinary. One could not find any coercion and a bit of repugnance in his look. His virtues and greatness attracting all could be felt.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Overflowing in his shining eyes were the love for his country and soldiers, burning hatred for the enemy and brave spirit. His appearance that day was enough for the Koreans to give vent to their deep reverence and trust in their supreme commander. The leader and the people have become as one like this. This was a scene which so vividly showed the course of the single-minded unity in the DPRK lauded by the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean nation accepted sycophancy and national ruin like their destiny, unable to defend itself as it has had no correct leadership even though it was proud of the history and brilliant culture spanning five thousands of years. This was the appearance of the Korean nation as a miserable and weak colonial nation one century ago. But the DPRK has now become a full-fledged political and military power and working people there are demonstrating their dignity as the independent people whom no one dare provoke.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The people in the north find the factor of this in being blessed by the illustrious leaders and generals. The people in the south admit this. This is the pride of not only the north but the whole nation. With this pride of the DPRK, waves off Jangjae Islet are splashing and waves off Mu Islet are dancing joyfully.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Jangjae and Mu islets of reunified Korea are visible. Happy sounds of laughter of the families ringing out from these peaceful and beautiful islets, the earthly paradise full of joy, under the leadership of Kim Jong Un will resound through the world by waves."

It's is to achieve the independence of the whole of Korea and its independent development. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has intensified the hostile policy toward the DPRK with the goal of overthrowing the socialist system chosen by the Korean people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present situation urges to put an end to the U.S. military presence in south Korea at an early date."
