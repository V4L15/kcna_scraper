Paektu in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Over ten secret camps have been restored to the status quo on Mt. Paektu, Saja Hill, Mt. Kom, Mt. Kanbaek and so on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The secret camp on Mt. Paektu was a revolutionary fortress where the main force of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army was active in the latter half of the 1930s and the first half of the 1940s and a guiding center of the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There the President Kim Il Sung made preparations for party founding and conducted activities for strengthening the internal forces of revolution and ushering in a great event of the country's liberation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the camp is the native home where General Secretary Kim Jong Il was born on February 16, Juche 31 (1942). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He grew up there, hearing the gun report of the great anti-Japanese war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Jong Il Peak, 1,798 meters high, stands by the native home. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Not far from the secret camp on Mt. Paektu is the Sajabong secret camp where the President dispatched small units or received political workers and local revolutionaries and guided meetings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The camp played an important role in printing and disseminating revolutionary publications. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the area of Mt. Paektu are revolutionary battle sites where the President conducted military and political activities, commanding the Korean People's Revolutionary Army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe battle sites include Chongbong, Konchang, Pegaebong, Samjiyon and Mupho camping areas, Taehongdan and Sinsadong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nPreserved in the original state at secret camps and camping areas are the headquarters, barracks, campfire remains and trees bearing slogans and other relics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Samjiyon grand monument, the monument to the victorious battles in Musan area and other monuments and monuments to dedicated poems have been built in the battle sites, so that the area of Mt. Paektu is a grand open-air museum for education in the revolutionary traditions. \r\n\r\n"

This spirit fully proves that a people who have risen up, believing in their own strength, never yield to difficulties. It is a precious truth taught by the people in Jagang Province that if a people struggles believing in their own strength they never wavers before difficulties but creates something out of nothing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This spirit also proves that a people possessed of do-or-die fighting spirit can carry out any difficult tasks on their own efforts and only a people with a firm will can steadily advance,  surmounting all hardships. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The people in Jagang Province are unanimous that everything goes well when they do as taught by Kim Jong Il and nothing is insurmountable only if they have the spirit of carrying out the tasks given by the WPK unconditionally under any circumstances. It is the truth they have learned in practice. \r\n\r\n"

No sooner had the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework been released than the DPRK took the step of stopping the development of its independent nuclear power industry from a sincere stand to solve the \"nuclear issue\" on the Korean peninsula and this remains unchanged up to now. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is proved by the acute shortage of electricity in the DPRK in recent years. This is attributable to its failure to push ahead with its own nuclear power industry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is not difficult to guess the real aim sought by the U.S. in feverishly spreading the rumour about \"nuclear suspicion,\" still remaining skeptical over the DPRK measure of nuclear freezing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is nothing but a U.S. foolish design to evade the responsibility for its failure to fulfil its commitments under the agreed framework under the pretext of the DPRK's \"nuclear suspicion.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. has dragged out the LWR project and nowadays it claims that the project is expected to be completed beyond 2007. This assertion suggests that it is hard to tell when the project is expected to be completed and it may end in smoke. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It has not properly fulfilled its commitment to provide the DPRK with heavy oil, creating difficulties and confusion in the DPRK's economic performance. It is overshadowing the prospect of the agreed framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Refusing to mind their own business, the U.S. conservative hard-liners are crying that it is essential to make \"verification devices\" for all nuclear activities of the DPRK. This is an intolerable act as it is the height of moral vulgarity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This, in fact, is an expression of their abhorrence and doubt about the agreed framework and a criminal move to scrap its provisions one after another in the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   An \"amendment\" to the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework precisely means its abrogation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the U.S. tries to \"amend\" the agreed framework, skeptical over the DPRK measure of nuclear freezing and the agreed framework itself, instead of sincerely implementing it, the agreed framework will be bound to be abrogated. \r\n\r\n"

Many wars are recorded in human history, but there is no precedent of Japan's abduction of women in the occupied countries, including nearly 200,000 Korean women, to reduce them to sex slaves for its army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The crimes related to \"comfort women for army\" should have already been brought to the international tribunal as they were an organized group rape and hideous crimes against humanity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But Japan has not yet been forced to stand trial at the international tribunal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan is so crafty as to try to hush up these crimes with a petty amount of money. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   These crimes can never be settled in that way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Former \"comfort women for army\" say they cannot die before making the Japanese government apologize and compensate for the Japanese imperialist brutes' outrages. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese authorities should not turn deaf ears to this strong demand, if they are human beings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The crimes related to \"comfort women for army\" were ordered by the then Japanese government and committed by its military. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Therefore, the Japanese government can never escape from its responsibility for the crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The international community should force Japan to stand an international trial. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Therefore, it is the main trend of the development of history for them to head for such a new world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The old order of domination and subjugation which tramples down independence of people is rejected everywhere in the world as a leftover of the old times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   History is advancing along the road of independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Sudden and abnormal things happening in the world are the temporary phenomena which humankind faces in the course of advance toward a new independent world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The collapse of socialism in a number of countries does not mean victory of the old over the new but a total bankruptcy of opportunism whose true colors as a counter-revolutionary ideological trend were brought to light and condemned in the international communist movement already long ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But opportunism disguised as \"modern social democracy\" has been advocated as something new in some countries for many years. Socialism thus got damaged and degenerated and ended in collapse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   History is bound to forge ahead. The master of the world is popular masses and they are advancing the history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHistory advances and develops thanks to their creative efforts according to their independent demands. \r\n\r\n"
