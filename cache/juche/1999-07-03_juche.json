Korean rulers urged to discontinue anti-north false propaganda\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 3 (KCNA) -- Strange voices are ringing out from South Korea as regards the Min  Yong Mi case.   The South Korean authorities asserted that the north threatened Min  Yong Mi and forced her to write a letter of apology, thus reducing her to an operative for defection on purpose.   As exposed clearly, the South Korean authorities sent Min  Yong Mi as a tourist to Mt. Kumgang for the purpose of inducing persons in the north  to defect to the south. This is an intolerable criminal act.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Min  should have been punished by our law for the gravity of her crime but the DPRK government took a lenient step to send her back to South Korea.   The South Korean authorities, however, are getting frantic again in the anti-north false propaganda, asserting that the north threatened her to write a letter of apology and there should be a safety guarantee for tourists in the future. This added to their criminal provocations against the north.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   From a compatriotic stand, we let Min  put up at a deluxe hotel and treated her well. Moved by this hospitality, she voluntarily admitted all the grave political crimes committed by her and entreated for lenient pardon.   Min  went back to South Korea safe. But the South Korean authorities is using her for the anti-communist propaganda again. It is not quite surprising.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We will, in the future, too, greet and welcome with compatriotic feelings all the fellow tourists who come to see Mt. Kumgang  with their wholeheart without any sinister aim and purpose.   We will, in the future, not send back such impure elements as Min  Yong Mi for good and all. The South Korean authorities  should be wholly responsible for all the consequences to be entailed therefrom.   We will strictly punish such impure elements as Min  Yong Mi trying to  hatch anti-north plots under the mask of tourists. \r\n\r\n"
