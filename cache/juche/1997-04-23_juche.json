            "content": "NDFSK vows to expel Hwang Jang Yop\r\n  Pyongyang, April 23 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the National Democratic Front of South Korea (NDFSK) issued a statement over the Seoul-based radio voice of national salvation on Tuesday, concerning  Hwang Jang Yop's \"statement upon arrival in Seoul.\" The spokesman says:\r\n   The Kim Young Sam regime manipulated  Hwang Jang Yop to read a \"statement\" upon arrival in Seoul on April 20.\r\n   As to this political burlesque, our people curse and despise both the crazy Kim Young Sam regime and Hwang Jang Yop, a class a criminal and common enemy of the north and south Korean people.\r\n   We regard the \"statement\" of the mentally deranged Hwang, who has no conscience and reason, as a sophism that deserves not a passing note. But we can hardly repress resentment at the \"statement\" that insulted and flouted our people.\r\n   The \"statement\" is nothing but an outcry of a crazy man sick with paranoia, eccentricity and mental derangement, and a jargon of a traitor who has been trained abroad for more than two months into a parrot of the \"Agency for National Security Planning\" (ANSP).\r\n   The moment Hwang in bullet-proof vest arrived at a military airport south of Seoul, our people spat and closed their eyes. Why had the civilian to choose a military airport, wearing a bullet-proof vest? \r\n   As commented by our press, Hwang is a class a criminal to both the north and south.\r\n   His bullet-proof vest convinced our people that he is terribly suffering from paranoia.\r\n   He also proved to be eccentric. Our people were shocked at his shabby appearance and imprudent behavior that did not become his age and position.\r\n   He stammered out a script written by the \"ANSP.\" He even said he was happy to see SEOUL, while he was at a military airport far off from Seoul.\r\n   To our people, his worth is less than a dog's.\r\n   Our people can hardly repress indignation at the \"statement\" of the lunatic.\r\n   Hwang dared say he defected the north for the sake of the 70 million fellow countrymen and to prevent the outbreak of a war in the Korean Peninsula.\r\n   If his defection were really for the nation, he should have deplored south Korean colonial society where national sovereignty has been trampled down by outsiders and mentioned the need to get south Korea out of the U.S. domination.\r\n   But he slandered the north, considered as a fortress of national independence, and lauded the south, regarded as a graveyard of national independence.\r\n   Though he cried for the prevention of a war in the Korean Peninsula, he ignored the root cause of war.\r\n   He must be unaware of the military occupation of south Korea by the U.S. forces and their nuclear weapons and war preparations.\r\n   He is obviously a lunatic with no sense of patriotism and treachery, no sense of war and peace.\r\n   Worse still, he is unable to make a clear distinction between the fellow countrymen and the enemy. He has said the north regards the south as class enemy. \r\nBut the south Korean people know that the north has always loved them with compatriotic feelings. It is none other than Hwang that regard our people as class enemy.\r\n   He said our people including the workers and students who struggle for democracy and civil rights including right to existence should be punished as \"traitors\". He, currying favor with the authorities, also said the \"agency for national security planning\", the ruling party and the \"ROK Army\" should be strengthened.\r\n   His remarks indicate that he considers the south Korean people as enemy and wants to put them on the altar of the fascist dictatorship.\r\n   Through his blast representing south Korea's conservatives, he admitted that he is the bitter enemy of our people.\r\n   It is really ridiculous that such a lunatic promised to do something together with our people.\r\n   Our people bitterly condemn the Kim Young Sam group for bringing the lunatic to Seoul and using him politically.\r\n   The traitor Hwang is a troublemaker who is not useful for both the north and the south.\r\n   The Kim Young Sam group's bringing him to Seoul is a provocation against the north, a challenge to the south Korean people and also a crime wrecking the peace and security of the peninsula.\r\n   They made Hwang issue an anti-north statement in Seoul. \r\nIt is, in actuality, a forestalling attack and a declaration of war against the north.\r\n   If one side fires, the other side is bound to retaliate, and the cross-fire will inevitably lead to igniting a war.\r\n   The Kim Young Sam group's schemings to make use of Hwang to escape from the present crisis will result in further aggravating the confrontation and unleashing war between the fellow countrymen.\r\n   If peace is wrecked and war breaks out on the Korean Peninsula, the Kim Young Sam group will have to take full responsibility.\r\n   The present situation requires that the entire nation should see through the dangerous political schemings of the Kim Young Sam group and tide over the current serious situation with a nationwide struggle.\r\n   If Hwang, an uninvited guest and a spark of confrontation and war with the north, is left alone, our people will soon suffer a holocaust of war.\r\n   Our NDFSK ardently calls upon all the people to sharpen their vigilance, resolutely turn out in the struggle to expel the trouble-maker Hwang out of this land and daringly fight to overthrow the Kim Young Sam group, who are using him for their sinister political purpose. \r\n\r\n"

They plan to purchase SU-27, SU-35 and SU-37 fighters and S-300 anti-aircraft missile units.\r\n   Their intensified arms buildup and military exercises against the north are aimed at aggravating the tensions on the Korean Peninsula, worsening the inter-Korean relations and stepping up new war preparations.\r\n   This being the fact, they pretend to be interested in \"four-party talks\" for \"establishment of a peace-keeping mechanism on the Korean Peninsula.\" This is a trick to mislead public opinion and conceal their ulterior motives for military confrontation and war.\r\n   Moreover, it must not go unnoticed that some countries calling for measures to build military confidence and relax the tensions on the Korean Peninsula are vying with one another in a bid to sell modern weapons to south Korea.\r\n   These countries must ponder over the potential grave consequences of their self-contradictory behavior and refrain from encouraging military confrontation between the north and south of Korea, though belatedly.\r\n   Our people's army and all our people are sharply watching the enemies' anti-DPRK arms buildup and military maneuvers conducted behind the facade of \"peace\" and will be compelled to take countermeasures. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
