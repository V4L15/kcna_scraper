The groundless abuses heaped by bush upon the DPRK were intended to justify the U.S. aggressor forces' presence in South Korea and its hostile policy towards the DPRK, torpedo the process of reconciliation and reunification on the Korean peninsula and, furthermore, strain the situation and finally unleash a war against the DPRK at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are, indeed, arch disturbers of Korea's reunification and a group of warmongers, as they are working hard to spoil the hard-won atmosphere of reconciliation and reunification and force another war upon the Korean nation.\r\n A group of traitors, anti-reunification forces in South Korea, do not hesitate to do harm to fellow countrymen while kissing the enemies of the nation in order to gratify their greed for power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They can never escape a judgement by history and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an invariable will of the Korean nation to resolutely smash the moves of the anti-reunification forces at home and abroad and achieve the country's reunification by the concerted efforts of the nation. And no force on earth can stem the strong trend of the national history towards independent reunification.     \r\n\r\n"
