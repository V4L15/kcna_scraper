However, this only revealed the roots of distrust and enmity lurking behind it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A saying goes that a poisonous herb has its own noxious root. What Park and her \"confidence-building process\" have shown for the past 8 months are only distrust and confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No sooner had Park taken office than she cried out for \"resolute joint counter-action of south Korea and the U.S. against the north's provocation\", asserting that the above-said \"process\" is \"by no means an appeasement policy\" and \"it is based on military deterrence through south Korea-U.S. alliance\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She uttered that \"the north's dismantlement of nukes was not a precondition\" but is now taking the lead in the nuclear racket against the DPRK after declaring her policy \"urging the north to dismantle its nukes first.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not only her U.S. master's moves to stifle the DPRK but also provocative hysteria of the war maniacs of the south Korean puppet army are to be \"absolutely trusted\" and such behaviors deliberately going beyond the tolerance limit any time are tolerated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On the contrary, the joint declarations which should be regarded as cornerstones for the development of the north-south relations have been totally denied and actions demanding their implementation have become targets of distrust and suppression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the south Korean puppet Intelligence Service recklessly opened to public the minutes of north-south summit on June 24 just 4 months after Park took office, people from various circles in south Korea reacted against it at once.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Now that the minutes of the south-north summit, the core of the confidence-building on the Korean Peninsula, are opened to public, how can inter-Korean dialogue be conducted in an honest and candid manner? It is our view that inter-Korean relations in the 5 years of the Park's government have collapsed.\" \"The opening of the minutes of south-north summit is an unprecedented one. It brought to light that the process is not for trust but for confrontation.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the conclusion drawn by the Korean nation and the judgment made by history of Park Geun Hye and her \"north policy\"."

Asserting the \"presidential election\" was, in a nutshell, a fraudulent one, they urged Park to make an apology and the minister of Justice, the director of the IS and the chief of the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office to step down.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"Saenuri Party\" is trying hard to ward off the opposition parties' criticism and conceal the truth about the case at any cost, claiming the Democratic Party is seeking revenge for its failure in the election through a political offensive.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean political camp is, however, finding itself in greater mayhem in the wake of the disclosure of the fact that the Ministry of Justice urged the special investigation team to downplay the investigation as regards the case of the IS's interference in the election."

Korea Intolerable: DFRK\r\n Pyongyang, October 28 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of Korea (DFRK) Monday issued an indictment laying bare the gravity and danger of the moves to revive the \"yusin\" dictatorship in south Korea, the fascist dark era.\n\t\t\t\t\t According to the indictment, Park Chung-Hee, the ill-famed \"yusin\" dictator, seized \"power\" through a military coup and established the one-man dictatorial system unprecedented in south Korea before exercising unlimited power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present chief executive of south Korea took office and established the one-person ruling system reminiscent of the \"yusin\" dictatorial system. She broke a promise to enforce the systems whereby \"the prime minister assumes responsibility\" and \"ministers own responsibility\" and set up a direct ruling system under Chongwadae so that it may control all domestic and foreign policies and even \"the policy toward the north\". She thus reduced the puppet prime minister and ministries and agencies under the administration into puppets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She is reorganizing power mechanisms in the \"yusin\" dictatorship-style or totally reviving the ruling machines during the \"yusin\" dictatorship.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"National Security Office\" of Chongwadae which is reported to handle all diplomacy, security and unification matters is a copy of the \"National Security Council\" made by Park Chung-Hee in 1963. The puppet Intelligence Service has become a machine going above law just as the Central Intelligence Agency did under the \"yusin regime.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Many \"yusin\" remnants and their descendants are holding \"government\" posts. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The revival of the \"yusin\" dictatorship in south Korea finds a vivid manifestation in embellishing the \"yusin\" dictatorship of Park Chung-Hee and reviving things dating back to those times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Memorial services\" took place in Seoul and in Kumi, North Kyongsang Province, the birthplace of Park Chung-Hee, on October 26, the 34th anniversary of the death of the \"yusin\" dictatorship. Not content with whitewashing the \"yusin\" at the services, the puppet conservative group including the \"Saenuri Party\" praised the May 16 military coup as a \"decisive action for national salvation\" and traitor Park Chung-Hee, the \"yusin\" dictator, as a \"great man\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Son Pyong Du, director general of the \"Park Chung-Hee's Memorial Foundation\", blustered that he would certainly build together with Park Geun Hye what Park Chung-Hee wanted to achieve and the \"yusin\" era is better, sparking off public uproar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even the \"Park Chung-Hee leadership ability research institute\" is now operating in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Hye is claiming that she would develop the \"new village movement\" conducted by Park Chung-Hee in the 1970s into a \"future-oriented movement for reforming citizens' consciousness\" and an \"all-people movement\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  In August last the Committee for Compiling National History examined and passed the history textbooks rewritten by the Association of Contemporary History, an ultra-right conservative organization, seriously distorting the modern history of south Korea including the embellishment of the Park Chung Hee's \"yusin\" dictatorial rule, and let all the high schools use the textbooks from March next year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The revival of \"yusin\" dictatorship finds its clear expression in the south Korean regime's fascist suppression of people of various circles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After Park Geun Hye's seizure of power, a terror-ridden atmosphere of suppression racket reminiscent of the \"yusin\" dictatorship is prevailing in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is against the backdrop of reign of intelligence-based politics and repressive politics that activities of political parties and organizations have been brutally suppressed, elementary political freedom, democratic rights and rights of south Korean people wantonly violated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean regime kicked up a whirlwind of arrest, grumbling that the South Headquarters of Pan-national Alliance for Korea's Reunification (Pomminryon) is still active though it is long since it was labeled an \"organization benefiting enemy\". It is suppressing such core members of the headquarters as the acting chairman, secretary general and director in charge of cooperation with foreign countries of Pomminryon after detaining them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park is zealously encouraging the repressive forces in the suppression of the Teachers Union after branding it as \"a blight-like organization\" and \"the main culprit plunging schools into state of confusion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After Park took office the puppet conservative group put 103 personages behind bars on the charge of violation of the \"Security Law\", much more than the number of those detained in the same period last year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The revival of \"yusin\" dictatorship is seriously affecting the inter-Korean relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative group is now driving the inter-Korean relations into a catastrophe, trumpeting about \"confrontation accompanied by dialogue\" and \"confrontation of the social systems\" just as the erstwhile \"yusin regime\" did.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Absolutely intolerable is the revival of the \"yusin\" dictatorship.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If Park Geun Hye persists in reviving the \"yusin\" dictatorship in disregard of the warnings of the history and the nation, she will never escape the same miserable fate as that her father's \"yusin\" dictatorship met."
