It is a group of despicable political charlatans engrossed in irregularities and corruption. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As its nicknames such as a \"party embezzling truckloads of  money\", a \"party corrupt from its inception, a \"party of thieves,\" and others it earned for its election frauds tell, corruption and moral vulgarity are peculiar to the GNP. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These can be called incurable diseases that torment the GNP unless it is buried underground. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This case warns what a gloomy future south Korea would have if such political imposters and human scum of the \"GNP\" were allowed to return to power. It is as clear as noonday that this traitorous party's seizure of power would revive fascist dictatorship and treacherous politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary calls upon the people from all walks of life in south Korea to turn the up-coming \"election to local self-governing bodies\" into a tribunal for severely punishing the \"GNP.\"    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on Three-point Patriotic Movement \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Thursday in a signed article says that the patriotic movement for independent reunification, peace against war and great national unity is a revelation of the ardent patriotism of the Korean nation.\r\n Noting that despite the outrageous and vicious challenge and obstruction of separatists at home and abroad the three-point patriotic movement is vigorously advancing, the article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality is unthinkable without the patriotic enthusiasm and will of the fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Patriotism without reunification cannot be spoken of in Korea divided into two.\r\n Without independence reunification cannot be achieved nor can patriotism be displayed. Independent reunification precisely means patriotism and the struggle for independent reunification is the most patriotic one. The struggle for independent reunification to achieve independence of the nation is an expression of patriotism.\r\n The movement for peace against war is, indeed, the patriotic struggle of justice today when the U.S. imperialists are seeking to exert nuclear holocaust upon the heads of our nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is impossible to achieve independent reunification and peace against war without the great unity of the Korean nation. The great national unity helps achieve independent reunification and peace against war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is patriotism to aspire after great national unity and it is treachery to hinder it.\r\n Koreans can no longer live in the pain resulting from division and the danger of a war. The Korean nation should pool its ardent patriotic will to dynamically open up a new history of independent reunification, peace against war and great national unity. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
