It is a group of despicable political charlatans engrossed in irregularities and corruption. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As its nicknames such as a \"party embezzling truckloads of  money\", a \"party corrupt from its inception, a \"party of thieves,\" and others it earned for its election frauds tell, corruption and moral vulgarity are peculiar to the GNP. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These can be called incurable diseases that torment the GNP unless it is buried underground. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This case warns what a gloomy future south Korea would have if such political imposters and human scum of the \"GNP\" were allowed to return to power. It is as clear as noonday that this traitorous party's seizure of power would revive fascist dictatorship and treacherous politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary calls upon the people from all walks of life in south Korea to turn the up-coming \"election to local self-governing bodies\" into a tribunal for severely punishing the \"GNP.\"    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
