Kim Young Sam is an \"election\" offender who bought the \"presidential\" seat with black money. \r\n   Now, Kim Young Sam is \"President independent\" from any party after being driven out of the ruling party, which was his private party. Can this guarantee that the upcoming \"election\" will be a fair election, as he is advertising?\r\n   It is self-evident that although the Kim Young Sam regime calls for \"impartial election control\" and \"strict neutrality,\" it will mobilize government power, money and illicit means to back the political party and \"Presidential candidate\" that promise its \"safety\" after retirement.\r\n   In his \"statement,\" Ko Gon threatened to take \"resolute measures\" against violations of \"election law.\" By this, he meant, however, that he would ruthlessly suppress the struggle of the south Korean people for the establishment of an independent, democratic government.\r\n   The ulterior intention of the puppets is to support with government power the reactionary forces which will inherit the colonial puppet regime and ruthlessly crack down on the people's righteous struggle for the building of new politics and new life.    \r\n\r\n"
