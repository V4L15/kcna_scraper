The south headquarters of Pomchonghakryon will take the lead in the efforts to realize this demand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south headquarters of Pomchonghakryon will make all the youth and students including those under the influence of the South Korean federation of university student councils supporting the June 15 joint declaration the driving force of the movement for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It will make new progress in the movement for national reunification by dealing a blow at the United States trying to block the reunification of the Korean nation and the ultra-right conservative forces going against the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the mission and duty of the students to fight for implementing the joint declaration, the article says, and calls for the youth and students in the south, north and overseas to struggle in firm unity as the vanguard of the movement for national reunification.    \r\n\r\n \r\n020403 - appeal of 2001 meeting supported\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 4 (KCNA) -- Boris Petkov, chairman of the executive council of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party (Marxists), issued a statement on Jan. 28 in support of the appeal of the 2001 meeting for the independent reunification of the Korean nation.\r\n In the statement he said that the Bulgarian Communist Party (Marxists) fully supports the appeal of the DPRK for the independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation should hold high the north-south joint declaration as the banner common to the nation, he said, adding: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north and south of Korea should work hard for an end to the division of the country and reunion of the separated families and relatives. Now is the time for the entire Korean nation to fully display patriotism, national dignity and responsibility.    \r\n\r\n \r\n020404 - new film previewed\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 4 (KCNA) -- The April 25 Film Studio of the Korean People's Army recently produced part 6 (choe hyon), the multi-part film \"the Nation and Destiny\" part 55.\r\n The feature film deals with the historical facts that during the Fatherland Liberation War Choe Hyon's army corps followed up victories in battles behind the enemy's line in hearty response to the order of supreme commander Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also tells about warm love and trust with which Choe Hyon led people with problematic social background to a whorthwhile struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A preview of the film was held at the People's Palace of Culture on Saturday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present there together with citizens were senior party and state officials.    \r\n\r\n\r\n020405 - measures against damage caused by u.s. military\r\n         bases urged in s. korea\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 4 (KCNA) -- Organizations in U.S. military base-occupied areas in South Korea have conducted activities to solve with joint efforts the issue of damage caused by U.S. army bases, according to CBS from Seoul.\r\n A council of autonomous organizations in U.S. army base-occupied areas was formed last June involving 15 autonomous organizations throughout South Korea including Nam district, Taegu city, and ryongsan district, Seoul, and it has been active since then. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The council is now making efforts to work out a draft law related to the issue of damage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Stipulated in this law are provisions calling for detailed measures against damage and substantial compensations to the damaged citizens in areas around U.S. army units. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The council held that the issue of damage caused by the U.S. army bases is not a regional issue but one which should be settled by the authorities.    \r\n\r\n\r\n020406 - preparatory committees formed \r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 4 (KCNA) -- Preparatory committees were inaugurated by the Socialist Unionist Party of Syria and in Indonesia on Jan. 28 and 31 to mark February 16, the birthday of leader Kim Jong Il.\r\n A preparatory committee was formed in Portugal on Jan. 29 to celebrate February 16 and Sun's Day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chairmen of the committees were elected in the inaugural meetings and it was decided to have multifarious events.    \r\n\r\n\r\n020407 - vigorous advance under red flag of socialism \r\n         called for\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 4 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article calls upon the Korean people to push ahead with their advance in the 21st century holding higher the red flag of socialism as in the 20th century.\r\n It says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The advance is one to exalt the glorious history and exploits of President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il for all ages, invariably preserve the ideology and principles successfully carried forward through decades of the Korean revolution and build a powerful socialist country in the spirit of self-reliance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The red flag of socialism associated with the whole life of the president is firmly defended and is now fluttering higher by Kim Jong Il, the article says, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the fixed will of Kim Jong Il to hew out the 21st century and build a powerful country on this land fluttering ever higher the red flag of revolution, the banner of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nothing is more important for the Korean people today than to glorify the DPRK as an ideologically and militarily powerful country and bring about an overall revival of the country upholding Kim Jong Il's politics.    \r\n\r\n\r\n020408 - rodong sinmun on ishihara's outbursts\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 4 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today comments on anti-dprk outbursts let loose by Tokyo metropolitan governor Ishihara at a recent world economic forum held in Switzerland.\r\n At the forum he talked about the issue of \"'Japanese kidnapped' by North Korea,\" adding that \"it is necessary to sink operation ships by missile attacks.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a blatant challenge to the DPRK, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-DPRK diatribe draws attention as it came when the theory of \"preemptive attack\" against the DPRK is advocated by the japanese reactionaries and their moves to convert Japan into a military power and preparations for overseas aggression are in full swing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their wild ambition for overseas aggression has reached the extreme. The Japanese monopoly capital expanded to its maximum urgently calls for overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries intend to invade Korea and use it as a springboard from which to invade other countries in Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ishihara's provocative remarks are an incitement of war and of reinvasion. The Japanese reactionaries are mistaken. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK are greatly angered by such militarist fanatics as Ishihara who tries to defame the dignity of the DPRK and incite reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Japanese reactionaries dare mount a preemptive attack on the DPRK, all our military power will be mobilized to cope with it. They should ponder over the ensuing consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We do not talk empty words.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
