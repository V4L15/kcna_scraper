These moves are also related to its aggressive Asian strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The main point of the Asian strategy of the U.S. is to contain the expansion of the sphere of influence of other powers in the region and establish a dominationist order in which the U.S. would boss the show. The U.S. schemes to back it with the deployment of strong forces. Here, the U.S. attaches importance to Northeast Asia, south Korea and Japan in particular, and intends to build strong forces there and use them in realizing its dominationist designs on Asia. The U.S. is bent on attaining domination over the region by overwhelming the DPRK and containing other powers with south Korea as its forward base for its Asian Strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is talking about \"peace\" and \"detente\" on the Korean peninsula, but its actions are quite the contrary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present situation makes it incumbent upon the DPRK to be fully ready both for dialogue and war. The DPRK will make thorough preparations to cope with any contingency.    \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

Korea Urged \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 13 (KCNA) -- Stephen Gibson, head of the Australian friendship delegation, which visited the DPRK strongly demanded the withdrawal of the U.S. troops from south Korea.\r\n Peace on the Korean peninsula is related to the global security and constant tensions in the region are attributable to the U.S. troops' presence in south Korea, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean peninsula has become the most dangerous region as huge armed forces have stood in confrontation from the last century, he noted, adding: This is because the U.S. has kept its forces in south Korea and put military pressure upon the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went on to say: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun politics pursued by leader Kim Jong Il is the most outstanding political mode as it helps reliably defend the security of the country and fully ensure global peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite natural for the DPRK to build up a powerful military deterrent force to protect its sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are fully supported by the world's peace-loving people as they are reacting to imperialists' hardline policy with the toughest stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people's cause is just and it encourages the world people in their struggle to put an end to the present international order whereby highhanded and arbitrary practices are rampant. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will always extend full support to the Korean people in their struggle for justice and peace.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "End to Foreign Domination and Interference Called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 13 (KCNA) -- The failure of the Korean nation to achieve the country's reunification for over half a century is entirely attributable to the foreign forces' domination and interference and the U.S. is entirely to blame for this. Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article.\r\n The article cites concrete facts to accuse the U.S. of having long pursued the policy of aggression in order to realize its ambition to dominate the whole Korean peninsula, the area of military and strategic importance in Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. policy to dominate Korea has been pursued in real earnest during the Second World War. The talks of allied forces on the post-war settlement discussed the Korean issue contrary to the will and demand of the Korean nation for independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe U.S. persistently pursued that policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists worked out a plan to \"divide Korea with the 38th Parallel as a line of demarcation\". Their forces occupied south Korea on September 8, 1945, nearly one month after the defeat of the Japanese imperialists, and thus divided Korea into the north and the south. The U.S. imperialists have since most viciously blocked the reconciliation and unity of the Korean nation and the country's reunification though over half a century has passed since its partition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They fabricated the \"nuclear suspicion of north Korea\" in the 1990s in a bid to perpetuate their military presence in south Korea and stifle the DPRK. They instigated the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN and others to threaten the DPRK with \"special inspection\" and \"sanctions\" and staged the once suspended large-scale \"Team Spirit\" war drills to invade north Korea and started the massive manoeuvres of aggressor troops. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists designated the DPRK as part of an \"axis of evil\" and a target of preemptive nuclear attack and kicked up a reckless nuclear racket, driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to a grave phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts go to clearly prove that the U.S. imperialists are chiefly to blame for the national split and a stumbling block lying in the way of the country's reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is impossible to achieve national reconciliation, unity and the country's reunification and defend peace on the Korean peninsula unless an end is put to the foreign forces' domination and interference. This is a serious lesson taught by the over half a century-long history of the movement for national reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

But it does not know such precedents of crimes against humanity and human rights abuses as drafting so many people and forcing so many women into sexual slavery in a bid to exterminate one whole nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries, however, are working hard to evade their responsibility for such unprecedented crimes. They are rushing headlong into militarism, letting loose such reckless remarks as \"international pressure\" and \"hardline step,\" to extremely provoke the DPRK and embellishing and distorting their history of aggression &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We strongly demand the Japanese authorities come to their senses and honestly reflect on their past crimes against humanity, though belatedly, and opt to apologize and compensate the victims of the forcible drafting and their bereaved families for them.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"
