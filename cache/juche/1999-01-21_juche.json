            "content": "U.S. will take responsibility for consequences�@of nuclear confrontation \r\n  &nbsp; &nbsp;Pyongyang, January 21 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK made public a statement today in connection with the fact that U.S. military bosses have openly revealed their design to unleash a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The statement said:\r\n   During recent tours of South Korea, the U.S. Secretary of Defense and the U.S. chairman of joint chiefs of staff held the 20th \"military committee\" meeting and the 30th \"annual consultative meeting on security\" with the South Korean military bosses. At the joint confabs, they, raising again \"the DPRK's suspected underground nuclear facility,\" \"missile issue\" and \"issue of biological and chemical weapons,\" made public a \"joint statement\" replete with violent remarks that the DPRK is continuously posing threats to the U.S. national interests and that the U.S. will make a strong \"chastisement\" with the mobilisation of all means including nuclear weapons in case of emergency.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At the confabs, they also agreed on setting up a \"South Korea-U.S. joint psychological warfare command\" intended to conduct a \"psychological warfare\" in case a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula, intensifying a joint lookout for possible overall war or limited provocation by someone and quickly deploying U.S. patriot missile batteries in South Korea to cope with the DPRK's \"missile attack.\"\r\n   The recently held confabs were very aggressive and bellicose ones without an equal in history, the spokesman said, and continued:\r\n   This is a declaration of war that a second Korean war being prepared by the United States is none other than a nuclear war.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. utterances about \"nuclear chastisement\" are a wanton violation of the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework.\r\n   It is a mistake for the United States to think that it can \"win over\" some people through a \"psychological warfare\" in case a war breaks out.\r\n   Since we have lived exposed to U.S. constant nuclear threats for scores of years, we are fully ready for a nuclear war, too.\r\n   It is the will and faith of the Korean People's Army and people that they never avoid a war but will certainly win if they fight.\r\n   If the U.S. finally takes the road of nuclear confrontation, we cannot but adopt an appropriate countermeasure. The United States will be held 100 percent responsible for its consequences. \r\n\r\n"

They are an open threat and blackmail and declaration of a nuclear war against the DPRK.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The issues of \"underground nuclear facility\" and \"missile development\" the warmongers raised in the war confabs against the north aim to invent an excuse for  igniting a nuclear war according to the \"operation plan 5027\".\r\n   Answering \"punishment\" with punishment, a total war with total war and an aggressive war with liberation war is the character and mode of counteraction pertaining to the DPRK.\r\n   If  the U.S., their henchmen and followers dare unleash a war against the DPRK, the Korean people and revolutionary armed forces will never miss the opportunity to plunge the provokers into a sea of fire and to reduce them to ashes.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Minju Joson says that if warmongers unleash a war against the DPRK, it will annihilate the aggressors in reliance upon the invincible might which it has cultivated for scores of years and achieve the historic cause of national reunification. \r\n\r\n"
