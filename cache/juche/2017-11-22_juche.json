            "content": "FM Spokesman Blasts U.S. for Re-listing DPRK as \"Sponsor of Terrorism\"\r\nPyongyang, November 22 (KCNA) -- A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the DPRK gave the following answer to a question raised by KCNA on Wednesday as regards the fact that the U.S. re-listed the DPRK as a \"state sponsor of terrorism\":\n\t\t\t\t\t On November 21, the U.S. made a scene of re-listing the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) as a \"state sponsor of terrorism\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Following Trump's reckless remark on the UN arena of \"totally destroying\" our country, the U.S. labeled the DPRK as a \"state sponsor of terrorism\" this time. This is a serious provocation and a violent infringement upon our dignified country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since 1979 the U.S. has been labeling the countries that are not obedient to it as \"state sponsors of terrorism\". In January 1988, it listed our country as a \"state sponsor of terrorism\" and de-listed it in October 2008.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. deleted Iraq and Libya from the list of \"state sponsor of terrorism\" that gave in to its pressure. It also deleted Cuba from the list as a part of the normalization of bilateral relations. These facts clearly show that the label of \"state sponsor of terrorism\" is just a tool for American style authoritarianism that can be attached or removed at any time in accordance with its interests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., the kingpin of all kinds of terrorism who cannot even prevent terror in its own territory, is acting like an \"international judge on terrorism\" while attaching or removing the label of \"state sponsor of terrorism\" on sovereign countries. This is clearly an absurdity and a mockery to the world peace and security.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The act of listing other countries as \"state sponsors of terrorism\" by the U.S. is one of the heinous means to suffocate independent countries disobedient to it, and it is only a cloak to hide its incompetence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK government values international justice and peace, and consistently stands against all forms of terrorism and any sponsorship for terrorism. That's why the DPRK announced that it would faithfully fulfill its duty of nuclear non-proliferation before the international society as a responsible nuclear power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We have nothing to do with \"terrorism\" and we do not care whether the U.S. puts a cap of \"terrorism\" on us or not.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This time, while re-listing the DPRK as a \"state sponsor of terrorism\", the U.S. announced additional sanctions against the DPRK under the pretext of blocking illegal funds for \"prohibited nuclear and ballistic missile program of the DPRK\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nuclear weapons of the DPRK are the deterrence to safeguard our sovereignty and our rights to existence and development from the U.S. heinous hostile policy and nuclear threats that have lasted for over half a century, and as long as the U.S. continues with its anti-DPRK hostile policy, our deterrence will be further strengthened.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By re-listing the DPRK as a \"state sponsor of terrorism\", the U.S. openly revealed to the whole world its intention to destroy our ideology and system by using all kinds of means and methods.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not content with its sanctions against our country, the U.S. is making a last-ditch attempt to suffocate our country by labeling it as a \"state sponsor terrorism\". However, no sanction or pressure can stand up to the great and limitless strength of self-reliance and self-development of our people who are closely rallied around their leader.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our army and people are full of rage and anger towards the heinous gangsters who dared to put the name of our sacred country in this wretched list of \"terrorism\" and are hardening their will to settle all accounts with those gangsters at any time in any way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is talking about some kind of \"peaceful solution\" while making a provocation by labeling our dignified country as a \"state sponsor of terrorism\". Its pitiful lot reaffirms the philosophical truth that we were absolutely right to choose the path for simultaneously pushing forward the economic construction and the up-building of the nuclear force and we must continue to keep the treasured nuclear sword in our hands more tightly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. will be held entirely accountable for all the consequences to be entailed by its impudent provocation to the DPRK."

            "content": "Minju Joson Rejects Japan's Territorial Claim to Tok Islets as Pipe Dream\r\nPyongyang, November 22 (KCNA) -- The Japan Defense Ministry in its defense white paper, published every year since 2005, has specified Japan's dominium over Tok Islets as a fait accompli. The same thing happened in the defense white paper for this year, too. In the meantime, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan decided to put into practice next year the measure for implementing the future study guidance for primary and secondary schools which made it obligatory to educate students in Japan's dominium over Tok Islets, even though it was originally planned to be applied in 2020 and 2021 respectively.\n\t\t\t\t\t A commentary of Minju Joson Wednesday dismisses Japan's territorial claim to Tok Islets as a gangster-like far-fetched assertion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's territorial claim to Tok Islets is fundamentally different from the issues of retaking territory usurped by other country or restoring the sovereignty of a country in its nature, because Tok Islets are not Japan's territories but part of the inviolable territory of Korea, the commentary says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Very clear is the reason that Japan is making so strong claim for the islets which are so small as to be marked as a point on map.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If they make Tok Islets territories of Japan, the islets can be taken as having been occupied by other country and then this will be enough to kindle the ambition for restoration of sovereignty and territory among the Japanese nationals.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the point sought by the Japanese authorities. In order to make a territorial issue and then create conditions favorable for realizing their ambition for militarist reinvasion, the Japanese authorities have become so zealous in their call for dominium over the islets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their scheme for reinvasion while eyeing the post of \"leader of Asia\" is a foolish dream that can never come true."
