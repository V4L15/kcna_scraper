She made up her mind to give birth to children and let them stand at the defence post where she had done. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Her wish came true 20 years later.  She brought up a son and two daughters and let them join the KPA. Her elder daughter Son Kyong Sil was sent to serve at the same coastal battery that she did. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Son Kyong Sil had the special honor of being received by General Secretary Kim Jong Il during his on-site guidance to the battery in November, 1997. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He was greatly satisfied to learn that Son Kyong Sil was standing guard over the post to succeed to her mother and acquainted himself in detail with what her family was doing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He spared time to meet Om Pok Sun and her husband and told them about their daughter in January, 1998, busy as he was providing the army-first revolutionary leadership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Taking into consideration the loyalty of Om who was devotedly working in the revolutionary spirit of soldiers, always considering herself to be in the army, even after her discharge, he showed such loving care for her as letting he rejoin the army and work as a political officer.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And on Feb. 17 this year he asked all of them to come to see him so as to arrange a meeting of the members of her family serving at the different posts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He highly praised them as the first family of revolutionary servicemen, and called on the whole country to follow their example. He had a picture taken with them and hosted a luncheon for  them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Greatly inspired by this profound trust and love, Om Pok Sun's family is firmly determined to uphold with loyalty Kim Jong Il's army-first revolutionary leadership as a model of revolutionary families of servicemen. \r\n\r\n"

And the two sides agreed to closely cooperate in the international arena to frustrate those moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Russian Foreign  Minister's visit to the DPRK and the signing of the new treaty marked an important occasion in developing the relations between the two countries based on the long-standing friendship in conformity with a new situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    It is the view of the DPRK that the relations of friendship and good neighborliness between the DPRK and Russia will dynamically develop in the future, too, by the concerted efforts of the two sides in the spirit of the new treaty. \r\n"

They sold Tok Islet, an inalienable territory of Korea, and fishing ground surrounding it to Japan, decided to call the Japanese king representing the criminal Japanese  \"Emperor\" and opened door of South Korea to the Japanese corrupt \"pop culture.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They have turned South Korea into a harsher fascist society against democracy than in the former dictatorial \"governments\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their \"people-veiled\" fascist rule, the rotten politics, has reduced the South Korean economy into total bankruptcy,  producing 8 million jobless people, 13 million absolute poor and 1.1 million lunatics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their heinous crime in the two years of office is that they laid a more stumbling block in the way of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The present chief executive told without hesitation that \"the reunification will not be realized during his term of office\" and \"he  will leave this issue to his successor.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean ruling quarters have taken the lead in carrying into practice the \"operation plan 5027-98\", the U.S.'s scenario of war against the DPRK, while crying that they would continuously pursue the \"policy of engagement toward the north\" under the \"support\" of the outside forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They ran wild to develop and deploy long-range missiles capable of attacking the whole territory of the north,  staged war exercises such as \"Foal Eagle\" and \"Ulji focus lens\" with the U.S. aggression forces and committed armed provocations against the north at the West Sea of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As long as they are allowed to stay in power, South Korea can never escape from the yoke of double colonial subjugation by the United States and Japan and it is impossible to realize its people's desire for democracy and reunification. As a result, South Korea has gone to ruin in all fields of politics, economy and culture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is the lesson the South Korean people have again drawn from the two years' rule by the \"people's government.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There is no future for traitors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the South Korean authorities are insisting on the flunkeyist, fascist, anti-reunification and confrontation treacherous policies, they will only face a bitter curse and denunciation by the people and be thrown into the scrap-heap of history. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "S. Korean authorities' intensified military provocations \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 28 (KCNA) -- The South Korean authorities are persisting in military provocations in waters under the DPRK's military control at the West Sea of Korea these days, thus further aggravating tensions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As known, the DPRK, through a special communique of the general staff of the Korean People's Army dated September 2, 1999, clarified the Military Demarcation Line at the West Sea of Korea and solemnly declared that the \"Northern Limit Line\" set by the U.S. in an arbitrary and brigandish way is invalid and its right to defend the MDL at the West Sea of Korea will be exercised by various means and methods. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Nevertheless, the South Korean authorities have illegally infiltrated \"ROK\" army warships into waters under our military control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   These warships are still violating these waters under the pretext of the \"Northern Limit Line\" unilaterally set by the U.S. masters. Worse still, they are crossing and recrossing the \"limit line\" like cat burglars as they did on February 22 and 25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What cannot be overlooked is the fact that the South Korean authorities set the \"period for perfecting combat preparations\" from February 20 to march 30 and have drastically amassed up-to-date war equipment in this zone in view of the \"lesson drawn from the naval battle at Yonphyong.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Recently alone, they introduced a new type of 155 mm self-propelled howitzers and a large quantity of shells into Paekryong and Yongphyong islets. On February 23 and 24 including mid-February, they staged a \"test-firing\" under the simulated conditions of a battle to \"destroy\" warships of the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In addition, they additionally deployed many guided weapons launchers in islets in waters under our military control including Paekryong, Taechong, Sochong and Yonphyong islets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean military have reorganized the commanding system of the \"ROK\" army units deployed on the west coast and dispatched high-level warmongers including commanders of the second fleet and the marine corps to five islets at the west sea including Paekryong Islet to examine the \"combat capabilities\" and stage war exercises under various names. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWe cannot but take a more serious view of these ill-boding developments as they are timed to coincide with those moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All facts fully show that the South Korean authorities, encouraged by the U.S., are openly preparing for a new conflict at the west sea of Korea in a bid to use it as a pretext to ignite a war of aggression on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They should clearly know that our people's army is sharply following every movement of the enemy with a heightened vigilance and act with discretion, properly judging what will follow the present silence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They will be held wholly responsible for all the serious consequences to be entailed by their reckless acts. \r\n\r\n"

It is also a political trick intended to split and disintegrate the community of Korean nationals in Japan and eventually, undermine the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon), a dignified organization of overseas compatriots of the DPRK, the statement says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Instead of making apology and compensation for the crimes committed by Japan against the Korean people in the past, the Japanese authorities are seeking to reduce Chongryon and Korean residents in Japan into a political plaything of Japan, ignoring the dignity of the DPRK. This is as good as throwing a wet blanket over the desire for improved DPRK-Japan relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They should immediately withdraw the \"bill on prefectural suffrage\" and stop the anti-DPRK, anti-Chongryon moves at once, if they truly hope for the improvement of relations with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We will decisively reject any infringement upon Chongryon and Japan-resident Koreans' democratic national rights, regarding it as an act of violating the sovereignty of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the Japanese authorities persistently legislate the \"prefectural suffrage,\" disregarding our warning, they will be entirely to blame for all its grave consequences. \r\n\r\n"

The sea between the Korean peninsula and Japan has been inscribed with \"sea of Korea\" from old times. This is the stark historical fact. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The world people have recognized the East Sea of Korea as \"Sea of Korea\" from long ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Its wrong inscription as \"Sea of Japan\" must be corrected on any account. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan's insistence on the wrong inscription at the current session reveals its unchanged nature of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Noting that at the session the South Korean ruling quarters made no protest against such unreasonable assertion but talked about \"transitional step\" and \"simultaneous inscription,\" the commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This obviously shows that the Japanese blood flows in their bodies instead of our nation's blood. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   To correct the wrong inscription is a joint task of the north and south of Korea, which is directly linked with the defence of the national sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Therefore, the north and the south must take concerted action with a proper understanding of this issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Only by doing so, is it possible to totally clear away the old leftover of the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule and defend the sovereignty and dignity of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan is well advised to deeply repent of its crimes it committed against the Korean people in the past and take a proper attitude to the issue of liquidating all the leftover of the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule over Korea. \r\n\r\n"

Korean colonial dependent  economy disclosed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, February 28 (KCNA) -- The \"economic recovery\" touted by the South Korean authorities is a sheer lie because economy has not been recovered at all but is in the grip of total bankruptcy and the people's living in dire distress, observes Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Though the South Korean rulers claim that there was an increase in \"foreign exchange holdings,\" this was the result of snowballing foreign debts. They borrowed more than tens of billions of dollars from the U.S. and other countries in the last two years of the mandate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   For all their advertisement about the \"increasing rate of economic growth\" enterprises are going bankrupt everywhere in South Korea while the foreign ones operating there have attained growth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   South Korea has to pay more than a hundred billion dollars to other countries and its total foreign debts amount to three hundred billion dollars when the money borrowed overseas is added to this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Under the mandate over 60,000 enterprises have proven insolvent in South Korea and at least 1,000 enterprises have fallen victim to foreign businesses. And the operation rate of some enterprises that survived is much lower than that before the mandate came. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The jobless rate in 1999 is 2.3 times that in the preceding years and a million more people have joined the ranks of the unemployed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The income of the ordinary people dropped 12.7 percent in this period. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   With the South Korean economy in the grip of such uncontrollable depression, the people have been thrown into bottomless abyss of death and the people's living is in the worst destitution. Only a tiny handful  of the privileged class who account for less than 0.3 percent of the population have become richer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is the truth about the South Korean rulers loudmouthed \"economic recovery.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the lesson to be drawn from this deplorable reality that as long as South Korea remains a colonial dependency, it can neither get rid of economic bankruptcy nor can it improve the people's living. Bankruptcy of South Korean economy is unavoidable. \r\n\r\n"
