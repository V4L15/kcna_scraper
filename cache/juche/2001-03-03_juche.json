            "content": "DPRK FM spokesman on its principled stand toward DPRK-U.S. relations \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 3 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry gave an answer to a question put by KCNA today as regards the U.S. side's reaction to the recent statement issued by him.\r\n He said:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already reported, on Feb. 21 we issued a statement of the spokesman for the Foreign Ministry clarifying our principled stand toward a torrent of hardline remarks made By the new U.S. administration against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tenor of the statement is that if the U.S. propose dialogue we will respond to it with dialogue and if the U.S. comes out in confrontation we will counter it with confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the United States is spreading the rumour that the DPRK is \"threatening\" it in a bid to shift the responsibility for the possible worsening DPRK-U.S. relations onto the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We have neither intention nor capacity to browbeat anyone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is none other than the DPRK which is exposed to threat owing to the conservative hardline stand expressed by the U.S. administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The same is true of the issue of offering light water reactors to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The prospect for the provision of LWRS under the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework is becoming more gloomy and this gravely threatens the DPRK's right to existence as it is suffering acute shortage of electricity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under this situation it is self-evident that it is difficult for the DPRK to unilaterally and indefinitely keep in force such measures as moratorium on the launch of satellites and missiles taken by it with good faith for DPRK-U.S. dialogue, to say nothing of the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Of course, we take note of the statement of the authorities of the U.S. administration that they would implement the agreed framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What we need now is not empty words but practical actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A year ago, we advanced a concrete proposal for the solution to the issue of the loss of electricity caused by the delayed lwr offer and the U.S. side said that it would set forth an alternative proposal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. side should put forward as soon as possible a solution to the issue of loss of electricity for which it is responsible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is keen to impose unilateral sacrifice and loss upon the DPRK while shunning the fulfilment of its commitment and evade its responsibility by bringing the charge of \"threat\" against it.  The U.S. should know that this wrong great-power chauvinist conception and trite trick will never go down with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK which has sincerely implemented the agreed framework has a legitimate right to call the U.S. side to account for its insincere attitude towards its implementation and an unshakable will to exercise it.    \r\n\r\n"

We extend support and encouragement to our fellow countrymen in South Korea who are voicing strong protest against the Japanese reactionaries' moves to tamper with history and expressing towering resentment against Japan. We believe that they would positively respond to our appeal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The appeal also calls on the people of all other Asian countries who undergone pain and sufferings under the jackboots of the Japanese imperialist aggressors to turn out in a joint struggle to frustrate the Japanese criminal moves to distort history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The appeal expresses belief that the peace-loving people in all the countries of the world would express positive solidarity with the Korean people in their struggle to check the Japanese reactionaries' moves to tamper with history and force them to apologize and compensate for the crime.     \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Anniversary of agrarian reform law observed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 3 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today devotes a full page to an article entitled \"great history of socialist solution to land issue\" on the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the promulgation of the historic agrarian reform law.\r\n Recalling that President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il have given most successful solution to the issue of land which was raised as humankind's historical task, the article refers to their wise leadership and outstanding feats. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The promulgation of the law on March 5, Juche 35(1946) was a declaration on putting a definite end to the exploiting land ownership deeply rooted in the Korean countryside, marked a historic event which brought about an epochal turn in the peasants' destiny and a prelude to the new chapter on the solution to the land issue, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The solution to the issue is a historic task to guarantee the popular masses an independent life. Properly solving the issue of land ownership is prerequisite to settling the question of land and, furthermore, the socialist rural question. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pointing to the shining example set by the DPRK in the issue of land, the article says : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the wise guidance of Kim Il Sung, the Workers' Party of Korea has successfully solved the land issue by laying down correct guidelines and policies at every stage of the revolutionary development and implementing them to the letter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Il Sung promulgated the agrarian reform law without delay after the establishment of the Provisional People's Committee of North Korea and solved all problems in carrying out the reform in conformity with the peasants' requirements and will. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He put up the slogan \"land to the tillers \" and set forth the policy on confiscating the land of the landlords without compensation and distributing it free to the peasants. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a result, the land revolution was successfully carried out in a matter of 20 odd days only half a year after the liberation of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Il Sung steered the drive for agricultural cooperativization in the direction of uniting the peasants close around the party by closely combining the class line and mass line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle of land distribution, the method of enforcing the agrarian reform and the class policy, all enforced at the time of the land reform, were not picked up from any classics but were confirmed by him on the basis of his deep grasp of the situation in rural areas through his tour of those places including taedong county, South Phyongan Province.  The policy on agricultural cooperativization was a unique policy laid down by him after the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n True to the noble intention of Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il paid deep attention to the rural question as early as in the 1960s and has since energetically led the drive for its solution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il toured various local areas and acquainted himself with the situation there and discussed the orientation and ways of settling the rural question with the president before the publication of the rural theses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il published the famous work \"position and role of the county in socialist construction\" right after the publication of the theses and further enriched and developed the theory on regional base clarified in the rural theses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that a bright prospect was opened in the DPRK for the socialist solution of the land issue, the article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il, considering it as a work of eternal value for the complete solution of the land issue and an important work for building a powerful nation to change the appearance of land beyond recognition in the socialist society, comprehensively expounded the idea and line of the Juche-oriented land levelling and rezoning. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The originality of his idea of this land realignment lies in that he proposed this work as an important socio-political work to completely remove the leftover of feudal land ownership and highlight the characteristic feature of the socialist state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His dynamic and clear-sighted leadership lies in that he chose one province as a unit for this gigantic undertaking and has pushed ahead with it in a big way throughout the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The great victory achieved in the socialist solution to the land issue fully demonstrated the undisputed superiority of socialism to capitalism, it concludes."
