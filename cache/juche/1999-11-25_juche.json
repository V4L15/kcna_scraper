This is intolerable   stooges of the imperialists, hack writers, bourgeoisie-paid scholars and others who dislike the ideology and social system in the DPRK are now taking great pains to tamper with the history of our revolutionary struggle and disparage it by citing figures and happenings from a few documents. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Asahi Shimbun released this false report on the basis of misinformation about Kim Il Sung's revolutionary history in disregard of our materials on the history. This is an intolerable insult to the Korean people as it is a sheer distortion of the genuine history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   No matter what others may say, our history will remain as it is. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Whenever there was a sign of fresh improvement in the DPRK-Japan relations, some media at the instigation of the Japanese right-wing reactionaries intentionally spread misinformation provided to them by the South Korean intelligence institutions in a bid to throw a wet blanket over the efforts to open the relations between the two countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Such a provocative article appeared in the Japanese paper at a time when the public in Japan and abroad are lifting up their voices demanding Japan's liquidation of its past and improved DPRK-Japan relations as days go by with the present century coming to its end and the DPRK visit of a Japanese supra-partisan delegation is high on the agenda. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This merits our particular attention. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We lodge a stern protest with the paper against its sheer false report and strongly demand it apologize for it at once.  \r\n\r\n"

If this is tolerated, it will result in escalating   the arms race and missile race in northeast Asia, the world's biggest hot spot,  and the military tensions not only on the Korean peninsula but in the far east. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. has forced others to observe international conventions and principles related to world peace and security while violating them  and the South Korean authorities have followed its policy. This double-dealing attitude should not be tolerated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The letter expressed the expectation that the world's anti-war and peace organizations, which  have valued peace and security of humankind and carried on energetic activities to defend them, will work to check the moves of the South Korean authorities  to develop long-range ballistic missile at the U.S. connivance and continue to pay deep attention to the issue of ensuring peace on the Korean peninsula in accordance with the desire of the Korean nation and humankind to live in a new peaceful century free from war and confrontation. \r\n\r\n"
