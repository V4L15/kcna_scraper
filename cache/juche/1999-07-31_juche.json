But the Japanese authorities are foolishly scheming to settle the crimes with a small amount of money, turning away their face from state responsibility and legal compensation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The international community confirmed the past crimes of Japan as the crime of human rights violation and violation of the international law and is urging it to hold state responsibility and make a legal compensation. If Japan fails to get rid of the present stance and position, it will not enjoy even elementary trust from the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The appeal strongly called upon judicial and human rights organizations and the progressive people of the world to conduct a widespread solidarity movement to put pressure upon the Japanese government to admit state responsibility and make a legal compensation for the past crimes as demanded by the former \"comfort women for the army\" and the victims of forcible draft and the international community. \r\n\r\n"

Meanwhile, the construction of the Korean War memorial \"state museum\" is progressing apace in Chicago, the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In these burlesques they seek an ulterior intention to beautify the history of aggression and incite a fever of aggression on the DPRK to unleash a second Korean war at any cost, the commentary observes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We are compelled to heighten vigilance against these farces as they are synchronized with the moves of the U.S. bellicose forces and their stooges to ignite a war against the DPRK that have reached a very reckless stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The burlesques prove that the enemy may start a war against the DPRK any time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people and people's army will closely follow the moves of the enemy, and will not miss the opportunity to deal a merciless punishment to the enemy if he unleashes a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States and its followers should squarely face the reality and give up the dirty burlesques. \r\n\r\n"

Korean ruler's obstruction\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 31 (KCNA) -- If the South Korean ruling quarters turn to obstruct South Koreans' tour of Mt. Kumgang, we will not remain a passive onlooker to this but take a strong step against it. They will have to  bear full responsibility for the grave consequences to be entailed by this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This warning was served by a spokesman for the Korean Asia-Pacific Peace Committee in a statement today denouncing the South Korean authorities for trying to flee from the responsibility for the suspension of the tourism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The spokesman said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities are going berserk in a bid to create the impression that Mt. Kumgang tourism was a \"benefit\" given to the north by them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They are imprudently letting loose a string of jargons about \"possibility\" or \"impossibility\" of tourism, painting Mt. Kumgang tourism as a \"present\" given to us. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What cannot be overlooked is that having suspended the tourism, they asserted the Hyun Dai Business Group should bring documents that \"provide for personal safety\" and \"return on the same day\" if a tour boat is to sail, and they insisted that they will \"not allow the boats for tour of Mt. Kumgang to leave,\" dispirited by our reasonable and principled stand to meet the wish of the South Koreans to come to see Mt. Kumgang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThey went the length of scattering anti-north leaflets in the air above the area of Kuryong fall of Mt. Kumgang on July. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is a premeditated and intentional move to totally block the Mt. Kumgang tour by South Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWe will not remain a passive onlooker to the anti-national acts of the South Korean authorities to put a check-bar on the tourism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We have no idea of arguing any longer with the South Korean authorities who have hindered the tourism, a non-governmental project between the north and south, asserting that they cannot allow tourists boats to leave for the north. \r\n\r\n"
