Why? It is because the DPRK is fully ready for confrontation with the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will emerge victorious in the showdown with the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently the deputy spokesman for the UN Secretary General made it clear that the Unite Nations didn't command any units during the Korean war in the 1950s nor played any role in commanding forces deployed in Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This clarification was like a bolt from the blue to the U.S. which has floated for decades an absurd story that the \"UN Forces\" have been deployed in south Korea to protect it from the possible attack from the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This also proves that the U.S. imperialists make whatever lies to realize its ambition for dominating the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, its policy of strength toward the DPRK has ended up in failure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. will have to admit the stark reality."
