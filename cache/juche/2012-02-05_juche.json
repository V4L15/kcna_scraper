Paektu, called a holy mountain of the Korean revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His old home was a small log cabin emanating the personality of the legendary Korean guerillas. It was gun-report of the anti-Japanese war that he heard as lullaby.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Born as the son of the guerrillas, he reliably defended the sovereignty of the country and socialism from the imperialists' threat for aggression, holding high the banner of Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He turned the DPRK, founded by President Kim Il Sung, into a political and ideological power which achieved the single-minded unity of the whole society unprecedented in the history of world politics and into a military power any formidable enemy dares not pounce upon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He unfolded the grand plan for building a thriving socialist nation and wisely led the Korean people to steadily make world-startling, signal achievements in building an economic power."
