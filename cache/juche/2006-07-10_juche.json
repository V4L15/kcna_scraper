They all serve the working masses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Educational, public health and cultural institutions are called by \"people\". Among the institutions named by the President are the Pyongyang City People's Hospital No.1 (October 20, 1945), the University of National Economics, the People's Palace of Culture and the Grand People's Study House. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are many honorary titles including People's Artiste and People's Athlete to be awarded to those who have distinguished themselves for the society and collective. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people, with deep reverence, look back on the whole life of President Kim Il Sung who had dedicated his all for the people under the motto \"The people are my God\".    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Abolition of SOFA Demanded\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 8 (KCNA) -- The people from all walks of life in south Korea should turn out in a fiercer nationwide anti-U.S. struggle for independence to have the south Korea-U.S. \"Status of Forces Agreement\" scrapped and drive the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces out of south Korea as they are the root cause of all disasters.\r\n A spokesman for the North Side Headquarters of the Nationwide Special Committee for Probing the Truth behind the GIs' Massacres urged this in a statement on July 8, 40 years after SOFA was concluded between south Korea and the U.S. on July 9, 1966. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n SOFA stipulates that the issue of criminal jurisdiction over any crime committed by U.S. soldiers and employees of U.S. forces units and the issue of compensation claimed by local people should be handled in the interests of the U.S., legalizes its forces' right to free use of all facilities and areas under their control and does not oblige them to restore any damaged ones to their original state in case of their return to the south Korean side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the strength of SOFA the U.S. forces have arrogantly behaved as a dominator over south Korea for 40 years, committing all sorts of hideous crimes in south Korea without hesitation such as man-killing and plunder. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  GI criminals are granted extraterritorial rights without being subject to any sanctions and punishment as evidenced by the fact that the two GIs were declared not guilty even after killing two schoolgirls in cold blood in south Korea in 2002. Such deplorable situation is due to \"legal guarantee\" provided by the shackling and unequal SOFA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are persisting in such brigandish arbitrary practices as cruelly depriving south Korean civilians of their cradles under the pretexts of \"relocation of the U.S. forces\" and \"transfer of military bases\" for the purpose of igniting a war against the north and pressurizing the south Korean authorities to increase \"the share of expenses for their upkeep.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people can never escape from the present misfortune and pain and the peace of the country and security of the nation can not be preserved as long as the U.S. forces are present in south Korea and SOFA remains in force.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
