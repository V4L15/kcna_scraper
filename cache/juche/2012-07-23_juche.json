They will serve as a historical occasion of fully displaying the firm confidence and will of all the service personnel and people to glorify for all ages the exploits in war victory and the exploits of Songun revolution achieved by Generalissimos Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, and strikingly demonstrating the might of powerful country of Mt. Paektu under the leadership of Kim Jong Un."

            "content": "KCNA Commentary Slams Lee Myung Bak's Nonsense\r\n Pyongyang, July 23 (KCNA) -- The south Korean Lee Myung Bak regime is resorting to a sleight of hand to conceal its attempted heinous state-sponsored terrorist act. Involved there are TVs, Dong-A Ilbo, Yonhap News and other reptile media. They blared that the north's assertions are groundless, going the length of saying that organizations of \"defectors from the north\" could have done it.\n\t\t\t\t\t It is as a despicable act as trying to get the sun eclipsed by palm.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The attempt at demolishing statues of the peerlessly great persons of Mt. Paektu is a heinous politically-motivated terrorist act which the Lee puppet regime pushed forward in an intentional and planned way under the manipulation of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As far as the \"Statue Demolition Society\" in which Jon Yong Chol was involved is concerned, its aim is to demolish leaders' statues in the DPRK. The organization exists in reality in south Korea and those involved in it are not subject to any legal sanctions. What does it mean?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the illegal investigation into civilians shows, a word and a footstep made by people in south Korea are under watch and control of the Intelligence Service. Those who write or speak in praises of the north are fated to be handcuffed and those who visited the DPRK where their fellow countrymen live are to be taken away to prison. This is the situation of south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The existence of the said organization is absolutely impossible without the interference of the puppet regime which is keen on confrontation of social systems and fratricidal showdown.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The same is the case for an explosive launcher. This time the criminals tried to introduce three parts of an explosive device in secrecy through different channels as it was a terrorist weapon whose use is banned worldwide, assemble it on the spot and examine its performance before finally handing it over to a person who would execute the \"plan\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nearly millions of U.S. dollars were allocated for the manufacture of the launching device and its secret introduction. How can it be done by the organizations of stooges such as the \"Front for Liberation of the North Koreans\" and the society?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As widely known to the world, to get a job in south Korea is more difficult than dying. Moreover, \"defectors from the north\" are snubbed and censured everywhere. They are denied jobs and suffer from uneasiness and fear. Finally, they join the anti-DPRK plot-breeding organizations such as the front and the society in order to keep dirty bodies alive. If those fools imported and circulated even terrorist weapons for special use with their own money, this would make even a cow laugh.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The bandit of such human scum planned to photograph through the satellite the area where the \"case\" will occur in a bid to attain the \"greatest effect\" of the \"undertaking\". This is something impossible to be done alone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the facts clearly show that the attempt to demolish statues is from A to Z a heinous criminal act which was openly choreographed by the Lee regime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the group of traitors is letting reptile media blare that a civilian organization could have been behind the case. This is another outrageous politically-motivated provocation and invective slandering the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will never remain a passive onlooker to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Anyone who intends to dare hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and encroach on it even a bit will never be able to survive on the earth."

All these facts are well known to the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They made no scruple of daring hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and trying to commit even hideous terrorist act. Clear is that if the Lee group had not been seated on the chair of power, the reconciliation, cooperation and unification between the north and the south would have been brought earlier.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reunification of Korea is being put off, not because of lack of money but due to the anti-reunification group of traitors like Lee.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee's fate is now at stake as he is forsaken by not only south Koreans but his clan including the \"Saenuri Party\" due to a series of scandals involving his relatives and confidants.

The U.S. assistant secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs said they will draw an \"international responding line\" to head off north Korea's \"additional provocation\". The U.S. secretary of State said the \"way of provocation\" by north Korea \"is a grave threat to the security in Asia and the rest of the world\".

General Assembly resolutions and international conventions on terrorism were adopted in the 20th century, defining terrorism as international crime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism, adopted at the UN General Assembly in 1994, and the code on crimes against peace and security of mankind, adopted at the U.N. Commission on International Law, define as a serious international crime any country's act to organize, encourage and instigate activity intended to undermine or destabilize other country's socio-political system, making it a duty for all nations to prohibit such conducts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the United States, which has staged 'total war on terrorism' after the '9/11 incident', committed extra large-scale terrorist acts against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The news of attempted terrorism is giving a great shock to the international community.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ri Kyong Chol, a section chief of the institute, said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"There are many international conventions on combating terrorism at present.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Typical are the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings and the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. These conventions elaborate on the kinds of international terrorism and stipulate that those who commit such crimes be severely punished regardless of their political motives and prescription be not applied to those criminals.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recently detected terrorism against the dignity of the DPRK supreme leadership is evidently a hideous crime contrary to the internationally-established anti-terrorism system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In particular, the system prohibits encroachment upon the life, health and honor of heads of state. Nevertheless, the United States appointed as targets of terrorism the statues of the great men whom the DPRK people are holding in high esteem as their eternal leaders and attempted to use the internationally banned explosives.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Han Sok Bong, a researcher at the Institute, said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"With the recent hideous terrorist attempt the U.S. seriously encroached on the security of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to international law, a victim state is entitled to take necessary counteraction against an assailant state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should admit the gravity of the terrorist case and officially apologize to the DPRK for this hideous crime.\""
