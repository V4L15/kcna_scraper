The workers in all the fields of national economy including electric power, coal and metal industries and railway transportation should redouble their efforts to bring about a fresh economic surge. Sustained vigorous efforts should be directed to major construction objects including the reconstruction and renovation in main streets of Pyongyang, construction of large hydro-power stations and land alignment. Scientists and technicians should attain without fail their goals to modernize the national economy and put it on a new scientific and technological basis. All the Party members and other working people should make positive efforts to boost the production with increased zeal and steadily improve the quality of products by fully meeting the needs of technical processes and norms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Party members and other working people of the units honored with the on-the-spot guidance given by Kim Jong Il should take the lead in implementing the tasks set forth in the joint editorial. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to continue giving full play to the heroic fighting spirit and ardent patriotic devotion in the drive to implement the tasks set forth in the joint editorial. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The editorial calls for fully displaying the revolutionary soldier spirit in the efforts to thoroughly implement the tasks and pulling through difficulties with the might of unity so as to effect signal collective innovations in every part of the country.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Strict Application of Idea of \"By Our Nation Itself\" Urged \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 24 (KCNA) -- \"By our nation itself\", the basic spirit of the June 15 joint declaration agreed upon by the north and the south of Korea and supported by all the Koreans, is an idea common to the nation that all its members should uphold and apply in the way of national reunification.\r\n Rodong Sinmun stresses this in a by-lined article on Tuesday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people in the north and the south of Korea are of a homogeneous nation who has lived with the same blood and language, building a brilliant culture in one territory for thousands of years. They should be reunited as a community bound together by common destiny, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle of national independence should be firmly maintained in the development of the north-south relations. The cause of Korea's reunification should be realized by its nation itself according to the independent will and demand of the nation with it as the master. Therefore, it is necessary to develop the north-south relations strictly on the basis of the principle of national independence, regarding it as their lifeline. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also important to develop the inter-Korean relations by means of national cooperation. Only steady north-south national cooperation based on the idea of \"By our nation itself\" can prevent the danger of a new war in the Korean Peninsula and bring about a decisive phase in the improvement of the north-south relations and the reunification of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a dangerous factor worsening the situation and endangering the inter-Korean relations to stage joint military exercises with outsiders against the other party, while singing the ballad of peace on the Korean Peninsula. However, the south side is now staging joint military exercises against fellow countrymen, reading outsider's face and cooperating with it under its pressure, failing to take the stand of national cooperation, and thus driving the situation of Korea to catastrophic phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to remain true to the idea of \"By our nation itself\", it is urgent to remove the barriers of confrontation in system existing within the nation at an early date. Legal mechanism is an obstacle to removing confrontation and distrust between the north and the south and developing their relations in accordance with the idea of \"By our nation itself\". There still remains in south Korea the \"National Security Law\", and such practices are witnessed as judging ideological realms of society and the north-south relations with the NSL as a yardstick. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea of \"By our nation itself\" laid down in the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration is the key to the improvement of the inter-Korean relations and solution of the problem of national reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And the U.S plans to form a large fleet and stage a joint war rehearsal in early November against the DPRK involving \"sea search\" in the East Sea of Korea together with the Japan maritime \"Self-Defence Force\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In staging very provocative war games against the DPRK while driving the situation to the extreme phase of confrontation and war through unprecedented maneuvers of sanctions and blockade, the U.S. and its followers seek to put military pressure on the DPRK and bring it down. For this criminal purpose the U.S. imperialists have long resorted to sanctions and military aggression against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is, however, a pipe dream that can never come true. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And it is a hare-brained folly leading to self-destruction for the Japanese and south Korean pro-U.S. warlike forces to join in the dangerous play with fire, dancing to the drum-beating of the U.S. imperialists in the anti-DPRK racket with daggers in their belts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., Japanese and south Korean warlike forces should no more run amuck but immediately stop the provocative war exercises, pondering over the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by their saber-rattling.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
