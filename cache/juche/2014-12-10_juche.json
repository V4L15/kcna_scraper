            "content": "ACNC comenta el incidente de Ferguson\r\nPyongyang, 10 de diciembre (ACNC) -- Hace poco, las autoridades judiciales de Missouri de Estados Unidos decidieron no acusar al policia blanco quien en agosto pasado, mato a tiros a un muchacho negro.\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta decision demuestra claramente a todo el mundo que EE.UU., que preconiza tanto la \"defensa de los derechos humanos\" y la \"igualdad de todas las personas\", es la tierra privada de derechos humanos y el reino de discriminacion racial. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa discriminacion racial en Estados Unidos se agrava cada vez mas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn esa sociedad tenebrosa los negros sufren la discriminacion racial, la falta de derechos politicos, la penuria y los maltratos y viven con el panico al fusilamiento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos incidentes sucesivos de fusilamiento a los negros son desastres y actos de violacion de DDHH causados por las autoridades estadounidenses. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo el amparo abierto de las autoridades, los policias encargados de la seguridad del pais matan a golpetazos a los negros a plena luz del dia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon motivo del incidente de Ferguson, se desarrollan en mas de 170 ciudades norteamericanas las protestas contra la politica racista. En tal circunstancia, en otra ciudad un policia mato a tiros a un adolescente negro revelando otra vez el caracter corrupto de la sociedad norteamericana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos asesinatos de negros por policias blancos es la caza de negros de version moderna. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas fuentes extranjeras comentan que son mas los negros muertos a manos de los policias que los asesinados por los gangsteres o narcotraficantes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, no se castigan los policias en los casos de asesinato ocurridos por el abuso del poder. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHasta Obama, afrodescendiente elegido como presidente prometiendo resolver el problema de desigualdad racial, dice que EE.UU. es el pais fundado segun la ley y se debe acatar la decision de las autoridades judiciales. Como se ve, en EE.UU., autodenominado como \"defensor de derechos humanos\", no se cambia nunca la politica racista aunque se cambie su presidente. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora el incidente de Ferguson afecta mucho la \"diplomacia de derechos humanos\" de EE.UU. que presenta como meta diplomatica la \"divulgacion del valor de derechos humanos y democracia\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa sociedad internacional y la prensa mundial lo protestan como \"un incidente de desigualdad que mancha el prestigio de EE.UU. que se creia campeon en la defensa de DDHH\" y \"climax de la cronica discriminacion racial de la sociedad estadounidense\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 28 de noviembre pasado, el comite anti-torturas de la ONU urgio a EE.UU. a investigar el abuso del poder y la reaccion excesiva de la policia contra las minorias. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs natural la internacionalizacion del problema de discriminacion racial de EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, el gobierno norteamericano no toma ninguna contramedida. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras que existan el problematico sistema de derechos humanos y la discriminacion racial arraigada en la sociedad estadounidense, se repetira el incidente de Ferguson en EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs muy ridiculo que EE.UU. tilde de \"violadores de derechos humanos\" a los paises que mantienen el regimen y el modo politico propios. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe aceptar con sinceridad las criticas unanimes de la sociedad internacional y resolver primero el problema de derechos humanos de casa."
