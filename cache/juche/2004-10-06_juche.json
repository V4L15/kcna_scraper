            "content": "S. Korean Authorities' Scheme to Register DMZ as World's Heritage Lambasted \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 5 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland in a statement Monday condemned the scheme of the south Korean authorities to register the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) along the Military Demarcation Line as a world's heritage and open it to international tourism, branding it as a vicious challenge to the aspiration and desire of all the fellow countrymen for the reunification of the country and an anti-national folly to perpetuate the division of the nation.\r\n It is a behavior bereft of common sense to register as a \"heritage\" the DMZ which is symbolic of misfortunes and sufferings of national division and along which the north and the south are standing in acute military confrontation, the spokesman said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Along the DMZ towns and villages which had once been cradles of life of people have disappeared without leaving a trace and roads, bridges and pylons which had linked the north and the south as one territory remain a symbol of pains and grievances of division owing to the barbed-wire entanglements and concrete wall running across the waist of the country, bisecting it. It is only too clear that this zone cannot be a \"heritage.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To want to register and preserve the DMZ as a world's \"heritage\" is a disgrace and shame to the nation. The DMZ dividing one territory into two should not be preserved but be totally removed together with the barbed-wire entanglements and concrete wall of division and the country be reunified into one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that the International Court of Justice and the United Nations some time ago adopted a resolution on opposing the building of artificial walls in some countries and demanding their immediate demolition, the spokesman urged the south Korean authorities not to dream of making money on the DMZ but to make a bold decision to pull down the concrete wall first of all for the sake of national reunification, looking straight into the aspiration of the nation and the trend of the times.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Dismisses Story about DPRK's Pursuance of \"Uranium Enrichment Program\" \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 5 (KCNA) -- There is public opinion in the United States that the story about the DPRK's development of \"uranium enrichment\" was deliberately faked up by the Bush administration to prevent the inter-Korean and the DPRK-Japan relations from improving.\r\n Selig Harison, senior researcher at the U.S. International Policy Center, in an article criticized the Bush administration for hyping up the threat caused by uranium, asking it if the administration has any evidence to support its assertion that north Korea has developed weapon-grade uranium enrichment facilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The story about the DPRK's uranium enrichment program much touted by the U.S. is nothing but groundless and base propaganda. It was a product of the despicable plot hatched by ultra neo-conservatives of the U.S. in the wake of U.S. presidential envoy Kelly's Pyongyang visit in October 2002. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. asserted that the DPRK must scrap its nuclear program first and it has been pursuing a uranium enrichment program at the several rounds of the six-party talks and other working-level talks only to be rebuffed. It is well known to everybody that far from drawing a proper lesson from this, the U.S. has persistently raised hue and cry over the program and even peddled the story about Pyongyang's \"secret sale of uranium hexafluoride\" to make its story sound plausible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aim sought by the U.S. in this is to isolate and strangle the DPRK by laying an international siege to it after charging it with nuclear weapons development and, furthermore, topple its political system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a trite method employed by the Bush administration to fabricate misinformation and encroach upon the independence of sovereign countries on its basis. This is clearly proved by its aggression against Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a widely known fact that the Bush administration first raised the issue of the development of weapons of mass destruction to invent a pretext to invade Iraq, disarmed it through arms inspection and then brought down its legitimate government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seems to try to repeat what it did in Iraq in the DPRK. But that is a pipedream. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. moves to pressurize the DPRK over its nuclear issue and its adventurous attempt to provoke a nuclear war against it have resulted in totally overturning the groundwork for the dialogue between the DPRK and the U.S. for a solution to the nuclear issue and escalating the military tension on the Korean peninsula and this put it on the verge of a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the established war scenario of the U.S. to launch an all-out nuclear war on the peninsula and escalate it into its surrounding areas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This military strategy of the U.S. will inevitably spark off confrontation and clashes in Northeast Asia, to say nothing of the Korean peninsula, as it is aimed to establish its unchallenged domination over the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. invasion of the DPRK would lead to another world war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had better ponder cool-headedly over the grave consequences to be entailed by the outbreak of a war and stop its policy of pressure upon the DPRK over the nuclear issue and confrontation with it, going against the trend of the times.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is the trait and pluck of the army and people of the DPRK to react against a provocation with a retaliation, and a challenge with a merciless blow. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should stop at once their reckless moves for arms buildup, pondering over the serious consequences to be entailed by their moves for military confrontation with north, it urged.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It goes without saying that it would have been better if direct import and export of the substance had been made between the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is deplorable that the south Korean authorities raised a hue and cry over the issue, far from regretting the failure to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is intolerable that they are taking legal actions against those enterprises that had produced and exported the substance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite natural to handle the issue of the north's import of the substance produced in the south in the interests of the whole nation. The attitude taken by the south Korean authorities towards the export of sodium cyanide is related to a fundamental issue showing whether they stand for national cooperation or cooperation with the outside forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent misbehavior of the south Korean authorities clearly proved that their action does not match their words as they talked about \"cooperation\" and \"exchange\" with the north whenever an opportunity presented itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The authorities should drop their antipathy towards the north at an early date and swim with the trend of the times for reunification after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration which calls on all Koreans to get reconciled and cooperate with each other in the efforts to achieve independent progress.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In this regard Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says in a signed commentary:\r\n The issue of Japan's becoming a permanent member of the UNSC is unthinkable unless the issue of its past history is settled. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a legal and moral obligation and an unavoidable duty of Japan to apologize and compensate for its crimes committed against the people of Korea and the rest of Asia in the past. Japan is keen to set out for world supremacy and the ranks of permanent members of the UNSC to this end. In other words, by occupying a permanent seat on the UNSC Japan seeks to pressurize and dominate other countries and thus lord it over the world. It asserts that the issue of history is different from the issue of making a bid for a permanent member of the SC in its nature. This is an insult to the people of Asia and the rest of the world who hope to see Japan's settlement of its past and a disregard of the UN. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is making a pitch for a permanent member of the UNSC under the pretext that it pays a big share of the contributions to the UN. A permanent seat on the UNSC can in no way be bought. How much a country should contribute to the UN is fixed by the statute of the UN. The UNSC is neither an economic organization nor a board of directors of a company. Japan is sadly mistaken if it thinks it is entitled to sit on the SC for the mere reason that it pays a huge amount of fund as a contribution to the UN. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the fair public opinion that if major international political issues are to be impartially discussed and settled, permanent seats on the SC should be given to those countries that have an independent view, judgment and say, those countries enjoying support and trust from many countries and various developing countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An important issue Japan should settle at an early date is not an issue of becoming a permanent member of the SC but get international trust through the settlement of its past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This would be a right option for Japan.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
