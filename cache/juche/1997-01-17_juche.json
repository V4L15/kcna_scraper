This is because the traitor Kim Young Sam has pursued \r\na flunkeyist and anti-social economic policy after he took \r\noffice.\r\n   After his assumption of office he opened the rice \r\nmarket, though any preceding dictator dared not do it. He \r\nled the whole of the south Korean economy to catastrophe.\r\n   The Kim Young Sam group are describing the revised \r\n\"labour laws\" as ones for \"economic restoration\" and a \"new \r\nleap\". This only brings their anti-social Colors.\r\n   History shows that those resorting to the fascist laws \r\ncan never remain long.\r\n   The Kim Young Sam group will be overthrown by the massive \r\nstruggle of the people. \r\n\r\n"
