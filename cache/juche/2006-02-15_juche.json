The higher the developing countries hold the banner of unity, the firmer guarantee they can provide for the security of every country and the more stable phase of peace they can bring to it in its efforts to build a new society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they make an effective use of each country's economic and cultural potentials on the basis of the successes and experience already gained on the principle of unity and cooperation, they can settle a lot of problems arising in the building of a new society.\r\n What is important for strengthening unity and cooperation among developing countries is to abide by the principle of respecting sovereignty.\r\n The developing countries should boost the economic cooperation on the principle of collective self-reliance and, at the same time, energetically struggle against the old international economic order imposed by the imperialists upon them.\r\n To protect resources is one of the effective ways of destroying the old international economic order and establish a new and fair one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The developing countries should strengthen the unity and cooperation to smash the imperialists' moves to loot resources and replace the unfair old international economic order by a new and fair one.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
