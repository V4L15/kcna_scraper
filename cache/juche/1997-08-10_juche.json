Thanks to our broad-minded effort, tentative agreement was reached at the preliminary meeting on a series of matters such as the level of participants, the venue and procedures of the \"four-way talks.\" however, there were raised seriously conflicting views on some key issues such as the agenda.\r\n   Our main principle concerning the agenda is that the \"four-way talks\" should not discuss internal affairs of our nation in any case and, accordingly, the agenda of the talks should be defined in concrete and explicit terms.\r\n   The conclusion of a peace agreement between the DPRK and the United States and the U.S. troop pullout, which we proposed as the agenda items, are the key to the preservation of peace on the Korean Peninsula. at the same time, these issues cannot be settled between north and south Korea.\r\n   If there are no such issues, there is no reason to hold \"four-way talks\" including foreign countries concerned, because the issues that can be settled between north and south Korea have all been agreed upon and specified in documents. \r\n   The United States, however, refused to accept such issues as agenda items and insisted on Generalising the agenda items so that other issues can be discussed.\r\n   We suspect that the U.S. intends to avoid its responsibility and interfere in internal affairs of our nation.\r\n   What also disappointed us was the U.S. position that food assistance to the DPRK can be expanded only after the \"four-way talks\" are opened.\r\n   With serious food problem, we guard against possible use of food assistance to the DPRK as a political weapon at the \"four-way talks.\"\r\n   The U.S. attitude at the preliminary meeting added fuel to our fear.\r\n   The preliminary meeting also proved that we were right in fearing that the inequality in mutual relations between the parties to the talks may affect the principle of impartiality in discussions.\r\n   Because the U.S. fortunately came out to the negotiation table, though belatedly, in response to our long-time call for terminating the armistice and establishing a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, we will watch their attitude for some more time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
