            "content": "Unconverted long-term prisoners must be repatriated unconditionally\r\nPyongyang, March 21 (KCNA) -- Kang In Dok, \"Minister of National Unification\" of South Korea, told a press conference some time ago that, since South Korea suffered \"enormous losses\" from the repatriation of Ri In Mo, it would not repeat the same \"mistake\" in the issue of repatriating unconverted long-term prisoners.\r\n   Commenting on his outbursts, Rodong Sinmun today says:\r\n   To repatriate unconverted long-term prisoners of the DPRK origin, who were taken prisoner while in the Korean War, is a humanitarian issue rather than a political issue and an inviolable requirement of international law and the Korean Armistice Agreement.\r\n   It is only too right that Ri In Mo was repatriated to the socialist homeland.\r\n   As admitted by the world, his return bears nothing harmful but good for the improvement of the north-south relations and reconciliation and unity.\r\n   Kang In Dok's remark about South Korea's losses is nonsense. Ri must have been repatriated long before.\r\n   The DPRK government has already expressed its apprehension and disappointment at the fact that Kang In Dok, who is detrimental to improving the relations between the north and the south and reunification and who cannot share the lot with the nation aspiring after reconciliation and reunification, was appointed to a ministry in charge of the reunification question.\r\n   We are all the more concerned and disappointed about his indecent remarks.\r\n   How to approach the issue of repatriating unconverted long-term prisoners is a touchstone which distinguishes between reconciliation and confrontation and between reunification and division.\r\n   The ruling quarters of South Korea must ponder over the serious consequences to be entailed by their wrong attempt to use the issue of repatriating the unconverted long-term prisoners for their sinister political purpose and return all of them to the north unconditionally.    \r\n \r\n"

It plans to mount a land mobile offensive with huge ground forces the nucleus of which is the 8th army on one hand and, on the other hand, make intensive strikes at the DPRK from the sea and sky with the naval and air forces.\r\n   The reorganisation clearly proves that the U.S. scenario of Korean War has entered the stage of implementation.\r\n   To provide against this situation, the DPRK government issued a wartime mobilisation order throughout the country and hurled all the armed forces including the people's army into military exercises. This is a very just self-defensive measure to prevent war and preserve peace on the Korean peninsula.\r\n   The United States must give up the reckless policy of strength to test the will of the Korean people.    \r\n \r\n\r\n"

And its basic demand is to strictly defend their independence against all forms of subjugation and restriction. It is hard to regard this stand as the same with the materialistic stand that everything should be viewed by focussing on material conditions since the world consists of material.\r\n   The creative stand is one that the masses of the people ought to play the role as transformers of the world and shapers of their own destiny. And it fundamentally requires that all the problems should be solved in a creative method  with reliance on inexhustible creative strength of the masses and their creativity. This stand is different from the dialectical stand of the preceding philosophy considering that the world consistently changes and develops, so everything should be viewed as process of change and development.\r\n   The might of the Juche idea as instrument of practice can be increased only when the people have a correct understanding of the independent and creative stands and adhere to them in the revolution and construction, the article stresses.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is our people's spirit not to fear a war.\r\n   The warmaniacs must clearly know it and really act with prudence.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
