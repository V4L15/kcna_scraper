Seeing with keen interest data on the development of the station inaugurated in 1972, he noted that leader Kim Jong Il had shown special care for the soldiers of KPA Unit 549 President Kim Il Sung wanted to inspect in his lifetime. They would have been very glad to know that the station has made a big haul for the soldiers, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He toured different parts of the station to learn in detail about its fishing and management.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is spectacular to see the pickling tanks and freezing storehouses full of fishes, he said, repeatedly expressing great pleasure over the fact that the station caught thousands of tons of fishes in a few days.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He called on the station to set a high goal for remarkably increasing the yearly output of fish in a short span of time on the basis of this year's achievement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also stressed the need to arrange enough sharp-freezing and refrigerating facilities for supplying fresh fishes to the soldiers in all seasons and raise the proportion of mechanization in unloading, sorting, freezing and storage works while taking care of fishing boats and economizing in the use of fishing materials.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The station should be turned into a modern fishery base to go well with shore scenery and to be impeccable even in the distant future, he said, adding it is needed to give face-lifting to all production and living buildings and construct breakwater and wharf better.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His visit to the station is aimed to not only congratulate it on its achievement in fishing but also provide a fresh turning point in the work of the station, he noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Modernization of the station will help it catch more fishes, he said, adding: The station should be turned into an up-to-date fishery base which can be boasted of in the world, thus making our ongoing efforts produce good results for the servicepersons and civilians. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  He said that the loud whistle fishing boats in the fisheries run by the KPA are sounding in the area of the east sea to herald big hauls serves as a source of giving inspiring strength to the civil fisheries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed belief that the officials and employees of the Fishery Station No. 15 under KPA Unit 549 would renovate the station wonderfully as intended by the Party and greet the 7th WPK Congress with the greater success in fishing as befitting the makers of the history of big fish haul.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accompanying him were So Hong Chan, Jo Yong Won and Han Kwang Sang."
