            "content": "Ri Hoe Chang's Ambition for Power Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, November 26 (KCNA) -- Voices are growing ever louder in the north and the south of Korea and overseas denouncing traitor of south Korea Ri Hoe Chang's ambition to grab power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Home media of the DPRK come out every day with commentaries and articles bringing into glaring light the flunkeyistic treacheries, anti-reunification crimes, corruption and swindle committed by Ri Hoe Chang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentaries dismiss his running for \"presidency\" as a ludicrous kicking and struggling and a fantastic daydream of a political living corpse preoccupied with greed for power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun carries serial articles uncovering the past crimes of Ri Hoe Chang under a fixed headline. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, answering a question put by KCNA, said it was an intolerable insult to the south Korean people and an unpardonable mockery of justice and consciousness for Ri, who had been forsaken by the times and public sentiments for his despicable flunkeystic treacheries, anti-reunification crimes, corruption and swindle, to attempt to seat himself in the \"presidential\" post. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Angry voices of denunciation are coming also from the south Korean political quarters including the \"New Democratic Party for Great Unity\", \"Democratic Party\", \"Creative Party\" and the Democratic Labour Party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the failure of Ri in the past two \"presidential elections\" had been a moral judgment passed on him, a spokesman of \"Chongwadae\" said his running for the forthcoming election was an act ignoring and insulting the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"Grand National Party\" is also firing off volleys of criticism on Ri Hoe Chang by every means available. It warned that if anyone within the party communicated secretly with Ri, he would be sternly reprimanded. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many organizations such as the south Headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification and the People for Achieving Peace and Reunification released commentaries condemning the traitor's drive for power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Solidarity for Implementing the South-North Joint Declaration in a statement urged the whole progressive camp to make thorough exposure of the irregularities and corruption committed by traitor Ri Hoe Chang including the cases of \"Pyongphung,\" \"Sephung,\" \"Chongphung\" and \"Anphung,\" and to form an all-people front of struggle against Ri. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The General Association of Koreans in China issued a statement calling for a stern punishment of Ri, a heinous sycophantic traitor and anti-reunification element, in the name of nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Cha Sang Bo, vice-chairman of the General Association of Koreans in China, and Mun Thae Hwan, chairman of the Federation of Korean Youth in China, in their statements appealed to the 70 million fellow countrymen to turn out as one in the patriotic struggle of justice to decisively shatter the plot of Ri Hoe Chang, a pro-U.S. stooge and kingpin of irregularities and corruption, to seize \"power\" and drive this despicable traitor once and for all from the arena of history.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is the most just idea as it helps strengthen the international solidarity and make a positive contribution to the cause of global independence.  Rodong Sinmun Monday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK and the DPRK government have firmly upheld and consistently adhered to the idea of independence, peace and friendship, thus dealing a heavy blow at the imperialist forces keen to maintain their outdated international order, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK and the government of the DPRK are holding high the banner of Songun now that the imperialist forces are working hard to stamp out the idea of independence, peace and friendship by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Songun provides the party and the government with the most powerful weapon and guarantee for defending and implementing the above-said idea. What the Korean people keenly realize at present is that but for Songun there would have not been independence, peace and friendship. For the DPRK Songun precisely means independence, peace and friendship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-mentioned idea unites the anti-imperialist independent forces and encourages them in the energetic endeavors to accomplish the human cause of independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historic Pyongyang Declaration serves as an immortal revolutionary banner for uniting the revolutionary parties and people aspiring after socialism as it confirmed the truth and validity of the cause of socialism and its sure final victory. More than 270 political parties have actively turned out in the struggle to accomplish the cause of socialism since they signed the declaration. This represents the victory of the unity registered in the socialist movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK and the DPRK government, holding aloft the banner of independence, peace and friendship, have striven hard to achieve common progress, developing relations and cooperating with those countries and nations, irrespective of ideas and systems, when they were ready to deal with the DPRK on the principle of equality, respecting its sovereignty and not interfering in its internal affairs. This has contributed to putting spurs to the development of international relations and the victorious advance of the cause of global independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The WPK and the DPRK government will make every possible effort in the future, too, to materialize the idea of the foreign policy of independence, peace and friendship, under the uplifted banner of Songun, concludes the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

El logro de esta sustitucion puede eliminar el estado de enfrentamiento militar en esta peninsula y solucionar por si solo el problema del aseguramiento de la confianza entre la RPDC y EE.UU. La actitud de este ultimo pais sobre dicha sustitucion sirve de un cartabon para distinguir si desea la paz o persigue la guerra en esta peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Eliminar las relaciones hostiles y lograr la confianza entre los dos paises es indispensable para asegurar la paz de la Peninsula Coreana, normalizar las relaciones bilaterales y mejorar la imagen de EE.UU. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Este pais debe poner fin a sus maniobras encaminadas a hacer sus bases militares de Japon y el Sur de Corea y retirar a sus fuerzas amadas agresivas de la Peninsula Coreana y la region de Asia-Pacifico.
