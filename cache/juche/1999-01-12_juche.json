            "content": "Nothing can be expected from DPRK-U.S. agreed framework\r\n   Pyongyang, January 12 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today comes out with a signed commentary on the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework reached in Geneva.\r\n   The news analyst of the paper says:   Four years have passed since the agreed framework was adopted and effectuated. However, the United States has not faithfully implemented any of its commitments. On the contrary, it has intentionally delayed or evaded its implementation.\r\n   This compels the DPRK to expect nothing any longer from the agreed framework.\r\n   If the U.S. imposes military confrontation in violation Of the Geneva agreement, the Korean People's Army and people will answer it with the mode of counteraction of Korean style.\r\n   The DPRK draws not a small number of conclusions and lessons from the stand and attitude taken by the United States toward the agreement in a little over four years.\r\n   First of all, the DPRK has come to clearly penetrate again into the U.S. hypocritical and deceptive double-dealing nature.\r\n   The United States will not find words to deny that the U.S. President's letter of guarantee that he would certainly implement the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework has been reduced to a mere sheet of paper which is of no use.  The DPRK feels disillusioned with the behaviour of the United States which reverses what it promised to do and pretends that it has not made any promises. In other words, the U.S. is the most bad-natured of countries which are deceptive and are different in word and deed.\r\n   The U.S. has approached the agreed framework with extreme shamelessness and arrogance.\r\n   It used to make unilateral demands, crying as if the agreement were a u.s. Favour to the DPRK.\r\n   It has misjudged its opponent.\r\n   When the agreement was adopted, the DPRK guessed that the United States might use it as a lever to wither the DPRK to death and, therefore,  has since approached it with the sharpest vigilance.\r\n   What the u.s. took into account was that if it tightened economic sanctions and put military pressure, delaying the construction of Light-Water Reactors and suspending the supply of  heavy oil time and again, the DPRK would wither to death in a few years.\r\n   The DPRK has never pinned hope on or trusted any U.S. \"favour.\"\r\n   The U.S. insincere attitude and stand toward the agreed framework prove once again that the position of the Korean People's Army is right.\r\n   The KPA's position is that diplomatic negotiation is not the only way for solving matters.\r\n   Our determination is getting firmer day by day.\r\n   We cannot be bound to the agreed framework, suffering only losses.\r\n   As was pointed out in the indictment of the Korean Anti-Nuke Peace Committee, the U.S. moves to delay implementing the Geneva agreement have had a bad effect on our socialist planned economy as a whole. As a result, direct losses caused by them amount to tens of billions of dollars.\r\n   We cannot suffer such losses for an indefinite period.\r\n   Moreover, we have no intention of observing the Geneva agreement because the united states refuses to abandon its attempts to use it as a lever to stifle the DPRK.\r\n   It is high time the U.S. clarified its stand about whether it will implement or break the agreed framework.\r\n   The DPRK also has the right of choice.    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n"

Korean authorities denounced for railroading \"fisheries accord\" \r\n   Pyongyang, January 12 (KCNA) -- The South Korean coalition ruling parties single handedly railroaded a motion  on the treacherous \"fisheries accord\" signed with the    Japanese reactionaries through the \"national assembly.\" \r\n   Commenting on this thrice-cursed crime of the South Korean authorities in selling part of the territory and doing harm to the national interest, a news analyst of rodong sinmun today says:   the \"fisheries accord\" is the worst of flunkyism and treachery.\r\n   TOK islet in the middle of the East Sea of Korea is an inseparable territory of Korea. The islet as well as the whole land of Korea has a 5,000-year long history of the nation. It is known to the international community as a Korean islet.\r\n   Nevertheless, the South Korean rulers gave up dominium over TOK islet and transferred a wide area of the east sea of Korea to Japan by adopting the \"fisheries accord,\" yielding to the brigandish demand of the Japanese reactionaries.\r\n   The entire nation is trembling with anger at the unpardonable crime of the South Korean rulers who obtained \"promise of cooperation\" against the nation in reward for selling off the islet.\r\n   They are pro-Japanese flunkyists who are the same with \"five traitors of Ulsa (1905)\" and traitors who have no national dignity and soul.\r\n   It is none other than the \"people's government\" that will unhesitatingly sell off the country and nation as a whole to outsiders and plunge the nation into scourge of war if it is to prolong its days as a colonial stooge and live in luxury and comfort. \r\n   The South Korean rulers should immediately repeal the \"fisheries accord\" resolutely opposed by the people, step down and face judgement by history.    \r\n \r\n"
