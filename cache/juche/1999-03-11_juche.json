            "content": "Deceptive argument about \"security\"\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 11 (KCNA) -- The South Korean chief executive turned up at the graduation ceremony of the Military Academy on March 8 and made provocative remarks against the north.    He asserted a way of ending the Cold War on the Korean peninsula was to prevent the north from undertaking armed provocation through tightened security and on this  basis accommodate positive changes in the north to bring about stability in the peninsula. After his coming into power he never let a chance pass by without arguing about that kind of \"security,\" which he described as a key to the pursuance of his policy towards the north.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   However, it is becoming clearer with each passing day that his platitude about \"security\" is little different from that of his preceding dictators for maintenance of power.   He talks about \"reconciliation and cooperation,\" after coining new phraseologies \"sunshine policy\" and \"engagement policy\" in a desperate effort to disavow it, but he is still free with such a bellicose statement as \"tightened security,\" which manifests his sinister intention to stifle the north by force of arms, backed by outsiders. From the historic point of view and in the light of the requirements of the situation on the peninsula and the desire of the fellow countrymen for peace, stability, great national unity and reunification, the \"security\" on his lips is not acceptable to anyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In fact the U.S. which is chiefly responsible for the division of the peninsula is trying hard to set up the \"Theatre Missile Defense\" system in Northeast Asia on the plea of \"security,\" crying for cooperation of Japan and South Korea in this program.   It is obvious that the \"security\" which needs increasing military spending by tens of billions of dollars will certainly lead to the aggravation of the situation in and around the peninsula and the outbreak of a war.   The \"security\" called for by the South Korean authorities who are working just to meet the political and military interests of the U.S., their master, cannot be interpreted otherwise than an argument about war against the compatriots.  The present South Korean chief executive's cry for such \"security\" only goes to prove that he is little different from his preceding dictators of South Korea who staked their fates on flunkeyism and treachery. \r\n\r\n"

Urging the United States to drop it, the commentary goes on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DPRK can not remain an onlooker to the scheme of the U.S. Defense Department to establish the system even in South Korea as well as Japan on the plea of the \"missile threat\" from the DPRK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This plan is heavily getting on the nerves of the DPRK.   Recently, a group of U.S. hawks in its \"report on North Korea\" openly called for a preemptive attack on the DPRK.   Hostile relations between the two warring parties the DPRK and the United States have reached the brink of conflagration.   It is, therefore, reckless for the United States to establish the \"Theatre Missile Defence\" system in South Korea and Japan at this critical juncture.   The U.S. is describing this system as an \"umbrella\" for \"protection\" of the U.S. forces in South Korea and Japan in a bid to justify its plan, but it does not go down with anybody.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Underlying the U.S. plan for the establishment of the system in South Korea and Japan is its intention to take a military upper hand in the region and use it for attacking the DPRK. The move will only spark a new arms race and Cold War and increase the danger of war.   The United States is well advised to forgo this action. \r\n \r\n"

Commenting on this, a news analyst of Rodong Sinmun today says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   The South Korean authorities simply said they \"welcomed\" the DPRK's proposal for dialogue as an \"affirmative one\" coming short of officially clarifying their stance. However, they have ceaselessly committed acts of gainsaying what they said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is a mockery of the nation aspiring after reunification and an insult to the dialogue partner.   The major items of the DPRK's proposal are not preconditions for dialogue between the north and the south but they are aimed at making a new start for inter-Korean dialogue and opening a new chapter of sincere dialogue for reunification.   Accordingly, the South Korean authorities should take a proper stand and attitude toward the three principles of national reunification, implement those items essential for inter-Korean dialogue at an early date and come out for dialogue with the north.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is our stand that if the South Korean authorities implement those major items at an early date, we will hold dialogue with them even in the first half of this year.   The South Korean authorities should immediately remove obstacles in the way of north-south dialogue so that it may begin in a good atmosphere at the earliest possible date. \r\n\r\n"

It is of great importance in disseminating modern science and technology among agricultural workers and developing agriculture.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A film \"Good-quality calcine coal obtained from slag\" shows the method of substituting calcine coal made by an easy method for coke and charcoal.   The film scientifically proves that good-quality calcine coal can be used as substitute fuel almost at all units in various domains of the national economy where high caloric coal is used.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   \"Micro Computer\" introduces programs which are of great economic significance. The programs have been developed by the Korean Computer Center.

In an article sent to KCNA on March 10, he said the \"restructuring\" is a treacherous act aimed at deepening the colonial dependence of the South Korean economy and a criminal act intended to fill pockets of exploiters seeking high profits and to justify the exploitation of the workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is quite natural that South Korean workers have turned out in a massive struggle against the \"restructuring.\" so, they can never be a target of suppression, he said, and went on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of the unemployed has reached 2 million in South Korea in March. This suffices to show how vital rights of the South Korean workers have been threatened.   It is a proud and righteous action that the South Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and workers under it declared that they would wage an all-out struggle in March and April for the right to existence, and have risen up in the struggle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The fascist oppressors must stop acts of infringing on the rights and interests of workers and the physical suppression.

            "content": "S. Korean authority's \"sunshine policy\" rejected\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 11 (KCNA) -- A South Korean political critic Jong Nam published an article entitled \"I refute 'sunshine policy',\" the Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation said.   The author of the article said:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The \"sunshine policy\" brought forward by the master of Chongwadae as a program for improved relations between the north and the south is a continuation and replica of the anti-north confrontation policy of the successive regimes.   Just as the successive \"governments\" never worked out any policy toward the north with their own brains, \"sunshine policy\" of the present chief executive was also invented by the United States as its \"policy of strength\" did not work with North Korea.   The \"sunshine policy\" borrowed from Aesopian fables means to strip the north naked with the help of a brain of an alien who had lived in ancient times.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Some time ago, the master of Chongwadae asserted the \"sunshine policy\" was the same with the policy whereby the United States had destroyed and induced former socialist countries to reforms and opening, thus fully disclosing its ulterior purpose.   The \"sunshine policy\" means to undress the north in all aspects of politics, economy and military affairs. Accordingly, it is quite an immoral behaviour of desecrating the personality of others.   By bringing forward the \"sunshine policy\" meant to give light and heat to the north, the master of Chongwadae has self-exposed that he is a megalomaniac ignorant of his position and bereft of reason.   South Korea, a colonial state dependent upon the United States in politics, economy, military affairs and culture, has no thread of light to give to others.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There is light in the north, not in the south.    The north is the sole sun's state which other countries of the world envy. The reason is that in the north, human dignity has reached the highest level under the guidance of the great leader, the people's welfare is being promoted day by day and it has a bright future of eternal prosperity.\r\n   The outcries of the master of Chongwadae about engagement and sunshine are the height of shamelessness and folly.   Giving the lie to the \"sunshine policy\" peddled by the self-proclaimed \"people's government\", Jong Nam said the principle of separating politics from economy on which this policy is based is an empty talk.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He continued:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;South Korean businessmen's contact with the north is possible only with strict prior permission of the \"Ministry of National Unification\" and only under its control and inter-Korean economic cooperation is also subjected to ceaseless political restriction, bound by poisonous articles of laws on north-south exchange and cooperation and its enforcement ordinances. This is an undeniable fact.   Reciprocity coined by the present chief executive of South Korea as the basic principle of inter-Korean relations is a concept which is contrary to the \"sunshine policy\" which he claimed beneficial to the north.   By the policy of giving priority to security the South Korean authorities mean that it is based on security and that when security and reconciliation and cooperation conflict with each other, the former is placed before anything else. This is a negation of reconciliation and cooperation and a call for anti-north confrontation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The real nature of the \"sunshine policy\" on the lips of the \"people's government\" has been brought into bolder relief when it defined the north as the \"principal enemy\".    The whole nation is surprised and enraged at the self- contradictory behaviour of the South Korean authorities talking about \"sunshine\" and \"engagement\" after defining the brothers and sisters in the north as the \"principal enemy\".   All facts prove that the \"sunshine-policy\" this \"government\" is advertising as an \"about-face policy toward the north\" is nothing but a confrontation policy seeking mistrust and tension, not reconciliation and cooperation with the north, and a war policy seeking collapse and overthrow, not co-existence and co-prosperity. \r\n\r\n"
