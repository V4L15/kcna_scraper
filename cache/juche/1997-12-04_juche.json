Kim Jong Il inspects Kim Chaek Air Force University\r\n Pyongyang, December 4 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Il, General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, Chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission and Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army (KPA), inspected Kim Chaek Air Force University on November 30.\r\n   He was accompanied by Director of the KPA General Political Department Jo Myong Rok, Chief of the KPA General staff Kim Yong Chun and KPA generals.\r\n   He, who was guided to an education room furnished with revolutionary relics, said the Juche-based air force could be founded and could grow into a formidable force thanks to President Kim Il Sung's clairvoyance and wise leadership.\r\n   General Kim Jong Il learnt about how education was going on at the university. He said that as military science was ever being developed and military equipment improved, the cadets should be given new military technology so fully that they could become commanding officers and technical personnel capable of creditably performing their duty in modern war.\r\n   He made the rounds of a bedroom, mess hall, education room and other logistic, cultural and educational facilities and resting places of the university and watched a basketball game.\r\n   He said it was a good thing that the cadets were studying and living full of revolutionary optimism and confidence. He also said if the cadets were to be reared as healthy and optimistic revolutionaries, it was necessary to organize sports and art activities on a wider scale.\r\n   He, noting that the university took a big share in the development of the nation's air force, gave highly important tasks which would serve as guidelines in the university's education and management.\r\n   He gave the university a pair of binoculars and an automatic rifle as a gift.\r\n   He then had a picture taken with the university's instructors and cadets.\r\n   After the inspection, the Supreme Commander appreciated with them a performance given by the merited choir of the KPA song and dance ensemble.    \r\n \r\n"

In the course of this, she awakened people politically and rallied them around revolutionary organisations.\r\n   And she built up centres for activities of underground workers at a photograph studio, tailor's shop and other places.  \r\n   After revolutionising the area and setting up a powerful network of underground organisations, she conducted the assistance work for the Korean People's Revolutionary Army (KPRA) and military reconnaissance activities.\r\n   In those days,  she secured a large quantity of cloth and materials for 600 military uniforms and caps needed for operations of the KPRA in the homeland. \r\n   When she raked out information that the Japanese imperialists, who had suffered a crushing defeat at the historic Pochonbo Battle on June 4, 1937, mobilized large armed forces in \"punitive\" operations against the KPRA, she reported it to the KPRA headquarters in time and thus greatly contributed to the victory in the Jiansanfeng Battle on June 30, 1937.    \r\n \r\n"

The Monday's edition of the daily dealt with \"suspected remittance to north Korea\" by the Korea bank Osaka Credit Union under the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon).\r\n   In a commentary Rodong Sinmun says:\r\n   It is really deplorable and surprising that the Mainichi Shimbun, a leading newspaper of Japan, has carried such a false report, which is part of the anti-DPRK, anti-Chongryon campaign.\r\n   The false report is apparently prompted by an ulterior political purpose.\r\n   The report came after the first batch of Japanese wives in the DPRK visited their hometowns in Japan and a delegation of the three ruling coalition parties of Japan visited the DPRK. From this point of view, it was intended to freeze the improvement of DPRK-Japan relations.\r\n    It must make an adequate apology to the DPRK and Chongryon for its false report, insert a correction regarding it and stop such false propaganda. If it continues serving the \"ANSP\" as its mouthpiece in the anti-DPRK, anti-Chongryon campaign, the responsibility for all the consequences will be placed on it.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
