            "content": "DFRK Exposes True Colors of U.S.-S. Korea Alliance\r\n Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of Korea (DFRK) Tuesday released a memorandum showing the history and true colors of the U.S.-south Korea alliance as regards the fact that the south Korean puppet regime has gotten more hell-bent on sycophancy and treachery, confrontation with the fellow countrymen and anti-DPRK war moves while crying out for strengthened alliance with the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t Terming the U.S.-south Korea alliance a master-servant tie-up, an inequitable alliance based on subjugation and submission and a war alliance for carrying out the U.S. policy of aggression, the memorandum said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists landed in south Korea on September 8, 1945 to replace the Japanese imperialist aggressors defeated in the Second World War and then proclaimed their military administration, enforcing the colonial government-general rule through it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They staged the ruinous \"separate elections\" in May of 1948 and set up the Syngman Rhee puppet regime in August that year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the emergence of the puppet regime, various \"agreements\" and \"treaties\" were concluded under the coercion and wire-pulling of the U.S., and they all were no more than nooses to colonialize south Korea as a whole in political, economic and military aspects.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On August 24, 1948, the U.S. egged traitor Syngman Rhee on to sign the \"status of forces agreement on tentative military affair and security in transitional period\" in a bid to justify its military occupation system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under this \"agreement\" the U.S. offered the puppet army huge munitions enough to arm tens of thousands of troops, many weapons seized from the defeated Japanese imperialists and U.S.-made warplanes and warships so as to make preparations for an aggression on the northern half of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., which ignited the Korean War on June 25, 1950, cooked up an \"agreement on jurisdiction over the U.S. forces in south Korea\" in July to put the prerogative of the puppet army, including the right to command operation, under its control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Due to this \"agreement\" the south Korean puppet army was enrolled into the \"UN forces\" and the commander of the \"UN forces\" exercised full command over the puppet army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S.-south Korea \"mutual defense treaty\" was officially signed in Washington on October 1, 1953. The \"treaty\" in its article 4 calls for conferring on the U.S. the right to deploy its three services in any part of south Korea. The article 6 stipulates the \"treaty\" as \"indefinitely valid\" so as to \"justify\" the U.S. forces' permanent presence in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"treaty\" is the worst unequal and shackling one, quite different from similar treaties the U.S. concluded with other countries, as it gives no restriction to the U.S. in reducing south Korea to its military bases, allowing its military presence for an indefinite period.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. fabricated the U.S.-south Korea \"agreed minutes\", a supplementary agreement of the \"mutual defense treaty\", in November of 1954 and reaffirmed its permanent presence in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S.-south Korea alliance has recorded the history of aggression, war, plunder and subjugation for the last seven decades since the U.S. imperialist aggressors' occupation of south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After issuing the \"joint statement\" of the puppet regime and the \"UN Command\" in May, 1961, the U.S. stepped up the preparations for war of aggression against the DPRK by continuing to seize the right to command operations of the commander of the \"UN forces\" over the puppet army, investing a huge amount of funds for beefing up armed forces for aggression and intensifying war drills. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On the strength of the alliance, the U.S. imperialists hurled troops of the south Korean puppet army, colonial mercenaries, as cannon fodder into shambles of wars of aggression, large and small, ignited by them in different parts of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On July 9, 1966 the U.S. faked up the SOFA, giving the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces in south Korea privileged position rare to be found in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On the strength of the humiliating SOFA the U.S. imperialist aggressors have made no scruple of perpetrating murder, rape, plunder, destruction and all other crimes in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In December, 1994 the U.S. staged a farce of transferring the peacetime operation control to the puppet forces but it was a crafty artifice to quell the people's anti-American sentiment and desire for independence and calm down the criticism at home and abroad of the U.S. military presence in south Korea and colonial domination over it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It declared transfer of OPECON in April, 2012 but installed a pro-U.S. conservative regime, instigating it to repeatedly extend the transfer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through deceptive \"aid\" it strengthened the system of neo-colonialist domination over south Korean economy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the mid-1960s the U.S. put the bulk of financial budget and banking funds of south Korea under its control and monopolized 70-80 percent of supply of raw materials and 80 percent of trade.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. forced south Korea open its market, deepening economic infiltration into the latter and its dependence on the former.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It cooked up the humiliating FTA, putting south Korea deep into colonial yoke.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet conservative group is making last-ditch efforts to prolong its despicable remaining days in reliance on the alliance with the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What the present puppet regime has done so far since it came to power was the acts of making south Korea increasingly dependent on the U.S., crying out for tightened alliance with the U.S., and the ones of putting the inter-Korean relations into the worst catastrophe through cooperation in confrontation with the DPRK and moves to invade it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how loudly the puppet group may advertise the U.S.-south Korea alliance, regarding it as its lifeline and kowtowing to the U.S., the U.S. considers the puppet forces as nothing but a colonial servant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As long as there exists the U.S.-south Korea alliance, the south Korean people can never free a miserable fate, the danger of a war can hardly be defused on the Korean peninsula and it is hard to expect either peace or the reunification of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S.-south Korea alliance, shame on the nation and obstacle to peace and reunification, should be dissolved without delay, the memorandum demanded."

Such behavior is now enraging all Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t Announcing that south Korea \"co-sponsored\" the \"resolution\", the puppet regime stated that it hails the adoption of the \"resolution\" and \"expects the UN Security Council to play a sustainable and positive role over the north's human rights issue\". It went the lengths of demanding the \"implementation of recommended provisions.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Besides, the regime disclosed its scheme to set up a UN \"office for human rights in the north\" in Seoul soon and intensify the international anti-DPRK \"human rights\" campaign.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this regard the Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) issued its information bulletin No. 1088 on Mar. 30, which said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the foulest anti-national crime that could be committed only by the group of heinous traitors keen on confrontation with fellow countrymen, and this is another unpardonable grave provocation and blatant challenge to the dignity and social system of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"resolution\", railroaded by the U.S. and its followers through the UN Human Rights Council recently, is a heinous politically-motivated fraudulent document for aggression intended to hurt the dignity and prestige of the DPRK and topple its social system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the height of impudence for the south Korean puppet regime to pull up the DPRK over its \"human rights\" performance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should be taken issue at present is the worst human rights situation in south Korea, a colony of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the reality of south Korea that those protesting against the U.S. war drills for invasion of the DPRK and praising their fellow countrymen and calling for national harmony and reunification become a target of harsh suppression, after being branded as \"terrorist\" and \"forces following the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the spies of its Intelligence Service confessed recently after being arrested in the DPRK, the south Korean puppet regime has made no scruple of committing terrorism to hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and bring down its social system under the manipulation of the U.S. Therefore, its call for \"human rights improvement\" is an intolerable insult and mockery of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will never tolerate the U.S. and south Korea's reckless anti-DPRK \"human rights\" campaign aimed to hurt the dignity of the DPRK and bring down its social system but take a staunch action against them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In particular, now that the puppet regime seeks to set up a UN \"office for human rights in the north\", a plot-breeding body, in Seoul so as to turn south Korea into an international hotbed of crimes against the DPRK, it will never overlook this attempt and such office will be the first target of its merciless punishment and strike immediately the office is set up in south Korea."

Among them are U-2, Patriot 3, Longbow AH-64D copters, ATACMS Block 2 and ATACMS Block 1A, M1-A1 tanks, U-2 S Block 20, F-117 stealth fighter bombers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has stockpiled 600 000 tons of war supplies and stored 3 million of depleted uranium shells in such U.S. air force bases as those in Osan, Suwon and Chongju of south Korea in particular.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It decided to deploy THAAD in south Korea and is staging war drills under the simulated conditions of an actual war almost every day with the involvement of huge war hardware including littoral combat ship Fort Worth designed to suit the sea-bed conditions in the vicinity of the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than the peninsula into which latest weapons are being shipped, pursuant to the U.S. policy for aggression against the DPRK and its ambition to dominate the world. A nuclear war may break out any moment on the peninsula as the density of nuclear weapons deployment there has reached the highest in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This being a hard reality, the European countries are mulling massively selling new-type attack helicopters to south Korea.  This is a criminal act of inciting a war, pursuant to the U.S. policy of aggression against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  It is no more than a suicidal act that the European countries are following the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK and war moves against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some countries in Europe are being censured and ridiculed by the international community as marionettes of the White House for blindly following the U.S. scenario.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They have earned an ill-fame as \"human rights abusers\" for conspiring with the CIA in tortures against prisoners and joining in the conspiratorial human rights racket of the U.S. administration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are finding themselves in the most serious dilemma since the end of the Cold War, hit hard by the financial and economic crises and debt crisis in the U.S. while taking advantage of its bubble economy. They are still suffering from their aftereffects.

De esta manera, tomó en sus manos el mando de operaciones y el control sobre el ejército surcoreano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPretextando ese convenio ilícito, incorporó al ejército títere surcoreano a las \"fuerzas de la ONU\" para que el \"comandante\" de estas fuerzas pudiera ejercer el mando sobre aquél. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl primero de octubre de 1953 fue firmado en Washington el \"Tratado de Defensa Mutua\" EE.UU.-Sur de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl capítulo IV del tratado atribuye a EE.UU. el derecho a desplegar en toda la extensión surcoreana las fuerzas armadas terrestres, navales y aéreas, mientras el capítulo VI \"legalizó\" la presencia perenne de las tropas norteamericanas en el Sur de Corea al estipular que \"el tratado es vigente por tiempo indefinido\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl tratado fue el leonino de peor contenido que distaba mucho de otros tratados pactados con otros países sobre el estacionamiento de las tropas norteamericanas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn noviembre de 1954, EE.UU. fabricó \"actas de acuerdos\" como suplemento del \"Tratado de Defensa Mutua\" EE.UU.-Sur de Corea reafirmando su ocupación perpetua del territorio surcoreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante 70 años transcurridos desde la ocupación del suelo surcoreano, la alianza EE.UU.-Sur de Corea registró la historia criminal y vergonzosa de agresión, guerra, saqueo y subyugación. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAteniéndose a la \"declaración conjunta\" del gobierno títere surcoreano y la \"comandancia de las fuerzas de la ONU\", publicada en mayo de 1961, EE.UU. aceleró los preparativos de guerra de agresión anti-RPDC manteniendo el mando de operaciones del comandante de las \"fuerzas de la ONU\" sobre el ejército surcoreano, invirtiendo enormes gastos en el aumento armamentista e intensificando los ejercicios bélicos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY lanzó a los efectivos surcoreanos mercenarios como carnes de cañón para las guerras de agresión desatadas por doquier del mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 9 de julio de 1966, fabricó el \"Acuerdo Administrativo\" EE.UU.-Sur de Corea que permite a las tropas norteamericanas ocupantes del Sur de Corea tener las prerrogativas nunca vistas en otras partes del mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCobijadas por el \"acuerdo\", las tropas yanquis cometen sin vacilación alguna en el suelo surcoreano los crímenes de toda índole, tales como el homicidio, la violación sexual, el saqueo y el sabotaje. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn diciembre de 1994, el imperio orquestó la farsa de entregar a los títeres el mando de operaciones en el tiempo de paz con el astuto intento de calmar el ambiente por la independencia antiyanqui de la población surcoreana y las críticas internas y externas sobre la ocupación del territorio surcoreano y la gobernación colonial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDeclaró que entregaría en abril de 2012 el mando de operaciones en el tiempo de guerra. Sin embargo, tras fabricar el \"poder\" conservador proyanqui, le instigó a aplazar repetidamente el tiempo de su transferencia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA través de la engañosa \"ayuda\", intensificó el sistema de gobernación neocolonial sobre la economía surcoreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA mediados de la década de 1960, tomó en su mano el presupuesto financiero y la mayoría del capital del Sur de Corea y monopolizó 70-80% del suministro de materias primas y el 80% del volumen comercial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon la apertura de mercados norteamericanos, profundizó la penetración y la dependencia económicas del Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl inventar el \"Tratado de Libre Comercio\", colonizó más a los títeres surcoreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tApoyándose en la alianza con EE.UU., la banda conservadora surcoreana realiza el último esfuerzo por mantener su sucia y precaria vida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo que hizo hasta ahora el actual poder surcoreano es haber subyugado más el Sur de Corea al imperio abogando por la alianza y llevado a la fase catastrófica las relaciones íntercoreanas mediante la confabulación conflictiva y las maniobras bélicas contra el Norte de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras exista esa alianza, la población surcoreana no podrá liberarse de desgracias.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNunca se eliminará el peligro de guerra en la Península Coreana ni se podrá esperar la paz y la reunificación del país.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebe ser disuelta ahora mismo la alianza EE.UU-Sudcorea, vergüenza de la nación y obstáculo para la paz y reunificación."
