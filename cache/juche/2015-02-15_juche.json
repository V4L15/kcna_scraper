            "content": "Kim Jong Un Visits Construction Site of Mirae Scientists Street\r\n Pyongyang, February 15 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, first chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK and supreme commander of  the Korean People's Army, guided the construction of the Mirae Scientists Street on the spot after enjoying a bird's-eye view of it from his plane.\n\t\t\t\t\t He, to begin with, commanded a bird's-eye view of the construction site from his plane.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the plane he said that it was very nice to see buildings under construction as required by the lay-out design of the street ratified by the party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed great satisfaction, saying that the frames of the apartment houses and public buildings to be completed in the first phase have sprung up like mushrooms after rain thanks to the devoted struggle of soldier builders. The construction site of the street is reminiscent of those in the 1970s and the 1980s and Pyongyang spirit and speed today are being created there, he added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the objects built in the first phase will look splendid when those in the second phase are constructed well, he fixed the construction projects in the second phase and their scope.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Looking down the magnificent appearance of Pyongyang City changing day by day from the plane, he said he came to have the conviction that if the construction makes progress at this speed, it is possible to successfully face-lift Pyongyang, the capital of the revolution, as a world class city to be envied by the world true to the behests of the great leaders in the near future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then he guided the construction of the street on the spot.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said he was satisfied to look down the construction site from the plane. His face beaming with a broad smile, he added its appearance on the spot looks more magnificent and spectacular.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After being briefed on the construction before a plan showing the  bird's eye-view of the street, he went round flat No.1 on the second floor of block No. 77, geothermal water pumping station and various other places to learn in detail about the first phase construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that the soldier builders are constructing the objects in the first phase of the street as required by the new century, he praised them for having built a new embankment along the bank of the River Taedong after removing the old one to make the street look splendid and successfully constructing the interior of the apartment houses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Underscoring the need to turn the Mirae Scientists Street into the one fully demonstrating the party's policy of attaching importance to science and talents, he stressed that the officials of the relevant unit and soldier builders involved in the construction should complete the street as the one to be handed down to posterity from the stand to ensure the highest civilization and create the maximum speed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that it is necessary to build all structures in such a manner as to preserve their own features and appearances and to be peculiar so as to symbolize the scientists street.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He gave instructions to produce furniture and fixtures for flats at the highest level while building the street and construct well medical care and commercial network and cultural facilities including barber's house, beauty salon, laundry, bath house, dress and shoes repairers, pharmacy, restaurant, shop and library.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  He said that it is necessary to push forward the embankment arrangement of the River Taedong and the greening of the area around the street while stepping up the construction of structures as required by the design and construction method.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  He told the commanding officers to give precedence to the frontline-style political work for giving fullest play to the mental power of the soldier builders, dynamically conduct a socialist competition, pay deep attention to the supply service for them and take care of them like their real parents would do so that they may not have any slightest inconvenience in their living.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Calling for unconditionally completing the first phase construction of the street till the Day of the Sun this year and the second phase construction till the 70th founding anniversary of the party, he stressed that to this end it is necessary to reinforce the construction force of the People's Army and the whole party, state and society should render positive support to the construction of the street.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the construction site of the street is the place which proves the validity of the WPK's construction policy and showcases the level of the Korean people's civilization and mental power of the army and people, he added that under the leadership of the party the recent period witnesses great changes in every site of the grand socialist construction as what is happening in the construction site of the Mirae Scientists Street.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that he came to have stronger confidence that the party's plan for building a rich and powerful nation is sure to come true thanks to such staunch and loyal soldiers while looking down from the plane and watching on the spot them waging a dynamic drive despite the mid winter cold weather.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He extended the militant salute of the supreme commander to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He called on the soldier builders to steadily expand the successes being registered in all projects and carry out their assignments for objects and phases as scheduled and thus powerfully demonstrate once again the truth that the DPRK's determination precisely means practice through the construction of the street.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  He was accompanied by KPA Vice Marshal Hwang Pyong So, director of the General Political Bureau of the KPA, and Han Kwang Sang, department director of the C.C., the WPK."

Trabajo de Corea, Primer Presidente del Comite de Defensa Nacional de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea y Comandante Supremo del Ejercito Popular de Corea, dirigio en el terreno la construccion de la avenida de cientificos Mirae, luego de contemplar desde el avion de uso particular el campo de construccion.\n\t\t\t\t\tMirando el panorama del campo desde el avion, el Mariscal dijo que lucen muy bien los objetos arquitectonicos ubicados segun el proyecto de formacion de la avenida firmado por el partido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGracias a los esfuerzos abnegados de los constructores militares, se levantaron como crecen hongos las armaduras de viviendas y edificios publicos a ser terminados en la primera etapa, apunto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnadio muy satisfecho que este campo de construccion hace imaginar los terrenos de construccion de las decadas de 1970 y 1980 y se crean aqui el espiritu de Pyongyang y la velocidad de Pyongyang de hoy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIndico el objetivo y tamano de la segunda etapa, enfatizando la importancia de terminarla bien para que luzcan mejor las construcciones de la primera etapa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tViendo a bordo de avion el aspecto majestuoso de la ciudad de Pyongyang que se cambia cada dia, tuve la seguridad de que a la velocidad actual de construccion, podemos remozar en un futuro cercano esta capital de la revolucion como ciudad de talla mundial, que envidiaria todo el mundo, segun los legados del Presidente Kim Il Sung y el Dirigente Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLuego, acudio al campo de construccion para dirigir la obra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMe puse complacido al ver desde avion el panorama del campo de construccion y resulta mas espectacular todo lo que veo en el terreno, dijo sonriente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLuego de escuchar explicaciones ante el plano de la avenida, recorrio la vivienda no. 1 del tercer piso del edificio no. 77, la estacion de bombeo de aguas geotermicas y otros puntos de la construccion haciendo conocimiento detallado de la construccion de primera etapa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tContinuo que los constructores militares levantan los objetos de construccion de primera etapa a las alturas del nuevo siglo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara poner de relieve el aspecto de la nueva avenida, ellos removieron el dique original y construyeron el otro nuevo a lo largo de la ribera del rio Taedong y construyen bien el interior de las viviendas, evaluo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRefirio que la avenida de cientificos Mirae debe ser testigo de la politica del partido de dar importancia a las ciencias y a los talentosos y enfatizo que los funcionarios de las unidades correspondientes y los constructores militares deben terminar la obra a ser legada de siglo en siglo con la posicion de crear la mejor civilizacion y la maxima velocidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInstruyo que todas las construcciones deben tener sus particularidades con que puedan simbolizar la avenida de cientificos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEnseno que deben amueblar las viviendas en el maximo nivel y acondicionar la barberia, peluqueria, tintoreria, bano publico, sastreria, zapateria y otras instalaciones de servicios publicos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAgrego que hay que acondicionar bien la red de servicios medicos y comerciales y las instalaciones culturales, tales como la farmacia, restaurante, tienda, biblioteca, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRefirio que se debe acelerar la obra conforme a la demanda del diseno y del metodo de construccion, por una parte, y por la otra, impulsar simultaneamente el ordenamiento de las riberas y la creacion de zonas verdes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEncomendo a los oficiales que desarrollen la emulacion socialista al anteponer las labores politicas a fin de movilizar al maximo las fuerzas espirituales de los constructores y presten profunda atencion a las labores de intendencia y atender bien con afecto paternal las condiciones de vida de ellos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDijo que la construccion de primera etapa debe ser terminada sin falta hasta el Dia del Sol de este ano (15 de abril) y la segunda, hasta el aniversario 70 de la fundacion del PTC (10 de octubre).\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tProsiguio que para ese fin, se debe movilizar mas fuerzas constructoras del ejercito popular y todo el partido, todo el Estado y toda la sociedad deben apoyar activamente la construccion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSubrayo que el campo de construccion de la avenida es un lugar que demuestra cuan justa es la politica del partido sobre la construccion y como son la pauta de civilizacion del pueblo coreano y las fuerzas espirituales del ejercito y el pueblo de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tContinuo que en los ultimos tiempos, bajo la direccion del partido, se crean grandes cambios tambien en otros campos de construccion socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tViendo desde avion y en el terreno a los constructores militares que trabajan intensamente a pesar del frio invernal, redoble la conviccion de que gracias a esos soldados tan indoblegables y fieles, se cumplira sin falta el proyecto del partido de construir una patria prospera, asevero y les envio un saludo combativo del Comandante Supremo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDestaco que los constructores militares deben ampliar los exitos alcanzados en todo el campo de construccion para cumplir como lo planificado las tareas de edificacion de cada edificio y por cada etapa y dia, demostrando asi una vez mas a todo el mundo la verdad de que la decision de Corea es precisamente un hecho consumado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLe acompanaron en esta ocasion el vicemariscal del EPC Hwang Pyong So, jefe de la Direccion Politica General del EPC, y el jefe de departamento del CC del PTC, Han Kwang Sang."
