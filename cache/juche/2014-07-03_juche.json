            "content": "Tactical Guided Missiles Will Continue to Be Launched: KPA Strategic Force\r\n Pyongyang, July 3 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Strategic Force of the Korean People's Army gave the following answer to a question raised by the Joson Inmingun Thursday in connection with the fact that the U.S. is saying this or that to find fault with the tactical guided missile test-fire being conducted by the DPRK:\n\t\t\t\t\t A few days ago, researchers in the field of national defence and workers in the munitions industry field of the DPRK developed and successfully test-fired ultra-modern high-precision tactical guided missiles. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This was followed by successful launching drill of tactical guided missiles by the Strategic Force of the KPA.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The test-fire and launch of tactical guided missiles that took place at a time when the dangerous war provocation moves of the U.S. and its allies have reached an extreme phase are the exercise of the full-fledged sovereignty that showed in practice that those who provoke the sovereignty and the dignity of the country can never get rid of the striking range of various high-precision firepower strike means whoever and wherever they are and whether they are individual or group targets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Great irony is the U.S. ridiculous response to the test-fire and launch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has become vocal in calling the recent launch problematic and a \"threatening act of escalating tension in the region\", while saying it is the U.S. \"basic principle\" and \"basic stand\" to \"oppose any missile launch by north Korea\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It even urged the DPRK to \"immediately refrain from provocative act\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is understandable that south Korea is crying in distress that the DPRK's tactical guided missiles become \"serious threats\" as they can turn to ashes at a stroke even the Kyeryongdae in South Chungchong Province which houses the headquarters of the puppet three services. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is because they always suffer from uneasiness and horror, feeling guilty conscience for the crimes they committed against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Problem is that the U.S. which is accustomed to branding all the just measures taken by the DPRK for self-defence as \"provocations\" and \"threats\" has become louder in criticizing the tactical guided missile launch as the launch of long-range rockets targeting the U.S. mainland.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A saying goes criminals often mistake a power pole for a scaffold.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the tactical guided missile test-fire and drill become \"provocations\" and \"threats\", how can a huge number of missile launches conducted by the U.S. be justified.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was only recently that the U.S. carried out a ballistic missile launch exercise to intercept guided missiles of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Does the U.S. have the right to dare find fault with the tactical guided missile test-fire and drill of the DPRK, an act pertaining to the sovereign right of the country?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The point is why the U.S. brands the test-fire and drill as \"threatening acts\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is aimed to prevent the DPRK from bolstering the deterrence for self-defence, employ every possible means and method to isolate it and create an opportunity for \"overthrowing its social system\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We are clearly aware of the fact that the U.S. is a chief criminal posing the constant danger of a war to the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has been engrossed in nuclear threat and blackmail against the DPRK by frequently bringing the formation of B-52 nuclear strategic bombers and super-large nuclear-powered carrier task force from the U.S. mainland, Guam and the Pacific region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is also the U.S. which backed south Korea's efforts to extend the missile range to over 800 km to pit it against the DPRK to the last.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a height of effrontery for such a country to take issue with the DPRK under such absurd charges of \"escalating tension\" and \"making a threatening and provocative act\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even a wall has an ear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. exposed once again its ugly nature as a gangster by itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the military measures taken by the DPRK on this land are the righteous exercise of its sovereignty that was caused by the U.S. aggression and war moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will put the greatest spurs to bolstering the deterrence for self-defense thousand-fold, bearing in mind the teachings given by the respected supreme commander that the peaceful environment dearest to the Korean people can neither be provided by someone nor be bartered for anything and that durable peace can be protected only when one is so strong that nobody dares provoke one and it can be guaranteed by one's own strength.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how desperately the U.S. may find fault with the DPRK, it will continue to hold drills of launching high-precision tactical guided missiles, targeting the citadel of the gangsters who go mischievous.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What remains to be done by the U.S. is to just keep watching the signal measures to be taken by the DPRK to bolster its capability for self-defence which will demonstrate their might to strike the world with admiration."

\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn una palabra, es para frenar el fortalecimiento del disuasivo de autodefensa de la RPDC y aislarla a toda costa y preparar la oportunidad para el \"derrocamiento del regimen norcoreano\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tConocemos demasiado bien que EE.UU. es el autor que lleva la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana al constante estado de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl imperio comete la amenaza y chantaje nucleares anti-RPDC trasladando a menudo de su territorio principal, la isla Guam y la region de Asia-Pacifico las escuadrillas de bombarderos estrategicos nucleares B-52 y el colectivo de portaaviones nucleares. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara que el Sur de Corea se enfrente hasta el fin con la RPDC, le permitio aumentar a mas de 800 km el alcance de tiro de misil. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTal imperio acusa a la RPDC de \"agravador de la tension\" y \"provocador amenazante\", lo cual es una ilogica y el climax de cinismo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe esta manera, EE.UU. demostro otra vez sus entranas malignas y aspecto asqueroso como gangster. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodas las medidas militares que tomamos en nuestro propio territorio son el legitimo ejercicio del derecho a la autodefensa, frente a las maniobras de agresion y de guerra de EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestro ejercito y pueblo consolidaran por todos los medios el disuasivo de autodefensa teniendo presente las instrucciones del Comandante Supremo quien dijo que el precioso ambiente pacifico no se ofrece por nadie ni puede ser mercancia de negocio sino se defiende y se garantiza por sus propias fuerzas fuertes para que nadie se atreva a atacarla. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor mas que EE.UU. recurra a las calumnias de toda indole, nuestros proyectiles teledirigidos tacticos de alta precision seguiran volando hacia el baluarte de la horda de gangsteres. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo que debe hacer EE.UU. es ver sin decir nada nuestras extraordinarias medidas de autodefensa que admiraran a todo el mundo."
