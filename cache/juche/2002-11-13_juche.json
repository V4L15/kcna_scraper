Kumgang, a famous mountain of the nation, was a great event which proved that if the Korean youth and students unite irrespective of political views and religious beliefs, they can achieve anything as it was a brilliant fruition of the movement for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They noted that the initiative made by representatives of youth and students organizations across South Korea to inaugurate the solidarity body was aimed to promote solidarity and unity among various youth and students organizations and thus effect independent exchange among youth and students in the south and the north and overseas.    \r\n"

This is well known to the world. \r\n There is no reason for the U.S. to fail to conclude a non-aggression treaty nor is there any need for it to insist that a dialogue is possible only after the DPRK scraps its \"nuclear weapons program\" if the U.S. has no intention to invade the DPRK and its strong defence capacity causes the U.S. to worry about its security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to conclude the non-aggression treaty with the DPRK as unanimously demanded by the world peace-loving people, well aware that it can never bring the Korean people to their knees as they hold their sovereignty dearer than their lives.    \r\n\r\n"

Nothing is more important than defending the dignity of the nation and realizing its independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Based on the military power are the independent spirit of not yielding to any pressure and threat of the imperialists and the decision positively to hew out the road of revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since the imperialists are resorting to the military-almighty policy, independence cannot be defended without a strong military power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a splendid result of the army-centred policy that the DPRK triumphantly concluded the \"arduous march\" and defended socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army-based policy also reliably guarantees politics for the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The independent and creative life of the popular masses in socialist society is provided by such politics for the people as democratic politics and benevolent politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such politics provides the popular masses with genuine political rights and freedom and with a worthwhile life and happiness. It is just the army-centred policy that definitely guarantees such politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Without arms, the dignity and rights of the people and their happiness and wellbeing are unthinkable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Giving importance to the military affairs in socialist society is the most reasonable step to defend the destiny of the people and guarantee their happy life. So, the army-centred policy is the most powerful mode of politics for the WPK and the socialist government that serve the people and work to provide the people with an independent and creative life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK's army-based policy has its truthfulness, validity and invincibility proved in the socialist revolution and construction. \r\n\r\n"

The meeting expressed full support to the proposal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was particularly stressed at the meeting that the ever-victorious army-based policy pursued by Kim Jong Il, leader of the nation and the sun of the 21st century, the most powerful policy to frustrate the U.S. attempt to stifle the DPRK, is a patriotic policy that defends the sovereignty, security and interests of the whole nation including not only the north but also the south and guarantees national reunification and prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The meeting had a detailed discussion on action programs and immediate tasks facing the NDFSK organizations at all levels to arouse the South Koreans in the struggle to support the proposal of the north for concluding a non-aggression treaty between the DPRK and the U.S. and defend the army-based policy in the north.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
