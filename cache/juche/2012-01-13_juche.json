Y un gran numero de surcoreanos, que se sustentaban de la cooperacion N-S, se vieron en la encrucijada de vida o muerte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas impidieron tambien la celebracion de los actos nacionales conjuntos que habian sido programados con motivo de los dias de publicacion de las historicas declaraciones intercoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo permitieron al Consejo por la Solucion del Problema de las Tropas de Voluntarios sostener comunicacion con la parte nortena para discutir el texto de la declaracion conjunta de las entidades de mujeres del Norte y el Sur de Corea a publicar con motivo del dia conmemorativo del Levantamiento Popular del Primero de Marzo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesautorizaron tambien el viaje a Kaesong de los miembros de la comision funeraria de Pak Yong Gil, viuda del pastor surcoreano Mun Ik Hwan, para recibir la nota de condolencias de la parte Norte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda de Lee recurrio con mas frenesi a la campana de confrontacion fratricida y al complot anti-RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSolo en el ano pasado, Lee visito varias veces a EE.UU. en busca de apoyo a su politica de enfrentamiento fratricida y chismeo abiertamente que \"no cambiara su politica sobre el Norte aunque sea criticada dentro y fuera del pais\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos titeres surcoreanos mantuvieron tras las rejas por mas de un ano al pastor Han Sang Ryol quien fue condenado luego a duras penas en virtud de la infame \"ley de seguridad\" por el solo hecho de haber visitado a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tReprimieron la Solidaridad de los Jovenes y Estudiantes para la Ejecucion de la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio y otras entidades calificandolas de \"pro-enemigas\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ano pasado, desconectaron mas de 90 sitios web tildandolos de \"pro-Norte\" y eliminaron mas de 80 y tantos mil articulos online, ademas de arrestar y encarcelar a sus autores y divulgadores. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInventaron sucesivamente los casos intrigantes como el de la red de espias y el del grupo de sicarios, aumentando cada vez mas el clima de enfrentamiento. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa campana conflictiva anti-RPDC de la banda del traidor Lee llego al climax en el periodo de duelo nacional a finales del ano pasado. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTan pronto como fue publicada la informacion sobre el duelo nacional, convoco la \"reunion de seguridad nacional\" y el \"consejo de ministros\" y ordeno a Chongwadae (Casa Azul), el ejecutivo, el ejercito titere y la policia el \"estado de alerta\" y el \"estado de servicio emergente\" para que apuntaran los fusiles en los enlutados connacionales del Norte. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPretendio al mismo tiempo destruir la unidad monolitica de la RPDC hablando de la \"reaccion diferenciada a la direccion y a los habitantes del Norte\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades y la chusma del \"Gran Partido Nacional\" del Sur de Corea insultaron siniestramente la manera de expresar condolencias de los habitantes norcoreanos e impidieron la visita de condolencias de los partidos opositores y las entidades de distintos sectores. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tReprimieron brutalmente a los jovenes, estudiantes y entidades civiles surcoreanos que quisieron expresar condolencias en los altares de incensacion acondicionados por ellos mismos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el dia de despedida del Dirigente Kim Jong Il, cometieron la imperdonable provocacion de enviar mas de 30 entidades conservadoras y derechistas a la linea de demarcacion militar para que lanzaran los volantes de contenido anti-RPDC que manchaban la maxima dignidad de la RPDC y agitaban la insurreccion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda de traidores surcoreanos recrudecio el ano pasado sus acciones belicas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAmenazaron seriamente la paz y la estabilidad de la Peninsula Coreana y la region al crear la crisis de conflicto armado Norte-Sur. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCometio incesantemente las provocaciones de una magnitud sin precedentes insultando atrevidamente la maxima dignidad de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe verdad, la camarilla del traidor Lee Myung Bak es la horda de peores maniacos de enfrentamiento y guerra que sera condenada implacablemente."
