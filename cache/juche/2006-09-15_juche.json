            "content": "Japan Accused of Refusing to Permit Entry of DPRK Synchronized Swimming Team into Japan \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 14 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Swimming Association of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on Sept. 13 assailing the Japanese reactionary authorities and the Ministry of Justice for refusing to permit the entry of the DPRK's synchronized swimming team into Japan to participate in the 11th FINA Synchronized Swimming World Cup 2006. \r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world cup is slated to open in Yokohama of Kanagawa Prefecture in Japan on Sept. 14 under the sponsorship of the FINA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the above-said association received from the Japan organizing committee a note to the effect that some members of the team were not allowed to enter Japan just a few days before their expected departure for Japan. This compelled the association to cancel its plan to send the DPRK team to the event. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for those for whom the Ministry of Justice refused to issue visas, they are officers in charge of technique, administration and foreign relations already recognized not only by many world experts on synchronized swimming but the FINA for their participation in international competitions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Moreover, among them is a referee registered by the FINA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is, therefore, no justifiable ground to refuse to permit their entry into Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then, what is the true intention of the Japanese side behind its refusal to issue visas for them? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The organizing committee, in the course of making arrangements for the event, was instructed by the ministry not to allow the DPRK national flag to be displayed under any circumstances while the competition was under way, in case the DPRK's team participates in the world cup. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Acting upon this instruction, the committee absurdly proposed that national flags of the participating countries would not be hoisted inside the swimming pool and flags of their national associations would be used during their teams' entry into the venue of the opening ceremony. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This was something unprecedented in view of international sporting practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The association formally informed the FINA of the fact that the above-said committee was behaving quite contrary to international sporting practice while making arrangements for the event, prompted by a sinister political purpose. The committee was compelled to properly deal with abnormal issues at the request of the FINA and in face of protest made by officials of the Korean Amateur Athletic Federation in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the participation of the DPRK's team in the event became obvious and the demand for the display of the national flag of the DPRK during the whole period of the competition became undeniable, the Japanese authorities and the ministry made last-ditch efforts to prevent the team from participating in the event under the pretext of \"turning down applications for visas.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This case exposed before the whole world that the Japanese authorities are political dwarfs and dregs in international sports circles that resort to any despicable and clumsy method for achieving their dirty political aims and stoop to anything violating transparent sports spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK Swimming Association on behalf of all Korean sports fans vehemently denounces the Japanese authorities and the ministry for stretching their dirty political tentacles to the pure sports event in contravention of the sacred Olympic charter and idea in a bid to prevent the DPRK's team from participating in the international sports event slated to take place in Japan.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It plans to begin deploying PAC-3 in its air force base in Kadena of Okinawa this month as the second-phase step and make it partly operational by the end of this year.\r\n  Rodong Sinmun Thursday in a signed commentary carried in this regard observes: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' reckless arms buildup and their moves to undertake military provocations against the DPRK are very dangerous as they push the situation on the Korean Peninsula to the point of explosion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the strategic goal of the U.S. to invade the DPRK and lay a military siege to China and Russia and, moreover, establish domination over Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now the U.S. imperialists consider it as a key and most important task for implementing their aggressive Asia-Pacific strategy to put the DPRK under their military control. To this end they seek to use Japan as a shock brigade for waging the second Korean war. In a word they are contemplating using Japan as their advance and logistic bases and a combined war commanding post to carry out their scenario for invading the DPRK. The U.S. bellicose forces' additional deployment of the Aegis in Japan is part of their moves to round off the preparations for a new Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After designating the DPRK as part of an \"axis of evil\" and a target of their nuclear attack the war-like Bush forces are working hard to put their scenario for a war of aggression against the DPRK into practice under the signboard of \"ensuring security\" and \"defending\" their allies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarists overheated with their wild ambition to stage a comeback to Korea are zealously cooperating with the U.S. in its moves to ignite a new Korean war. In case a war breaks out on the Korean Peninsula, Japan is bound to automatically involve itself in the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is rushing headlong into a war, pursuant to its reckless hostile policy toward the DPRK. This is an unpardonable crime as it is aimed at starting a dangerous war to put the whole of Asia under its control.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Kim Jong Il's Field Guidance to Mt. Kumgang Resort\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 14 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il provided field guidance to Mt. Kumgang resort on his way of inspection of the front.\r\n Mt. Kumgang covers a vast area of 530 square kilometers extending 60 km from south to north and 40 km from east to west including Kosong, Kumgang and Thongchon counties of Kangwon Province. It is known as a famous mountain of Korea and a world-famous mountain from old times as it presents a myriad of diverse, majestic and spectacular scenery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is called a mountain of superb scenic beauty as everything there presents fantastic scenery. It is superb not only in the beauty of its peaks and ravines but in the scenery of the sea and its shore, lakes, kaleidoscopic changes seen around the peaks due to winds and clouds, thick forests rich in rare animals and plants and falls presenting ever-changing scenery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He climbed the Piro Peak, the main peak of the mountain, and commanded a bird's-eye view of the mountain presenting kaleidoscopic scenery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said that Mt. Kumgang, which had long been a resort for the exploiting class only, turned into a splendid recreation ground for the people in the era of the Workers' Party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our country has many scenic spots wherever its people go, the objects of foreigners' envy, as its mountains are beautiful and its water is clear, he said, adding that our people are highly proud of fully enjoying a worthy life in the beautiful socialist country with brilliant culture and long history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that one can display patriotism only when one knows well about the history, culture and scenic beauty of the country, he underscored the need to intensify the education through scenic spots. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He specified tasks to be undertaken to permanently preserve the superb scenery of Mt. Kumgang and ways to do so, underlining the need to spruce up the beauty spots in a peculiar manner and prevent the damage by natural phenomena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by Korean People's Army Generals Ri Myong Su, Hyon Chol Hae and Pak Jae Gyong.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
