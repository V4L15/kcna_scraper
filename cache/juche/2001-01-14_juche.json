Only then can the whole nation pool their strength and wisdom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north and the south should establish a reunified state by federal formula reflecting the will and demand of all compatriots on the basis of recognizing and tolerating the existing two systems and on the principle of shelving differences and widely accepting the demand and common denominators of the nation, without allowing each other's interests to be infringed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The thorough implementation of the declaration would guarantee the independent reunification of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will make all efforts to implement the declaration to the letter to accelerate the reunification of the country. \r\n\r\n"
