This method is high in cost and low in productivity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By the new method, it is possible to directly alloy Ti with the arc heat of electric furnace and the heat produced in the reaction between a by-product of aluminum production and the carbon, silicon and calcium contained in the burden materials.\r\n Ti cast-iron ball made by the new method contains more than 2.5 percent of C, 0.2-0.4 percent of Ti and less than 0.04 percent of phosphorus and sulfur. And its hardness is HRC55. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its serviceable life is 2-2.5 times longer and its consumption is lower than other kinds. And it saves heavy oil, electricity and manpower and shortens production hours compared with rolled ball. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Ti cast-iron ball has already been used in coal-pulverizing in thermal power plants and the concentrated ore production in mines.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It can neither exist nor meet its interests without aggression and war.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ever since imperialism raised its ugly head in the world, it has been engrossed in aggression and war. In the new century, too, the means for the existence of the imperialist forces remains unchanged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Aggression and war are inevitably required by the politico-economic structure of modern imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Munitions monopolies dominate the economy in the imperialist countries and their rise or fall entirely hinges on those monopolies. The military spending in the imperialist countries is on the steady increase and the militarization of their economy is aggravating the crisis of imperialism. The overall economy remains in the doldrums, increasing the joblessness and weakening its competitive power. Imperialism seeks a way out of this daily worsening crisis in pursuing aggression and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A series of wars provoked by imperialism in different parts of the world after the end of the Cold War were chiefly aimed at settling this economic crisis by saving the munitions monopolies and helping them increase their profits. As a matter of fact such purposes have been achieved through the imperialists' aggression and war. \r\n The imperialists have taken pleasure in attaining their politico-economic goal and realizing their wild ambition for domination through aggression and war against other countries and nations. That is why the imperialists are desperately clinging to the policy of aggression and war and becoming more cunning and vicious in their methods. \r\n The reality requires all the countries and nations aspiring after independence and peace to properly see through the criminal true colors of the imperialist forces who regard aggression and war as means of their existence and main job and dynamically turn out in the struggle against their moves for aggression and war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
