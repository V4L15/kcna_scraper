            "content": "Japan Must Be Punished for Its Human Rights Abuses \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 2 (KCNA) -- All the international human rights organizations should show due interests in the human rights abuses committed by Japan in the past and make all efforts for an early solution to the issue, says Minju Joson today in a signed commentary.\r\n Recalling again that the Japanese imperialists drafted at least 8.4 million Koreans to force them to tragic death and slave labor, made 200,000 women sex slavery for the Japanese Imperial Army and massacred over one million Koreans during their military occupation of Korea for 40 odd years, the commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This shows that nearly a half of the Koreans fell victims to the hideous human rights abuses by the Japanese imperialists, measured against the then size of the Korean population. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was impossible for Japan to cause losses to so many Koreans without an organizational measure based on a state policy. This proves that the brutal human rights violation against the Korean people by the Japanese imperialists was a deliberately organized state-governed crime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The problem is that Japan is strutting about like a conquering hero scot-free today after committing such monstrous human rights abuses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Germany and other countries, which inflicted losses to humankind under different historical conditions in the past, are now paying a great attention to compensation and properly resolving the issue. Only Japan, however, is evading its legal and moral responsibility as the assailant and wantonly violating the principles of compensation based on provisions of international conventions and usages. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis illegal and immoral act of Japan has become a main cause of encouragement to the continued practices of human right abuses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The realities show that for Japan to redress its past crimes of human rights abuses is not merely to comply with the demand for compensation to the victims but the preceding process of guaranteeing justice and putting an end to human rights abuses on the global scale.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
