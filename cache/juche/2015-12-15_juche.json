            "content": "S. Korean Authorities Slammed for Pushing Authorities' Talks to Rupture\r\nPyongyang, December 15 (KCNA) -- The chief delegate of the south side to the first round of the north-south authorities' talks at a press conference in the Kaesong Industrial Park right after the rupture of the talks on Dec. 12 said the south approached the negotiations with sincerity after advancing various proposals but the north side created difficulties in the way of the talks by calling for the simultaneous solution of the resumption of tour of Mt. Kumgang and the issue of \"separated families\".\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities even let conservative media float story that the \"north was only concerned for the resumption of the tour of Mt. Kumgang, money box\", malignantly slandering the north and giving impression that it was to blame for the rupture of the talks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea in a statement on Tuesday branded this as an intolerable and serious provocation against the dialogue partner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The talks that were provided with much effort amid expectation and concern of all the Koreans ended without any fruit. This was an inevitable result of the confrontation policy of the south Korean authorities who are interested in neither genuine dialogue nor the improvement of the relations, the statement said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In fact, we were of the view that things can hardly be settled even though we sit face to face with the south Korean authorities who are keen on the moves for escalating confrontation in total breach of the August agreement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the south side earnestly called for the authorities' talks, saying any issue can be discussed once they are opened. Our idea was to trust them and sit with them first and then solve issues that are deemed urgent and easy in the bilateral relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t So, we, stressing the need to create the atmosphere of dialogue for improving the bilateral relations, proposed resuming the tour of Mt. Kumgang and settling the issue of separated families and relatives, urgent issues about which all the Koreans are concerned, and reactivating exchanges in various fields.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the south side raised lots of unimportant issues which are not helpful to the improvement of the north-south relations in wanton violation of the agreement made at the technical contact for the authorities' talks on seeking negotiated settlement of pending issues between the north and the south, thus deliberately creating difficulties and obstacles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK side proposed simultaneously pushing forward and implementing the issues of the resumption of tour and the separated families and relatives as the south side shunned the discussion of the resumption issue but the south side flatly turned down discussion of the tour issue, saying that \"it is principle not to link the issue\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We even allowed the extension of the talks, persuading the south side and showing magnanimity, but the south side insisted that it can never agree on resuming the tour, thus pushing the talks into a rupture.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What's more, the south Korean authorities now talk loudly in public that it proposed the issue of \"three channels\". It had better look back  on whether it has face to talk about \"channel\" as it blocked all the wide avenues that were created in the June 15 era and now goes mischievous not to open even such small channel as tour.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The talks clearly proved that as long as the south Korean authorities persist in dependence on outsiders and moves for confrontation with fellow countrymen, the north-south relations can never make even a step forward and that even though dialogue is held, nothing will be settled."

Pero, puesto que la parte Sur solicito reiteradamente que podria consultar todos los problemas en las conversaciones de autoridades, decidimos resolver primero los problemas urgentes y faciles en las relaciones intercoreanas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn este contexto, dando enfasis en crear el ambiente de dialogo favorable a la mejora de las relaciones bilaterales, propusimos resolver el problema de reanudacion del turismo al monte Kumgang y el de familiares y parientes separados, temas mas apremiantes que atraen la atencion de todos los coreanos, y activar tambien el intercambio en varios dominios. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, la parte Sur infringio brutalmente el acuerdo logrado en el contacto de trabajo para las conversaciones de autoridades, ocasion en la cual ambas partes decidieron discutir y resolver los inmediatos problemas pendientes. Y pusieron obstaculos artificiales presentando los problemas inutiles a la mejora de las relaciones intercoreanas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDado que la parte Sur evita la discusion sobre la reanudacion del turismo al monte Kumgang, propusimos promover y ejecutar simultaneamente el reinicio del turismo y el encuentro de familiares y parientes separados. Entonces, la parte Sur nego discutir el primer tema \"manteniendo el principio de no vincularlos\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPersuadimos con magnanimidad a la parte Sur dilatando hasta el plazo de la cita. Sin embargo, la parte Sur llevo a la ruptura las conversaciones negando la reanudacion del turismo al monte Kumgang. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora las autoridades surcoreanas, que impidieron todas las rutas preparadas en la era de reunificacion del 15 de junio y hasta el turismo al monte Kumgang, dicen que en la presente cita propusieron las \"tres vias\". Pues, ellas deben reflexionar por si solas si tienen la cara de hablar de la \"via\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas presentes conversaciones demostraron claramente que las relaciones intercoreanas no se pueden lograr ni un avance mientras las autoridades surcoreanas recurran a la dependencia de las fuerzas extranjeras y a la confrontacion fratricida y que no se resolvera nada aunque se realice el dialogo."
