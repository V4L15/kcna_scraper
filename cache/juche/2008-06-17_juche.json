These crimes are recorded in history and widely known to the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is that Japan has refused to honestly admit and repent of the hideous crimes committed by it against humanity during the illegal military occupation of Korea in the past and persistently evaded the responsibility for them though the old century is replaced by a new one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is negating and embellishing its history of aggression and evading the responsibility to redress its past, not freed from the militaristic outlook on history. This is as foolish an act as pricking its own eyes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  For Japan to honestly settle its criminal past is to win the trust of the world people and become a member of the international community with clean conscience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan had better discard its wrong way of thinking and stance and make a political decision to redeem its past, though belatedly.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
