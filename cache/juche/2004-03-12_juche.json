            "content": "KCNA on U.S. Foolish Way of Thinking \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 11 (KCNA) -- A rumor is afloat on the international arena that the DPRK is driving the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. to a quagmire in the hope that if Bush is voted down, it would be possible to settle the nuclear issue more favorably.\r\n The Washington Times on March 6 in an article titled \"North Korea hopes Bush to resign\" said that north Korea is hoping President Bush from the Republican Party to fail in the U.S. presidential election slated for November and step down. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We do not care where such opinion came from. But we cannot but clarify that this is nothing but sheer misinformation as it is an expression of utter ignorance of the independent nature of the DPRK's diplomacy. It is clear that this misinformation is aimed to serve the purpose of speaking for the present U.S. administration which finds itself in a difficult position after being bitterly censured at home and abroad for driving the DPRK-U.S. relations to the lowest ebb and coming out to the second round of the six-way talks without any proposal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As well known to everyone, the second round of the six-way talks could not produce any positive results owing to the unreasonable attitude of the U.S. toward dialogue. It proved fruitless not because of \"expectation\" of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the talks we showed the greatest magnanimity, clarifying our will to scrap its nuclear program according to the proposal for a simultaneous package solution aimed to denuclearize the Korean peninsula and advancing a fair and flexible proposal for implementing the first-phase actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. did not show even an iota of its will to withdraw its hostile policy toward the DPRK and coexist with it in peace, obstinately insisting on the DPRK's completely scrapping its nuclear program in a verifiable and irreversible manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent talks were put in a stalemate by such unreasonable attitude of the U.S. as it unilaterally insisted on the DPRK's dropping its nuclear program first. The deadlock was not attributable to the \"delaying tactics\" allegedly employed by DPRK in anticipation of \"Bush's resignation\" as claimed by the media. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such being a hard fact, some media talk about the DPRK's hope for \"Bush's defeat\" in the election, skeptical about the fair attitude of the DPRK toward dialogue. This can not be interpreted otherwise than an expression of ignorance of the DPRK's independent foreign policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK does not care at all whether a candidate from the Democratic Party is elected or a candidate from the Republican Party is elected in the United States because it is a matter to be decided by the U.S. voters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a foolish way of thinking to guess that the DPRK seems to be inconsistent in implementing its foreign policy in anticipation of the outcome of the U.S. presidential election. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a basic principle governing the activities of the DPRK government to firmly maintain independence in its external relations, act according to its faith and independently settle all the problems raised. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's diplomacy is not aimed to please anyone but fair and aboveboard one that to meet its state interests. It is the diplomacy based on the principle of independence, unlike the diplomacy of those countries reading other's face devoid of independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's stand is, therefore, consistent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whoever elected U.S. president should be willing to make a switchover in its policy toward the DPRK, drop the hostile policy toward it and express readiness to coexist with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a main point. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. makes a switchover in its policy toward the DPRK, though belatedly, progress will be made in the settlement of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S.    \r\n\r\n"

The history of this traitorous party is recorded with its evil acts against the nation, reunification and people, the statement noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP's pro-U.S. traitorous acts have reached their height since traitor Choe Pyong Ryol became its representative. After taking this office, he let loose a string of reckless remarks slandering the people's righteous anti-U.S. struggle for independence against colonial enslavement as a \"perfidy to the U.S.\" and \"a rash act to bedevil the south Korea-U.S. ties\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the U.S. raised a brigandish demand for the use of land as regards the transfer of its military base, the Choe Pyong Ryol group took the lead in pressurizing the \"government\" to accept the U.S. forces' request. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  No sooner had the U.S. started putting pressure on south Korea to dispatch its troops to Iraq than he visited his master before anyone else and promised to take the lead in making the troop dispatch successful   The GNP, pro-U.S. acts and confrontation with the north being means of its existence, has worked hard to bring the June 15 era of reunification back to the bygone era of confrontation, pursuant to the U.S. policy for Korea's permanent division. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP was opposed to the historic Pyongyang meeting. It has, therefore, desperately worked to hold in check the seventy million Koreans' dynamic grand march for independence and reunification to implement the June 15 joint declaration. The GNP cooked up \"the law on special inspection of remittance to the north\" not only throwing behind bars those pro-reunification patriots who contributed to the south-north reconciliation and cooperation but driving them to tragic death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was none other than the GNP that forced the authorities to brand the north as the \"principal enemy\" and \"the target of liquidation\" and register them in the \"white paper on national defence.\" It vociferously cried that it would not rule out even a war, zealously supporting the U.S. arms build-up and war exercises to invade the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP is a kingpin of mafia as it has met its own selfish interests by squeezing \"election funds\" amounting to hundreds of billions of won by the most base and despicable methods and a headquarters of corrupt political forces that resorted to arbitrary and high-handed practices, made a mockery of the people and threw the political situation into confusion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It is the GNP that has administered the money-manipulated politics, bought the post of \"National Assemblyman\" and won its supporters by use of money. This group of thieves called \"rich grand party\" extracted money running into astronomical figures from 100 businesses by fraud and swindle, threat and blackmail and a conspiratorial plot reminiscent of a detective film during the last election, the money collected from the people as taxes. It has put the \"National Assembly\" in a state of indefinite malfunction, shelving the problem of people's living and 1,200 other pending issues. The sharks of the GNP, taking advantage of their dominance in the NA, have turned it into a \"crime-ridden assembly,\" \"vegetable assembly,\" \"bullet-proof assembly\" and \"assembly for war\" in utter disregard of the people's living, their mindset and the country's economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is impossible to get rid of the people's misfortune and stop the cycle of evils of political and economic catastrophe and bring about a bright prospect of national reconciliation, unity and reunification as long as the GNP is still at large. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Now is the time to totally eliminate the GNP from the political arena and put an end to its base existence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement called upon the people from all walks of life to cut off the windpipe of the GNP and reduce it to ashes, holding aloft \"Let's bury the GNP, a south Korean branch of the U.S. Republican Party and a henchman of Bush!,\" \"Let's blow up the GNP, a modern brand Nazi party!\" and other slogans.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They have conquered the seas, calling the sea east of the peninsula the Korean Sea or East Sea.\r\n The term \"East Sea\" was mentioned in several hundred times in such old documents of Korea as The Chronicles of the Three States, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe Heritage of the Three States, The History of Koryo Dynasty and The True Records of the Ri Dynasty. It was written as East Sea in the maps--General Map of Eight Provinces (1463), The Northwest Genealogy and The General Map of Our Country (1700) and The Grand World Map (in the latter half of 18th century). All these prove that the sea has been called Korean Sea and East Sea from centuries ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, the recently discovered maps compiled in 18th century and later name the sea east of Korea Korean Sea, which had been widely used by Russia, Britain, France, the United States and other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The sea between the Korean peninsula and Japanese Islands are written even in the maps and books printed in Japan such as The Whole Map of Asia (1794), The Sketch Map of Japanese Coastal Seas (1809), the New World Map (1810), A Picture of Four Guardians of Great Japan and others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nonetheless, Japan asserts that it has inscribed the sea east of Korea as the \"Japanese Sea\" historically. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The distorted assertion of Japan is a new intolerable crime plus its past crimes. It only gives rise to great indignation of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Jong Chang Gyu, director of the History Institute under the Academy of Social Sciences, said in an interview with KCNA that the Japanese reactionaries heated with wild ambition for overseas aggression persist in asserting that the East Sea of Korea is \"Japanese sea\", far from repenting and compensating for its crimes committed against the Korean nation in the past. The historically fixed names of geographical objects cannot be distorted or changed according someone's wild insistence or demand.   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is, therefore, an outright challenge to the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No one can vouch that these disturbing military developments will not spark off a new West Sea skirmish as the south Korean authorities dared call for defending the \"northern limit line.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year alone south Korean navy warships intruded into the territorial waters of the north side in the West Sea of Korea more than 40 times. Fortunately, no unpleasant incident occurred there entirely thanks to a high degree of self-restraint and patience on the part of the KPA servicemen who do not want the escalated tensions between the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But there is a limit to their self-restraint and patience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should stop their rash acts, pondering over what countermeasures will be taken by the north side when they recklessly dispatch warships and helicopters to the controversial waters, a hotbed of fresh military clashes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
