The U.S., the backstage wirepuller of the \"impeachment against the president\" and, at the same time, the mastermind of the plot to foil the \"election,\" is resorting to vicious moves including the escalation of the military tension on the Korean peninsula to deliver the ultra-right conservative forces out of the tight corner by taking advantage of the current political confusion in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people should see through the criminal scheme of the despicable traitors indulged in anti-reunification confrontation and corruption with the backing of the U.S., check and frustrate it at the right moment and sternly judge the traitorous group in the course of the forthcoming \"election.\"    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Assails U.S. \"Defense Strategy\" \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 6 (KCNA) -- The Bush administration is persistently resorting to grave military adventure threatening humankind.\r\n The U.S. Defense Department worked out the \"1-4-2-1 defense strategy\", according to a recent issue of the Los Angeles Times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was revised and supplemented last year on the basis of the reexamination of the defense strategy dating back to the era of the Cold War and the period of the Clinton administration. Its keynote is to spark disputes in any place anytime and bring down the systems of the countries it aims to seize, according to its option. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This new defense strategy being the core of the U.S. strategy for world supremacy is arousing deep concern of the world public for its unprecedentedly adventurous and aggressive nature and aim and ways to carry it out as it is a strategy for preemptive nuclear attacks on different countries at the same time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The danger of this defense strategy lies in that it calls for conducting special and secret operations and using nukes as basic war methods according to the theory of preemptive strike and turning the U.S. military forces into active offensive forces, not reaction forces, as they have already been beefed up to the fullest extent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The strategy is aimed to expand the simultaneous operation capacity in the two regions during the Clinton administration to the one in the four regions. It calls for creating a smaller strike group equipped with powerful precision strike and latest information means, deploying it in an overseas base and organically combining the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency with irregular military forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already known, the Afghan and Iraqi wars are no more than a prelude to realizing the U.S. military strategy for world supremacy after the demise of the Cold War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After occupying Afghanistan and Iraq through the brigandish wars of aggression, the U.S. is set to carry into practice its strategy for world supremacy by putting the Middle East and Northeast Asia under its full control and, furthermore, containing big powers around the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is by no means accidental that foreign media termed the new defense strategy a \"very dangerous defense operation\" as it involves preemptive strike, preemptive nuclear attack operation going beyond diplomacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK and China are the major targets of the new defense strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the U.S. defense strategy the DPRK and China are made major targets of strategic operation and a plan has already been worked out to strike the DPRK and China with nuclear and conventional weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. revised the \"Iraq + North Korea operation plan\" it had already worked out as the \"Iran + North Korea operation plan.\" It is escalating the nuclear confrontation with the DPRK behind the scene of dialogue. It is working with bloodshot eyes to put into practice the strategy for preemptive nuclear attack to stifle the DPRK by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no doubt that the U.S. naval missile interceptor system to be deployed in the East Sea of Korea and other reckless military moves including joint military exercises under different codenames are quite contrary to its talk about the \"negotiated settlement of the nuclear issue\" and the U.S. design to stifle the DPRK remains unchanged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality clearly shows what a reckless and dangerous phase the U.S. moves for a war of aggression against the DPRK have reached. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will take a decisive self-defensive countermeasure to avert a war and defend peace in the Korean peninsula and in the rest of Northeast Asia.    \r\n\r\n"

The work defines it as the general goal of the great unity of the whole nation to found a unified state, independent, peace-loving and neutral, and considers patriotism and the spirit of national independence as the ideological basis of unity. The work indicates specific ways for achieving the great unity of the nation such as the principle of attaining it by promoting co-existence, co-prosperity and common interests and subordinating everything to the cause of national reunification and issues of putting an end to all political disputes and building confidence and achieving unity between the north and the south, letting all Koreans join hands with each other for reunification irrespective of differing isms, developing contact, visits and dialogue, strengthening the solidarity among them and highly honoring those who have contributed to the cause of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The 10-point programme serves as the most just programme of the great unity of the whole nation acceptable to everybody desirous of reunification for the patriotic will, the  idea of great unity and the fair and aboveboard nature and actual possibility reflected\r\nin it, says Rodong Sinmun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans in the north and the south and overseas should wage a more vigorous struggle for the unity of the nation, peace of the country and national reunification under the banner of the Korean nation-first spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The cooperation the Korean nation should realize is cooperation among Koreans against foreign forces as it is aimed at achieving harmony and unity among them to reject aggressive foreign forces and promote the cause of independent reunification in the basic spirit of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. All Koreans should make redoubled efforts to put an end to the treacherous cooperation with the U.S. in south Korea and realize harmony and national cooperation for reunification under the banner of the Korean nation-first spirit in order to give spurs to the development of the national history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson calls on all Koreans to strengthen the national cooperation under the banner of the Korean nation-first spirit and thus build the structure of the Korean nation's confrontation with the U.S. through practical actions.    \r\n\r\n"

Minju Joson today says this in a signed commentary.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the DPRK's missiles are concerned, they are not for threatening or attacking others but for protecting the national sovereignty and dignity from enemy invasion and serves as a deterrent force for frustrating the reckless moves of aggressors to provoke a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has never posed any missile threat to anybody. It has never threatened the United States with missiles nor browbeaten south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The target of the DPRK's deterrence with missiles is only those foreign forces which infringe upon its national sovereignty and dignity. It is an inviolable legitimate right of a sovereign state to have missiles for national defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not the DPRK but the United States that is creating a missile threat and increasing the danger of war on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States should stop fooling the public at home and abroad with the fiction of \"nuclear threat from north Korea\" whose hypocritical and deceptive nature has already brought to light but withdraw from south Korea with its armed forces, the main source of aggression and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The People's Army and people of the DPRK will further increase the defence capability for self-defence in view of all sorts of reckless moves of the U.S. to start a new war in Korea.

Japan, however, is escalating its hostile policy towards it, faulting even this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is clearly proved by the fact that Japan is set to pass the \"bill on banning the portcall of specified ships\" through the Diet in the wake of its passage of the \"amendment to the law on foreign exchange,\" a bill on economic sanctions against the DPRK, in a bid to isolate and suffocate the DPRK economically. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Through this, Japan seeks to completely blockade the DPRK, form an international siege to it and realize military cooperation with the U.S. aimed at stifling the DPRK in a bid to settle the issue of the bilateral relations by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n��Yet, Japan is pulling up the DPRK, paying lip-service to world peace and stability.

All sorts of anti-DPRK hostile acts perpetrated by Japan along with its smear campaign against it only disclose its stance and true colours as a harasser of peace before the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  If Japan is truly interested in peace and stability in the region it should not drive the situation to a crisis but liquidate its crime-woven past in the basic spirit of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration, abandon its ambition to emerge a military power and realize overseas expansion and stop blindly toeing the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Japan is well advised to think twice about what it should do before pulling up the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He grew up to be a platoon, company and regiment commander from an ordinary soldier, displaying matchless heroism and self-sacrificing spirit in the anti-Japanese war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the country's liberation he devotedly worked to build the regular armed forces and defend the gains of the revolution, true to the line of building the army set forth by President Kim Il Sung. Assuming the heavy responsibility as divisional commander of the Korean People's Army during the rigorous Fatherland Liberation War, he contributed to repelling the U.S. imperialists' armed invasion and winning a victory in the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He performed great feats in safeguarding the headquarters of the revolution and increasing the military power of the country, holding important posts at the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of National Defence, the Central Committee of the WPK, the National Defence Commission of the Central People's Committee, and other Party, state and military institutions in the post war period. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Il Chol, minister of the People's Armed Forces, in his memorial address said that the revolutionary life of O Paek Ryong was a life of a genuine revolutionary who dedicated his all to the Party, the leader, the country and the people and to the victory of the cause of socialism and a worthwhile life which showed in practice how revolutionaries should uphold the leader and protect him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He underscored the need to carry forward the transparent outlook on the leader and the indomitable revolutionary spirit displayed by O Paek Ryong and other anti-Japanese revolutionary forerunners and push ahead with the building of a great prosperous powerful socialist nation and accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche under the uplifted banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The memorial service was attended by senior officials of the Party, the state and the army and anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A wreath was place before his bust in the Revolutionary Martyrs Cemetery on Mt. Taesong on the same day.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
