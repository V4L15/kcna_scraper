The U.S. has become more undisguised in its nuclear threat and blackmail under the pretext of the DPRK's \"nuclear issue.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is entirely attributable to the reckless row kicked up by the U.S. to stifle the DPRK with nukes after singling out it as a target of the U.S. nuclear attack that the AF has collapsed and the Korean Peninsula is riddled with a dangerous nuclear crisis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is not entitled to talk about the DPRK's \"breach of the AF\" as it is chiefly to blame for ditching it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently the DPRK advanced a proposal for concluding a non-aggression treaty with the U.S. as part of the efforts to save the AF from its collapse but the U.S. responded to the DPRK's reasonable proposal with a decision to stop the supply of heavy oil to the DPRK. this glaringly revealed the true colours of the U.S. as a violator of the AF. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S.-led construction of \"light water reactors on paper\" will serve as clear historical evidence laying bare the U.S. true colours as violator of the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. can never conceal its true nature as a criminal who ditched the AF like a thief calling crying \"stop the thief\".    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "DPRK Foreign Ministry condemns U.S. piracy\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 13 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry on Friday issued a statement condemning the U.S. for its piracy wantonly violating the DPRK sovereignty.\r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. captured the DPRK trading cargo ship Sosan in broad daylight when the ship was sailing in the open seas off Yemen on Dec. 10. The U.S. even mobilized warships and warplanes of Spain for the capture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Soon after it was brought to light that its capture had no legal ground but wantonly violated the routine trade between countries, the U.S. was compelled to send the ship back. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is an unpardonable piracy that wantonly encroached upon the sovereignty of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAs far as the DPRK's trading ship is concerned, it was carrying missile components and some building materials to be delivered to Yemen under a legal trade contract and was on a normal voyage along the publicly recognized sea route, having all the navigation conditions consistent with international law and usage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has already clarified that it is not only producing missiles to defend itself from the U.S. constant military threat but exporting them to earn foreign currency. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ship was, therefore, aware that it was watched and chased by U.S. military intelligence agencies, but continued its voyage as planned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Knowing about this better than anyone else, the U.S. mobilized even its satellite forces to commit a deliberate military provocation. This clearly shows what an extent the Bush administration has reached in its undisguised moves to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is that the U.S. is becoming  more pronounced in its anti-DPRK smear campaign and its efforts to create an atmosphere of pressurizing it, dubbing it \"exporter of mass destruction weapons,\" in a bid to evade its responsibility, far from making an open apology for having seriously violated the DPRK's sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. provocation can never be justified in any case as it is typical state-sponsored terrorism. And this clearly proves how it is brazen-faced for the U.S. to list other countries as members of an \"axis of evil\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States should apologize for its high-handed piracy committed against the DPRK's trading ship and duly compensate for all the mental and material damage done to the ship and its crew. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is something very regretful and disappointing that Spain which has normal state relations with the DPRK blindly acted a servant of the U.S. pirate, unbecoming on its status. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is working hard to isolate and stifle the DPRK at any cost by keeping the label of \"rogue state\" attached to it. But it is a dream-dream. \r\n It will have to be wholly responsible for all the consequences to be entailed by its evermore reckless moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK and stepped-up hostile policy towards it.    \r\n\r\n"

It is now letting loose a spate of absurd remarks that improved DPRK-U.S. relations would be impossible unless the DPRK scraps its \"nuclear program\" and it is necessary to put continued pressure upon it to force it to abide by the international agreement.\r\n The Bush administration mobilizes all senior and junior officials of the White House, the departments of state and defense in such smear campaign and plugs even its allies and dishonest elements of the IAEA into it, leading the situation to an extreme pitch of tension. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such disgusting move is intended to cover up the shameless colors of the U.S. as the very one chiefly responsible for the breach of the AF and shirk the blame for having dodged the DPRK's just proposal for concluding a non-aggression treaty with it. It is an intolerable mockery of the world community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is needless to mention that the AF has been reduced to a dead document by the United States as it unilaterally decided on Nov. 14 to stop the supply of heavy oil to the DPRK that had been under way according to the AF. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. laudmouthed DPRK's \"admission of nuclear development\" which it cited as the only evidence proving the latter's \"violation\" of the AF is nothing but a phraseology arbitrarily used by the U.S. President's special envoy after his visit to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States was shameless enough to deliberately reprocess its dialogue partner's warning made at inter-state talks as \"admission\" in a bid to kick up a nuclear racket and mislead public opinion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While launching such nuclear campaign, the Bush administration brought the AF to the verge of collapse and actually threatened the DPRK with nukes. Even under this worst situation, the DPRK proposed the U.S. to conclude a non-aggression treaty as a solution to the nuclear issue, exercising its self-restraint to the full. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. arrogantly responded to this constructive proposal with a decision to halt the supply of heavy oil. \r\n The facts clearly proved that the main purpose of the U.S. was to disarm the DPRK and stifle its system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is needless to say that this highhanded and reckless attempt of the U.S. was the main factor of compelling the DPRK to resume the operation and construction of its nuclear facilities at once. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whether the DPRK will refreeze its nuclear facilities or not entirely depends on the attitude of the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will watch the future attitude of the U.S.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
