They also promised to carry out political reforms, revise the election law and properly settle \"grass root-like democracy.\"\r\n   The present ruler said the election, in the long run, put the \"electoral culture\" on a higher level.\r\n   In actuality, however, there has been no change in South Korea's fascist dictatorial politics. Regional confrontation has been fostered and \"commitments\" buried in the black propaganda and smear campaign among political parties as in the period of the preceding dictatorship.\r\n   All the facts show well how pseudo the \"government of people\" is.\r\n   They, who have abused regional antagonism in South Korea, occupied by the U.S.  as means of taking power, are carrying forward the policy of confrontation and division, while ignoring the desire and demand of all the Korean people for the independent and peaceful reunification of the country through great national unity.\r\n   The South Korean chief executive is now saying as if he would do a great thing during the visit to his master's country.\r\n   But the South Korean people are doubtful of this.    \r\n\r\n"

No one can vouch that they, who have long stepped up nuclear armament, will not produce nuclear arms nor take the road of overseas expansion with upon them. \r\n\r\n"

Its falsity has already been brought to a glaring light.\r\n   It is not without reason that the Japanese reactionaries are resorting to the despicable smear campaign, reposing \"expectations\" in it.\r\n   With an increasing number of people at home and abroad calling upon Japan to make an apology and compensation to the Koreans for her past crimes the Japanese reactionaries are kicking up a dust in an effort to flee from the responsibility for them.\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries should ponder over the consequences to be entailed by their anti-DPRK smear campaign and stop it at once.    \r\n   \r\n"
