This miracle could not be wrought without the leadership feats of Kim Il Sung.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He is a great man who trained the Korean people to be a people with strong independence and a heroic people who do not yield to difficulties and ordeals. Such a thing as his feats cannot be seen in history of any country for all ages.\r\n   Just as Korea startled the world with the successful launching of an artificial satellite because it is  guided by Kim Jong Il and  its people have the strong spirit of independence, so it will imposingly rise up as a powerful nation before long and enjoy the highest praise of the world again. \r\n\r\n"

Their first target is the Korean peninsula.\r\n   \"Emergencies\" in areas surrounding Japan implies \"emergencies\" on the Korean peninsula and the first target of Japan's overseas aggression is Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries intend to stage a comeback to Korea that is closest to Japan and situated in a geopolitically, militarily and strategically important place, and to revive their colonial domination and use Korea as the bridgehead of their aggression on Asia.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  That is why they have led the DPRK-Japan relations to warring relations, clamoring about \"threat from North Korea\" and they do not make apology and compensation for their past crimes.\r\n   They will be well advised to ponder over the grave consequence to be entailed by their moves for reinvasion.\r\n   Japan's reinvasion will only precipitate its destruction. \r\n\r\n"

So, he tried to convey his feelings to others. How can this be a crime?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   By arresting the patriotic inhabitant who conducted such righteous activity, the fascist ruling quarters of the \"people's government\" fully revealed themselves as a group of traitors who are getting frantic in anti-north confrontation and man-hunting. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
