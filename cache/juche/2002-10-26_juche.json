Personally writing on a piece of paper produced there, he carefully examined the quality of the paper. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the workers and the officials of the mill have done a splendid work for the people, he stressed that if those in other local factories work hard as they do, they can successfully produce quality goods. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then he moved on to Kumya Power Station No. 2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that it is very gratifying that Changsong County has built several power stations on their own efforts in recent years to produce a lot of electricity, he stressed the need to build new power stations while steadily increasing the generating capacity of the existing ones. He indicated the orientation and ways to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The last leg of his visit was the integrated stock-breeding center of the Okpho Cooperative Farm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He noted with great satisfaction that the farm has not only massproduced meat, eggs, milk and wool by developing the stock-breeding in a big way but sharply increased the cash income of its members. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He proposed tasks to be fulfilled by the farm to boost the animal products by introducing advanced technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Calling for increasing the role of the county and developing the local industry and the rural economy to significantly improve the standard of people's living, he set forth highly important tasks which would serve as guidelines in putting the county's work on a new stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by secretaries Kim Kuk Thae and Kim Ki Nam and first vice department directors Ri Je Gang and Ju Kyu Chang of the Central Committee of the WPK.    \r\n\r\n"

It is the firm principled stand of the DPRK government to oppose all forms of terrorism and any support for it, it said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We have consistently supported the measures and efforts of the Russian government to put an end to terrorism and separatist attempt in Chechnya and to achieve the socio-political stability and territorial integrity of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Sending firm solidarity to the Russian President, the message hoped that the leadership and people of Russia would successfully settle this crisis as early as possible.    \r\n\r\n"

He declared it is anachronistic and baseless for the prosecution to list the north as an anti-state organization and suppress Hanchongryon under the pretext of saying something similar to what the north asserts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Hyong Ju in his statement proved the justice of Hanchongryon's activities and the injustice of the authorities' labeling it as an enemy-benefiting organization.    \r\n\r\n"

It is due to the ceaseless moves of the U.S. to stifle the DPRK that the Korean Peninsula has never witnessed detente and the danger of war is growing in the region with each passing day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It stands to reason that the DPRK can not sit idle as the U.S. is watching for a chance to seize it by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Does the U.S. have the face to talk about the \"threat\" from the DPRK? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. warlike forces are well advised to properly know who is their rival and behave themselves. \r\n The U.S. should abandon its anachronistic hostile policy towards the DPRK before talking about the DPRK's \"threat.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis is what the U.S. should do before anything else.    \r\n\r\n"

They seek an ulterior aim through this.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Being aggressive and predatory, the imperialists do not do others favour. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Obvious is the aim they seek through \"aid.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through the \"aid\" they seek to openly interfere in the internal affairs of the underdeveloped countries and those countries that incur their displeasure in a bid to force their view on value and  social structure upon those nations, westernize all fabrics of the social life of their peoples and thus establish an imperialist order based on subjugation and domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is keen to force other countries to accept the American way of life under various pretexts of \"aid,\" \"loan,\" \"joint development,\" etc. with a view to Americanizing them and establishing a monopolistic high-handed order. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No country has achieved economic progress or prosperity because of the imperialists' \"aid.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As their financial crisis is getting serious and their \"aid\" policy does not work on others, the imperialists are now resorting to crafty tricks to economically subjugate the underdeveloped countries through the multi-national companies' export of capital. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The foreign capital which the imperialists advertise as if it were a big help is nothing but capital to rake up maximum profits. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nNot a few countries are in the grip of social and economic chaos and ethnic dispute because they were not aware that the imperialists' \"aid\" and foreign capital are a noose of subjugation and looting but harbored illusions and depended on them. An illusion about imperialism leads to death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a historical lesson.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The dastardly terrorism committed by Chechen rebels is bitterly condemned by the Korean people and other peace-loving people of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chechnya is an inalienable legitimate part of the territory of the Russian Federation and the Chechens had lived in harmony in the same family like various other nationalities of the Soviet state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the separatist forces in Chechnya, taking advantage of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, sparked and escalated bloody territorial and ethnic disputes in pursuit of the extremist goal of \"independence of Chechnya,\" supported and patronized by foreign forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This situation compelled the Russian government to dispatch the armed forces of the Russian Federation to Chechnya and take steps to contain rebel forces in order to achieve the socio-political stability and territorial integrity of the country. This is a legitimate right and duty of a sovereign state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The hostage crisis took place in Moscow at a time when most of the armed rebels were mopped out and peace, stability and order are in the process of settling in Chechnya thanks to the positive steps of the Russian government in recent years. This cannot be viewed apart from the double-dealing policy, the hard-line policy of the United States toward the issue of terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States classified all the countries of the world into good and evil to achieve its extremist selfish aim under the pretext of \"anti-terrorism war\" after the September 11 incident last year and has left no stone unturned to carry out such policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration did not hesitate to resort to such extreme adventure as ordering the military to work out an emergency plan for the use of nuclear weapons against at least seven countries, including the DPRK, Russia, China, Iraq, and manufacture small nukes to be used in certain war theatres. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Due to such hard-line policy of the U.S. the authority and role of the united nations and the publicly recognized norm and morality of the international community are seriously damaged and a cycle of evil such as terrorism, retaliation, war and bloodbath is aggravating. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is pushing such extremists as Chechen rebels to reckless terrorism and the U.S. hard-line foreign policy encouraging them in desperate suicide operations is, in essence, little short of supporting terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the principled stand of the DPRK to oppose all forms of terrorism and any support for it and the DPRK government has consistently stood against terrorist acts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people who value the traditional Korea-Russia friendship wish the Russian government and people early and successful settlement of the crisis and will consistently support the steps and efforts of the Russian government to achieve and defend the territorial integrity of the country.    \r\n"
