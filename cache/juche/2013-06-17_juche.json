            "content": "S. Korea Slammed for Continuing Moving to Abduct Citizens of DPRK\r\n Pyongyang, June 17 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Central Committee of the Red Cross Society of the DPRK gave the following answer to a question raised by KCNA Monday as regards the south Korean authorities persisting in the criminal moves for the abduction of citizens of the DPRK and flesh trafficking:\n\t\t\t\t\t As known, it was recently disclosed that the puppet regime of south Korea tried to abduct youngsters of the DPRK and take them to south Korea. Following the disclosure of the unprecedented crime against humanity, the DPRK strongly demanded the puppet group immediately stop the mean acts of alluring and abducting its people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the puppet group again allured and abducted citizens of the DPRK recently.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It let agents of the Intelligence Service and flesh traffickers put in a secret hiding place of a foreign country more than ten citizens of the DPRK to take them to south Korea. In the face of tightened control, they tried to hide them in the embassy of south Korea in the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is all the more shocking is that Chongwadae directly choreographed the operation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A media report said that Park Geun Hye, expressing regret over the failure in the plan of taking nine youngsters of the DPRK to south Korea, directly ordered officials concerned to put the abductees into the embassy so as to prevent similar mistake from being made. She even confirmed the whole process of operation all the way to the end at the \"crisis management room\" in the underground air-raid shelter of Chongwadae, according to the report.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the instructions of Chongwadae, the south Korean embassy and agents divided the northerners into several groups and took them to the embassy in top secrecy, in fear of being located when moving in one collection, the report said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korean media, reporting on this, said that it reminded one of an intelligence operation, adding that \"it was unusual that it was directly confirmed and commanded by the president\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent abduction case in which Chongwadae and a south Korean embassy were involved is an unpardonable serious provocation against the DPRK, an indication that the crimes against humanity by the puppet group have reached a reckless phase, assuming organized nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group has become all the more frenzy in its abduction moves despite denunciation at home and abroad. This is aimed to retrieve the recent failure in the operation of alluring youngsters of the DPRK, divert elsewhere the public criticism of its act of scuttling the efforts for the talks between the authorities of the north and the south and further fan up the atmosphere for the confrontation with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The latest case clearly brought to light the fact that Chongwadae is a chief architect of abduction of citizens of the DPRK and human trafficking.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This gives the lie to the \"confidence\" and \"dialogue\" openly spoken out by the puppet group and proves that it has no intent to mend the north-south ties but to escalate confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It even made desperate lobbying to inveigle foreign countries into the smear campaign against the DPRK and abduction of its citizens, disclosing its sordid nature as international hooligan and human trafficker.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t DPRK citizens including those nine young people who came back to the embrace of the DPRK, after being freed from the abduction of the puppet group, are denouncing the unethical and monstrous crimes committed by it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The more berserk the puppet group goes in its sordid act of abduction, the more fully it will disclose its nature as human rights abuser and the bitterer grudge and denunciation it will touch off.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group should stop at once the crimes of alluring and abducting citizens of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the puppet group clings to the smear human rights campaign against the DPRK, defying the internal and external censure and repeated warnings of the DPRK, it will be made to hold all the responsibilities for the ensuing grave consequences."
