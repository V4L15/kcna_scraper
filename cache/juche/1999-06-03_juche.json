The statement noted that the \"operation plan 5027-98\" is a plan for a war of aggression surpassing the former notorious \"operation plan 5027\" in bellicosity and danger.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The plan  reflects the U.S.'s intention to make a preemptive attack on the north any moment  and sets such an extremely adventurous stage as  \"occupation and rule\" over someone  after the end  of war, it said, and went on:   What is all the more dangerous is the fact that they  are running amok in the air attack on Yugoslavia which is believed to be a test war, a preliminary war to put the \"second Korean war\" into practice, while  deploying  large armed forces and war equipment in South Korea under the pretext of  filling up \"vacuum\" and staging  large-scale war exercises between the U.S., Japan and South Korea almost every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As the \"operation plan 5027-98\" envisages a preemptive attack if there is a \"sign\"  of movement in the north,  their large-scale war exercises reached such a very dangerous stage that no one can  presuppose when the exercises will turn into a real war.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"operation plan 5027-98\" proves that the U.S.'s outcries for \"peace\" and \"stability\" on the Korean peninsula are a hypocrisy and they are the  very ones who bring clouds of war to the Korean nation and the wrecker of peace.     If the U.S.  and the South Korean rulers ignite a war of aggression, they will be burnt to death by fire of justice showered by the Korean people and people's army united in one mind. \r\n\r\n"

Korea policy and the war maneuvers against the north at once,  promptly withdraw their aggression forces and military equipment including nuclear weapons from South Korea, make an immediate apology for their responsibility for all misfortunes and sufferings the Korean nation has undergone owing to the division and compensate for them  and no longer interfere in the internal affairs of the Korean nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It also urged the South Korean authorities not to seek a fratricidal war by clinging to the coattails of outsiders, but confess their wrong flunkeyist and treacherous acts  before the nation and make a policy switchover to national independence. \r\n\r\n"

The article says:   The United States is  using unreasonable pretext to interfere in internal affairs of those countries that go against the grain with it and those regions and countries that are situated in military strategic vantage-points.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is openly resorting to military threat, pressure and aggression, considering strength an almighty means of establishing a U.S.-led unipolar world.   Its arbitrariness is  manifested in acting as it pleases, ignoring the United Nations and other international organizations.   The targets of its arbitrary practices  are small and big countries, international organizations, even \"allied nations\", and countries in Asia, Europe, Africa and Latin America.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is seeking a way of establishing the sphere of their  domination over the Asia-pacific region in unleashing a war of aggression on the Korean peninsula.   The U.S. war hawks have worked out a new \"operation plan 5027-98\" and are fully prepared for a preemptive attack on the DPRK.   The U.S. considers its military actions in Yugoslavia as a good opportunity to test up-to-date weapons for the second Korean war and round off its military operation command system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Unless its arbitrary practices are shattered, neither peace and security of the world can be defended nor can international justice and impartiality can ensured.   The reckless moves of the U.S. to dominate the world should be checked and frustrated.\r\n   The unshakable anti-imperialist independent stand should be maintained and  even the slightest concession and compromise should not be  tolerated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   One should not harbor the slightest illusion about the U.S. and yield to economic blockade and military pressure.   In order to shatter their arbitrary practices it is necessary to increase self-reliant national defence capabilities.      One should cultivate one's strength and decisively counter any pressure and challenge of the enemies, convinced of the validity of one's cause. \r\n\r\n"
