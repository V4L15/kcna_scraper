            "content": "U.S. urged to drop its hostile policy toward DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 18 (KCNA) -- The United States is behaving quite contrary to its call for an \"unconditional dialogue\" with the DPRK, says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary.\r\n The commentary says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The special envoy for peace negotiations on the Korean peninsula recently blustered that if North Korea does not fully honour its commitment under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty the assistance to the construction of light water reactors will be suspended. U.S. deputy secretary of defense Wolfwoitz asserted that the DPRK is posing \"biggest military threat,\" arguing that the U.S. is exposed to serious threat of conventional weapons of North Korea. \r\n Rice, adviser to the U.S. President for National Security, asserted that if the DPRK refuses to \"reduce its conventional weapons\" the U.S. has no willingness to resume dialogue with Pyongyang. The chairman of the senate foreign relations committee even went so far as to assert that the U.S. has capacity to destroy North Korea at one sweep. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. loudmouthed \"threat of nuclear, missile and conventional weapons\" of the DPRK is totally unfounded and it is an open challenge to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The dialogue for the improved DPRK-U.S relations has not yet been resumed for which the U.S. is totally to blame.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK and the U.S. cannot sit at the negotiating table as long as the latter has a dagger in its belt and no success can be expected even if such dialogue takes place. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Although the U.S. is talking about the \"resumption of dialogue,\" it is persisting in all sorts of malignant anti-DPRK diatribes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"issue of the reduction of nuclear, missile and conventional weapons\" is a precondition for dialogue that the U.S. unilaterally imposed upon the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for the issue of suspending assistance to the LWR construction raised by the U.S., in fact it has already been suspended. That was why the DPRK stated that the issue of compensation for the delayed provision of the LWRs should be included in the agenda for the DPRK-U.S. negotiations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After putting up the precondition for dialogue unacceptable to the DPRK the U.S. seriously provoked it, aggravated the situation and shifted the responsibility for the deadlocked dialogue onto the DPRK side in a bid to attain its aggressive goal at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has no intention to respond to the proposal for the resumption of the dialogue while allowing its dignity to be hurt and its sovereignty to be infringed upon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK makes it clear once again that it will never be interested in any dialogue with the U.S. unless its new administration drops its hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. is truly interested in the improved relations with the DPRK, it should drop its wrong policy toward the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Young North Korean again interviewed after coming back from South Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 18 (KCNA) -- Yu Thae Jun, former instructor of the Hamhung coal shop of the coal management bureau of South Hamgyong Province, was again interviewed by mediapersons here on August 14 at his own request after coming back to the DPRK from South Korea.\r\n He recently returned to the DPRK via a third country after being tricked into going to South Korea by the \"intelligence service\" and his mother An Jong Suk, step younger brother Ri Kun Hyok and maternal uncle An Haeng Gyo, residing in China, who are associated to the service. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In an interview called early in June he already clarified in detail how he was taken to South Korea, how he went through an examination at the \"Daesong Company,\" a camouflaged institution of the South Korean \"Intelligence Service\" and the \"Defense Security Command,\" .How he underwent brain-washing and why and how he came back to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, a recent issue of the South Korean Chosun Ilbo maliciously slandered the DPRK, asserting that it is difficult to confirm whether Yu Thae Jun is alive or not, the voice of the person who spoke in the interview in June was not Yu's voice and Yu said long-dead maternal uncle is alive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Yu Thae Jun dismissed its assertion about him as sheer sophism, saying that he is alive in reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dismissing as intolerable Chosun Ilbo's story that the woman it described as his mother said she could not recognize his voice, he asserted that there will be no mother in the world who can not distinguish her own son's voice from other's. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Her negative comment on my voice might be cooked up by the right-wing conservatives and Chosun Ilbo of South Korea, he asserted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Strongly protesting against this newspaper's malicious anti-DPRK diatribe, Yu went on to say: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With such scandalmongering paper, which acts rashly, keen on anti-communist, anti-north confrontation, left intact, it is impossible to expect the unity of the Korean nation and the reunification of the country and the proper implementation of the June 15 north-south joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people and genuine media in South Korea should decisively reject Chosun Ilbo, seeing through its true colors as an anti-communist scandalmongering paper. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n I also hold that this paper, which releases false reports while falsifying truth and outwitting the reality, should be removed from the honorable media without delay. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Choe Jong Nam, wife of Yu Tha June, told in the press interview: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n How can An Jong Suk be regarded as mother or human being as she refused to acknowledge her son's voice in collusion with ultra right-wing conservatives and Chosun Ilbo of South Korea? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n I, on behalf of the mothers, send curse and condemnation to An, who has betrayed her homeland and son, mad for money and wealth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Asking reporters to help him to reunite in the DPRK with his six-year-old son, Yun Ho, who was taken to South Korea by allurement and trick of its \"intelligence service\", Yu Thae Jun said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n My son has no reason to remain in South Korea. The South Korean authorities should unconditionally and immediately send him back to the DPRK where his parents are waiting for him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Choe Jong Nam, too, strongly urged the South Korean authorities to send him back to her at an early date, saying that it is two months since she made this demand in the previous press interview. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Reclarifying the truth that he left South Korea on the plea of \"international marriage\", Yu said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"International marriage\" was just a plea for my escape from the south, and this escape was prompted by my conclusion that it is hard to lead a genuine life with human dignity and rights in the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Korea is a society in which no one can have his future guaranteed and it is a paradise for a tiny handful of the privileged class but a hell for the toiling masses.\r\n He recalled that after five months of strict examination at the \"Daesong Company\" he was sent to Taegu, North Kyongsang Province, where he was forced to do hard labour, his elementary right and freedom denied. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went on to say: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n I wanted to die and to be buried in my native place, my homeland. This was my feeling at that time. After months' painstaking efforts to escape from the South Korean society, I succeeded with difficulty in getting out of South Korea under the pretext of \"international marriage\" and returning to the northern half of Korea. I went to the relevant organ to confess my crime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Yu accused Chosun Ilbo of claiming that his interview with reporters was unusual and \"faked-up\" as foreign reporters did not participate in the interview and it was not televised. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He asked newspapers and television not to report about him as he felt it unnecessary to inform compatriots at home of his disgraceful past because he is well as usual thanks to the lenient policy, the benevolent politics of the party and the country, he added.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
