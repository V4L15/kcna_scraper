            "content": "U.S. urged to drop its hostile policy toward DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 18 (KCNA) -- The United States is behaving quite contrary to its call for an \"unconditional dialogue\" with the DPRK, says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary.\r\n The commentary says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The special envoy for peace negotiations on the Korean peninsula recently blustered that if North Korea does not fully honour its commitment under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty the assistance to the construction of light water reactors will be suspended. U.S. deputy secretary of defense Wolfwoitz asserted that the DPRK is posing \"biggest military threat,\" arguing that the U.S. is exposed to serious threat of conventional weapons of North Korea. \r\n Rice, adviser to the U.S. President for National Security, asserted that if the DPRK refuses to \"reduce its conventional weapons\" the U.S. has no willingness to resume dialogue with Pyongyang. The chairman of the senate foreign relations committee even went so far as to assert that the U.S. has capacity to destroy North Korea at one sweep. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. loudmouthed \"threat of nuclear, missile and conventional weapons\" of the DPRK is totally unfounded and it is an open challenge to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The dialogue for the improved DPRK-U.S relations has not yet been resumed for which the U.S. is totally to blame.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK and the U.S. cannot sit at the negotiating table as long as the latter has a dagger in its belt and no success can be expected even if such dialogue takes place. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Although the U.S. is talking about the \"resumption of dialogue,\" it is persisting in all sorts of malignant anti-DPRK diatribes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"issue of the reduction of nuclear, missile and conventional weapons\" is a precondition for dialogue that the U.S. unilaterally imposed upon the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for the issue of suspending assistance to the LWR construction raised by the U.S., in fact it has already been suspended. That was why the DPRK stated that the issue of compensation for the delayed provision of the LWRs should be included in the agenda for the DPRK-U.S. negotiations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After putting up the precondition for dialogue unacceptable to the DPRK the U.S. seriously provoked it, aggravated the situation and shifted the responsibility for the deadlocked dialogue onto the DPRK side in a bid to attain its aggressive goal at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has no intention to respond to the proposal for the resumption of the dialogue while allowing its dignity to be hurt and its sovereignty to be infringed upon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK makes it clear once again that it will never be interested in any dialogue with the U.S. unless its new administration drops its hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. is truly interested in the improved relations with the DPRK, it should drop its wrong policy toward the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"
