            "content": "Biased behaviour\r\n Pyongyang, September 22 (KCNA) -- The president of the UN Security Council after the informal consultation of the Security Council on September 15 made a \"press statement\" which reflects Japan's stand toward the launch of an artificial satellite in the DPRK.\r\n   Commenting on this fact, Rodong Sinmun today says:\r\n   The UN Security Council was egged by Japan with an ulterior political intention to express \"concern\" and \"regret\" over the DPRK's launch of the satellite. It is an attitude of negating the actual situation and unfit for an international body.\r\n   This shows that the UN Security Council is being inveigled into  applying double standards, having already lost impartiality.\r\n   Some countries have launched many satellites but the UN Security Council has never called them in question.\r\nThat is why the UN Security Council has no reason to call our satellite launch in question.\r\n   The logic that a country should give prior notification to the countries in the region does not go down with anyone.\r\n   It is not the DPRK but the Japanese militarist forces that should be warned and called to task. They are giving spurs to the moves of aggression and war,  refusing to admit the crime-woven past and to compensate for it.\r\n   The Japanese government's malicious slander at the DPRK over the satellite launch is chiefly aimed at inventing a pretext and reason to cover up their crimes as the sworn enemy of the Korean people and turn Japan into a military power for aggression and war. \r\n   No matter who tells this or that and  what force interrupts our advance, we will invariably take the road chosen by ourselves. Our just activities for a peaceful use of the space will continue.\r\n   The UN Security Council should make a fair judgement of the present situation and ponder over all the matters.    \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n"

This is aimed at advertising the necessity of \"security cooperation\" with their U.S. and Japanese masters and hurting and stifling the DPRK.\r\n   Far from praising and hailing as fellow countrymen the DPRK's success in science and technology of which the entire nation is proud, they are slandering it and abusing it for their sinister purposes. This can never be tolerated.\r\n   They do not need to be afraid of and feel uneasy at the amazing success of the DPRK, which has become one of the not many nations that possess artificial satellites.    \r\n\r\n"

And he learned about details of their study and life at the academy.\r\n   When he visited a women's coastal artillery company in November last year,  he met a twin brother and sister and posed for a photograph with them.\r\n   He received 22 sets of soldier-triplets who participated in the 3rd meeting of the KPA  soldiers in charge of youth work in November, Juche 85 (1996). He met the triplets who were serving in the KPA three services and said Korea is an impregnable fortress as they defend the socialist motherland.\r\n   As seen above, his expectation and love for soldier-twins and triplets is boundless.    \r\n \r\n\r\n"
