But, what the masses demand of it most of all is that it throws away its ugly traitorous physical quality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSuffice it to recall that it has changed its signboard six times, but the voices of the people for its overthrow are shaking heaven and earth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP is making a desperate bid to preserve its \"vested rights,\" while showing no heed to the people and fellow countrymen, worshipping the United States as God. As long as it remains alive, neither the progressive development of the south Korean society, nor the sovereignty of the nation and the country's peaceful reunification, nor inter-Korean reconciliation and unity can be expected. The only way to the independence, democracy and progress of the south Korean society lies in dissolving the GNP, the party of traitors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people should intensify the fight to blow up this traitor party, not being deceived by its tricky art of disguise, concludes the commentary.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Against this background is Europe coming on the scene as one polar. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It should be recalled that the EU recorded two dramatic events last year-- the sharp growth of its members to 25 and the signing of the EU Constitution. And it has pushed forward the founding of an independent rapid reaction force, not depending on the United States and NATO, in a bid to build an independent collective defense system. In May last year the defense ministers of the EU member nations endorsed a concrete plan for the foundation of a rapid reaction force to be deployed in the areas of disputes. It vividly shows the stand and policy of the EU not wanting to remain a \"contractor for the U.S.\" any more, but seeking to fortify its position and role as a polar. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is worthy of notice that the EU members did not blindly follow the will and demand of the United States but spoke what they wanted to say on a number of international issues and took measures necessary for their own interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The antagonisms and frictions between the EU and the U.S surfaced more glaringly over economy and trade, in particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The developments in Europe last year provide a striking illustration as to that the independence, merger and integration of Europe is an irresistible flow and, for this reason, the antagonisms and confrontation between the EU and the U.S. will assume greater intensity.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Stressing the need to take a future-oriented approach toward improving the bilateral relations in the new century, instead of repeating the unpleasant past, the DPRK side expressed its stand that the DPRK would not stand against the U.S. but respect and treat it as a friend unless the latter slanders the former's system and interferes in its internal affairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As regards this position, the U.S. congress delegation said it came to know well about the DPRK's stand, expressing the stance that the U.S. does not antagonize the DPRK nor has any intention to invade the DPRK and overthrow its system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK side assured the U.S. side that the DPRK would opt for finding a final solution to all the outstanding issues between the two countries, to say nothing of the resumption of the six-party talks and the nuclear issue, if what U.S. congressmen said would be formulated as a policy of the second Bush administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During its stay the delegation toured different parts of Pyongyang, including Kim Il Sung University, the Tower of the Juche Idea, the Pyongyang Metro, the Mansudae Art Studio, the Korean Stamp Exhibition, the Folkcraft Exhibition and a market in Thongil Street.

Korean Unification Ministry's Anti-north Moves Assailed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 14 (KCNA) -- The south Korean authorities have conspired with the United States and its followers in the operations to allure and\r\nabduct DPRK citizens on their foreign trips and take them to south Korea after painting them as \"defectors from the north\". This time they faked up an \"alternative phraseology for defectors from the north\" and fabricated even the \"law on the protection of residents from north Korea.\" This is nothing but a revelation of their intention to commit organized abduction of north Koreans in the future, too.\r\n A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland said this in a statement Friday. The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Ministry of Unification in south Korea shaped a domestic policy to replace the phraseology \"defectors from the north\" by \"new settlers\" on Jan. 8. In this regard the boss of the ministry remarked that the ministry has the idea to use new alternative phraseology meaning \"new area to settle down and hope\" because the phraseology of \"defectors from the north\" gives a negative meaning. He even clarified that the proposal for using a formal phraseology in the \"law on the protection of residents from north Korea\" would be considered after studying the \"public opinion.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is exalting its dignity with Songun politics. It, therefore, can not but be a serious insult and challenge to it to paint as \"a new area to settle down\" the south Korean land where national sovereignty is violated under the occupation of foreign aggression troops and such leftovers of the old era as the \"National Security Law\" and the \"Grand National Party\" still remain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is nothing but an undisguised provocation against the patriotic appeal the DPRK has made to achieve cooperation for national independence, cooperation for peace against war and cooperation for reunification and patriotism with a view to opening up a new vista of independent reunification this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ministry's improper behavior once again reveals the double-dealing tactics of those who have an axe to grind while talking about \"reconciliation and cooperation\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It would be hard to expect any improvement in the inter-Korean relations if the south Korean authorities keep inciting confrontation with the north, their dialogue partner, while negating its ideology and system and sowing the seed of distrust and discord as now. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north will never remain an on-looker to the ministry's act of supporting the U.S. in its hostile policy toward the DPRK to bring it down while inciting discord and confrontation among the fellow countrymen, far from working for inter-Korean reconciliation, cooperation and national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities would be well advised to behave with discretion, clearly understanding that confrontation with the DPRK will get them nowhere.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
