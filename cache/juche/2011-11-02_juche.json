This regime has approached from negative stand all the successes made in the June 15 era of reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The north-south relations can never improve as long as the south Korean authorities regard the DPRK as a target of confrontation and are set to do harm to it, a partner with whom they should get reconciled and united.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is prerequisite for the south Korean authorities to make a switchover in their confrontation policy to ensure peace and security in the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To waste time and wealth away for confrontation and preparations for a war is a crime and an act of treachery.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If a war breaks out in the Korean Peninsula, the victims will be the Koreans in the north and the south. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the north and the south escalate confrontation, the nation will suffer and foreign forces will benefit from it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The peace and security can settle on the peninsula only when the south Korean authorities make a switchover in their confrontation policy and press for mending the fence with the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The switchover in the confrontation policy is also urgently required for implementing the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now is the time for all the Koreans to pool their efforts and for the north and the south to unite for reunification, a long-cherished desire of the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To persist in confrontation with the DPRK and deny the implementation of the June 15 joint declaration and the Oct. 4 declaration at this time is an intolerable anti-reunification act. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should immediately roll back the anachronistic policy denounced by all the Koreans."

The financial crisis that hit Asia in 1997 brought down the GDP at least 50 percent in the countries concerned. But the present financial crisis worldwide has caused a loss of trillion U.S. dollars on earth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and other capitalist countries of the West which pushed ahead with \"globalization\" are now in trouble being caught in its whirlpool.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Capitalism which revived with U.S. imperialism as a core after the Second World War was elated in high spirit since the end of the Cold War. But now it is being shaken to its roots, festering from its center.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. finds itself in the bottomless abyss of ruin due to the \"war on terrorism\" which it called the Third World War, just like the past fascist powers who met self-destruction in the disastrous world wars against humanity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The financial crisis which started in the U.S. is developing into that of the capitalist world as a whole, sharpening class contradiction. The revolutionary advance of the oppressed toiling masses such as \"Occupy Wall Street\" demo is being intensified on a worldwide scale.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Capitalism in which the minority dominates the majority, exploiting and plundering them is on the verge of judgment by history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Financial supremacy, the last mainstay of U.S. imperialism, is on the point of collapse.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Various countries are showing the trend of converting their foreign currencies into gold out of concern that U.S. debt snowballing beyond 14 trillion dollars may lead to the possible dollar depreciation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The era is coming to an end when the minority of capitalist powers have exploited and plundered the majority of countries and peoples at will.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t BRICS, grouping Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, are bravely challenging the outdated West-led international economic order with South-South cooperation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are using national currencies when settling mutual trade, thereby dealing decisive counteraction to the U.S. dollar supremacy and increasing their political and economic position and the right to speak.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Developing countries including those in Asia and Latin America are suffering less from the current financial crisis than in the 1990s thanks to the multilateral cooperation in reliance upon ASEAN, ALBA and other regional organizations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Contradiction and antagonism are getting serious among capitalist countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Warfare\" between U.S. dollar and euro is surfacing over the U.S. design to get benefit by deliberately reducing the dollar price.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nexus among capitalist countries has been marred, bringing contradiction to the fore as they have become competitive in their scrambles for strategic resources and markets."

Se intensifica el avance revolucionario de las masas populares explotadas como la manifestacion \"Ocupa Wall Street\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa heguemonia financiera, ultimo punto de apoyo del imperialismo norteamericano esta tambien en vispera de bancarrota.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa tendencia actual es que varios paises compran oro como reserva de divisas en vez de dolar preocupandose por la crisis de deuda de EE.UU. que se aumenta incesantemente sobrepasando el limite de 14 billones US$, lo que podria  provocar la baja de valor de dolar norteamericano,.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tVa a terminar la epoca en que la minoria de las potencias capitalistas explotaba y saqueaba a su antojo a la mayoria de los paises y los pueblos del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBRICs (Brasil, Rusia, India, China y Sudafrica) se enfrenta categoricamente con la cooperacion Sur-Sur al viejo orden economico internacional cuya supremacia pertenece al Occidente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsesta contraataque decisivo a la hegemonia de dolar estadounidense realizando la liquidacion comercial mutua con monedas nacionales y eleva su posicion y derecho a la palabra en lo politico y  economico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl fortalecer la cooperacion mutua ateniendose a la Asociacion de Naciones del Sudeste Asiatico (ASEAN), la Alianza Bolivariana para los Pueblos de Nuestra America (ALBA) y otras organizaciones regionales, los paises asiaticos, latinoamericanos y otros en vias de desarrollo reciben poca influencia negativa de la crisis financiera en comparacion con la decada de 1990.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRecrudece la contradiccion interior y el antagonismo entre los paises capitalistas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn relacion con que EE.UU. intenta sacar provecho bajando artificialmente el precio de dolar se exterioriza la \"guerra\" entre el dolar estadounidense y euro.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde cuando las potencias capitalistas entran a porfia en la guerra para conquistar los recursos estrategicos y los mercados se agrietane las relaciones de contubernio entre ellos y se exaltan mas sus contradicciones."
