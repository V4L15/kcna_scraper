Por tanto, la retirada de THAAD sirve de la piedra de toque para juzgar a las actuales autoridades surcoreanas que son el representante de las opiniones publicas de la lucha con velas encendidas o sirvientes de EE.UU. como Park Geun-hye.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl unico remedio para liberarse de la presion y molestia, es aceptar totalmente la advertencia del Norte y la exigencia de las opiniones publicas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas deben tener bien presente que la sumision a EE.UU significa continuar los fracasos de sus predecesores."
