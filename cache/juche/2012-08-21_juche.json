            "content": "KPA Panmunjom Mission Clarifies Its Stand to Not Miss Opportunity for Reunification\r\n Pyongyang, August 21 (KCNA) -- The Panmunjom Mission of the Korean People's Army issued the following statement Tuesday:\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists and the south Korean warmongers finally kicked off Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military exercises for aggression, defying strong public protest and denunciation at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They do not hide that the exercises are pursuant to \"an actual war scenario\" targeted against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Huge troops of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces and the south Korean puppet army have already set up positions in and around south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even military personnel of those countries which took part in the last Korean war under the UN helmet are involved in the drills.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The war drills in the wake of the disclosure of the hideous state-sponsored and politically-motivated terrorism against the DPRK prove that the U.S. is the harasser of peace and provoker of a war in the new century that upsets the stability on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet regime and other allies that are taking part in the U.S.-led saber-rattling are just poor stooges little different from sacrifice to their master.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Panmunjom Mission of the Korean People's Army clarifies as follows with a touch-and-go situation prevailing on the Korean Peninsula:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 1. The joint military drills of the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppet regime are the most undisguised and serious final-phase violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement (AA).\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Paragraphs of the AA specify an unconditional halt to all arms buildup, large-scale military exercises and military provocations against the other side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The armistice state that had been barely maintained in the unstable form of neither war nor peace by the peace-loving efforts of the DPRK has now turned into a catastrophic phase beyond control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that the armistice state has been wantonly violated, the army and people of the DPRK state to the world that they have the right to do whatever they should do any time, not bound to the AA any longer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the actions of the army and people of the DPRK, not bound to the AA, will become merciless exercises of unpredictable and unimaginable physical strength.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 2. The on-going joint military drills are a vicious challenge and violation of the peace on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We love and value peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But now that the enemies are set to harass peace on the Korean Peninsula and encroach upon the inviolable sovereignty of the DPRK by force of arms, the option to be taken by its army and people can not but be an indiscriminate counteraction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As it has become clearer that the nation's sovereignty and peace which are more valuable than one's own life can be guaranteed only by arms, the army and people of the DPRK will take physical counteraction any moment, unhindered, to safeguard its sovereignty and peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 3. The joint military drills are intolerable actions going against the Koreans' desire and wish for national reconciliation, unity and reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the unanimous desire of all the Koreans to achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the country through the national reconciliation and cooperation and by their concerted efforts under the banner of \"By our nation itself\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppet regime counter the nation's cherished historic desire with military provocation, the DPRK can not but take the resolve to use force to defend the nation's reconciliation and unity and head for reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army of the DPRK has already finished the preparations to remove the root cause of all evils that stand in the way of the nation's reconciliation and unity by use of force for self-defence .\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation shows that nothing has changed in the U.S. war policy of antagonizing the DPRK and only the great war of reunification remains to be done to settle accounts with them by the use of merciless arms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The war for reunification to be waged by the DPRK will not end in armistice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What remains to be done now is to wage a merciless sacred war for wiping out the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppet forces to the last man and reunifying the country to win a great, admirable victory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will never miss the golden opportunity for waging a great war for reunification but achieve the cause of national reunification without fail, in hearty response to the militant order given by Supreme Commander Kim Jong Un during his inspection of the biggest hotspot area in the southernmost part of the southwestern front for defending the country on August 17."

August 15 this year marks the 67th anniversary of Japan's defeat and August 22, the 102nd anniversary of fabrication of the brigandish \"Korea-Japan Annexation Treaty\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Koreans can never forget the disgrace they suffered at the hands of the Japanese imperialists even though old century and generations are replaced by new ones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the past the Japanese imperialists forcibly took away to Japan more than 8.4 million innocent young and middle-aged Koreans and massacred at least one million Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They forced 200 000 Korean women into sexual slavery, a hideous crime against humanity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But Japan's attitude now reveals its impudence and brutal nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It called the unprecedented sexual slavery a \"misconduct of individuals\" and even said that \"women volunteered to earn money\", describing it as \"history of toilet room\". This was little short of rubbing salt into the wounds of the victims.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In addition to its denial of the crime-woven history, Japan is trying to revive militarism to make the said history repeat itself on this land.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It published for several years defense white papers claiming Tok Islets and revised \"three principles of arms export\", openly calling for going nuclear, emerging a military giant and exercising the right of collective self-defence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Vicious politically-motivated persecution and crackdown on Koreans in Japan, victims of the Japanese imperialists' rule over Korea, and their descendents, are violating their right to existence and national rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This clearly shows again to what extent the Japanese reactionaries have gone in their ambition for aggression and bitterness toward the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An apology and reparation for the past crimes serve as a touchstone judging Japan's total ruin and rebirth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan should know that many countries and regions around the world and even its allies are urging it to make apology and reparation for the sexual slavery this month marking the anniversary of its surrender in World War II."

Korea Military Drills\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, August 21 (KCNA) -- The U.S. and the south Korean warmongers, oblivious of the historical lesson, have gone reckless in their moves to ignite a new war. This has created once again a touch-and-go situation on the Korean Peninsula, the world's biggest hotspot.\n\t\t\t\t\t They kicked off extremely provocative big joint military drills for aggression, defying the unanimous desire and wish of the people at home and abroad for peace and stability on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ulji Freedom Guardian military drills now under way with the involvement of 30 000 U.S. troops including those based abroad and huge south Korean forces and even U.S. allies are apparently a dangerous saber-rattling targeting the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The enemies are making lame excuses, calling the drills \"annual defense exercises\" but the maneuver is the most dangerous and vicious act aimed at aggression of the DPRK in the light of its scale, nature, codename and program.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Special warfare drill\" targeting the headquarters of the revolution of the DPRK and \"drill for preemptive attack\" on strategic strongholds including nuclear and missile bases in it and other programs of UFG can not be viewed otherwise than a declaration of an all-out war against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The application of the field operational control system of the south Korean puppet army that took effect from last year and the right to the operational control which south Korea was granted for the first time in the history of joint military drills highlight the danger and belligerency of UFG.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The enemies' extremely provocative moves have rendered the situation on the Korean Peninsula so tense that it reminds one of the eve of the Korean War in the 1950s.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After World War II the U.S. defined the peninsula as \"a ground for testing stand-off between American-style democracy and communism\" and an outpost for realizing its strategy for world domination. So, it put the south Korean puppet forces under arms and prodded them to ignite the Korean war. Now it is moving to follow in the footsteps of those adventurers, obsessed by wild ambition.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. aims to topple the DPRK by force during the office of pro-U.S. stooges like Lee Myung Bak, who put traitor Syngman Rhee into the shade, and turn the whole peninsula into a springboard for its strategy for domination of Asia. This is the essence of the new U.S. defense strategy and the ultimate goal of the on-going military drills.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world's most powerful military means including nuclear weapons are amassed on the peninsula where there are neither durable mechanism nor guarantee for heading off a war. Any slightest provocation will not be just confined to a local war but lead to bilateral all-out nuclear war and a regional war and spill over into new world war in the end.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The military gambling of the U.S. and south Korean puppet regime deserves censure of the public at home and abroad as it jeopardizes the peace and stability of the world including Northeast Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the enemies dare preempt an attack on the DPRK, it will never miss the opportunity for the sake of the lasting peace and stability of the peninsula, the region and the rest of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will mount deadly strikes at the bases of aggressors and provokers and remove the source of evil that troubles the world so as to greet national reunification, the cherished desire of the Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the fixed determination and will of the army and people of the DPRK in response to the order of the illustrious commander.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and its allies will be made to meet a miserable end in the face of undaunted attack by the great country of Mt. Paektu led by the great commander."

Los presentes ejercicios militares conjuntos del imperialismo norteamericano y los titeres surcoreanos son un acto mas abierto y grave que rompe en la ultima etapa el Acuerdo de Armisticio de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos articulos de ese documento estipulan claramente el cese incondicional del aumento de fuerzas armadas de todo tipo, los ejercicios militares de gran envergadura y las provocaciones militares contra la contraparte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl estado de armisticio, que gracias a los esfuerzos pacifistas de la RPDC, se mantenia por un pelo sin fijarse en la guerra ni en la paz, llega a la fase insostenible por mas tiempo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy dia, en que se ha roto indudablemente el estado de armisticio, nuestro ejercito y pueblo declaran a todo el mundo que tienen el derecho a hacer lo que le toca hacer en cualquier momento sin comprometerse mas al Acuerdo de Armisticio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodas las acciones de nuestro ejercito y pueblo, que no se comprometen al Acuerdo de Armisticio, pasaran al ejercicio de las fuerzas fisicas imprevisibles, inimaginables e implacables.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. La presente maniobra deviene un desafio brutal y violacion de la paz de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC ama la paz y la aprecia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA nuestro ejercito y pueblo no les quedan otra opcion que el indiscriminado contraataque bajo la situacion de hoy en que los enemigos perturban flagrantemente la paz de la Peninsula Coreana e intentan violar con fuerzas nuestra sagrada soberania. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa que se hizo evidente que es posible defender solo con los fusiles la soberania y la paz de la nacion, mas valiosas que la vida, la reaccion fisica de nuestro ejercito y pueblo para defenderlas tendra lugar sin limites a cualquier hora.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. La presente maniobra constituye un insoportable desafio a la aspiracion y demanda de todos los connacionales sobre la reconciliacion, la unidad y la reunificacion de la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs unanime la aspiracion de todos los connacionales a lograr la reunificacion independiente y pacifica de la patria mediante la reconciliacion y cooperacion de la nacion y con las fuerzas unidas bajo la bandera de \"Entre nosotros, los connacionales\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFrente al hecho de que el imperialismo norteamericano y los titeres surcoreanos desafian con la provocacion militar al anhelo historico de la nacion, nos vimos obligados a tomar la decision de defender la reconciliacion y la unidad de la nacion y lograr la reunificacion con las fuerzas armadas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestro ejercito ya termino perfectamente los preparativos para eliminar mediante el uso de las fuerzas armadas de autodefensa la fuente de todos los males que impiden la reconciliacion y la unidad de nuestra nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa realidad demuestra que no hubo ningun cambio en la politica de guerra de EE.UU., que vino hostilizando a la RPDC, y lo unico que falta es la guerra de reunificacion para ajustar las cuentas con los implacables fusiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo puede haber el armisticio en esa gran guerra para la reunificacion que vamos a hacer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNos quedan solo la despiadada guerra sagrada por lograr la reunificacion exterminando al imperialismo norteamericano y los titeres surcoreanos y la historica tarea de terminarla con la gran victoria digna de admiracion de todo el mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl acatar con el corazon la orden de combate dada por el Comandante Supremo inspeccionando el pasado dia 17 la zona mas candente del extremo sur del frente sudoeste en defensa de la patria, nuestro ejercito y pueblo cumpliran sin falta la causa de reunificacion de la patria sin perder la oportunidad de oro de la gran guerra de reunificacion."
