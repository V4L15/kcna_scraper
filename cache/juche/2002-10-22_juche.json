A message of solidarity to Kim Jong Il was adopted there. \r\n\r\n"

They should stop such criminal attempts and behave themselves, lending an ear to the demand of the world people for peace.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article as regards the strong-arm policy still pursued by the United States in the international arena in a bid to dominate the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Proceeding from the hegemonistic way of thinking based on upperhand in strength, the U.S. arrogantly insists that all other countries should accept its demand and unconditionally carry out what it dictates, whether they like or not, the article notes, and says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some time ago, the U.S. Congress adopted a resolution that allows its president to use armed forces against Iraq. This means that the present U.S. chief executive is allowed to start any war of aggression against Iraq and other countries anytime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. strong-arm policy was manifested in what Kelly did while visiting Pyongyang some time ago in the capacity of the U.S. President's special envoy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kelly made an ultimatum-style notice that the DPRK-U.S. dialogue can not be expected and the favorably developing inter-Korean relations and DPRK-Japan relations might collapse unless the DPRK clears the U.S. of its \"security concerns\". Such threatening and highhanded practice of the envoy was a vivid expression of the U.S. imperialists' brigandish and arrogant nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is now calling for \"arms reduction\" of the DPRK, making a hue and cry over its \"threat\". But such row does not stand to reason and it will get the U.S. nowhere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. persists in its moves to apply pressure and stifle the DPRK by force, the latter will have no option but to take a tougher counteraction. The U.S. will stand further isolated due to its anachronistic hardline policy to stifle the DPRK.\r\n The only way out for the U.S. is to opt for reconciliation and peace, not strong-arm policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is now rejected with its influence waning in the Mideast and Northeast Asia including the Korean Peninsula. This is an inevitable result of the policy of the U.S. which acts an international gendarme.    \r\n\r\n"

Paektu, Lake Chon and Lake Samji and other rooms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is in the introductory hall a large panorama which shows the vast area of Mt. Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the hall visitors can listen to a computer-aided lecture on the revolutionary battle sites and revolutionary sites in the area of Mt. Paektu. There one may feel as if he is looking down over the area from a plane. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the rooms visitors can find computer files on materials about the revolutionary battle sites and revolutionary sites in the given areas and their history and fauna and flora in the area of Mt. Paektu. \r\n On the balcony in the centre of the second floor one can see picturesque Lake Samji.    \r\n\r\n"

He learnt that officials were interested only in the expansion project of the carbide workshop, indifferent to the black smoke shot up from the chimney of the factory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Returning from the guidance tour, he told officials they, fully responsible for the destiny of the people, could not allow air pollution even a bit but provide the people with pollution-free living conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWhat he said reflected his strong sense of responsibility for the destiny of the people.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
