Herein lies the U.S. purpose of building the above-said operational system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By the recent \"U.S.-Japan alliance in the new era\" the U.S. imperialists mean the U.S.-Japan military alliance for provoking the Korean war in the 21st century and by a \"timely counter-action\" they mean a war of aggression against the DPRK which they may start any time. \"A consultation about the military scenario\" touted by them is nothing but a U.S.-Japan joint military operational plan for igniting another Korean war. It is the ulterior aim of the U.S. to use Japan as a shock force in the war, retaining its grip on Japan as the most important stronghold for carrying out its strategy for a preemptive attack on the DPRK, readjust and tighten the U.S.-Japan military alliance and the U.S.-south Korea military alliance to keep pace with the projected conclusion of a new military agreement between south Korea and Japan and make them serve the purpose of the above-said Korean war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the unshakable stand of the DPRK to counter the \"preemptive attack\", which the U.S. singled out as its main mode of striking the DPRK, through a more powerful advanced preemptive attack of Korean style.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Availing ourselves of this opportunity, we would like to serve a strong warning to the Japanese reactionaries.

Japan would be well advised to bear this in mind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Should the U.S. persistently come in preemptive attack on the DPRK in collusion with Japan, the army and people of the DPRK will deal a thousand-fold retaliatory blow at the aggressors by use of the powerful war means of Songun and thus inflict a bitter defeat upon them."

Rodong Sinmun Tuesday observes this in a signed commentary.\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"threat from the north\" touted by the puppets is nothing but sheer sophism intended to justify their moves to start a war of aggression against the north and escalate them as it is a replica of \"threat of southward invasion\" cited by the south Korean successive warmongers. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After bringing to light the intention to invade the north, crying out for the provocative \"theory of principal enemy\" and \"preemptive attack\" the Lee Myung Bak group of warmongers is getting evermore desperate in its moves to bring the inter-Korean relations to the crisis of total severance and ignite a new war at any cost. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The catastrophic crisis of the inter-Korean relations bears a close resemblance to the situation on the eve of a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality goes to clearly prove that the Lee regime is making its provocation of a war of aggression against the north an established fact and its adventurous scenario is being put into practice with increased zeal. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppets are, however, seriously mistaken. It is, indeed, foolish of the puppet warmongers to try to do harm to the DPRK which has demonstrated the might of a military power well known to the world under the banner of Songun.

Al contrario, por el temor a la revelacion de sus fechorias, vino eliminado a quemadura durante varias decadas los documentos relativos a ellas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, los crimenes de Japon no seran borrados ni silenciados aunque pase mucho tiempo y se hagan ingentes esfuerzos por ocultarlos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA fin de enganar a la opinion publica internacional, Japon miente que ya ha pedido disculpas por el particular.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs totalmente absurdo que los reaccionarios japoneses intentaran conseguir algo amedrentando y presionando al pueblo coreano con la campana de sancion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA su vez, el pueblo coreano redobla su voluntad de ajustar la cuenta sin falta con ese pais isleno sintiendose sumamente indignado por la sucia conducta de las autoridades japonesas que persiguen sus malsanas metas politicas tomando la sancion por el medio de presion a la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi los reaccionarios japoneses siguen armando escandalos en busca de la sancion anti-RPDC, sera mas avergonzado y aislado en la sociedad internacional."
