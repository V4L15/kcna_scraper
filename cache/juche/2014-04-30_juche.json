            "content": "Kim Jong Un Inspecs Workers' Hostel of Pyongyang Textile Mill\r\n Pyongyang, April 30 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, first chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, looked round the newly built workers' hostel of Kim Jong Suk Pyongyang Textile Mill.\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching the hostel, he expressed great satisfaction. He said:  \"The hostel looks very nice. The place once covered with dust only has undergone a dramatic change. There has sprung up another splendid structure in the era of the Workers' Party of Korea in a matter of 180 odd days. The People's Army helped me keep the promise made with the workers of the textile mill by creditably performing its role as a standard-bearer in the campaign for implementing the idea of the party and defending its policy.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He looked round various places of the hostel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After entering its lobby, he was pleased to see the floor height of the lobby and the corridor fixed as intended by the party and their walls painted with the color liked by women.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Not only bedrooms but also library in the hostel have been arranged well to provide the best convenience to boarders so they might not feel any discomfort in their life\", he added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He praised the soldier-builders for building the public bath to be impeccable and the dining hall like a banquet hall and equipping the kitchen with modern and latest utensils.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was pleased to see a paradise-like park outside the hostel where boarders may have good rest, playing amusement and sports games.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round the hostel, he was very pleased and satisfied. He said: \"Another behest of President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il has been carried out. How greatly pleased they would have been if they had seen the newly built hostel as they attached so great importance to the textile mill directly linked to the people's living in their lifetime.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Officials told him that the employees of the textile mill call the hostel a palace of workers, a hotel of workers and that they hardly find proper words to express thanks to Marshal Kim Jong Un.    Hearing this, he said what he just hoped is to see them increase the production of fabrics, remembering Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il who made so much effort to provide the people with quality clothing materials.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Proposing holding a grand banquet for workers in celebration of May Day at the newly built workers' hostel of Kim Jong Suk Pyongyang Textile Mill, he asked the director of the General Political Bureau of the KPA to attend the banquet and congratulate the workers on his behalf.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un noted: \"Through the construction of the hostel the KPA correctly carried out the party's policy and service personnel created again a world-startling miracle under the slogan 'Let us take charge of both national defence and socialist construction!'\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that he was informed every day of the drive waged by them, erecting another building over the hostel and working inside it under the conditions of cold winter. \"Even biting cold could not freeze the service personnel whose hearts were burning with the resolution to implement the order of the party,\" he added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Calling on the whole country to learn  the revolutionary soldier spirit and work style of the KPA, he highly praised service personnel of KPA units 966, 462, 101 and 489 for performing feats in devotedly implementing the order of the party and gave them thanks of the supreme commander of the KPA.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Hwang Pyong So, Pak Yong Sik and Ma Won Chun."

This proves that the Park Geun Hye group is hordes of despicable sycophants and traitors and maniacs hell-bent on confrontation with their fellow countrymen. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural that the south Korean people are cursing Park, daughter of \"yusin\" dictator, as \"a murderer\" and shouting the slogan \"Haya\" (Park step down) as she is refusing to make any proper apology for the death of hundreds of innocent people including young schoolchildren and shifting the responsibility for it onto her inferiors while going busy kissing outside forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Hye will not be able to evade a severe punishment by history for her thrice-cursed crimes."

More ridiculous are Obama's remarks at the ceremony that as the president, he came to realize that it is hard to make progress in the American society and there are some discouraging points.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In fact, the remarks are little different from his admission of the serious human rights situation in the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the citizenship act, racialism is getting more severe in the U.S. The gaps between the minorities and the whites are very wide in the exercise of such rights to work and elect.

As a result, the U.S. has witnessed an increasing number of gun-related crimes in all parts of the country and even its military bases this year. In this regard, the United Nations on April 10 put the U.S. on the top of the world list of homicide rates.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. also has 2.2 millions of prisoners at present, the highest number in the world.
