Yet, he has argued that the fellow countrymen are \"threatening peace\" when they exercise the national independence and sovereignty against the aggressors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This argument is little different from the platitudes used by his masters the U.S. and Japan to cover up their aggressive design. The former is seeking to permanently occupy South Korea and dominate Asia and the rest of the world with it as a springboard and the latter is getting frantic in the moves for reinvasion of Korea and Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   That is why the chief executive, at a \"cabinet meeting\" on Sept. 7, defended the \"Northern Limit Line\" unilaterally set by the U.S. master in violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and international law by saying that he can not recognize the territorial waters proclaimed by the north ignoring the \"line.\"   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Although he is insisting on the \"Northern Limit Line\" at the U.S. instigation, we can never recognize it and will take a decisive self-defensive measure against any breach of the Military Demarcation Line at the West Sea of Korea proclaimed by us. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Our people and self-defensive revolutionary armed forces will surely make the South Korean authorities, colonial stooges of the United States and Japan, pay for their foul flunkeyist and treacherous deeds.

He took the lead in carrying out the brutal suppression and slaughter of patriotic-minded people in South Korea under the cloak of \"adviser to the governor of the U.S. Military Administration\" before his death in Pusan during the Korean War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The grandson of Underwood also committed all sins during the Korean War as the \"most influential adviser\" in plotting the \"Inchon landing operation\" of the U.S. aggression forces. He cooked up sinister anti-DPRK strategies and tricks, working as an \"advisory officer\" and \"chief interpreter\" at the Korean cease-fire negotiations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Even after the end of the war descendants of Underwood played their dirty parts in maintaining the colonial rule of the U.S. in South Korea, working as \"university professor,\" \"priest\" and \"director of foundation.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Underwood and his clan played the role of guide and storm trooper for the implementation of the U.S. policy of aggression on Korea for 114 years through four generations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They are now busy spreading in South Korea the idea of worship and flunkeyism towards the U.S. under various pretexts and are whetting their swords to invade the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people are now trembling with towering wrath and grudge against Underwood and his clan. \r\n\r\n"
