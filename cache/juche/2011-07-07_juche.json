I will make clear what to do first, what to do next and what should not be done.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In his presidential inaugural speech he said he would shape north policy based on pragmatism, not on idea. At \"March 1 commemoration speech\", the first one after his inauguration, and at a ceremony of appointing army generals on April 3 he decried the idea of \"By our nation itself\" as \"narrow-minded nationalism\" and \"national chauvinism\", saying \"it will never help solve the south-north relations.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To block north-south dialogue and relations he put up all kinds of pretexts including \"dismantlement of nuclear weapons\", \"sincerity\", \"maintenance of principle\" and \"change of north's attitude.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  At a meeting held to hear a working report of the Unification Ministry on March 26, 2008, etc. he dropped a checkbar on the north-south cooperation, talking about \"dismantlement of nuclear program first\" and \"drain on resources\". On November 12 of the same year he said \"he is waiting for the north to change its attitude. Waiting is also a strategy.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He made no scruple of asserting he would not \"hold talks without principle\", \"the present south-north relations are going on its normal orbit\" and he \"does not care whether he will have no chance to have a summit during his tenure of office.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On Nov. 30, 2007 he said \"the north should know that it cannot expect anything unless it dismantles its nuclear program and opts for reform and opening.\" Early in February 2008 when interviewed by media, he noted \"the north's dismantlement of nuclear weapons is a precondition for the improvement of the south-north relations\". In his presidential inaugural speech he went the lengths of officially declaring \"no nukes, opening and 3 000 dollars\" as the \"north policy.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Speaking at the opening session of the 18th \"National Assembly\" and at an interview with foreign reporters on September 26, he also pinpointed \"the north's dismantlement of nuclear weapons\" as a \"top priority in north policy,\" \"primary task\" and \"master key\". He disclosed his intention not to advance the north-south relations even a bit unless it is solved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He talked about someone's \"change\" and \"opening\" and \"unification under liberal democracy\" in wanton violation of the three principles of national reunification, basic principles of the north-south relations, thereby escalating the confrontation of systems. This pushed the north-south relations to such phase that they are no longer repairable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He even set the duty and function of the puppet Ministry of Unification not for the improvement of north-south relations, reconciliation and cooperation but for \"unification through absorption\" and called on the ministry to get prepared for it. He brought together even riff-raffs and human scum and instigated them to intensify the scattering of leaflets and anti-DPRK broadcasting.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On Sept 26, 2008 the traitor visited the puppet army's joint demonstration firing exercise ground where the warmongers fired at the DPRK flag. There he complemented them, blustering \"there is no rear separated from front in a modern warfare. The army should get fully ready to go into action.\" At major commanding officers' meeting on May 4, 2010 he cried out for \"establishing principal enemy concept\" while talking about \"hostile relations with the north\" and \"specific situation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At talks with the people over \"Cheonan\" case and talk-fest with those of the Consultative Council for Democracy and Peaceful Unification he blustered that \"one should know there is the most warlike group just 50 km ahead\", \"one should take a firm stand\", \"one should not be afraid of a war\" and \"now is the time to show action rather than words.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When he inspected the commanding control post of the puppet Joint Chiefs of Staff on Nov. 23 and a forefront unit of the puppet army on Dec. 23, 2010, he said \"countermeasures should be taken even in violation of wartime rules,\" \"a big counterattack should be mounted\", \"we will make them pay due price\" and \"one should open one's eyes wide to watch the north.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On June 24, 2011 he called members of the Defense Committee of the puppet National Assembly to Chongwadae where he said he \"regrets so deeply for failing to strike the north during Yonphyong Island shelling.\" He added: I felt surge of anger. Still I can't calm down myself. I can't tolerate.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These are just part of his remarks carried by south Korean media, the white paper said, adding his biggest treason can never be pardoned."

Sobre todo, clasificare lo que debo cumplir ahora y despues y lo que no puedo hacer\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Al pronunciar el discurso de investidura, Lee aclaro su posicion de \"solucionar la politica sobre el Norte no con el ideal, sino con la pauta de pragmatismo\". Y en su \"discurso por el Primero de Marzo\", que acogio por primera vez como presidente, y el acto de nombramiento de los generales del ejercito titere surcoreano efectuado el 3 de abril, dijo que el ideal \"Entre nosotros, los connacionales\" es un \"nacionalismo de estrecha vision\" y \"chovinismo nacional\", agregando que \"con ese ideal no puede solucionar el problema de relaciones Sur-Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Para impedir el dialogo y el avance de relaciones entre el Norte y el Sur, el uso todos los pretextos como la \"renuncia nuclear\", la \"sinceridad\", el \"mantenimiento de principios\" y el \"cambio de la actitud del Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Al recibir el 26 de marzo de 2008 el informe de trabajo del Ministerio de Reunificacion, frustro los proyectos de cooperacion entre ambas partes coreanas hablando de la \"renuncia nuclear, primero\" y la \"entrega desmesurada\" al Norte y el 12 de noviembre,  hablo de que \"estan esperando el cambio de la actitud por el Norte. La espera es tambien una estrategia\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Ademas, no vacilo en pronunciar estas palabras: \"No procederemos a las conversaciones que falten a los principios\", \"Pienso que las relaciones intercoreanas de ahora van en la orbita normal\", \"No me importa que no haya ninguna cumbre S-N durante mi mandato\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Chismeo el 30 de noviembre de 2007 que el \"Norte debe saber que no podria esperar nada si no opta por la cancelacion nuclear, la reforma y la apertura\". En una entrevista de prensa sostenida a principios de febrero de 2008, afirmo que la \"cancelacion nuclear del Norte resulta la mayor premisa de las relaciones S-N\" y definio oficialmente la \"desnuclearizacion, apertura y 3 mil dolares\" como \"politica sobre el Norte\" al pronunciar el discurso de investidura el 25 de febrero de 2008.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　En el discurso de apertura de la 18a \"Asamblea Nacional\" pronunciado el 11 de julio de 2008 y en una rueda de prensa con los medios extranjeros sostenida el 26 de septiembre, el traidor Lee enfatizo que la \"renuncia nuclear del Norte\" es la \"mayor prioridad de la politica sobre el Norte\", \"tarea primordial\", \"asunto mas importante\", etc. De esta manera, expuso mas abiertamente su intento de no dar ni un paso adelante en las relaciones N-S antes de que fuera resuelto el problema nuclear del Norte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　En flagrante violacion de ese principio principal de relaciones intercoreanas y de los Tres Principios de la Reunificacion de la Patria, el traidor Lee Myung Bak persiguio persistentemente el enfrentamiento de sistemas hablando del \"cambio\" y \"apertura\" de alguien y de la \"reunificacion bajo el sistema democratico liberal\". De esta manera, llevo las relaciones Norte-Sur a la fase irremediablemente catastrofica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Ademas, definio la mision y la funcion del Ministerio titere de Reunificacion no como la mejora de relaciones intercoreanas ni la reconciliacion ni la cooperacion, sino como la \"reunificacion mediante la absorcion\". Y movilizo a las escorias humanas de toda calana en el lanzamiento de volantes y la radiodifusion intrigante contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　El 26 de septiembre de 2008, visito el campo de ejercicio de prueba de la artilleria conjunta del ejercito titere surcoreano y alabo a los belicistas militares diciendo que \"En la guerra moderna no hay limites entre el frente y la retaguardia. Es preciso entrar en la disposicion de reaccion perfecta\". El 4 de mayo de 2010, en la reunion de los principales comandantes del ejercito titere y otras ocasiones, les exigio \"establecer la concepcion de enemigo principal\" haciendo referencia al \"estado hostil con el Norte\" y a las \"circunstancias especiales\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　En la declaracion al pueblo sobre el incidente de hundimiento de la corbeta \"Cheonan\", y durante la charla con los compinches del Consejo Consultivo por la Democracia, la Paz y la Reunificacion, el traidor Lee pronuncio un paquete de disparates tales como \"hay que saber que a solo 50 kilometros delante de nosotros esta desplegado el colectivo mas belicoso\", \"se debe tomar una posicion rotunda\", \"no hay que temer a la guerra\" y \"es el momento de actuar en vez de hablar\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　El 23 de noviembre y el 23 de diciembre de 2010 cuando se traslado al puesto de mando del cuartel del Estado Mayor Conjunto del ejercito surcoreano y a una unidad militar en el frente avanzado, dijo otros chismes como \"hay que responder por encima de las normas de beligerancia\", \"es preciso lanzar una gran contraofensiva\", \"le haremos pagar el precio debido\" y \"hay que abrir bien los ojos hacia el Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　El fanatismo por el enfrentamiento y la guerra del traidor Lee se ha constatado el 24 de junio de 2011 cuando dijo ante los miembros de la comision de defensa nacional de la titere Asamblea Nacional, reunidos en Chongwadae, que \"Me ha sido un rencor tremendo que no puedo ahogar todavia el hecho de que no pudimos atacar al Norte durante el fuego artillero en la isla Yonphyong. Casi me reventaba de colera. Es insoportable\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Los disparates de Lee mencionados hasta ahora no pasan de ser una parte de lo publicado en las publicaciones surcoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　El ejercito y el pueblo de la RPDC enjuiciaran sin falta, junto con todos los coreanos, a la camarilla del vendepatria Lee Myung Bak por sus imperdonables e inauditos crimenes de traicion"

            "content": "Conversaciones \"2+2\" para la  alianza militar, comentario de ATCC\r\nPyongyang, 7 de julio (ATCC) -- Hace poco, se realizo en Washington, Estados Unidos, la reunion del comite consultivo por la seguridad Estados Unidos-Japon con la participacion de los secretarios de Estado y de Defensa de EE.UU. y los ministros de Relaciones Exteriores y de Defensa de Japon, o sea, las conversaciones \"2+2\". \n\t\t\t\t\t　En la ocasion ambas partes fijaron la \"meta estrategica conjunta\" de frenar las \"provocaciones del Norte de Corea\" y fortalecer el sistema de cooperacion por la seguridad con el Sur de Corea y Australia frente a la \"situacion de seguridad incierta\" de la region de Asia-Pacifico. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　El hecho muestra que EE.UU. impulsa persistentemente los preparativos para fundar una alianza militar al estilo de OTAN con el designio de aplastar a la RPDC, baluarte del socialismo y de la independencia antiimperialista en la region de Asia-Pacifico y resistir a los \"rivales potenciales\" como China.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Ademas, el imperio tiene el calculo estrategico de modificar a su favor la estructura politico-militar de esta region para realizar la ambicion hegemonica. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　En el nuevo siglo, en la region de Asia-Pacifico surgieron China, la India y otros paises como  potencias emergentes alcanzando simultaneamente el desarrollo vertiginoso. Y el centro politico, economico y militar del mundo se traslada desde Europa a esta region. En especial, se agranda cada dia mas la influencia economica de los paises emergentes de esta region a los aliados de EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Tales hechos pueden debilitar el dominio de EE.UU. sobre esta region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　En el informe de estrategia sobre Asia, publicado en mayo de 2001, EE.UU. presento como nueva meta estrategica fundar la alianza militar capaz de contener a los \"rivales potenciales\" regionales como China y controlar a Japon, el Sur de Corea y otros paises aliados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Durante un decenio desde entonces, vino acelerando sistematicamente la fundacion de la \"OTAN de cuno asiatico\" tomando por nucleo la alianza con Japon, el Sur de Corea y Australia e incorporando hasta los paises de Asia oriental. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Puso en funcionamiento el dialogo tripartito por la seguridad con Japon y Australia, permitio intencionalmente la salida militar a ultramar de Japon y desarrollo las conversaciones \"2+2\" como un eslabon para restringir perpetuamente a Japon. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Bajo el pretexto de la \"prevencion de proliferacion de armas de exterminio masivo\", se entrego a los ejercicios militares para perfeccionar el sistema de cooperacion militar multinacional en la region de Asia-Pacifico. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Como resultado, aparecio en esta region la \"OTAN de cuno asiatico\" como una nueva estructura de seguridad multinacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El movimiento hegemonico de EE.UU. provoca una gran preocupacion del mundo por su peligrosidad que pueda acarrear una nueva guerra fria. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El siglo pasado dejo a la historia la amarga leccion de que la guerra fria conlleva la guerra caliente y trae la consecuencia catastrofica a la paz y la estabilidad del mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Las guerras desatadas en el ambito mundial durante la guerra fria como la coreana, la vietnamita, la Iran-Iraq, la afgana, etc., causaron incontables sufrimientos y perdidas a muchos paises y naciones y violaron gravemente la paz y la estabilidad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  No se ha eliminado todavia la consecuencia de la guerra fria y se agrava cada dia mas la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana y de otras varias regiones. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  EE.UU. pretende fabricar una nueva alianza militar tomando el Nordeste Asiatico como escenario principal con el fin de utilizarlo como brigada de choque de la agresion contra la RPDC y como un aparato para cercar y controlar a los \"rivales ocultos\" como China. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esto acarreara una consecuencia irremediable a todo el mundo, incluso la region de Asia-Pacifico, que se hace el centro estrategico del siglo XXI.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Las maniobras de las fuerzas hegemonicas que persiguen la confrontacion y la guerra, a contrapelo de la tendencia hacia la paz, el desarrollo y la cooperacion, despiertan la conciencia de los paises regionales y seran inevitablemente fracasadas por su caracter reaccionario e imprudente."
