It is an open revelation of the sinister \r\nintention to disunite the socialism of the DPRK from within.\r\n   The broadcasting of the radio in Korean indicates that \r\nthe united states has not renounced its policy of \r\nantagonising and stifling the DPRK and is pursuing it in a \r\nmore undisguised way.\r\n   Although the United States broadcasts American values and \r\nYankee culture over \"Radio Free Asia\", it has no effect on \r\nthe Korean people.\r\n   The Korean people have a history and culture of five \r\nthousand years and the most advanced political philosophy in \r\nthe world and bring into full play socialist national \r\nculture. They have long since despised American \"values\" and \r\ndecadent Yankee culture.\r\n   The hard-fought Fatherland Liberation War against U.S.-\r\nled imperialist allied forces was a showdown of strength as \r\nwell as a showdown of ideologies and culture. During the \r\nwar, the Korean people confirmed the true values of their \r\nideology and culture and, at the same time, the reactionary \r\nand immoral nature of American \"values\" and culture.\r\n   No one can deny that South Korean society has turned into \r\na den of criminals under the sway of corruption and social \r\nvices such as the Hanbo incident because of the influence of \r\nthe 50 odd years of U.S. military occupation and American \r\n\"values\" and decadent culture.\r\n   No matter what false propaganda the United States may \r\nspread over \"Radio Free Asia,\" the Korean people will feel \r\nstronger wrath and hatred for the U.S. And harden their \r\nconfidence in their ideology, culture and cause. \r\n\r\n"
