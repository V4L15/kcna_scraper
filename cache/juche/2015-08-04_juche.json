They went the lengths of asserting that the DPRK is resorting to \"hostage diplomacy\" as a tactical measure to take the initiative at the negotiations under the situation where the DPRK is playing a tug of war in the relations with south Korea and the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These remarks are nothing but sophism of those who have guilty conscience.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet authorities and the U.S. have always been behind those forces engaged in extreme hostile acts against the DPRK in all realms of politics, economy and military. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Rim acted an anti-communist maniac and a member of a shock force for the confrontation with the fellow countrymen in the north at the risk of his life under the mask of religion as he was under the dark tentacles of the south Korean puppet authorities and the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He perpetrated such high treason as hurling mud at the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and its social system, hatching a plot to bring down the state, creating distrust and bitterness toward the DPRK through sheer lies and fabrications, frauds, deception and speculations and conducting crafty operations to lure and abduct citizens of the DPRK, pursuant to the scenarios of south Korean puppet authorities and the U.S. for confrontation with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet authorities will not dare deny these facts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those guilty deserve punishment. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was not \"unreasonable\" but quite natural that the wicked elements were detected and arrested as they tried to destabilize and overthrow the DPRK. They admitted and confessed to their crimes, though belatedly. They did not do so under \"duress.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet forces are impudently falsifying this stark reality, a proof that they are diehard criminals steeped in plots and fabrications to the marrow of their bones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said sophism would only add to their crimes."

Consequently, the south Korean industry was reduced to a dependent sub-contract industry and a processing base bringing huge profits to the Group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lurking behind the \"economic cooperation\" between the Park Chung-hee regime and Mitsubishi was a political and business nexus, the daily notes, adding that a lot of things still remain shrouded in mists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This information brought to light the true colors of Park Chung-hee as a pro-Japanese lackey.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Mitsubishi should have been sternly punished together with war criminals in the very day of Japan's defeat for the crimes it perpetrated by actively supporting the regime's war of aggression and inflicting untold pain and damage upon Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But traitor Park made no scruple of joining hands with Mitsubishi in a bid to stay in power and meet his personal interests, far from forcing it to make apology and reparation for the crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Moreover, Park also received 1.2 million U.S. dollars from the Mitsui Group during the 1963 \"presidential election\" and billions of yen from Japanese businesses during the 1971 \"presidential election\" as \"political fund\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He committed an act of treachery by concluding a shackling \"agreement\" with Japan in 1965, which helped nearly 100 businesses and agencies of the latter strike their roots among the economic arteries of south Korea in 1966.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When recalling the fact that Mitsubishi plundered resources worth at least 32. 1 million U.S. dollars in south Korea in 1970 alone, it is not hard to guess how big profits all the Japanese businesses in south Korea have raked up there so far.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Hye is as wicked traitor as her father.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark Geun Hye is openly talking about \"normalization of relations\" with Japan which has desperately refused to make an apology and reparation for its past crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She is behaving quite contrary to the enmity running high among all Koreans toward Japan, saying \"this year would be a significant one for improving south Korea-Japan relations.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean regime did not utter even a word of protest when Japanese Prime Minister Abe was so arrogant as to bluster that the issue of comfort women can be settled by paying about three hundred million yen and south Korea would hold out its hands first if Japan remains tough in its stand. It also kept mum when Japan conducted open diplomacy to have its past industrial establishments registered as world cultural heritages though a lot of Koreans were forced to do slave labor there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently, Mitsubishi refused to make reparation for the loss suffered by Koreans who had been forced to do slave labor during the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule over Korea, asserting \"compensation had already been made through the conclusion of the 1965 agreement on claims.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the Park Geun Hye regime is keeping mum about it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Against this backdrop, the regime began sharing even military information about the DPRK with Japan, holding in real earnest meetings of various fields including diplomacy, military and economy with Japan at the instigation of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The regime's sycophancy toward Japan is, indeed, the most humiliating act of sycophancy and hideous act of treachery putting into the shade not only traitor Park Chung-hee but also the five traitors of 1905.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As Hankuk Ilbo took issue with the past conservative ruler's sycophancy toward Japan, terming it a \"matter that should not be overlooked\", what Park Chung-hee and Park Geun Hye committed should be strictly investigated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should be sternly punished by the nation for kissing Japan, the sworn enemy."

Lurking behind it is a cynical ploy to implant the anti-DPRK sentiment into the minds of Americans and hurl them into shambles of war to realize its ambition for aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is, however, a daydream.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Aggressors would only meet death as proved by the history of confrontation between the DPRK and the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. had better stop foolish behavior, drawing a lesson from its history of defeat in the standoff with the DPRK."
