This is also beneficial to itself. Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an urgent task raised by the times and a moral and historic commitment for those countries which did wrongs in the past to honestly admit and repent of them and make reparation for them in the new century. Precisely for this reason it has become a global trend for those countries to redress their past wrongs. And any action taken in this respect is earning sympathy from the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article cites facts to prove that the Japanese imperialists' invasion of Korea was a crime unprecedented in the world history. Japan has committed so many hideous crimes against the Korean nation for a historically long period that it should kneel before it a hundred times to make adequate reparation for them, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is insisting that it cannot make any reparation or compensation for its crimes because Japan and Korea were not at war in the past. This is a far-fetched assertion and sheer nonsense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Japan invaded Korea by force of arms and occupied it to annex it to her by force of arms. It enforced a colonial rule over Korea at the point of bayonet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people emerged victorious in the war against Japan because they waged a hard-fought war of resistance against the Japanese imperialists for a long period under the uplifted banner of the anti-Japanese war commanded by President Kim Il Sung, winning a shining victory over the Japanese imperialists in August 1945. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Clear is the reason why Japan is so persistently evading its responsibility to make reparation for its past crimes, disregarding and negating the above-said historical facts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not a simple economic issue for the DPRK to get reparation from Japan. This is an important political matter related to the dignity of the nation and its sovereign right and a crucial issue of foiling Japan's wild ambition for reinvasion and preserving peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some circles of Japan, however, claim that the DPRK is demanding Japan make reparation for its past wrongs for an economic reason, but this is nothing but a ridiculous jargon. The Korean people have lived on so far without the help of Japan and can do so in the future, too. What Japan has brought to them is nothing but great misfortune, sufferings and disasters. In fact, had Japan not been situated so close to Korea, the Korean nation would not have been invaded by Japs nor would have undergone such sufferings under their colonial rule but would have made several times faster progress than now. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a matter of fact, the Japanese imperialists committed indescribably enormous and fatal losses, mental, manpower and material, against the Korean people. Japan would be well advised to be guilt-conscious and pay a price for its past crimes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

And he did his utmost to increase the military capabilities all his life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to him, the truth was proven that single-minded unity is essential to building a rich and powerful nation. Under his leadership the unity of the party, the army and the people was achieved on the highest level and the People's Army grown to be an invincible army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history in which the President led the DPRK to victory and prosperity with his rare far-sightedness is the history that can be made only by the peerlessly great man, the peerless patriot. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said in his lifetime, \"Kim Jong Il's era is glorious at present and it will become a more brilliant and prosperous era in the future.\" This prediction has come to a proud reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will prosper forever as the President opened up the road of victory for it with his far-sightedness and General Secretary Kim Jong Il is glorifying it with his rare political caliber.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

La RPDC ha vivido hasta la fecha sin la ayuda de Japon y puede hacerlo tambien en lo adelante. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Lo que ha dado Japon a la nacion coreana es incontables desgracias, calamidades y desastres. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSi no hubiera este vecino malvado, la nacion coreana no habria sufrido la invasion japonesa ni la dominacion colonial, al contrario, habria logrado un avance y desarrollo mucho mas rapidos y grandes que ahora. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Japon debera sentirse culpable de todos los danos espirituales, humanos y materiales hechos al pueblo coreano y pagarlos.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
