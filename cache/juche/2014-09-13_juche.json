            "content": "S. Korean Authorities Urged to Show Sincerity for Improving Inter-Korean Relations\r\n Pyongyang, September 13 (KCNA) -- Recently the south Korean authorities vociferated about achieving the reconciliation and unity between the north and the south and repairing the relations through \"confidence-building\" in each public appearance.\n\t\t\t\t\t They called for resuming the north-south high-level contact as early as possible, asserting that \"the improvement of the relations\" is urgent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the north side's delegation to the north-south high-level contact in a statement on Saturday termed this nothing but a hypocritical act of mocking at the nation and deceiving the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is evidenced by the anti-DPRK psychological campaigns including ever-more undisguised leaflet scattering operations, the statement noted, and went on: The south Korean authorities have become evermore frantic in their anti-DPRK leaflet scattering operations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are driving the present inter-Korean relations into a deeper mire of catastrophe.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We have already declared solemnly that the scattering of leaflets is the most undisguised practice of the psychological warfare, a gross violation of the national agreement, an open confrontation with the DPRK and an action to provoke a war against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south side will find no excuse even in case the Korean People's Army deals a retaliatory blow at any target any time to frustrate the \"balloon operation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The KPA does not hide the fact that it is determined to wipe out \"the source of psychological warfare and forces supporting and commanding it\" at once in case the leaflet scattering operation kicks off.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The north-south relations can never be improved by empty words and deceptive wordplays.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a great historic cause of the nation which can be accomplished only through sincere practical actions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is crystal clear to all that the north-south relations can never be mended with such stand and attitude as throwing away like a pair of old shoes even the agreement reached with the special mandate given by the top leader as what is happening at present.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the primary requirement for improving the inter-Korean ties to uproot the south Korean authorities' true colors as diehard confrontation elements.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In other words, they should halt before anything else such anti-DPRK psychological warfare as leaflet-scattering operations at once.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should not forget that their priority task is to have elementary decency to appear before the north's delegates before repeatedly calling for the above-said contact.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We would like to reassure them that the door will automatically open for the dialogue between the north and the south if such actions of confrontation as leaflet-scattering operations stop. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will continue to closely follow the attitude of the south Korean authorities."

It reflects the characteristics of the socialist system, human rights policy pursued in the DPRK and the actual human rights performance in the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t The world is showing increasing concern for human rights issue and there are widespread actions for genuine human rights in all fabrics of social life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is getting all the more undisguised on the international arena at present are political pressures on specified countries and attempts at interference in the internal affairs of those countries by abusing the inviolable human rights. A typical example is the vicious human rights racket against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hostile forces are persistently peddling the \"human rights issue\" in the DPRK in a bid to tarnish its image and bring down the social system and ideology chosen by the Korean people. They are becoming all the more undisguised in these moves as the days go by.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Wild rumors and fictions about the DPRK are afloat in the international community due to the hostile forces' despicable human rights racket to slander and hurt the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under this situation the DPRK Association for Human Rights Studies released a report on human rights performance in the country to help the public properly know about the efforts exerted by the DPRK to protect and promote human rights and about the actual human rights performance and lay bare the false and reactionary nature of the reckless anti-DPRK \"human rights\" racket kicked up by the hostile forces and thus wipe out the prejudice and misunderstanding.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The five-chapter all-inclusive report was worked out with the cooperation among several domestic institutions and NGO organizations, academic institutions and human rights experts in various fields.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The first chapter deals with the ideological foundation of the state human rights system as regards the human rights system in the DPRK and the course of its formation and development.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The second chapter deals with all legal and practical measures taken by the state after the foundation of the country to guarantee the rights of people and protect and promote them and human rights enjoyed by the citizens.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The third and fourth chapters deal with the stand and efforts made by the DPRK for human rights in the world and major difficulties lying in the way of guaranteeing human rights in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The fifth chapter deals with data studied by the Association as regards the prospect for guaranteeing human rights in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As mentioned in the report, the DPRK has consistently enforced policies for the people from the very day of its foundation on the principle of putting the rights and interests of the popular masses above all and making them absolute and has exerted every possible effort to guarantee the people genuine rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the people in the DPRK, therefore, feel proud of the world's most advantageous human rights system and policies such as universal compulsory education, free medical care and free provision of housings that are enforced in the country, and are striving hard to defend and further consolidate the man-centered socialist system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By clearly reflecting the human rights system and situation in the DPRK, the report proves that the anti-DPRK human rights campaign of the U.S. and hostile forces is acts detrimental to guaranteeing and promoting the rights of the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The report also clarifies the efforts and stand of the DPRK on international cooperation for promoting human rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Consistent is the stand of the DPRK to have genuine dialogue and cooperation in the field of human rights and contribute to promoting human rights in the world. The DPRK has never opposed dialogue on human rights but maintained the stand to have a candid exchange of views with the countries truly concerned for the human rights issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But genuine human rights dialogue and cooperation have not been effected due to those forces abusing the human rights issue as a means for attaining such sinister politically-motivated purposes as interference in internal affairs and overturn of social systems.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The release of the study report on the human rights situation in the country is an indication of its will to creditably fulfill its responsibility in the field of human rights and a positive measure to promote international cooperation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The report will help clearly understand how false and unrealistic the rumors about the DPRK floated by hostile forces on the basis of fabrications.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The major source of misinformation about human rights performance in the DPRK are \"testimonies\" notably made by anti-DPRK fanatics who defected from the north. Those who cook up groundless stories about human rights to get a petty amount of money are without exception criminals who fled to the south for fear of facing a legal punishment after committing indelible crimes in their hometowns and immoral guys who are disqualified to talk about human rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their inhuman nature will be disclosed sooner or later.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whoever echoes what was uttered by the riff-raffs even after reading the report released by the Association must be imbeciles lacking the ability to judge the reality or tricksters seeking to attain sinister purposes even by making far-fetched assertions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and other Western countries should not pull up the DPRK over its human rights but face up to the situation as it is and repent of their own poor human rights records.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will continue to exert its utmost efforts to foil the anti-DPRK human rights campaign of the hostile forces and meet all their challenges, step up the peaceful economic construction, steadily improve the people's living standard and thus provide the people with better conditions for enjoying their rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The report will help set right the wrong views by widely introducing the DPRK's human rights policies and situation and contribute to promoting genuine cooperation in the field of human rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The full text of the report is posted on www.kcna.kp and www.naenara.com, internet homepages."

It reflects the characteristics of the socialist system of the DPRK, its human rights policy and actual human rights performance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and its followers, steeped in repugnancy toward the DPRK, faked up an \"investigation committee\", not content with pulling up it over its \"human rights issue\". They prodded the \"committee\" into releasing a \"report\" based on false data cooked up by riff-raffs, further intensifying the anti-DPRK \"human rights\" campaign.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The report made public by the \"Committee for Investigating Human Rights Situation in Korea\" is no more than a dead document as it is peppered with \"testimonies\" made by swindlers who \"defected from the north,\" speculation and enmity, not mentioning the human rights policy and mechanisms in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that the hostile forces are abusing the human rights issue to tarnish the image of the dignified DPRK and emasculate the idea and social system chosen by the Korean people, the Association released the report to probe the truth and properly inform the world of the actual human rights performance in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The report gives historical, comprehensive and systemic account of all consistent efforts made by the DPRK to let the people enjoy genuine human rights while giving top priority to the rights and interests of the popular people and absolutizing them since its foundation. It also discloses that the anti-DPRK human rights campaign by the U.S. and other hostile forces is an act of encroaching upon the human rights of the people of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The report also clarifies the DPRK's stand on the international cooperation for protecting and promoting human rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What the DRPK has opposed is the human rights dialogue which was used by some states as a means to realize their vicious political purposes such as interference in other's internal affairs and act to topple governments. The DPRK has made sincere efforts for the international cooperation in the field of human rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The report was worked out with positive cooperation among domestic institutions, NGOs, academic organizations, human rights experts in various fields and individual citizens of the DPRK. It will be conducive to make the world have a clear understanding of the DPRK's human rights policy and mechanisms and know about the deceptive and reactionary nature of the anti-DPRK human rights campaign by the hostile forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will as ever do its best to lay bare and frustrate the anti-DPRK human rights campaign by the hostile forces and provide the people with better conditions to enjoy human rights, and promote the international dialogue and cooperation for ensuring the genuine human rights."

The U.S. and the south Korean forces have become all the more undisguised in their moves to deploy THAAD in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on this, Minju Joson Saturday says this is a dangerous military nexus to render the situation in and around the Korean peninsula extremely tense and push the north-south relations to a catastrophe.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korea-U.S. \"Combined Forces Command\" is a mechanism for aggression against the DPRK.

Korean Authorities to Roll back Its Anachronistic Policy of Confrontation\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, September 13 (KCNA) -- South Korean authorities are now paying lip-service to \"improved south-north relations\" but, in actuality, persisting in their reckless acts of fostering hostility and confrontation with the DPRK, says Rodong Sinmun Saturday in an article.\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean regime's policy of confrontation with the DPRK is a source of bedeviling the inter-Korean ties, the article notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should roll back their policy of confrontation as the first step for mending the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such a policy is nothing good for the Korean nation as it faithfully serves the purpose of foreign forces' policy of aggression against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean authorities truly stand for confidence and dialogue between the north and the south, they should take the practical action to drop the anti-reunification policy of confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If they want to have dialogue, they should have negotiations for implementing the north-south declarations. If they want to have talks, they should have negotiations for substantially defusing the distrust and confrontation between the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is all Koreans who are responsible for resolving the issue of inter-Korean ties and defusing the tensions on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All Koreans in the north, the south and abroad should turn out full of confidence in the struggle to frustrate the anti-reunification forces' moves for confrontation with the fellow countrymen in the north and accomplish the cause of national reunification as early as possible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet regime is persistently pursuing the policy of confrontation, going against the trend of the times and the desire of all Koreans. This is as foolish an act as precipitating its ruin."
