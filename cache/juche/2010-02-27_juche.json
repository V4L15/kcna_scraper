Paektu area and gradually extending the armed struggle to the homeland for the purpose of escalating the anti-Japanese national liberation struggle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also put forward new strategic policies of forming a permanent united front body and effecting an upsurge in the overall Korean revolution centering on the anti-Japanese armed struggle in order to put the movement of the anti-Japanese national united front on a new stage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Reflected in the policies are his steadfast independent stand and patriotic spirit of accomplishing the Korean revolution in a responsible manner and his strong will to liberate the country with the effort of the Korean people by uniting all the anti-Japanese patriotic forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Juche-based policies made it possible for the Korean people to subdue the Japanese imperialists. They also defeated the U.S. imperialists who boasted of being \"the strongest\" in the world and turned the country into a powerful nation independent, self-sufficient and self-reliant in defence by successfully carrying out two stages of social revolution, two times of rehabilitation and construction and different stages of socialist construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In particular, the DPRK advanced triumphantly along the road of socialism in the face of manifold trials and challenges in the latter half of the 20th century when the U.S. imperialists were intensifying anti-DPRK moves as never before. All the successes are the fruition of the independent stand that the Korean people regard as their life and soul. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean people are now pushing ahead with the building of a thriving nation under the banner of Juche."
