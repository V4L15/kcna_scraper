What is all the more ridiculous is the fact that he showed up at a ceremony and praised its \"exploits.\"\r\n   The commander of the U.S. armed forces present in South Korea holds the prerogative of supreme command over the army.\r\n   In the past 50 years, the army has served the outside forces as a tool for executing their aggressive policy and murdered fellow countrymen= it has hurt the sovereignty and dignity of the nation and imposed only misfortune and sufferings upon people.\r\n   Nevertheless, the chief executive of South Korea praised its \"contribution\" and \"exploits.\" this is a mockery of and challenge to the nation.\r\n   Cooperation with outsiders is an anti-national, anti-reunification crime going against the interests of the nation.\r\n   We once again warn the South Korean rulers that if they cannot defend the sovereignty, the lifeline of the country and nation, and take the road of independence, they must follow us, who are powerfully advancing under the banner of independence. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Therefore, it is a proper behaviour consistent with the trend of times for the United States to turn the suffocation policy into apeace one.\r\n   Circumstances in which the United States can abandon the policy have already been created.\r\n   For the U.S. to abandon the policy and take the road to peace is a very natural and welcome thing.\r\n   But if the United States turns its face from the demand of times and people, pushes ahead with the policy to stifle the DPRK and persists in military adventure, a war will inevitably break out in Korea.\r\n   The DPRK hopes for peace but never begs for it.\r\n   The United States should change the policy of stifling the DPRK into a peace one and show its will for peace to the world. \r\n\r\n"

Through all sorts of submissive \"treaties\" and \"agreements\" it has seized the right to operational command and administration jurisdiction of the \"rok\" army. \r\nIt exercises control over planning,  performance of operations, personnel, information, troop information and education, munitions, economy and living quarters of the \"rok\" army through the U.S. forces command in South Korea.\r\n   The past 50 years of the \"rok\" army, colonial mercenary army for U.S. Korean peninsula strategy, is a history of indelible crimes against the nation.\r\n   The \"rok\" army, a war servant of the United States, murdered fellow countrymen and turned the whole country into debris during the three-year war.\r\n   After the June 25 war, it employed every conceivable means to launch another war against the north on the Korean peninsula. Clamouring for \"superiority of strength\" over the north, it has systematically reinforced the armed forces, artificially aggravated the situation on the peninsula and cast a chill over the nation's ardent desire for reconciliation, unity and peaceful reunification.\r\n   It has served as cannon fodder in the overseas aggression war of the United States.\r\n   The 50 years since the setup of the \"rok\" army is a crime-woven history when it has ruthlessly obliterated the people's movement for independence, democracy and Reunification, regarding the people as the \"enemy\" in order to protect the U.S. colonial rule and the interests of the U.S. monopoly capital, a history of curse in which its uniforms are stained with the blood of people. \r\n   It is also the anti-national, anti-people crime-woven  history of the U.S. colonial mercenaries, and 50 years of disgrace. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
