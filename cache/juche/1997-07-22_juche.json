In mid-July, it also alleged that the DPRK exported food it received from other country as assistance. The food in question was 1,300 tons of Chinese-produced maize carried to Japan via the DPRK by a contract with a Japanese stock breeder.\r\n   We have never thought that the Sankei Shimbun, which has long engaged in anti-DPRK propaganda, would say something in favor of the DPRK. We have already spat at the daily with no sense of justice and impartiality.\r\n   The world food programme and other international organizations and donator nations have rendered humanitarian assistance with sincerity to our people, who have been suffering food shortage caused by floods.\r\n   However, the Sankei Shimbun, far from sympathizing with our people in hard time, slandered our country with the false reports. It is really an inhuman, despicable act of those, with no elementary ethics and morality, tryinging to insult our people and obstruct international humanitarian activities.\r\n   The Sankei Shimbun's persistent anti-DPRK propoaganda has only shown its immorality to the international community and has become a target of world public condemnation. \r\n\r\n"

The groundless allegation was carried by the south Korean newspaper Donga Ilbo next day.\r\n   The Sankei Shimbun's false report was only aimed at slandering the DPRK and hurting its international prestige.\r\n   We can never allow the Sankei Shimbun to maliciously abusing the DPRK.\r\n   The false report is what the south Korean Agency for National Security Planning invented in conspiracy with the Japanese newspaper.\r\n   The Sankei Shimbun, in the hope of giving authenticity to the fiction, quoted testimonies of those who defected to south Korea from the north after committing crimes. But the sources are too despicable and poor fellows.\r\n   It is nobody's secret that the defectors can only say as told by the ANSP.\r\n   From this point of view, we can see how faithful the Sankei Shimbun is to the ANSP.\r\n   Counterfeit notes and goods are things available in such corrupt society governed by jungle law as Japan and south Korea.\r\n   Such things are unimaginable in our socialist society replete with justice and benevolence, society where the people are the masters of the country and constitute a great harmonious family.\r\n   We have no such plants as the Phyongsong trademark plant, the February Wonbit Trading Company and the liaison office No. 101 which the Sankei Shimbun described as dollar counterfeiting plants.\r\n   Obviously, they are bogus plants, brainchilds of the ANSP.\r\n   It is south Korea that tops the world's list of counterfeit and forgery.\r\n   It is an undeniable fact that south Korea's is a puppet regime faked up by the United States and Kim Young Sam could become its president with lies and through fraudulent elections.\r\n   South Korea is the kingdom of forgery which is inundated by counterfeit money, advertisements, drugs, foodstuff, etc.\r\n   Dollar counterfeiting plants and fake notes are what can be seen in such society as south Korea.\r\n   The Sankei Shimbun, oblivious of the duty and mission of the press, has nothing to get but miserable end.\r\n   The plot-breeding newspaper had better surrender itself to justice. \r\n\r\n"

Indeed, it is base and foolish.\r\n   I think the time has come for Kim Young Sam to die.

            "content": "Despicable drama\r\n Pyongyang, July 22 (KCNA) -- The Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation broadcast a commentary titled clumsy drama today.\r\n   The radio said:\r\n   The traitors of the south Korean Agency for National Security Planning (ANSP) have spread the rumor that the north sent terrorists to Seoul to kill Hwang Jang Yop.\r\n   Like Hwang's recent press conference, the drama, played by the headquarters of anti-north plots with the mobilization of all schemers, is so despicable that it deserves world public ridicule and condemnation.\r\n   It is nonsense that the north is trying to assassinate Hwang.\r\n   The north has already stricken his name off the list of the nation, the list of human beings because he is a lunatic who defected from the homeland where he, though he is a son of a landlord, was given an opportunity to study abroad and worked as Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea Central Committee.\r\n   The north feels it unnecessary to devote efforts to killing Hwang, who is almost dead body in view of his crimes against the country and the nation and in view of ethics and morality.\r\n   If the north had intention to assassinate him, it would have done so in Beijing or the Philippines.\r\n   But the north let the coward go his own way, feeling relieved.\r\n   In other words, garbage was cleared from the room.\r\n   Then, can there be any reason for the north to do such a thing now as assassinating Hwang, who has been confined in a remote place of the ANSP under strict cordon?\r\n   From this point of view, the rumor is only a fiction without any authenticity and an advance arrangement by the plot-breeding tool for playing a drama.\r\n   It is not the north but Kim Young Sam and the ANSP that are troubling themselves over Hwang's defection.\r\n   When Hwang was brought to Seoul, Kim Young Sam and the ANSP were very happy as if they won a big thing. But they have been eventually disappointed, finding that they have nothing to get from the lunatic's thoughtless words.\r\n   As all our people watched, Hwang, after being trained in confinement by the ANSP for more than two months, appeared at a press conference, but read with halting articulation even what was written by others and incoherently answered questions, making a show of himself. And his remarks were full of contradictions so that his press conference itself did more harm than good and resulted in fueling public distrust in the ANSP.\r\n   Worse still, Hwang is suffering from persecution mania, feeling bored with a solitary and lonely life at a ANSP place and also feeling headache over the crimes he committed against the nation. He is now in a miserable condition.\r\n   This is why the ANSP, thinking that if it keeps Hwang alive, it will be frowned at and finally have to treat with the dead body, intends to kill him and use his death in the anti-north propaganda by describing it as a making of the north.\r\n   The fiction about the dispatch of the north's agents and terrorists to Seoul is part of this scheme.\r\n   The ANSP, in the hope of making the fiction sound real, had an alert order issued to the police throughout south Korea.\r\n   But this drama is not worth notice.\r\n   They invented such fictions of terrorism and infiltration of terrorists in the August 15 shooting incident and the 88 Olympiad.\r\n   It is also south Korea that kidnapped Kim Dae Jung in Tokyo and had loudly advertized it as a making of the north until it was left with no other choice but setting him free in Seoul.\r\n   All the rumors about the north's terrorism spread by the ANSP ended with our people knowing that they were its own making.\r\n   Hwang will be killed soon by the ANSP.\r\n   Our people are now seeing a bullet the ANSP is firing.\r\n   Hwang's press conference was the first act and his assassination will be the second act.\r\n   The rumor about the dispatch of the north's terrorists to Seoul is just a prelude to the second act. With such a clumsy drama, however, can they never fool our people. Kim Young Sam, in the grip of a serious crisis, and the ANSP are escalating the anti-north smear campaign in a bid to find a way out. But our people are totally disillusioned with the smear campaign and bitterly condemn them.\r\n   History shows well that the end of those engaging in the anti-north plots has always been miserable and disgraceful.\r\n   History makes no exceptions to Kim Young Sam and the ANSP. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
