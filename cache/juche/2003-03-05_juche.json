Paektu whose servicemen have been revolutionized and are filled with socialist patriotism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-Japanese guerrilla trait of training should be established throughout the army and all its units and sub-units should carry out Kim Jong Il's orders for training, true to the party's five-point policy of training and the four-point principle of training and thereby emerge O Jung Hup's regiments today with invincible combat capability, he stressed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Speakers at the meeting called for advancing dynamically, giving fuller play to the spirit of the army of Mt. Paektu to glorify the 21st century as Kim Jong Il's century under his army-based leadership, holding aloft the banner of devotedly defending the leader.    \r\n\r\n"

Korean conservatives' anti-north burlesque \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 4 (KCNA) -- The General Freedom Federation and other ultra-right conservative organizations in South Korea held \"Citizens' Rally for Freedom and Reunification on the Occasion of March 1\" in Seoul on March 1 at which they demanded \"opposition to the cut down in the U.S. Forces and their redeployment and the north's nuclear development,\" according to South Korean KBS.\r\n The Koreans waged nationwide anti-Japanese resistance calling for the liberation of the country 84 years ago. On this historic day those forces staged the political charade intended to beg for the outside forces' continued presence in South Korea and incite north-south confrontation slandering the fellow countrymen, toeing the U.S. line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This cannot but be an insult to the anti-Japanese patriotic forerunners and a challenge to all the Koreans in their efforts to achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the country by the efforts of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such anti-national, sycophantic and treacherous burlesque staged at a time when the South Koreans' anti-Americanism is running high and there is growing awareness of independence among them with GIs' murder of schoolgirls as a momentum only lashes the Korean nation into a great fury. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nation is censuring this rowdyism supporting the U.S. reckless moves as a thrice-cursed crime as this was committed at a time when it is deeply concerned about the very dangerous  situation prevailing on the Korean Peninsula where a nuclear war may break out any moment due to the U.S. nuclear racket and large-scale joint military exercises. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a serious attention is that they are beating the outdated drum of \"theory of reunification under a liberal system\" to vitiate the hard-won atmosphere of reconciliation, cooperation, unity and reunification between the north and the south of Korea after the publication of the historic June 15 Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By \"the theory of reunification under a liberal system\" they mean, in essence, reunifying the country by armed forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are crying out for a fratricidal war, repeating the \"theory\" which had already been thrown into the garbage ground of history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is nothing but last-ditch efforts of those who have lived out their days. On February 10 they had a confab to prepare a rally on March 1 at which they staged an anti-DPRK smear campaign slandering the political system in the DPRK over its \"nuclear issue\" and \"issue of remittance to the north.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is intolerable is that the motley crew who gathered there let loose a string of vituperations against the dignified political system in the DPRK, saying that \"it is developing nuclear weapons against the fellow countrymen\" and \"it seeks to break South Korea-U.S. alliance by launching an anti-American propaganda campaign.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These vituperations are just an echo of the remarks made by the U.S. conservative hardliners, the author of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, in a bid  to cover up their criminal intention to  isolate and stifle the DPRK, launch a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula and bring a nuclear holocaust to the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This goes to prove that the ultra-right conservative forces in South Korea are just parroting what their American master  says. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the irresistible trend of the times to go in for independence against the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ultra-right conservative forces in South Korea will have to pay a very high price for their pro-U.S. flunkeyism and anti-reunification treacherous acts and will be compelled to dig their own graves in the long run.    \r\n\r\n"

Herein lie the security, dignity and reunification of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It is the spirit and patriotic tradition of our nation that all the fellow countrymen rose up in the patriotic struggle against the outside forces whenever the nation's destiny was endangered by outside forces.

The U.S. imperialists' launching of the exercise is an open challenge to the Korean nation and the world peace-loving people the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No one can vouch that the U.S. imperialists will not make a preemptive attack on the DPRK while launching the exercise involving huge forces enough to go to war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that in case the \"Foal Eagle\" exercise leads to a war against the DPRK a nuclear war breaks out and all the Korean people in the north and the south can not escape nuclear holocaust. At this critical juncture the entire Korean nation in the north and the south and abroad should turn out in the anti-U.S., anti-war and anti-nuclear struggle to save the destiny of the country and the nation from the crisis. The South Korean warlike forces should stop at once their treacherous moves to have recourse to the outside forces to make a showdown with the fellow countrymen, mindful that joining in the U.S. moves to provoke a war against the north is an unpardonable crime of inflicting nuclear disaster upon the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a miscalculation for the U.S. imperialists to try to invade the north with the exercise as a momentum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean warhawks should stop the \"Foal Eagle\" exercise at once, mindful of the consequences to be entailed by their moves to provoke a war against the north.    \r\n\r\n"
