Leader Kim Jong Il is now successfully applying in practice the Juche idea fathered by President Kim Il Sung in the period of the anti-Japanese struggle, he added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pavel Bilevski, scientific secretary of the association, noted that the liberation of Korea fully demonstrated the personality of Kim Il Sung, a genius of general type both in name and reality, and set a brilliant example of applying to the reality the Juche-oriented method for achieving the independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ram Krishna Karmacharya, president of the National Press Club of Nepal, said: The DPRK has developed into a powerful country, a country of miracles, from the ruins after the liberation of Korea and the three-year Fatherland Liberation War. The secret of such development is the wise guidance and ardent patriotism of     Kim Il Sung, anti-Japanese war hero Kim Jong Suk, and Kim Jong Il. All the miracles and advances made in the DPRK are associated with noble life of the three great persons of Mt. Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Haider Akbar Khan Rano, director of the Bangladesh Institute of the Juche Idea, noted that Kim Il Sung led the anti-Japanese armed struggle to victory to achieve the historic cause of national liberation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This victory evidently showed that the Korean people could defeat any formidable enemy and achieve the independence of the country with their own efforts.\r\n Congratulatory messages to Kim Jong Il were adopted at the seminars in Nepal and Bangladesh. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In another development, a photo exhibition and a film show took place in Lahore, Pakistan, and film shows at firms of Thailand and Indonesia from Aug. 6 to 12 on the above-said occasion. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This only touched off astonishment and resentment at him among them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This guy has already lost the qualification to live in the era of the June 15 reunification as he has been thrown into such a wretched position by outside forces and anti-reunification forces where he is compelled to wag his tongue in order to fan up antagonism and confrontation among Koreans in Japan and north-south confrontation. \r\n He will have to pay dearly for his reckless utterances going against the trend of the times.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Yet, Japanese right-wing forces did not bother to visit the shrine on Aug. 15 as if to demonstrate their obstinacy before the world.

This is aimed at highly praising \"exploits\" of the war criminals and advocating militarism set out by them as an ideological basis whereby to imbue the society with zeal for overseas aggression and thus create a social atmosphere in a bid to put the whole country on the orbit of militarization and fascistization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This goes to prove that the Japanese reactionaries are the worst type militarist fanatics keen to repeat their past and seek a way out in doing so. \r\nJapan's defeat 60 years ago was something unavoidable from the historical point of view. The history proved in practice that those who suppress and dominate others are bound to go to ruin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries should drop the idea of overseas aggression, bearing deep in mind that it is dangerous ideological venom leading Japan to its second defeat.

It is a foolish act to seek a solution to this issue with dependence on the outside forces which do not want the reunification of Korea. The national reunification is the cause of national independence that can be achieved only through the independent struggle of the Korean nation responsible for it.\r\n The historic June 15 joint declaration serves as a reunification program common to the Korean nation and a landmark for independent reunification as it fully reflects the independent demand and interests of the nation and the independent character of the reunification issue and calls for settling the issue independently by the concerted efforts of all the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the publication of the joint declaration, unprecedented events and achievements have been registered in the inter-Korean relations and the struggle for national reunification. This brilliant reality evidently proves that to implement the joint declaration is the way for independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ardent desire for reunification prevailing all over the Korean Peninsula in the era of independent reunification clearly shows that the June 15 joint declaration, the keynote of which is the spirit of \"By our nation itself,\" is the banner of noble patriotism and independent reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
