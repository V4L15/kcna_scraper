But he has done nothing for the toiling masses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Traitor Lee, regarding foreign forces more important than compatriots, has pursued with increased zeal the moves for confrontation and war against the DPRK in league with the U.S. and Japan, clamoring about the \"restoration of the relations\" with those countries and \"stronger alliance\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the final analysis, the Lee \"government\" has done nothing but deepening south Korea's colonial dependency upon foreign forces, deteriorating economy and the people's livelihood and bedeviling the inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the requirement of the times and the unanimous desire of the popular masses to develop the on-going vigorous candlelight actions in south Korea into all-people resistance for independence, democracy and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people are now aware that they can hardly think of social justice and progress or their existence as long as the Lee group are allowed to ride roughshod. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are nothing but cancer-like betes noires as they only do harm to the fellow countrymen. A boil should be lanced and a poisonous herb rooted out.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
