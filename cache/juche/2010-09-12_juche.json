Appreciating this as a great success, he extended thanks to the teachers and researchers of the university and workers in other related units for their great contribution to the technological updating of the factory. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the research group of the university has made a great contribution to the modernization and scientization of factories and enterprises in the past, he expressed firm belief that the group would play a vanguard role in the drive for settling scientific and technological problems arising in developing the nation's industry in the future, too. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In recent years the factory invented dozens of new valuable technologies and rapidly increased the production, he said, adding that this is the precious fruition of the dynamic drive for pushing back the frontiers of latest science and technology with extraordinary determination to glorify the country before the world by means of intelligence and technology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He highly praised the officials, workers and technicians making uninterrupted advance and innovations without a moment's stagnation and marking time for their revolutionary work style, enterprising work attitude and noble love for the country and the factory. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Calling on the factory to continue dynamically dashing ahead toward a higher eminence of science and technology on the basis of the achievements made by putting the production on a CNC basis, he set a goal to be attained in the near future and showed such deep loving care as unraveling the problems raised.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Looking at a variety of consumer goods made by the factory through an effective use of by-products, he said that their quality is high. He appreciated the devoted service rendered by the workers of the factory for improving the standard of people's living.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Making the rounds of supply service facilities including the canteen and the bean processing shop newly built by the factory, he expressed great satisfaction over the good living conditions provided to the workers. He said that everything including production is going on well at the factory as it is supported by good supply service.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed great expectation and conviction that the officials and workers of the factory would creditably perform the role of the vanguard and shock brigade in the worthwhile struggle to push back the frontiers of latest science and technology in the future, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Pak To Chun, chief secretary of the Jagang Provincial Committee of the WPK, Jang Song Thaek, vice-chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission and department director of the WPK Central Committee, Kim Ki Nam, secretary of the C.C., the WPK, and Kim Kyong Hui, Thae Jong Su and Hong Sok Hyong, department directors of the C.C., the WPK."
