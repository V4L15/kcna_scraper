This time he showed such profound loving care as providing again many latest type computers and their related facilites to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A ceremony of conveying the gifts took place at the People's Palace of Culture on Monday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After an address was made by secretary of the WPK Central Committee Jong Ha Chol to convey the gifts, director general of the KCNA Kim Ki Ryong and others evinced their resolutions to repay the great solicitude.    \r\n     \r\n"

The U.S. is duty-bound to supply heavy oil to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the U.S. has increased the combat capacity of its forces in South Korea and escalated the threat of a war to North Korea after openly disclosing its plan to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the U.S. which breached the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Therefore, it should be referred to the international atomic energy agency to receive international sanctions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. is truly interested in ensuring peace in Northeast Asia, it should urge Japan to freeze its nuclear facilities and drop arms. Asking Bush if he has a willingness to do so, the questionnaire stressed: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Koreans do not want the U.S. troops to stay in South Korea. Peace will settle on the Korean Peninsula if it is reunified. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBush should pay heed to the strong domestic and foreign call for the withdrawal of the U.S. troops from South Korea.    \r\n    \r\n\r\n"

The whole nation should have a transparent will for national independence to resolutely reject flunkyism and dependence on foreign forces and smash the u.s. moves for aggression, war and intervention. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The dignity and security of the nation and the independent reunification of the country are unthinkable without the great unity of the 70 million Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans can be united firm as one. If they place the destiny of the country and the nation above anything else and give priority to the reunification of the country, the cause common to the nation, they can achieve the great unity of the nation. When all the compatriots in the north, the south and overseas unite firm as one under the banner of national independence, the U.S. criminal war of aggression on the DPRK and its moves against the reunification of the country will certainly be frustrated.    \r\n\r\n"

Anti-Americanism has now become an irresistible trend of the times in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter how desperately those imbeciles may work in the dumping ground of history, no one will lend an ear to them and they can never stem the nation's strong trend for independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThose who swim against the trend of the times will only meet a miserable end.    \r\n\r\n"

This is the key to the solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As  far as the dialogue between the DPRK and U.S. is concerned, it should be a practical and productive one to find a fair and peaceful solution to the pending issues between them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the United States truly wants dialogue with the DPRK it should have a sincere and impartial approach to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States should drop its hypocritical and improper attitude toward \"dialogue\" and give the DPRK legal security assurances by signing a non-aggression treaty with it.
