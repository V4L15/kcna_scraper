            "content": "Kim Jong Il Gives Field Guidance to Major Industrial Establishments in Hamhung City\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPyongyang, October 16 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Il, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK, provided field guidance to major industrial establishments in Hamhung City.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe first leg of his guidance was the February 8 Vinalon Complex.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGoing round the newly rebuilt horizontal spinning shop, the fiber shop, the vertical spinning shop which had already gone operational and the converting shop and other places of the complex, he learned about the technical updating and production there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWatching the undiluted solution process in which polyvinyl alcohol goes through washing, cleansing, solution, filtration and other processes, he praised the complex for having built a production process with big capacity by its own efforts and with indigenous technology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe saw Korean type spinning machine, drawing machine, dehydrating machine and drying machines Nos. 1 and 2 dynamically operating in the building where no machines could be seen once. He was pleased, saying the complex has done a great job, indeed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWatching long vinalon fiber band being churned out from the horizontal spinning shop before being automatically cut into short band and piled up as vinalon fiber for weaving through formalin treating process at the fiber shop, the next process, he was very pleased. He said he felt as if he had seen quality clothing materials displayed at each shop.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe next leg of his guidance was the Hungnam Fertilizer Complex. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGoing round the first serial process of gasification including the gas producing shop, gas purification shop and nitrogen shop No. 2, he learned in detail about the construction and production there. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe expressed great satisfaction, saying it is a big success that the workers of the complex completed the first serial process of gasification in a matter of two and half years which would have taken more than 10 years at an ordinary pace by displaying popular heroism and patriotic devotion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe successful completion of the above-said process is a shining victory of the idea of President Kim Il Sung on the building of Juche-oriented chemical industry and the precious fruition of the self-supporting national economy in the DPRK, he said. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThen he went round the compounding shop and the urea shop to learn in detail about fertilizer production. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe dropped in at the fertilizer forwarding ground where he was pleased to see fertilizer produced through the gasification of brown coal. He stressed the need to increase the fertilizer production and send it to socialist co-op farms. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe third leg of his guidance was the Ryongsong Machine Complex.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe learned in detail about the work done by the complex to develop and produce new type modern geothermal equipment and the success made by the Songun Cast Iron Factory in establishing heating and air-cooling systems with geothermal equipment manufactured by itself. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Ryongsong Machine Complex has ensured a timely production of custom-built equipment badly required by various sectors of the national economy, thereby performing great feats in the efforts to consolidate the nation's industrial foundation and improve the standard of people's living, he noted. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe last leg of his guidance was the Hungnam Smeltery. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe went round the hard alloy shop and various other production processes to learn in detail about technological updating and production there. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWatching quality hard alloy products being churned out in an endless stream from the modern production processes, he was greatly satisfied to learn that the officials and workers and technicians of the smeltery have done a laudable job in a brief span of time. He highly estimated their successes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe perfection of modern hard alloy tool production process ranging from raw material feeding to the finishing process made it possible for the CNC-based equipment to pay off more profusely as they have reached a world level, he noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe once again expressed great satisfaction over the laudable feats performed by the workers of the above-said industrial establishments and the Taehung and Ryongyang mines in their endeavors to make a breakthrough toward the fulfillment of their national economy plans and consolidate the nation's economic foundation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe on behalf of the Central Committee and the Central Military Commission of the WPK invited to Pyongyang the officials, labor innovators, scientists and technicians of the above-said units who fully devoted patriotic enthusiasm and creative wisdom to the work for technologically updating them and putting them on a modern and scientific basis. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe was accompanied by Kim Jong Un, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission of the WPK, Kim Kyong Hui, member of the Political Bureau and department director of the C.C., the WPK, Jang Song Thaek, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the C.C., the WPK and vice-chairman of the NDC, Pak To Chun, alternate member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the C.C., the WPK, Kwak Pom Gi, chief secretary of the South Hamgyong Provincial Committee of the WPK, and Ri Jae Il and Pak Pong Ju, first vice department directors of the C.C., the WPK."
