            "content": "U.S. should take practical steps as soon as possible\r\n Pyongyang, May 8 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry answered questions of KCNA on May 7 concerning the fact that the U.S. side has not taken practical steps to implement the DPRK-U.S. framework agreement.\r\n   He told KCNA:\r\n   The agreement was adopted in 1994, the keynote of which is that both sides shall build confidence with the DPRK maintaining nuclear freeze and the united states offering light water reactors and shall remove the hostile relations with eased sanctions.\r\n   No sooner had the agreement been adopted than we promptly froze self-reliant nuclear power facilities, comprehensively lifted the sanctions on the United States and smoothly promoted safe storage of spent-fuel rods. Thus, we have sincerely fulfilled our obligations under the agreement.\r\n   The U.S. side, however, has not taken practical steps to ease the sanctions on the DPRK as it promised in the agreement. On the contrary, it is trying to use them as a means for gaining concession from the DPRK and, at the same time, is persistently pursuing the hostile policy toward the DPRK with intensified military threat.\r\n   The ground-breaking ceremony of the lwrs project, a main point of the agreement, took place more than one year later than scheduled. Now the construction is not progressing substantially on the pretext of difficulties within the KEDO (Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organisation).\r\n   This makes us doubt that the United States can complete one of the lwrs till the year 2003 as it promised in the agreement.\r\n   The United States is obliged to supply heavy oil to the DPRK to compensate for electricity shortage resulting from nuclear freeze. But the u.s. Side has not set forth the timetable for heavy oil supply this year and is not supplying heavy oil to the DPRK in time.\r\n   All facts show that the DPRK has gone farther in implementing the agreement whereas the U.S. side is not sincerely fulfilling its obligations. This causes serious imbalance in the implementation of the agreement which is based on the principle of simultaneous action.\r\n   Therefore, our competent organ says that the DPRK should no longer lend an ear to the empty promise of the U.S. side, but open and readjust the frozen nuclear facilities and do everything our own way.\r\n   We have issued warnings to the U.S. side over this on several times. The U.S. has made empty promise each time, but has not taken practical steps to implement the agreement.\r\n   There is a limit to our patience concerning this matter.  \r\n   The situation keeps the DPRK from promoting spent-fuel rods storage any longer till the U.S. side has taken relevent measures.\r\n   If the spent-fuel rods storage is suspended for a long time, we will be compelled to take measures for safe storage of spent-fuel rods for technical and security reasons.\r\n   This will be an unavoidable step to ensure the balance in the implementation of the agreement and to save the agreement.\r\n   In order that the DPRK may promote the safe storage of spent-fuel rods regularly, the U.S. side should take practical steps to fulfil its obligations under the agreement as soon as possible. In case the U.S. side repeats empty words, the consequences will be unpredictably grave. \r\n  \r\n"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun comments on Japan's diplomacy towards DPRK\r\nPyongyang, May 8 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today carries a commentator's article titled \"On Japan's diplomatic attitude towards DPRK.\"\r\n   The article says in part:\r\n   Since DPRK-Japan preliminary talks between vice department directors of Foreign Ministries were held in Beijing in August last year, the 9th round of the inter-governmental full-fledged talks has not yet been held. The reason should be found in Japan's position and attitude towards the agreement reached between the two governments.\r\n   At the preliminary talks the sides reached an agreement on all the technical matters, except the opening date of the full-fledged talks, on the basic principle of resuming the talks without raising any preconditions.\r\n   The Japanese side, however, is raising the settlement of the groundless \"suspected kidnapping\" as a precondition in violation of the agreement.\r\n   The Japanese government is avoiding the implementation of the agreement with unreasonable pretexts and conditions. The perfidious act degrades Japan's diplomatic image and deprives it of its international confidence.\r\n   Japan can never flee from the responsibility for breaking the agreement.\r\n   It is the height of moral shamelessness and arrogance in diplomacy that Japan, the perpetrator, is raising a precondition while calling for normalizing relations with the DPRK, the victim.\r\n   It is related to the diplomatic character intrinsic to Japan, which is blindly compliant with others' solicitation, pressure and order.\r\n   It is a stark fact that Japan talked about relations with others and atmosphere at contacts and even talks with the DPRK and sought \"understanding\" and received requests from others.\r\n   It is common sense that nothing can be achieved with dependent, submissive diplomacy.\r\n   The precondition raised by Japan, breaking its promise, is a product of Japan's tragic diplomacy.\r\n   Japan is now kicking up a row over the groundless \"suspected kidnapping.\"\r\n   As for such a crime as kidnapping, Japan is not in a position to open its mouth.\r\n   No fewer than 6 million Koreans were taken away by the Japanese imperialists in the period of their colonial rule over Korea. It is they that abducted nearly 200,000 Korean women and forced them to serve as \"comfort women for the army\" and it is also they that kidnapped and brutally killed one million innocent Koreans.\r\n   Nevertheless, the Japanese government, ignoring the stark historical fact about abductions, killings and slave labour, has raised outcries over the \"suspected kidnapping.\" \r\n   It fully reveals Japan's shamelessness and mental derangement.\r\n   Japan, oblivious of itself as a kidnapper, is attaching the groundless \"suspicion\" to th normalisation of bilateral relations as a precondition. It is really a rash act reminding one of a thief crying \"stop thief \" and also a foolish act adding to its crime.\r\n   Now the Japanese side is foolishly trying to prepare a noose for the DPRK side in a bid to cover up its poor position at the talks.\r\n   Motivated by such a third-rate trick, Japan is clamouring about the \"suspected kidnapping\" it is resorting to in talks with the DPRK.\r\n   What it is seeking is to isolate and stifle the DPRK in league with the South Korean puppets. But it is a foolish daydream.\r\n   If Japan cannot awake from the daydream, it can never improve its image.\r\n   Japan should cooly review its stand concerning DPRK-Japan relations and its diplomatic attitude towards the DPRK and draw a serious lesson.\r\n   If Japan continues resorting to such reckless and unprincipled acts and foolish tricks, we will have no contact with it for the sake of our dignity.    \r\n       \r\n"
