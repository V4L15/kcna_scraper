            "content": "DPRK Foreign Ministry Refutes \"Resolution of UN Security Council\" \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 16 (KCNA) -- The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued today the following statement vehemently denouncing and totally refuting the \"resolution\" of the UN Security Council against the DPRK, a product of the U.S. hostile policy toward it:\r\n The vicious hostile policy of the United States towards the DPRK and the irresponsibility of the UN Security Council have created an extremely dangerous situation on the Korean Peninsula where the sovereignty of the Korean nation and the security of the state have been seriously infringed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The U.S. has recently kicked up much row after bringing the issue of the missile launches conducted by our army as part of the routine military training for self-defence to the UN under the motto of reacting to it in one voice. It was against this backdrop that the U.S. forced the UN to adopt a UN Security Council resolution taking a serious note of our exercise of its right to self-defence on July 15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. sponsored \"resolution\" called for an international pressure for disarming the DPRK and stifling it, terming the missile launches pertaining to its right to self-defence \"a threat to international peace and security\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By doing so the U.S. sought to describe the issue between the DPRK and the U.S. as an issue between the DPRK and the UN and form an international alliance against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This has brought such serious consequences as gravely violating the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK and driving the situation to an extreme pitch of tension, thereby seriously disturbing peace and security on the peninsula and in Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was an entirely unreasonable and brigandish act that the U.S. brought to the UN the DPRK's missile launches nothing contradictory to any international law after branding them as a violation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This time the U.S. attempted till the last moment to apply Chapter 7 of the UN Charter legalizing a military action against the DPRK. This indicates that the \"resolution\" constitutes a prelude to the provocation of the second Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a brigandish logic to claim that missile launches conducted by the U.S. and Japan are legal while the training of missile launches conducted by the DPRK to defend itself is illegal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any missile fire or any nuclear test approved by the U.S. is connived at and they are not subject to discussion at the UN. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the reality today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has made mockery of the DPRK's true heart and sincere efforts to realize the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in a peaceful manner through dialogue and negotiations. Yet the U.S. is now asserting that it will not punish the DPRK once it come out for the six-party talks but punish it if it fails to do so. This is sheer sophism which can never be justified. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only the strong can defend justice in the world today where the jungle law prevails. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Neither the UN nor anyone else can protect us. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The past history and the present reality show that only a country with its powerful force can defend the national dignity and its sovereignty and independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a day-dream to calculate that our principle will alter due to the change of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We have already clarified that we will have no option but to take stronger physical actions should someone take issue with our army's training of missile launches for self-defence and put pressure on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Foreign Ministry of the DPRK is authorized to clarify as follows in view of the grave situation prevailing on the peninsula: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n First, our Republic vehemently denounces and roundly refutes the UNSC \"resolution\", a product of the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK, and will not be bound to it in the least. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Second, our Republic will bolster its war deterrent for self-defence in every way by all means and methods now that the situation has reached the worst phase due to the extremely hostile act of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will firmly defend our own way the ideology and system chosen by our people, true to the Songun policy, a treasured sword.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is little short of a justification of Japan's crime-woven past history and a call for freedom of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The persistent visit to the shrine by the Japanese reactionaries is a vicious challenge to peace and acts of lacerating the wounded hearts of the Asian people doubly and trebly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries do not feel the slightest compunction for the past crimes. They are dictated only by ambition for aggression on the continent to lord it over in Asia as its ruler as they did in the past. This has given rise to a madcap campaign in Japan to turn it into a military power and launch into expansion overseas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The higher the fever of visit to the shrine in Japan, the greater the danger of war by it and the worse the situation of the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The rampage of the Japanese reactionaries in their efforts to inculcate militarist ideas into the people, desperately evading the settlement of the past, is a suicidal act landing Japan into international isolation and driving it into a pitfall of death.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S. war mongers are going desperate in their efforts to ignite a new war on the Korean Peninsula at any cost. It is the real intention of the U.S. not to hesitate to impose even a nuclear disaster upon the Korean nation in a bid to carry out its criminal Korea strategy. It is as clear as noonday that Koreans will not be able to escape a miserable fate of victim and the very existence of the nation will be endangered, should they overlook the situation, taking a fence-sitting attitude towards the U.S. imperialist aggressors and harboring foolish expectation towards them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans should categorically repudiate flunkeyism and dependence on foreign forces and stage a dynamic struggle for peace against war, a struggle to resolutely foil the moves of the U.S. imperialists to start a new war, by their concerted efforts as guided by the idea of \"By our nation itself.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the fellow countrymen should bear in mind the grave consequences to be entailed by the moves of the U.S. imperialists against the DPRK and their reckless military provocations and decisively react to them through their united actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should wage a nationwide struggle for the withdrawal of the U.S. forces from south Korea to remove the very source of war from this land, deeply aware that they can never achieve peace and independent reunification of the country so long as the aggressor forces remain in their land.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 17 (KCNA) -- What the U.S. policy of occupation of south Korea has brought is nothing but evil and misfortune. The Korean nation can neither get rid of misfortune and pain, to say nothing of ensuring peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world, unless an end is put to this evil policy, observes Rodong Sinmun Monday in a signed article.\r\n The U.S. policy to keep south Korea under its occupation is a brigandish and criminal policy as it tramples down upon the dignity, sovereignty, security and interests of the Korean nation and an aggressive and hegemonic policy to invade the DPRK and put the whole of Korea under its control, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The policy is also imposing the tragedy of national division upon the Koreans and blocking Korea's reunification in a bid to keep it divided permanently. This policy is also aimed at domination, plunder, massacre and other crimes as it violates the dignity and sovereignty of the south Koreans and inflicts all sorts of misfortune and disasters upon them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The criminal nature of the U.S. policy of occupation of south Korea, a hostile policy toward the DPRK and a war policy, has been brought into bolder relief today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is stepping up the \"relocation\" of its forces in south Korea and transfer of its bases in it in a bid to launch the second Korean war quite contrary to the trend of the situation on the peninsula toward reconciliation between the north and the south and reunification of Korea. It is also putting spurs to arms buildup while increasing the aggressive role of those forces. It is staging madcap exercises and perpetrating military provocations to launch a war of aggression against the DPRK after massively introducing latest war means into south Korea. It is watching for an opportunity to invade the DPRK, while steadily modifying all sorts of war scenarios to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation on the Korean Peninsula is so tense that a war may break out there any moment due to the U.S. imperialists' war moves and this has put all the Koreans in the danger of a nuclear holocaust. The U.S. imperialists' presence in south Korea is the root cause of aggression and war on the peninsula and the danger of aggression and war will not disappear as long as it goes on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article urges the U.S. to roll up its criminal policy of occupation of south Korea and immediately quit it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
