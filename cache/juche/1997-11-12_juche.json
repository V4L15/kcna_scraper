He said no force on earth can match the KPA, which is determined to share destiny with the party, the leader and the beloved socialist country.\r\n   The socialist country, which is home to the Korean people forever, is a precious gain of revolution which they won at the cost of blood, he said, and urged the unit's soldiers to defend the country, even a tree and a blade of grass, dependably, aware of their mission as the defenders of the country.\r\n   He then looked round the barracks, the dining hall and other logistic facilities and showed great loving care and favors for the soldiers, adding that they should not feel any inconvenience in life in a solitary island far away from the land.\r\n   He also saw a basketball game played by soldiers during their break.\r\n   He noted with great satisfaction that all the soldiers of the unit have grown to be invincible combatants and live an optimistic and vigorous life through art and sports activities with confidence in victory in the revolution. This is a noble mental and moral trait of the KPA soldiers who are confidence of the future, he added.\r\n   He called for conducting art and sports activities more briskly in the army in conformity with the characteristics of young soldiers so that they all can have rich emotions and strong physique and spend a worthy youthful life defending the country.\r\n   He gave the unit a machine gun, an automatic rifle and a pair of binoculars as gifts.\r\n   He had a picture taken with the unit's soldiers.    \r\n\r\n"

The unhappy past between the DPRK and Japan in the beginning of the present century has not been settled properly today when a new century is drawing near, he noted. This is an abnormal thing which does not meet the demand and aspiration of the peoples of the two countries.\r\n   It is a good deed deserving welcome that the delegation of Three Ruling Coalition Parties of Japan visits the DPRK again for an early resumption of inter-governmental talks to improve the DPRK-Japan relations, he said, and went on:\r\n   \"If we open-heartedly exchange opinions independently and with our own views, looking forward to a bright future to meet the aspiration and desire of the peoples of the two countries, it will bear a good fruit, I think.\r\n   \"The forthcoming 21st century will be an era for the Asia-Pacific region. The Workers' Party and people of Korea will make all efforts to build a new Asia, independent, peaceful and prospering, with its neighbouring countries in Asia including Japan.\"\r\n   Speaking at the party, Yoshiro Mori expressed deep thanks once again to the DPRK for extending sincere consolation and encouragement to Japan at the time when it suffered from a great earthquake in 1995.\r\n   Noting that eight rounds of Japan-DPRK governmental talks were held, he said that the two governments agreed upon an early resumption of the talks.\r\n   The realisation of the long-awaited home visit of Japanese-Korean women is a confident stride forward in the Japan-DPRK relations, he said, expressing deep thanks to the governments of Japan and the DPRK for this.\r\n   There are difficult problems between Japan and the DPRK, but there are also sentiments for improving their relations, he said, adding that it is of historic significance to exchange frank views between the parties of the two countries in encouraging these sentiments. At the same time, it is of great importance for the leaders of the two countries to build confidence in the sense of creating circumstances to promote the negotiations between the two governments, he said.\r\n   He sincerely hoped that the new system of the DPRK would live up to the expectation of the people after the election of the leader Kim Jong Il as General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and would contribute to world peace and stability as a member of the international community.\r\n   He expected that Japan and the DPRK would build good relations for the future of the 21st century as close and near countries with the current visit as an occasion.\r\n   Shigeru Ito in his speech congratulated the leader Kim Jong Il on his election as WPK General Secretary.\r\n   He was pleased to visit the DPRK at a time when the home-visiting group of Japanese-Korean women is staying in Japan, he said.\r\n   Asia is greeting a new era today when the world has put an end to the Cold War era, he said. Needless to say, the key here is the Fareast Asia and the Korean Peninsula.\r\n   He said he wants to frankly exchange views to tide over the difficulties, believing in the big trend and advance of history which can open the door of the 21st century drawing near with a new Asia structure.\r\n   He could not forget that he visited the DPRK in the past and met with the respected President Kim Il Sung, he said.\r\n   The Socialist Party, though renamed the Social-Democratic Party, has supported the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea, he noted, adding that there is no change in their mind to bring earlier the normalisation of the Japan-DPRK diplomatic relations.\r\n   The Social-Democratic Party will in the future, too, develop the friendly relations with the WPK on the basis of these long relations.\r\n   Expecting that the talks between the delegation of Three Ruling Coalition Parties of Japan and the delegation of the WPK will become a new page in normalizing the Japan-DPRK diplomatic relations, he said he would make all efforts for this.\r\n   Akiko Domoto in her speech said: The flag of the WPK carries deep meaning. Expressed there is the will of the Korean people including the workers, peasants and intellectuals.\r\n   Referring to the importance of the visit of the delegation, she expressed her will to make active efforts for successful talks.    \r\n\r\n"

This is a crime that cannot be justified in any case.\r\n   It is the Kim Young Sam fascist clique, a herd of arch traitors, that should be sentenced to capital punishment by the people. Their anti-social misrule and irregularities and corruption caused the worst crisis in south Korea. The Kim Young Sam is still repressing the champions of independence, democracy and reunification by force of arms. Their brutal suppression of Hanchongryon which leads the movement for independence, democracy and reunification is the last-ditch effort of those doomed to ruin. It will only precipitate their destruction.   \r\n\r\n"

It describes in detail the scientific accuracy, validity and great vitality of these ideas and theories.\r\n   It also vividly explains the true advantages of the Korean-style socialism centred on the popular masses led by the respected General Kim Jong Il and the happy life of the Korean people living as a large harmonious family under the rays of the benevolent politics.\r\n   The book highly praises General Kim Jong Il for giving scientific answers to the theoretical and practical questions arising in carrying out the socialist cause on the basis of expounding the basic cause of the collapse of some socialist countries, and for wisely leading the struggle for the rebuilding of socialism.    \r\n\r\n"
