The U.S., however, did not properly implement any provision of the AF, resorting to go-slow tactics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAnd, in particular, it did not promote on schedule the construction of light-water reactors, the core provision of the AF. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. maneuvers to tear up the AF reached their apex after the emergence of the Bush administration. In the end, the AF went up in smoke and the DPRK-U.S. relations got to the worst phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the grave situation in which the Bush administration openly declared a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK and madly sped up preparations for a nuclear war aimed at the \"overthrow\" of its system, the DPRK was compelled to take a self-defensive measure for getting access to nuclear weapons.\r\n The nuclear weapons of the DPRK are a shield for defending the sovereignty of the country and a reliable deterrent for preventing a war and ensuring peace on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If it failed to build the nuclear deterrent, it would have already been swallowed up by the U.S. It is none other than the U.S. which has driven the DPRK to the possession of nuclear weapons. The U.S. can by no means deny this and can never shake off the blame for this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the fair public opinion holds, the U.S. is the very one which reduced the AF to a dead letter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should ponder over the matter with a cool head and discard its despicable intention to draw water to its mill by shifting on to the DPRK\r\nthe blame for scuttling the AF.    \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

But \"OPLAN 8022-02\" disclosed lately put the scheme of preemptive nuclear attack in a more concrete form than the former war scenarios against the north. It is a highly dangerous war scenario which can be carried into practice any moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And it must not go unnoticed that this operation plan is advertised as a measure to counter a symptom of a missile attack or an imminent missile attack on the U.S. mainland from the DPRK.This is intended to create a climate for mounting a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK any time under the pretext of what it calls \"symptom\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Still more clear is what the DPRK should do to defend the dignity and security of the nation when the United States has worked out a heinous plan for a preemptive nuclear strike in top secrecy while running about like a headless chicken in the anti-DPRK nuclear campaign. It is the DPRK's immovable mode of response to answer strength with strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States should be mindful that the option of preemptive nuclear attack is not in any way its monopoly. \r\n If the United States, oblivious of this, venture a nuclear war against the DPRK, the aggressors will be driven to the lot of a forlorn wandering spirit by the DPRK's formidable nuclear deterrent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe United States should scrap its adventurous nuclear war scenario and pull its troops out of south Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It has built a well-organized national education system to successfully train the young Koreans in Japan into the overseas citizens of Juche Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In recent years it has firmly defended and preserved its organizations and the Korean community in Japan with unshakable patriotic faith and indomitable will despite the ever-more undisguised plots of the reactionaries inside and outside of Japan to undermine Chongryon and the difficult situation there and steadily advanced the movement of the Koreans in Japan along the path of patriotism. This is the precious achievement made by Chongryon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the last period, it has made a tangible contribution to carrying out the cause of national reunification, the cherished desire of the Korean nation, through a vigorous mass patriotic movement and fully shown ardent patriotic devotion for the progress and prosperity of the homeland. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The 50 year-long history of Chongryon is a glorious one in which it has hewed the path of the overseas Koreans movement, guided by the Juche idea, and a proud one in which it has performed brilliant patriotic feats for the country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation is highly proud of having such reliable overseas Koreans organization as Chongryon which has remained intensely loyal to its leader and cause generation after generation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n I highly appreciate Chongryon for having creditably fulfilled its honorable mission and duty courageously weathering out difficulties and trials over the last five decades and extend warm thanks to all the officials of Chongryon and the Koreans in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chongryon and the Koreans in Japan are called upon to register the greatest success in the movement of the Koreans in Japan in the Songun era, a new era of the Juche revolution, keeping pace with the grand march of the people in the homeland to attain the high goal of a great prosperous powerful nation.\r\n Chongryon should consolidate its organizations, cement the single-minded unity of its ranks and direct great efforts to the work to promote the life and rights of the compatriots such as democratic national education in order to develop itself into a mass compatriots organization rallying Koreans from all walks of life in Japan under the banner of patriotism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It should enlist the patriotic enthusiasm and creative ingenuity of compatriots from all walks of life to make a genuine contribution to the independent reunification of the country and the building of a great prosperous powerful nation and conduct positive activities for friendship with the Japanese with a view to boosting the international solidarity with the cause of Juche and the movement of Koreans in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only victory and glory are in store for Chongryon and the Koreans in Japan dynamically promoting the patriotic cause in the new century with national pride and self-respect as overseas citizens of the socialist homeland of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The message expresses the belief that the Chongryon will as ever register greater success in the worthwhile drive to bring about a new phase in the movement of Koreans in Japan, invariably cherishing the faith of Juche and firm will to win sure victory.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The event marked a historic occasion that brought about a dramatic turn in developing the movement of Koreans in Japan and shaping their destiny, he noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The formation of the organization helped develop the movement of Koreans in Japan into a patriotic national movement serving their homeland and the nation on the basis of a correct programme and scientific leadership methods guided by Juche idea and enabled it to make dynamic progress along the orbit\r\nof Juche undeterred by whatever storms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that Kim Il Sung clearly indicated the ways to be followed by the patriotic cause of Chongryon in each period and at all phases of the developing revolution and worked heart and soul for the growth and progress of the movement, the reporter emphasized the past five decades covered by Chongryon has been a history of a great victory gained thanks to the President's Juche-based idea and theory of overseas Koreans' movement and his outstanding leadership and a glorious history of patriotism associated with legends about his noble love for the fellow countrymen and patriotism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pointing to the patriotic road characterized by victory and glory that has been traversed by Chongryon and great feats it has performed before the country and the nation in the past five decades, true to the Juche-based idea of overseas Koreans movement and leadership of the President and Kim Jong Il, the reporter went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The most valuable achievement made by Chongryon in the past is that the organization has grown to be a Juche-type overseas citizens organization intensely loyal to the leaders, the homeland and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chongryon established a well-regulated organizational and working system that meets the need of the organization championing the life and rights of Koreans in Japan and has fulfilled its sacred duty to look after them as a mother in the homeland would do over the last five decades. \r\n It has preserved advantageous national culture and tradition and brought them into full bloom even in an alien land with the national pride and self-esteem of being led by the great leaders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has made a great contribution to the sacred struggle for the homeland and the nation, considering it as its noble mission and obligation to render services for the country's reunification and prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has boosted the friendship between the peoples of Japan and the DPRK and international solidarity with the world progressive people through its active work to implement the DPRK governments' policy of independent external activities, thereby helping expand the ranks of supporters and sympathizers with the Korean revolutionary cause and raise the international prestige of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are many overseas citizens' organizations but none is so patriotic and powerful as Chongryon not only in view of its intense loyalty to their\r\nhomeland and the nation but in the light of its scale, scope of its activity, the might of its unity and militancy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chongryon has made a dynamic advance along the road of Juche in this period despite stern trials and hardship in history and adorned its proud history with victory and glory. This is ascribable to the extraordinary ideological and theoretical wisdom and outstanding leadership of  Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il has developed Chongryon to be a powerful and patriotic organization rare to be found in any other part of the world and embraced Chongryon officials and Koreans in Japan and has shown warm paternal loving care and solicitude for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter called on them to firmly defend, preserve and glorify the immortal exploits performed by  Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il in the history of the Juche-oriented overseas Koreans' movement and undertake all its work as intended and wished by the President, true to Kim Jong Il's idea and leadership. \r\n Nam Sung U, vice-chairman of the Central Standing Committee of Chongryon, took the floor next.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It thus provides a scientific guarantee of making a selected healthy bud of a plant open larger and more beautifully. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The research team has also found out a new method of preventing Kimjongilia, a typical long-day plant, from its dormancy so as to open any time needed.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Urges Some EU Nations to Be Impartial\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 24 (KCNA) -- Some EU nations are not behaving fairly in dealing with the DPRK's pullout of the NPT at the NPT Review Conference now underway in New York.\r\n They are asserting that the DPRK is to blame for possible worldwide unbroken non-compliance with the treaty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This cannot be construed otherwise than a deliberate distortion of the nature of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As is universally known, the DPRK is outside the NPT. There is, therefore, neither political nor legal ground to take issue with the DPRK over its stand on the NPT. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the DPRK had already declared, it is none other than the U.S. that compelled it to pull out of the NPT and have access to nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue surfaced entirely because of the U.S. increasing nuclear threat to the DPRK from its forces in south Korea and its vicinity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK acceded to the NPT and concluded the Agreed Framework with the U.S. in order to get rid of the U.S. nuclear threat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. had exploited all this for achieving its goal of isolating and stifling the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to destroy the DPRK with nukes, the U.S. shipped at least 1,000 nuclear weapons of various types into south Korea, thus, turning it into the biggest nuclear arsenal in the Far East and incessantly escalating its nuclear threat to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A particular mention should be made of the fact that the Bush administration has posed an undisguised nuclear threat to the DPRK, compelling it to manufacture nuclear weapons to defend itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If EU members are to be impartial in handling the nuclear issue, they have to call into question the U.S. which spurned the nuclear issue in the peninsula and has pushed it to the worst phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is the world's largest maker and owner of nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nuclear arsenals in the U.S. are filled with at least 20,000 nuclear weapons including more than 5,400 intercontinental ballistic missile warheads and over 1,750 nuclear bombs and cruise missile warheads. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. nuclear forces are large enough to engulf the whole world in a nuclear war and exterminate all human beings several times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuke policy of the Bush administration has gone beyond its tolerance limit. It has conducted more than 20 nuclear tests since 1997, refusing to ratify the CTBT. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The global nuclear crisis can never end unless the nuclear weapons states fulfill their commitments to nuclear disarmament and the \"nuke-all powerful\" notion disappears. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the current conference delegates became increasingly critical of the U.S. for having failed to honor its commitment under the NPT and driven the NPT into catastrophe and assertive that a proper solution of the nuclear non-proliferation issue should be preceded by the settlement of the issue of nuclear disarmament by the nuclear weapons states. This reflects the call of the world community at large. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As is the case with some EU nations, if one continues allowing the NPT to be used as leverage for pulling up the non-nuclear nations over the exercise of their legitimate rights, turning blind eyes to the U.S. violation of the treaty, it will only lose the confidence of its signatories in it and finally put its existence into jeopardy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n EU nations should face up to the reality and pay attention to removing the factor of having caused the DPRK to pull out of the NPT before arguing about its withdrawal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This would be an impartial attitude towards the nuclear non-proliferation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
