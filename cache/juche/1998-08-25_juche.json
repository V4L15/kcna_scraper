And it has deployed huge task forces including nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and nuclear-propelled submarines in the seas near the Korean peninsula. Then,  are these needed for \"dialogue\" and \"negotiation\"?\r\n    The United States should make its position clear and behave in a farsighted way.\r\n   We are  ready for both dialogue and war and will answer dialogue with dialogue and war with war, as the U.S. asks.\r\n   Today's Koreans are different from what they were in the past time when the U.S. forced gunboat diplomacy with its ship general sherman.\r\n   The continued dispatchment of the U.S. warships to South Korea will only invite greater indignation of our people and increase our revolutionary  armed forces' striking capacity.\r\n   Statesmen of the United States should know that \"policy of strength\" is not almighty and it will bring immeasurable disasters to the U.S.\r\n   We are keeping a sharp eye on the U.S. attitude. \r\n\r\n"
