No details escaped his attention ranging from conditions of their living room to the use of a sauna and cooking methods. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pleased to learn that the soldiers are spending happy days of military service in warm bedrooms, educational rooms and mess halls despite cold winter, he praised the commanding officers for having provided the soldiers with good living conditions with warm love for soldiers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He gave the servicepersons of the sub-unit a pair of binoculars, a machine gun and an automatic rifle as gifts and had a photo session with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by KPA Generals Hyon Chol Hae and Ri Myong Su.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Hardliners' Reckless Military Moves Assailed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, December 17 (KCNA) -- The conservative hardliners in the United States recently asserted that international pressure upon the DPRK should be continued in the future, too, and there is no need to discuss any compensation and offer to it. And they are doggedly criticizing and denying the September 19 joint statement, in which the U.S. and other countries participating in the six-party talks agreed to respect the DPRK's right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purpose and discuss the matter of offering light water reactors to it in an appropriate time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on such moves, Rodong Sinmun Monday says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This goes to evidently prove that the U.S. hard-line conservatives are blocking the process of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and insisting on the policy to stifle the DPRK by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose forces' constant hostile policy toward the DPRK is intensively manifested by the fact that they are speeding up the arms buildup against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. war-like forces are these days pushing ahead with the reckless plan for modernization of armed forces aimed at the DPRK and China. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is needless to say that the scenario for \"future combat system\", on which the U.S. is spending a huge amount of money, is targeted against the DPRK. The policy to stifle the DPRK by force is a part of the U.S. strategy for world supremacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose forces' arms buildup and military moves for a second Korean war are undoubtedly prompted by their sinister intention to hamstring and frustrate the progress of the six-party talks as such criminal acts are contrary to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and the September 19 joint statement.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
