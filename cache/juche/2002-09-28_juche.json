Duminduwardena and secretary general Upali Bandara of the Sri Lanka Society for Self-Reliance Studies on a visit to the DPRK were interviewed by mediapersons at Pyongyang Koryo Hotel on Thursday.\r\n Warmly welcoming the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang declaration, Duminduwardena said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many countries of the world, especially those countries which were hostile to the DPRK in the past are developing friendly relations with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was against the backdrop of this development that Junichiro Koizumi, Prime Minister of Japan, visited the DPRK, met with Kim Jong Il and the historic declaration was published. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The publication of the declaration marked a historic event of special mention in improving and developing the relations between the two countries and provided them with an opportunity of becoming near and close neighbours, not near yet distant countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bandara said it was fortunate that by visiting the DPRK Koizumi met with Kim Jong Il, honestly apologized to the Korean people and expressed his will to appropriately solve the issue of compensation in order to settle Japan's past. This is a welcome event as it meets the need of the era and the desire of the two peoples, he noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The declaration signed by Kim Jong Il and Koizumi is greatly conducive to normalizing the DPRK-Japan relations and ensuring peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world.     \r\n\r\n"

Through this crafty artifice he seeks to woo the people who have already turned their back on him and improve his public image. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri has been opposed to the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration ever since its publication, describing inter-Korean dialogue, cooperation and exchange as a \"drain on resources.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That is why he has long been branded as the boss of anti-reunification ultra-right conservatives in South Korea and censured and rejected by all the Koreans desirous of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is, therefore, preposterous for such a guy to say this or that about the issue of implementing the joint declaration and poke his nose into it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri's bumbling only goes to prove that he is a political charlatan who, hungry for power, does not know where he stands and is unable to distinguish between reality and a wild dream. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If he has an iota of national conscience and awareness as a human being, he should honestly apologize for all the crimes he has committed so far against the nation and reunification and quit the political arena as early as possible.     \r\n\r\n"
