He highly estimated their feats. \r\n He urged the province to concentrate efforts on the construction of the Wonsan Power Station now under way so as to finish it in the shortest possible time, and took detailed measures for this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then, he went to the fish farm managed by Pak In Chol. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Going round terraced fish breeding ponds which depend on water flowing down from a deep mountain valley, he acquainted himself in detail with the expansion project of the farm and its fish breeding conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said that President Kim Il Sung's wish in his lifetime to supply more fish to the people can be realized in the near future if all the sectors and units continue directing big efforts to pisciculture. And he advanced tasks that would serve as guidelines in conducting a vigorous mass drive for pisciculture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Accompanying him were officers of CC of WPK and government. \r\n"

These are a shining fruition of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and a product of the Korean people's desire and efforts to preserve the blood ties of the nation in a reunified country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality goes to prove that it is more urgent and vital than ever before for the Korean nation to pool its will, wisdom and strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The 70 million Koreans in the north and the south and abroad should demonstrate the homogeneity and advantages of the nation, deeply aware of the true meaning of the great proposition \"by our nation itself\" and achieve greater success in the efforts to accomplish the cause of reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It also made a great contribution to laying mass foundation of the revolution and developing the Korean revolution as a whole. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was recast as the anti-imperialist youth league in August 1927 as required by the developing revolution. Later, the Young Communist League of Korea (YCLK) was formed with the elite of the DIU. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The society for rallying comrades, the first party organization and the origin of the Workers' Party of Korea, was inaugurated in Kalun in early July 1930 with revolutionaries trained in the YCLK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe first party organization inherited the program and rules of the DIU without any modifications. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionaries of the new generation brought up by the DIU were active as the backbone in the WPK foundation and the program and the principles of independence set forth by the DIU served as the basic program of the WPK and its principles of party building and its activities.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
