            "content": "Changes in S. Korean People's Consciousness \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 14 (KCNA) -- Stating that there have been two changes in the consciousness of the south Korean patriotic people in six years after the publication of the historic June 15 joint declaration, Jo Il Min, chief of the Pyongyang Mission of the Anti-Imperialist National Democratic Front, said: One of them is the establishment of reverence for the great leader of the Korean nation Kim Jong Il and the other is the rapid upsurge of the anti-U.S. struggle for independence. This reality well illustrates the sharp growth of the sentiments of national cooperation in the national reunification movement of the south Korean people.\r\n He was answering a question put by KCNA Tuesday on the occasion of the sixth anniversary of the publication of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the fact that unquestioned prestige of Kim Jong Il and his benevolent image have been firmly rooted in the consciousness of the south Korean people over the past six years, Jo Il Min went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As many as more than 3,500 photographs of him and at least 4,500 articles on his greatness, public reaction to his activities, impressions and accounts of audiences granted by him were carried in leading media of south Korea in six years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At every venue of post-June 15 discussions of the question of shaping the independent destiny of the nation and the reunification issue, the people highly praised Kim Jong Il as \"a man quick in decision and practice\" and \"a man possessed of literary and military arts, talents and virtues\". And they look up to him as \"a great political veteran\" and \"mysterious leader\" produced by the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-U.S. struggle for independence has developed into the basic form of the mass movement. Diverse forms of anti-U.S. struggle involving upwards of 23 million people took place during the six years in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This anti-U.S. struggle sent shivers down the spines of the White House and the U.S. forces authorities present in south Korea. All the processes of the reunification movement after the publication of the joint declaration have been, in short, processes of a struggle to carry into action the main spirit of \"By our nation itself\" laid down in the joint declaration and render greater scope to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The marvelous changes in the consciousness of the south Korean people are a brilliant fruition of the Songun politics of Kim Jong Il, incarnation of patriotism and lodestar of reunification, and the June 15 joint declaration.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Independence precisely means life and soul of the movement. Only when the non-aligned countries thoroughly apply the principle of independence to all its activities, can they overcome the interference and obstructive moves of the imperialists and dominationists, maintain and strengthen the position of the movement as an independent political force and give full play to its peculiar characteristics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Peaceful environment is very important for non-aligned and developing countries aspiring after progress in the new century. The peaceful environment wanted by these countries is unthinkable without struggle against imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The slogan the NAM should put forward in its struggle in the new century is independence against imperialism and defence of peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the NAM, to struggle in defence of peace is the exercise of its legitimate right and its duty on behalf of the times to meet the interests of member nations and step up their prosperity and progress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the NAM is to contribute to ensuring global peace and security it should pay deep attention to categorically rejecting the double-standards in international relations and getting the principles of equality and impartiality preserved. The non-aligned countries should take collective action to reject the imperialists' application of double-standards, keeping vigilance over its consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to strengthen the NAM and vitalize its activities it is necessary to boost unity and solidarity among member nations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also necessary for the non-aligned countries to give full play to the tradition of unity and counter with the strategy of unity the imperialists' separatist move for undermining the NAM and take a joint step in the international arena to defend and carry through their common interests and demands. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The NAM member nations should take a joint action to ensure that the principle of respecting sovereignty is strictly abided by in handling major pending international issues such as disarmament, human rights, anti-terrorism and UN reform. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the member nations strengthen unity, the might of the NAM will grow stronger.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
