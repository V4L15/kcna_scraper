            "content": "Kim Jong Il Inspects Several Production Units of KPA \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, December 6 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il inspected several production units run by the army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by Kim Ki Nam, secretary of the Central Committee of the WPK, Jang Song Thaek, department director of the C.C., WPK, Ri Yong Chol and Ri Jae Il, first deputy department directors of the C.C., WPK, and KPA Generals Hyon Chol Hae and Ri Myong Su. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The first leg of his inspection was the cotton plantation under KPA Unit 1596. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After being briefed on the plantation, he looked round vast cotton fields to acquaint himself in detail with its trial cotton cultivation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He appreciated the successes made by the plantation, noting that the tenacious efforts made by the plantation have resulted in systematically increasing the production and accumulating not a few experience necessary for putting the cotton farming on a scientific basis in recent years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the master key to the successful cultivation of cotton to solve the issue of seed, he noted, underscoring the need to pay special attention to the research and introduction of high-yielding strain requiring a short period for growth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pointing out that it is possible to boost the yield while using less materials and manpower only when farming is placed on a scientific and technical basis as required by bioengineering, he stressed that it is important to actively introduce advanced methods of farming while rounding off the Korean-style system of cultivation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The next leg of his inspection was the new cotton processing factory built by KPA servicepersons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Walking round production processes, he learnt in detail about the technical equipment and production there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to keep the production going at a high rate, it is necessary to steadily improve the control of equipment and technical management and incessantly raise the level of technical skills of the producers, he said, setting forth the tasks to be implemented by the factory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The last leg of his inspection was the exhibition of products turned out by the combined building materials factory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the building materials on display are very high in their quality, he said that the construction of the new combined building materials factory with big production capacity has made it possible to bring about a qualitative leap forward in the field of construction in the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He set forth tasks to be carried out by the factory to keep the production there going at a high rate and build up it under a long-term plan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He called upon all the leading officials to minutely organize everything and push ahead with it in a tenacious manner by displaying the revolutionary fighting spirit just as the commanding officers of the KPA do and thus enable the people to lead a more affluent life as early as possible.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Herein lies the essential characteristics of the socialist cultural construction in the Songun era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in an editorial. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the intention and will of the Workers' Party of Korea to make the revolutionary enthusiasm and militant spirit, optimism and emotion of the People's Army prevail throughout the country and help all the people become genuine creators and enjoyers of socialist culture in the Songun era, the editorial notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The soldier culture reflects the spirit of the present times, fixed faith in and optimism about victory in the revolution and militant enthusiasm, joy and rich emotion. It has served as a powerhouse as it helped effect a revolutionary turn in the Korean people's ideological and moral traits and cultural and emotional life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was through the drive to learn from the revolutionary spirit and lifestyle of the People's Army that the Korean people emerged those strong in faith and optimists who cheerfully pull through any hardships and ordeals and the whole country was pervaded with revolutionary enthusiasm free from stagnation and standstill, hesitation or vacillation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people can enjoy a worthwhile life as genuine creators and enjoyers of socialist culture when they always carve out a noble life full of faith in certain victory and optimism just as servicepersons do. This is the truth the Korean people have learned in practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All party members and other working people should steadily intensify the work to learn from the revolutionary soldier culture as required by the era in which they are working hard to achieve the great prosperity of the country and thus bring about full efflorescence in the cultural construction in the Songun era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the greatest pride and honor of the Korean people to have such a model for the socialist cultural construction as the revolutionary soldier culture.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun Thursday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The patriotic enthusiasm of the Koreans that has grown strong since the outset of the year helped bring about a new turn in the efforts to achieve the reunification of the country and national prosperity in the strong spirit of national independence of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans in the north and the south and overseas came to have strong consciousness of national independence that it is the only the Korean nation that can settle the issue of national reunification as it is responsible for the issue. This is the most precious success. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The whole land of three thousand ri resounded throughout the year with loud voices calling for national independence, i.e. the assertion that either peace of the country or development of inter-Korean relations and reunification and prosperity of the nation should be achieved by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The same voices could be heard from the meeting of north and south Korean workers for reunification. The participants of the meeting for the great unity of the nation marking the 7th anniversary of the June 15 joint declaration strongly called for holding fast to the stand of attaching importance to the nation in settling the issue of reunification in the idea of \"By our nation itself\" free from the interference and pressure of the anti-reunification forces at home and abroad and protecting the interests of the nation and giving full play to the might of the driving force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These calls for national independence made by all Koreans in the north and the south and overseas reflecting their patriotic will and desire were a manifestation of their high awareness and will to perform their responsibilities and roles as a driving force for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is nothing impossible for the Korean nation when all its members have such strong spirit of national independence as the determination to conduct the movement for national reunification while rejecting flunkeyism and dependence upon foreign forces and firmly believing in the nation's strength and relying on it, concludes the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
