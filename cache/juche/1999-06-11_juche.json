There should be only things socialist under socialism. Only the socialist ideology and culture are allowed under socialism. It is not a closed-door policy to set up a mosquito net in the process of revolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If no revolutionary measures are taken to check  the infiltration of the bourgeois idea, aware that it makes people sick mentally, morally and physically, it is a grisly crime.   Setting up a mosquito net means a benefit  bestowed upon the people by a socialist state which makes them push ahead with the social development as the driving force of history, possessed of noble mentality, culture and  moral trait.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is imperative to conduct ideological education well and, at the same time, block all the channels through which the bourgeois ideological and cultural poison can infiltrate and ensure the purity of the socialist society.

Roh claimed that his remarks were based on what was said by the former deputy prime minister of Japan Shin Kanemaru, who visited Pyongyang in September 1990 as head of the joint delegation of the Liberal Democratic Party and the then Socialist Party of Japan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He said, \"when meeting Shin Kanemaru, who came to Seoul after visiting Pyongyang, I asked if the eight agenda items were agreed upon between the Worker's Party of Korea and the Japanese party delegation at the request of the north, not at his own will, he answered, 'you are right.' \"This is a cock-and-bull story.    Roh in his \"recorded memoirs\" claimed that when he asked Shin Kanemaru if he visited Pyongyang leaving aside the south, \"allured\" by the north, Kanemaru made an \"apology\" from the bottom of his heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It does not hold water to assert that Shin Kanemaru, who was considered to be influential in the then Japanese political circles and unshakable in his political faith, was \"allured\" by someone and, moreover, he made an \"apology\" to Roh Tae Woo upon whom he looked down as a worthless fellow.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Although the South Korean authorities launched a \"protest\" campaign over the adoption of the three-party joint declaration and Roh Tae Woo was trying to keep him from visiting Pyongyang, Shin Kanemaru stated \"I am a man who should take the path I have chosen\". He reiterated time and again his determination to put into practice what he agreed upon with the north.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAt that time, NHK reported as follows: When  Roh Tae Woo requested Shin Kanemaru to move for the improvement of the Japan-DPRK relations only after adequate prior consultation with South Korea, to urge the north to accept international inspection of its nuclear facilities and to refrain from making any compensation or giving any economic cooperation before the establishment of diplomatic relations with the DPRK, the latter, displeased with  his request, said nothing before flying back to Tokyo without delay.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Nevertheless, Roh Tae Woo did not hesitate to tell sheer lies at a time when Shin Kanemaru is no longer alive, nine years since then. Roh's outburst is so despicable and the aim sought by him is sinister.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Underlying his jargon is his intention to create the impression that he put a brake on the improvement of the DPRK-Japan relations and made a certain \"contribution\" to \"cooperation\" with Japan against the north, when he was \"president\" and thereby secure \"support\" from right-wing conservative forces and \"improve\" even a bit his miserable image after serving a prison term and as he has been driven to a tight corner for irregularities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   No matter how hard Roh Tae Woo may try to falsify the truth to realise his ulterior intention, it is in vain. This only lays bare his true colors as a political mountebank and an immoral fellow.\r\n   While in power, Roh aggravated the north-south confrontation and pushed back the movement for national reunification through his anti-national and anti-reunification moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Today he is slandering even the departed foreign politician through fabrications and intrigues and inciting anti-north confrontation though he is at death's door. He should immediately make an apology for this dastardly behaviour.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The present South Korean authorities should not pay lip service to \"reconciliation\" and \"cooperation\" but refrain from conniving at and encouraging those who distort history and falsify the truth with all sorts of political swindles in South Korea and who incite anti-communist confrontation and should punish them. \r\n\r\n"

Roh asked the head of the north side's delegation to convey to President Kim Il Sung his sincere feelings of deep respect  for having made a decision for improved inter-Korean relations, fully  considerate of the desire of the nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Saying that he was very pleased to hear that President Kim Il Sung was in good health, Roh added:    There may be something in common between the president and me in the sense that we are chief executives of the north and south. But I am no match for the president because he already led the anti-Japanese armed struggle when I was little and he is a great and distinguished leader who has successfully steered the Korean nation in the state of division since the august 15, 1945, liberation.   \"It is my sincere wish to build a high gold pyramid after the successful solution of the reunification question and have the honor of presenting it to the president first.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRodong Sinmun on December 14, 1991, carried the story to this effect filed by journalists of the north side who were visiting Seoul to cover the talks at that time. The director said, and continued: What Roh referred to as regards the June 25 War in his \"recorded memoirs,\" falsifying the truth, is a treacherous act of making a fool of public opinion and throwing a wet blanket over the aspiration of the fellow countrymen who want reconciliation and unity between the north and south, and an outcry of an imposter who does not have even an iota of conscience.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is not difficult to guess the aim sought by Roh in slandering the north in an \"interview\" with such a human fossil belonging to the cold war era as Jo Kap Je of Chosun Ilbo who is playing a leading role in the media to serve the purpose of confrontation with the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Roh's outcry is prompted by his try to prolong his dirty remaining days by taking precautions to get rid of his difficult position where he is trying to win \"sympathy\" by making eyes at some person. And he fears that he may be accused of \"being red\" if what he said is opened to the public as the former and incumbent \"presidents\" of South Korea are slandering each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   No one can deny history and facts.   \r\n   Those who orchestrated this base and despicable drama must make an immediate apology and withdraw their anti-north remarks.\r\n   The South Korean authorities are well advised to straighten the situation, clearly mindful that their connivance at the anti-north outcries of Roh Tae Woo and gangsters of Chosun Ilbo would adversely affect the inter-Korean relations. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Statement of spokesman for KPA mission in Panmunjom\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the mission of the Korean People's Army in Panmunjom released a statement today in connection with the situation getting ever tenser in Korea due to the unceasing moves of the South Korean authorities to provoke a war along the extension line of the demarcation line in the waters off the west coast of Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The statement says:   The situation in Korea, where there is neither a war nor peace, is growing tenser due to the ceaseless military provocations of the South Korean authorities along the extension line of the demarcation line in the waters off the west coast of Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   From June 4 onward, the South Korean authorities have infiltrated scores of naval warships deep into the territorial waters southwest of the Kangryong peninsula in south hwanghae province and began threatening the north side's peaceful fishing boats that were engaged in routine fishing.   Such provocations took place even today, following those on June 5-6.   The KPA naval patrol ships that stalwartly stand guard over inviolable territorial waters of our country promptly took a self-defence measure and entered into routine patrol mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But, the South Korean authorities infiltrated  various types of warships into the north side's territorial waters, six or seven warships on a daily average and 14 to 20 at maximum, unhesitatingly committing provocations by hindering routine patrol of the KPA naval vessels.   In the course of that, naval vessels of both sides collided three times on June 9 and 11.   From 11:15 on June 9, the South Korean \"naval\" clippers intentionally ran into our patrol boats on a routine duty after intruding deep into the north side's territorial waters and fled after suffering a big setback.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The situation has reached an extremely grave phase.   Even at this moment, scores of South Korean warships are sailing around along the extension line of the military demarcation line at the West Sea of Korea and the groups of warships  in the Taeyonphyong and Soyonphyong islets are on the alert for reinforcement.\r\n   Their planes are also ready for emergency action.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Meanwhile, the \"Minister of National Defence\" of South Korea instructed the \"army, navy and air force\" units to be on the alert. The \"headquarters of the joint chiefs of staff\" is directly commanding the military provocations  on the spot.\r\n   The emergency meeting of the \"Ministry of National Defence\" reportedly discussed tough measures to be taken to counter our self-defensive measure.   All these moves illustrate that the South Korean authorities' military actions have entered a reckless phase of war provocation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We are watching the military provocations as a grave war gamble that can not be overlooked because they took place at a time when the overall contents of the \"operation plan 5027\" for invasion of the north were revised and supplemented for a preemptive attack on the North Korea and when the Yugoslav crisis was coming to an end.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We bitterly denounce the South Korean authorities' military provocations, patronized by the U.S. conservative hard-liners, as a flagrant violation of the Korean armistice agreement and as a deliberate and premeditated move to drive the situation of the Korean peninsula to a touch-and-go situation of military confrontation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As regards the prevailing situation, the Panmunjom mission of the Korean People's Army states as follows,  on authorization:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   1) The South Korean authorities must take a measure of immediately withdrawing all warships that intruded into the north side's territorial waters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is an unshakable will of the Korean revolutionary armed forces never to pardon those who violate even 0.001 mm of the sky, the land and the sea of the fatherland, in defence of their sovereignty.   The South Korean authorities must know that if they continue reckless provocations despite our repeated warnings, they will meet with our strong self-defensive strikes.   There is a limit to patience.\r\n   We are always fully prepared to settle account with the South Korean authorities.\r\n   They must realise that we do not make empty words.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   2) The South Korean authorities must make an apology for the intrusions into our inviolable territorial waters and refrain from misleading public opinion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Now the South Korean authorities talk as if our naval warships intruded into their waters, though they made naval provocations.   At the same time, they try to shift the blame for the incident on to the north, calling for resumption of the Military Armistice Commission, the opening of the Panmunjom general officer-level talks and the like, manipulated by their master.   The South Korean authorities must immediately give up the foolish act that reminds one of a thief crying \"stop thief.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   3) The South Korean authorities must be held wholly responsible for all consequences of the naval provocations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The naval provocations have rendered the situation in Korea extremely dangerous.\r\n   We are fully prepared to cope with any danger and will not miss any opportunity.\r\n   If the naval provocations against the north continue, the South Korean authorities will be held wholly responsible for all ensuing consequences.\r\n   Our people and revolutionary armed forces will sharply watch every move of the South Korean authorities. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
