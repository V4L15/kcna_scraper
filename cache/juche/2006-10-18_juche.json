            "content": "DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman Totally Refutes UNSC \"Resolution\" \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 17 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea Tuesday issued the following statement:\r\n On Oct. 14 the United States instigated the UN Security Council to pass another \"resolution\" calling for harsh international sanctions and blockade against the DPRK, unreasonably describing its nuclear test for self-defence as a \"threat\" to international peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The successful nuclear test in the DPRK was an exercise of its independent and legitimate right as a sovereign state as it was a positive defensive countermeasure to protect the sovereignty of the country and life and security of the people from the U.S. escalated nuclear war threat and sanctions and pressure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK was compelled to legitimately pull out of the NPT according to its relevant provision and manufactured nuclear weapons after undergoing the most fair and aboveboard and transparent processes as the U.S. seriously encroached upon the supreme security of the DPRK and the fundamental interests of the Korean nation under the pretext of the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK conducted the test proving its possession of nukes in a legitimate manner after fairly announcing it in advance, something unprecedented in view of international practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It conducted the nuclear test under the conditions where its security is fully guaranteed and clearly declared that the DPRK, a responsible nuclear weapons state, would never use nukes first and will not allow nuclear transfer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It also clarified that it would make every possible effort to promote the worldwide nuclear disarmament and the final elimination of nuclear weapons and invariably adhere to the principle to realize the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula through dialogue and negotiations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S., the very one that has driven the DPRK to the nuclear test, is describing the DPRK's nuclear test as a \"threat\" to international peace and security, while shelving what it has done like a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\" This totally preposterous act is intolerable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear test in the DPRK was a great deed that greatly contributed to defending peace and stability not only on the Korean Peninsula but in the rest of Northeast Asia as it demonstrated powerful deterrent for coping with the U.S. nuclear threat and blackmail and foiling its attempt to ignite a new war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The UNSC, paying no heed to all these facts, feigned ignorance of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK, the policy that spurned the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, and is now incriminating the DPRK's exercise of its sovereign right to defend the sovereignty of the country, while trumpeting about the denuclearization of the peninsula. This is an immoral behavior utterly devoid of impartiality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The UNSC \"resolution,\" needless to say, cannot be construed otherwise than a declaration of a war against the DPRK because it was based on the scenario of the U.S. keen to destroy the socialist system of Korean-style centered on the popular masses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK vehemently denounces the \"resolution,\" a product of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK, and totally refutes it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The adoption of this \"resolution\" made it impossible for the UNSC to evade the historic responsibility for having patronized and connived at the U.S. which caused the division of Korea, the root cause of all misfortunes of the Korean nation, in violation of the UN Charter the cornerstone of which is the principle of sovereignty, equality and self-determination and has systematically perpetrated undisguised moves to \"bring down the system\" in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present development clearly proves once again that the DPRK was entirely right when it decided to have access to nuclear weapons, its people's choice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised not to miscalculate the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Bush group, oblivious of the lessons drawn from the shameful setbacks recorded in the history of the relations between the preceding U.S. administrations and the DPRK, calculates it can bring the DPRK to its knees through sanctions and pressure, pursuant to the already bankrupt hostile policy toward it, there would be nothing more ridiculous and foolish than its behavior. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK had remained unfazed in any storm and stress in the past when it had no nuclear weapons. It is quite nonsensical to expect the DPRK to yield to the pressure and threat of someone at this time when it has become a nuclear weapons state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK wants peace but is not afraid of war. It wants dialogue but is always ready for confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already clarified by the DPRK, it will fulfil its responsibility for realizing the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. But if anyone attempts to infringe upon the DPRK's sovereignty and right to existence even a bit under the signboard of the UNSC \"resolution,\" it will deal merciless blows at him through strong actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will closely follow the future U.S. attitude and take corresponding measures.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is the most precious truth taught by the 80 year-long history which has witnessed victories under the banner of the DIU. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Workers' Party, the army and people of Korea will always uphold and glorify the tradition and cause of the DIU. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea of the DIU has come true but the Korean revolution is not yet over. It is the noble sense of moral obligation and a sacred historic mission for the soldiers and disciples of the President to carry forward and accomplish the cause of the DIU. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should hold the President in high esteem as the eternal sun of Juche and glorify his exploits and last instructions for all ages. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should advance along the road of Juche explored by the President under the banner of the DIU no matter how much water may flow under the bridge and no matter what storm and stress we may face. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tradition and cause of the DIU can be defended and carried forward only under the leadership of Kim Jong Il in the future, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il represents an eternal banner of victory and the destiny of the country and the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Party members, the servicepersons of the Korean People's Army and working people should become fighters of Kim Hyok and Cha Kwang Su types in the 21st century remaining true to the idea and leadership of Kim Jong Il just as the hot-blooded members of the DIU fought to uphold the cause of the President like flames spreading over the land and hammers breaking iron chains. Herein lies a sure guarantee for the accomplishment of the cause of the DIU. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to carry the revolution to completion under the uplifted banner of the anti-imperialist struggle, the banner of Songun as long as there remains imperialism in the world. It is essential to develop the People's Army into the army of the leader, the army of the Party and the army of the people, the invincible revolutionary army, pursuant to the Songun politics of the Party, and thoroughly establish the spirit of attaching great importance to the military affairs throughout the country. The army and people of the DPRK are sure to win a final victory in the stand-off with the U.S. as they are advancing under the Songun revolutionary leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Party, the army and the people of the DPRK will always consolidate the single-minded unity based on the revolutionary comradeship as firm as a rock. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They will strikingly demonstrate the dignity and might of Songun Korea under the uplifted banner of building a great prosperous powerful nation in the future, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They will follow the headquarters of the revolution to the end of the world. This is the spirit of the DIU and the permanent signpost of the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The headquarters of the revolution, a great guide of the cause of Songun, represents a banner of all victories and the future. The army and people of the DPRK will share the destiny with the headquarters of the revolution despite whatever tempest, remaining true to the oath taken before the red flag. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As we are led by Kim Jong Il, the tradition and cause of the DIU will last forever and Songun Korea have immensely rosy future.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The imperialists are now becoming evermore undisguised in their highhanded and arbitrary practices. Under this international situation the validity and vitality of the Songun politics based on the Juche idea have been fully demonstrated and this is arousing strong support and sympathy among the revolutionary political parties and people of the world.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
