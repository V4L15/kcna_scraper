It is against this background that Japan is frantically pushing forward the arms buildup and taking an active part in the development of the U.S. missile defence system (MD). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan regards it as the only way of its overseas aggression to tighten its military alliance with the U.S. and avail itself of the U.S. \"war against terrorism\".\r\n Precisely for this reason Japan is keen to realize the \"integration\" of the SDF and the U.S. troops at an early date. Through this Japan seeks to drive its SDF to overseas aggression with ease, taking advantage of the U.S. acts of aggression and war.\r\n It is the main strategy of Japan for overseas aggression to realize its wild ambition for staging a comeback to Korea and realize its old dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\" under the patronage of the U.S., using the Japan-U.S. military alliance as a lever for starting a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to stop acting rashly, pondering over the disastrous consequences to be entailed by its reckless moves to realize its wild ambition for overseas aggression.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a clear demonstration of the validity and vitality of the Party's line of national independence as it is an expression of the steadfast will of the fellow countrymen to establish national sovereignty.\r\n The 10-point programme for the great unity of the whole nation advanced by President Kim Il Sung and the five-point policy of great national unity set forth by leader Kim Jong Il in the sacred  work for national unity have served as the banner of national reconciliation and unity and the guidelines of action. The driving force of reunification has been immensely strengthened in the course of applying the 10-point programme and the five-point policy and it has become the powerful motive force of stepping up the cause of independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any ordeals and challenges cannot arrest the dynamic advance of the cause of reunification as it is guided by the just grand programme of reunification common to the nation put forward by the Party.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
