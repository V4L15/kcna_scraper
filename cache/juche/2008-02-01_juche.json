Noting that thanks to the wise leadership and meticulous care of President Kim Il Sung, the unit has grown to be a mighty combined unit having a-match-for-a hundred units, Kim Jong Il underscored the need to briskly conduct education through the room so that all servicepersons may deeply cherish the profound solicitude shown by the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He dropped in at the operational command room and the military lecture room to acquaint himself with the unit's performance of duty and the training of its commanding officials.

            "content": "KCNA Indicts Japan for Its Sexual Slavery  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 31 (KCNA) -- The Korean Central News Agency released an indictment titled \"We denounce crimes related to 'comfort women' committed by Japan, world's worst abductor\" on Jan. 31 as regards Japan's continued ruckus over the \"abduction issue\" although it abducted or took away millions of Korean women and young and middle-aged Koreans after putting Korea under its colonial military rule in the past century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The following are excerpts from the indictment: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The crimes related to the \"comfort women\" for the Imperial Japanese Army were a product of the abduction pursued by the state of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese king, and the government and the military which acted by his order and ratification are chiefly to blame for the abduction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The right to enlist and control \"comfort women\" rested with the Japanese king who held judicial, administrative, legislative and all other state power under the constitution of the Japanese Empire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Ministry of Army organized and managed the sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army with the king's approval and at his instruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ministry directly pushed forward the work to enlist \"comfort women\", set up \"comfort stations\" and supervised the overseas transfer of \"comfort women\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists' policy of sexual slavery was enforced in Korea, to begin with. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under an agreement reached among the commander of the 19th Ranam division, the chief of the military police and provincial governors, more than 30 \"comfort stations\" for the exclusive use by servicemen were built in Phunggok-dong, Ranam District of Chongjin City in North Hamgyong Province in 1928 and women were taken away from across the Korean Peninsula for their operation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The operation to abduct Korean women was carried out by the Government-General in Korea, a machine of the Japanese imperialists for their colonial rule over it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their abduction operation baffled human imagination in its barbarous and vicious nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They openly abducted women the way reminiscent of the \"slave hunting\" in the Middle Ages. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese and Pacific wars the Japanese imperialists abducted Korean women on a larger scale and took them away to vast areas of Asia.\r\n 200,000 Korean women were forcibly taken to China, India, Indonesia, Philippines and other areas occupied by the Japanese imperialists and the areas where the Japanese troops were stationed 146,000 of whom lost their lives in alien lands. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists' abduction issue should have been solved in the last century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries, however, have not made reparation for the above-said crimes even today though several years have passed in the new century. They are now totally denying and distorting the historical fact itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is taking much pain to deny the coercive nature of the crimes perpetrated by government authority and military power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the consistent assertion of the Japanese authorities that \"there is no knowing about whether there was any forcible drafting by businessmen against the will of abductees but there was no forcible drafting by the Japanese army and officials.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind this assertion is its aim to cover up its disgusting image as the world's worst abductor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is ill-famed for having committed many cases of abduction for a long period of time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the 20th century called the century of civilization the Japanese imperialists openly abducted and drafted not only women but more than 8.4 million young and middle-aged Korean men. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is now persisting in its abduction operation against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Historical facts go to prove that Japan has always been an assailant against Koreans in the matter of abduction and the DPRK its victim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is that the present Japanese rulers have again raised the \"abduction\" of a few Japanese which had already found a solution while keeping mum about the Japanese imperialists' abduction of Koreans in the 20th century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Prime Minister Fukuda, when interviewed by CNN TV, asserted that the DPRK must settle the \"abduction issue\" if it wants financial aid from Japan and the Japanese foreign minister at a press conference claimed that it is the policy of the present Cabinet to solve the abduction issue in a substantial way. These are just a few examples. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities' noisy row over the \"abduction issue\" is prompted by their foolish intention to cover up the abduction crimes committed by Japan for hundreds of years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present Japanese authorities are following in the footsteps of their preceding cabinet ill-famed for raising the \"abduction issue\" even after the regime change there. This proves that they are not willing to make any apology or reparation for the abduction crimes they committed against the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There can never be any progress in the improvement of the DPRK-Japan relations as long as Japan stakes its fate on the \"abduction issue.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind the Japanese reactionaries' denial of the coercive nature of the crimes related to the \"comfort women\" and a hue and cry raised by them over the \"abduction issue\" is their black-hearted intention to paint the vicious assailant as a victim in a bid to cover up their crimes and evade their responsibility to redress them once and for all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army is a crime against humanity which can never be written off no matter how much water may flow under the bridge and how many generations are replaced by others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will never pardon the crimes committed by Japan against Koreans generation after generation but certainly force it to pay for those crimes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And it attended the summit of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf held in Qatar and channeled every effort to a solution to the regional problem, supporting the initiative of Arab countries for the settlement of the Lebanese issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nNow the U.S. moves to isolate and stifle Iran are meeting with rebuff from the International community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIts attempt to apply additional sanctions to Iran ended abortive at the United Nations Security Council recently. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRussia decided to deliver 82 tons of nuclear fuel to the Bushehr Atomic Power Plant in Iran and transported all of it in eight instalments by Jan. 28 this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe relations between Iran and other Arab states are on the improvement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSome time ago the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf invited the Iranian president to its summit conference and Saudi Arabia invited him to a pilgrimage to Mecca. This was something without precedent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nGrowing louder in the U.S. administration itself are voices calling for a change in its Iranian policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nFacts prove that the U.S. policy to isolate and stifle Iran is facing a breakdown and its clamor for sanctions and pressure is anachronistic.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
