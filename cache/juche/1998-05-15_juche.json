It was not until he acquainted himself with the result while inspecting KPA units that he felt easy.\r\n   He made sure that a modern salt refinery was built for the sake of the soldiers, saying that only when salt tastes good can  soy, bean paste and non-staple foodstuffs be delicious.\r\n   Some time ago, he called at the newly-built salt refinery, tasted salt and noted with great satisfaction that his desire to supply tasty soy and salt  of good quality to the servicemen had been realised.    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n"

Moreover, it is hard to understand that they are remarks of a person  styling himself as an expert in the issue of the Korean peninsula.\r\n   As is well known to the world, the cause of the political and military tensions on the Korean peninsula is the U.S. troops' occupation of South Korea, arms buildup and the war exercises ceaselessly staged to isolate and stifle the DPRK.\r\n   Bosworth probably knows well that this does not suit the spirit of the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework nor comply with the purpose of the \"four-way talks\" aimed at ensuring peace on the Korean peninsula.\r\n   Nevertheless, he showed up at the meeting of South Korean extreme rightists, where he hurled slanders at the DPRK and cried for \"deterrent to war.\" This cannot be construed otherwise than an undisguised war agitation and provocation.\r\n   His rigmarole fully reveals the true intention of the United States to keep its colonial rule over South Korea, not abandoning its anachronistic Korea policy. Accordingly, this cannot be pardoned under any circumstances.\r\n   The United States must abandon its ulterior design to keep the Korean nation divided into two in defiance of the will of the Korean people for national reunification and dominate them, going against the trend of the era of independence, and must withdraw its troops from South Korea. \r\n\r\n"
