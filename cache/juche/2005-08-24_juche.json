However, the Japanese imperialists forged the ratification of the Korean king for the above-said treaty in gross breach of international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"annexation treaty\" has already been recognized as illegal one by the United Nations, and the Japanese imperialists, too, had no way but to admit that the treaty had no legality and validity. This can be proved by the fact that they kept the fabricated treaty as a top secret and announced it to the world on August 29, one week after its concoction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reactionaries of Japan are now claiming that the annexation of Korea by Japan was \"lawful\" and the Korean people \"benefited\" from Japan's colonial rule although it committed such hideous crime of violating international law. This illogical assertion is an intolerable insult and a mockery of the Korean people.\r\n It is the will of the Koreans to certainly force Japan, their sworn enemy, to pay for its past crimes no matter how much water may flow under the bridge and how many times generations are replaced, the article says, urging Japan to settle its crime-woven past as early as possible.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a positive and encouraging development which proves that no desperate efforts on the part of the reactionaries at home and abroad can block the process of reconciliation, peace and independent reunification in the Korean Peninsula and the movement for achieving independent reunification in the spirit of \"By our nation itself\" is sure to triumph.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint slogans made public by the Central Committee and the Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the WPK call upon all the Korean people to achieve fresh successes and greater progress in the present struggle for independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is, indeed, painful that the Korean nation has not yet achieved the country's reunification though 60 years have passed since its division. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The national division that persists even in this new century has brought untold misfortune and pain to all Koreans, hindering the uniform development of the nation.\r\n It is a solemn call of history and an urgent demand of the times to bring about a fresh surge in the movement for independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now is the time to more dynamically push ahead with the movement for national reunification on a new stage of development and bring about a landmark phase for independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was a very timely and patriotic step that the joint slogans called for opening a landmark phase for independent reunification in this significant year.\r\n It is necessary to hold fast to the principle of national reunification and thoroughly implement the tasks laid down by the joint slogans. Doing so is a shortcut to advancing the movement for independent reunification to steady victory. \r\nThe Korean nation's will for independent reunification is strong and their fighting spirit is sky-high. No force on earth can stand in the way of the Korean nation as it is equipped with the conscience of national independence and strong will for independent reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
