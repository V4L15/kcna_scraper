Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 26 (KCNA) -- Anti-U.S. sentiment is mounting in South Korea following Bush's argument about the \"axis of evil\", according to a news report.\r\n The South Korean newspaper Munhwa Ilbo and Radio Seoul conducted a joint opinion poll on Feb. 15 and 16. as a result, 73.1 percent of those  polled said that Bush's remarks were improper as they had a negative impact on the south-north relations and the situation in northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to an opinion poll conducted by the MBC on Feb. 18, 67 percent of the respondents said that bush's hardline policy towards the north is \"not right\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In an opinion poll conducted by a specialized institution 70 percent of the respondents voiced opposition to Bush's remarks and six of ten pollees said that his remarks were prompted by the situation in the U.S. mainland including an off-year election and the interests of the Bush administration in the establishment of the missile defense system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Besides, for more than half respondents noted that Bush's visit to South Korea would not help improve the inter-Korean relations. Answering the question \"what will you do if the U.S. tries to mount an armed attack on the north\" put by MBC, 83 percent of the pollees said \"attack should be opposed.\"     \r\n\r\n"

It was brazen-faced for Ri Hoe Chang, president of an opposition party, to defend the U.S. imperialists' gangster-like logic and even urge the DPRK to come out to \"settle the issue.\" He supported their scenario for a war against the north while groundlessly slandering the DPRK though it has made all its sincere efforts for national reconciliation, peace and reunification. This is only touching off the nation's bitter wrath and indignation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In echoing his master's remarks about the \"axis of evil\" power-hungry Ri sought a sinister aim. His preoccupation is to become next \"President\" of South Korea in return for currying favour with the U.S. seized by war hysteria. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation will never pardon U.S. servant Ri Hoe Chang but make him pay a thousand-fold price for his crimes.  \r\n\r\n"

He did not let his car drive across the railway cross till the train passed it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the early morning of a May Day of Juche 81 (1992) the president left Pyongyang for Kaesong on field guidance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When he reached a point not far from Kaesong, the president told the chauffeur to stop the car and proposed to have a brief rest and breakfast. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Officials who accompanied him were at a loss what to do because he and his entourage were supposed to have a breakfast in the city. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Guessing their embarrassment, the president told them not to worry as he had made sure that breakfast boxes were prepared. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then he asked his aide to give a box to each, adding it is good for them to spare time and not to cause any trouble to Kaesong citizens. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He continued his journey after taking boiled rice and some seasoned greens. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is another anecdote about his noble personality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It happened on march 13, Juche 47 (1958) when he dropped in at a department store during his field guidance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He paused before a socks counter and asked to buy a pair of cotton socks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A salesgirl hesitated to give him poor quality socks, a product of a local industrial factory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Guessing her awkward position, the president said that was why he wanted to try them on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The president bought the socks, adding why he should not wear the socks while people were using them.     \r\n\r\n"
