He went the length of allowing \"the trusteeship\" called \"IMF system\" and selling off the South Korean economy to the outsiders lock, stock and barrel.\r\n   While keeping the indiscrimate, humiliating agreement with IMF from the public, he is now crying for its \"early implementation\", while imposing \"pain sharing\" upon the workers and other labouring people of South Korea.\r\n   In fact, he is trying to shift the responsibility for his crime onto others, which cannot be allowed at all.\r\n   Even a recent issue of the Newsweek said there would be \"a national assembly hearing\" over the responsibility for the present crisis of South Korea.    \r\n\r\n"
