A radical change should take place in south korea in order to achieve the reunification of korea at an early date, it said.\r\n   It stated that the U.S. troops should withdraw from South Korea as early as possible, taking along with them all their nuclear weapons so that the Korean people may achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the country by means of founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo on the three principles of national reunification.    \r\n \r\n"

He went the length of allowing \"the trusteeship\" called \"IMF system\" and selling off the South Korean economy to the outsiders lock, stock and barrel.\r\n   While keeping the indiscrimate, humiliating agreement with IMF from the public, he is now crying for its \"early implementation\", while imposing \"pain sharing\" upon the workers and other labouring people of South Korea.\r\n   In fact, he is trying to shift the responsibility for his crime onto others, which cannot be allowed at all.\r\n   Even a recent issue of the Newsweek said there would be \"a national assembly hearing\" over the responsibility for the present crisis of South Korea.    \r\n\r\n"
