            "content": "Definite solutions to international disputes called for \r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 16 (KCNA) -- In order to settle disputes in various regions it is necessary to make a serious review of the lessons drawn from international disputes that occurred in the past and seek definite solutions to them, says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that international disputes still remain unsettled and this teaches serious lessons, the article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The first lesson is that a final solution to international disputes cannot be expected before the root cause of the disputes is removed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Experiences prove that any agreements made as a result of temporary compromises and bargaining, sidestepping the root cause of disputes, have neither effect nor guarantee and they are fragile. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world gap between the rich and the poor, difference in the level of social development and the adoption by a country and nation of a political mode not suited to its tradition and specific conditions may serve as a cause of disputes. And the eradication of the leftover of the Cold War is one of the ways of removing the root cause of disputes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historical root cause of various disputes should not be discounted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another lesson is that the parties involved in the dispute should sit face to face to seek correct principles and solutions and guard against the sinister attempt of those forces which try to edge themselves into the dispute in a bid to meet their own interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is most reasonable and effective for the parties in dispute to be responsible for its settlement and discuss its right ways and principles and put them into practice. This alone can lead to a right solution to the dispute. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to discuss proper measures of the international community to settle disputes and build an international mechanism capable of putting an end to disputes and ensuring durable and lasting peace as early as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some forces take other's misfortune as a good chance of meeting their own interests. They arbitrarily get involved in disputes in a bid to settle it with their own yardstick. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to guard against Japan which is keen on getting involved in international disputes under the signboard of \"peace keeping mission.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n International efforts for the settlement of disputes can prove successful only when they are exerted on right principles and in the right direction. \r\n\r\n"

It happened when he visited the first-stage construction site of the Anbyon Youth Power Station in a day of June, Juche 85 (1996) when it was close to completion. It rained from early morning. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Upon arrival there Kim Jong Il warmly waved to the soldiers who were cheering him, braving downpour. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His dress was dripping wet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When an official accompanying Kim Jong Il held an umbrella above his head, he told the official to close the umbrella,  and exchanged greetings with the soldiers caught in the rain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then the Supreme Commander instructed that the soldiers should be let go into their quarters quickly lest they should catch a cold. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But they did not move until he went up to the observation platform to enjoy a bird's-eye view of the construction site. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He instructed the officers to ensure that soldiers are not caught in the rain, adding that he could not do any work before they went back to their quarters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact he did not inspect the construction site until he was sure that all of them were back to their quarters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is just an example showing the ties of kinship between the Supreme Commander and his soldiers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He shared without reserve a simple meal with soldiers while providing on-the-spot guidance to KPA units. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Feeling regretful for leaving a unit without seeing an art performance prepared by its soldiers, he went back there in the night to watch it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That is why all soldiers of the KPA are holding him in high esteem not only as their supreme commander but as their father and preparing themselves as a fortress and shield devotedly defending him. \r\n\r\n"
