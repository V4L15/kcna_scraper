This stirring reality goes to prove once again the validity and vitality of the line of the Workers' Party of Korea on simultaneously pushing forward economic construction and the building of nuclear force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will make as ever a dynamic struggle for fundamentally remove the danger of a nuclear war being imposed by the U.S. in reliance on strong defence capacity with the nuclear deterrence as a pivot and for defending peace in the region and the rest of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK with the nuclear treasured sword of justice has already declared the ruin of the era of sanctions and pressure over the nuclear issue."
