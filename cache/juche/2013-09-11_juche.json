Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says this in an article. \n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The July 4 joint statement the main contents of which are the three principles of national reunification was issued in the 1970s and the spirit of independent reunification mounted in the nationwide scale in the 1980s and 1990s. In the new century \"By Korean nation itself\" has become the idea of reunification common to the nation. All these are the results of the strenuous efforts made by the nation for national reunification on the principle of national independence. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to the DPRK's patriotic policy and broadminded practices, the way for dialogue and negotiations was opened in the relations between the north and the south that were in a deadlock in the 1970s and a new phase for national reunification movement was provided. The national reunification movement has turned into the nationwide patriotic movement in the 1980s and 1990s. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the 2000s the north-south summit was made the first of its kind since the partition of Korea and the June 15 joint declaration the basic idea of which is \"By Korean nation itself\" and the October 4 declaration were adopted. These were the historical events of the nation which set the stage for further developing the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Presidium of the DPRK Supreme People's Assembly adopted a decision on pushing forward the peaceful reunification of the country out of the responsibility to protect the security of the nation and peace of the country in mid-June of 1950 when the war provocative moves of the U.S. and Syngman Rhee traitorous group in south Korea reached the extreme phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the war, the DPRK government put forward fair line and policies for removing the military confrontation between the north and the south, easing tension and achieving peaceful reunification of the country and called upon all the Koreans to implement them despite of the persistent moves for a new war by the U.S. and south Korean warlike forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The military provocations of the anti-DPRK hostile forces still go on and the DPRK is exercising utmost restraint for peace."

Korea\r\n Pyongyang, September 11 (KCNA) -- Over 490 social bodies including the south Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, Teachers Union, and the Institute for National Studies held a joint press conference in Kwanghwamun plaza in Seoul on Sept. 5 declaring invalid the results of screening of the history textbooks embellishing pro-Japanese elements and dictators.\n\t\t\t\t\t At the press conference the organizations said: The results of screening of history textbooks which the Committee for Compiling History Textbooks approved were written by historians with neo-conservative leanings. They, therefore, referred to the \"theory of modernizing the colony\" which claims that \"the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule over Korea helped step up its modernization\" and do not mention at length the Japanese imperialists' mass killing of Koreans during the great Kanto quake, the sexual slavery enforced  by them, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The bodies slammed the textbook writers for praising sycophants and dictators, namely the \"yusin\" dictator, while misrepresenting and playing down the historic significance of the April 19 popular uprising, the May 18 Kwangju popular resistance and the June popular resistance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that those textbooks negate the peaceful reunification as those were written to stoke hostility and hatred towards the north, they said that the books would instill bellicose and Cold War-minded outlook on the world into the students.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe committee approved the screened textbooks which describe even those persons on \"the list of pro-Japanese elements\" as patriots. This is a revelation of the attempt to embellish the past crimes of Japan and pro-Japanese acts and wrong doings perpetrated by traitors to the nation, sycophants and fascist dictators.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They expressed their determination to launch activities to have the approved textbooks invalid in solidarity with the people from all walks of life."

The world peace and security would be unthinkable without peace and security on the peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The peninsula still remains a hotspot in Northeast Asia and the biggest source of war in the world for its geopolitical importance. South Korea is the biggest advanced base in the Fareast where U.S. nuclear weapons are massively stockpiled. U.S. modern armed forces including nuclear-powered aircraft carriers are concentrated in south Korea, Japan and their vicinities and DPRK-targeted war exercises are staged frequently. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If a new war breaks out in Korea, not only the Korean Peninsula but also Asia and the rest of the world will suffer inescapable war disasters. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its neighboring countries will have no option but to get involved in the war and it will spill over to a vast region of the world including those countries which have strategic interests in the region. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts go to prove that unless the situation in the peninsula is stabilized, that in the Asia-Pacific region can hardly be stable and, furthermore, the world cannot be in peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the reason why stability and peace on the peninsula are directly linked with the destiny of the whole mankind and the issue of ensuring world peace. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the steadfast will of the Korean people to unite with all the peace-loving forces of the world and achieve durable peace and stability and protect peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world."

Asi quiere impulsar la construccion de un Estado prospero en un ambiente pacifico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ahora en la RPDC comienza la epoca de saltos seculares y prosperidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Toma auge la campana para construir cuanto antes el mas civilizado y desarrollado Estado socialista del Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Para el pueblo coreano que debe movilizar toda la potencialidad y creatividad en la causa para la prosperidad del pais y la nacion, resulta mas importante que nada el ambiente pacifico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Procurar esa atmosfera en la Peninsula Coreana deviene requisito de la paz mundial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Es decir, la paz y seguridad de la Peninsula Coreana estan vinculadas directamente con la paz y seguridad del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Tanto en el pasado como hoy, la Peninsula Coreana es la zona candente del Noreste Asiatico y el foco de guerra mas peligroso del mundo, lo cual se atribuye a su importancia geopolitica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El Sur de Corea es la base avanzada nuclear mas grande del Extremo Oriente donde estan desplegadas muchas armas nucleares de Estados Unidos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En los alrededores de la Peninsula Coreana incluyendo el Sur de Corea y Japon, estan emplazadas modernas fuerzas armadas del imperio como el portaaviones de propulsion nuclear y se libran con frecuencia los ejercicios belicos contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Si estalla la nueva guerra coreana, la Peninsula Coreana, Asia y el resto del mundo sufririan calamidades irreparables.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Los paises perifericos se verian obligados a involucrar en esa guerra que se extenderia a amplias zonas del mundo, incluyendo los paises con intereses estrategicos en la region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Los hechos demuestran que si no se estabiliza la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana, tampoco estara en paz la region de Asia-Pacifico ni el mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por eso, se dice que la estabilidad y la paz de la Peninsula Coreana son un problema importante relacionado con el destino de toda la humanidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Es invariable la voluntad de la RPDC de lograr la paz duradera y estabilidad de la Peninsula Coreana y defender la paz y la seguridad de Asia y el mundo entero uniendose con todas las fuerzas pacifistas del mundo."
