Perplejo de eso, EE.UU. trato de crear la \"Comandancia de las Fuerzas Combinadas\" con el fin de apoderarse indefinidamente del Sur de Corea como su colonia y base militar estrategica y  dar mas acicate a sus aventureras maniobras belicas para invadir al Norte de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEn noviembre de 1978, EE.UU. promulgo la \"guia estrategica No.1\" para fundar la \"Comandancia de las Fuerzas Combinadas\" en el Sur de Corea y entregar a esta la autoridad de mando operacional de la \"Comandancia de las Fuerzas de Naciones Unidas\" a las tropas norteamericanas ocupantes del Sur de Corea y el ejercito titere surcoreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDebido a la creacion de este aparato se profundizo aun mas la dependencia militar del Sur de Corea a EE.UU. y se aumento la peligrosidad de la provocacion de nueva guerra en la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDesde 1978 en que se fabrico la nueva comandancia, el simulacro \"Team Spirit\" que  suponia la agresion al Norte de Corea se fortalecio como ejercicio de gran envergadura en que participaron mas de 100 mil efectivos y, a la larga, mas de 200 mil.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBajo el plan y el mando de esta comandancia, se desarrollaron casi diariamente los \"ejercicios combinados de refuerzo para tiempo de guerra\",  los \"Ulji Focus Lens\", los \"Aguilucho\" y otros ejercicios militares conjuntos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTambien, despues de iniciada la epoca del 15 de Junio para la reconciliacion y la cooperacion en la Peninsula Coreana, no cambio nada de la naturaleza  agresiva y belicosa de esta comandancia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSe trazaron el \"Plan operacional 5030\", \"Nuevo plan operacional 5026\", \"Plan operacional 8022-02\" y otros planes de guerra de agresion al Norte, y se libraron freneticamente los ejercicios belicos para aplicarlos en la guerra real.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTan solo en el ano en curso, la \"Comandancia de las Fuerzas Combinadas\" sustituyo los titulos de los \"ejercicios combinados de refuerzo para el tiempo de guerra\" y los \"Ulji Focus Lens\" por los \"Key Resolve\" y  los \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\" y no cesa de desplegar los ejercicios para introducir en el frente coreano las tropas agresoras norteamericanas en el interior y exterior.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTales ejercicios belicos y aumento armamentista ejercen la mala influencia sobre las relaciones intercoreanas y desalientan el fervor de los connacionales a la reunificacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEs por eso que el pueblo surcoreano demanda energicamente la disolucion de la \"Comandancia de las Fuerzas Combinadas\" que perturba la paz y obstaculiza la reunificacion en Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPor lo tanto, debe ser disuelta sin demora la \"Comandancia de las Fuerzas Combinadas\" Surcoreano-Estadounidense, aparato de guerra agresiva que crea  permanentemente el ambiente belico y exacerba la tension en la Peninsula Coreana."
