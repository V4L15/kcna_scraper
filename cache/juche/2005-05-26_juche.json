It is their invariable intention to stifle the DPRK by all means including a preemptive attack on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have already listed the DPRK as a target of their preemptive nuclear attack and worked out an operational plan to implement it. This patently proves the absurdity and hypocrisy of their loudmouthed \"diplomatic solution\" to the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Washington is talking about the resumption of the six-party talks while making oft-repeated assertion that it stands for the diplomatic solution of the nuclear issue and it puts stress on the negotiated settlement of the issue. But the United States has not stood for the diplomatic solution of the nuclear issue since the outset. The U.S. much publicized \"diplomatic solution\" is nothing but rhetoric intended to deceive the world community.It is behind the smokescreen of the \"diplomatic solution\" that the U.S. is rounding off its preparations to stage a preemptive attack and a nuclear war against the DPRK any moment. The U.S. bellicose forces' ambition to stifle the DPRK through preemptive nuclear attacks is getting more serious and dangerous as the days go by.\r\n They are sadly mistaken if they calculate they can frighten the DPRK with the \"OPLAN 8022-02\" to achieve their aggressive aim.    \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It has achieved great success in the struggle to protect the national rights of Koreans in Japan through a dynamic national patriotic movement and devoted itself to the prosperity and progress of the socialist homeland and the country's reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chongryon has been beset with the biggest ordeal since its formation due to the moves of the reactionaries inside and outside Japan in recent years.\r\nHowever, Chongryon officials and Koreans in Japan, regarding Kim Jong Il as their mental mainstay, have firmly defended Chongryon and carried on their unyielding patriotic activities for the sake of their country and nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il's idea and leadership serve as the first lifeline of Chongryon and banner for winning sure victory. Remaining true to his idea and leadership provides a guarantee for further glorifying the idea of the Juche-oriented overseas compatriots movement and the immortal leadership exploits of the President and strengthening and developing Chongryon into an eternal overseas compatriots organization of the President and bringing a brighter future and greater victory to Chongryon and Koreans in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK which was founded by the President and is led by Kim Jong Il is the genuine motherland for the Koreans in Japan. The authority and might of the Songun homeland precisely mean those of Chongryon and the homeland's honor and dignity those of the Koreans in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in Japan should resolutely struggle to defend the socialist homeland and continue to make tangible contributions to its prosperity and\r\nthe cause of building a great prosperous powerful nation with ardent patriotism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chongryon and Koreans in Japan are called upon to wage a more vigorous movement for independent reunification, strengthen the friendship with the\r\nJapanese people and international solidarity and create a favorable environment for Chongryon's patriotic work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only victory and glory are always in store for Chongryon and the movement of Koreans in Japan dynamically advancing along the path of Juche and\r\npatriotism, sharing the destiny with the people in the socialist homeland. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson notes that Chongryon will win victory after victory along with the Songun homeland led by Kim Jong Il.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They have also displayed a high degree of patriotism for the development of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe grand monumental edifices erected in different parts of the homeland and the splendid successes made in the socialist construction are associated with their patriotic sincerity and unassuming efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chongryon has led broad sections of Koreans in Japan in the efforts for achieving the unity of the nation and fully supported south Korean people and students in their patriotic struggle for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has also strengthened friendship with the peoples of Japan and other countries and expanded relations with international organizations, greatly contributing to creating an international climate favorable for the movement of Koreans in Japan and the reunification of the homeland.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Blasts U.S. Ambition for \"Unipolar World\"\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 25 (KCNA) -- The U.S. arbitrary practices to dominate the international arena are unlimited.\r\n Recently the U.S. has drawn up a list of \"unstable states\" in secrecy.\r\n The list is said to include the DPRK and 24 other countries which the National Intelligence Committee selected as the \"extremely dangerous or unstable countries\" at the request of the U.S. administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The point at issue is that the list was premised on the necessary U.S. intervention under the pretext of \"the settlement of dispute\" and \"peace.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is an open attempt to invent a pretext for meddling in the internal affairs of other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has been busy working out \"international black lists\" under various names in recent years in a bid to attain its target of \"world strategy.\"\r\n  Involved in it are not only the U.S. administration including the CIA but Congress and \"think tanks\" which influence state policy-making. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Put on the lists are countries situated in the regions of strategic importance and countries \"systems and value\" of which the U.S. deems can be changed and used in countering their neighboring potential powers. Namely those countries which disobey the U.S. over political and economic issues and regional matters are on the lists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On those lists the U.S. labeled those countries as part of an \"axis of evil,\" \"outposts of tyranny,\" \"bankrupt states,\" \"sponsors of terrorism,\" \"violators of religious freedom,\" \"major drug producers and purchasers,\" etc. It, at the same time, classified the countries into the category against which force would be used. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has become premeditated and persistent in its moves to build up public opinion in favor of \"justifying\" its monstrous crimes such as isolating and encircling those countries and applying sanctions against them and mounting even military attacks on them and overturning their governments.\r\n Its smear campaign against the DPRK is part of these moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is working hard to impair the DPRK's international image by creating impression that it is a \"challenger to the call of the international community\" in a bid to bring about an atmosphere favorable for implementing its policy and totally stifle it politically and militarily in the end. This is the orientation of present U.S. policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The gravity of such moves of the U.S. lies in that they are, in essence, prompted by its extreme ambition to overthrow and eliminate the countries contrary to the American view on value and anti-U.S. independent countries one by one and thus convert the world into a \"unipolar world\" dominated by it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. succeeded in seeking regime changes in Afghanistan, Iraq and some other countries and regions through military attacks and interference in others' internal affairs under the pretexts of \"combating terrorism\" and \"spreading democracy.\" Having got extremely arrogant, the U.S. is behaving like a world \"emperor\" wherever it goes in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is seriously mistaken if it thinks its unilateralism can always work on the present times.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's Fax Message on Its Claim to Tok Islet Sent Back\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 25 (KCNA) -- The Japanese government sent to the DPRK embassy in Beijing through its embassy there a ridiculous fax message to the effect that Tok Islet is an inalienable part of the territory of Japan, it can not tolerate the DPRK's issue of stamps on the islet and this is a breach of the charter and spirit of the Universal Postal Union.\r\n In this regard the DPRK embassy sent back the message to the Japanese embassy on May 20, informing it of the resolute stand of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its notice says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the undeniable historical fact that Tok islet belongs to the territory of Korea. Not only historical materials of the north and the south of Korea but those of Japan and other countries of the world prove this hard fact. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation's dominium over the islet is inviolable and there can be neither bargaining nor compromise over it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is understandable that Japan is poorly informed of the history of other country. But Japan seems to be ignorant of even its historical records that recognized the fact that Tok Islet has belonged to Korea throughout its history. This cannot be construed otherwise than a lack of common sense of history or its deliberate distortion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Accordingly, we send back the fax message from the Japanese side, terming it a ridiculous one as it is not worth any consideration or acceptance.\r\n We would like to stress once again that Japan's any argument about Tok Islet will only stoke the anti-Japanese sentiment among all Koreans. Japan's claim to the islet is as foolish an act as trying to sweep the sea with a broom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is now going reckless in its moves to realize its ambition for territorial expansion in the Asian region, backed by the United States, unaware of its position. But the crimes committed by it in the 20th century are indelible. They will always remain in history despite the flow of time and the replacement of the old century by a new one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The provocative act of Japan only heightens the Koreans' vigilance and hardens their stand on how they should approach Japan in the future.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
