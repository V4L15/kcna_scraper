Korea's Scattering of Anti-DPRK Leaflets\r\nPyongyang, March 29 (KCNA) -- The north-south relations have been driven into a catastrophic phase again due to the south Korean authorities' frantic scattering of anti-DPRK leaflets. The spokesman for the north side's delegation to the north-south high-level contact issued a statement revealing its gravity on Friday.\n\t\t\t\t\t It says: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities headed by Park Geun Hye dared take issue with the nuclear issue of their fellow countrymen outside Korea. Inside south Korea they are busy openly encouraging the operation to scatter leaflets against fellow countrymen and smear campaign against them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ceaseless leaflet scattering operation in south Korea is an open breach of the valuable agreement reached between the north and the south and the most serious act of treachery that can never be pardoned.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The north and the south reached a historic agreement at the high-level contact on February 14 in which they solemnly stated to the nation that they would refrain from slandering each other.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the situation is quite contrary to our expectation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is because the pledge which south Korea made upon authorization of Park Geun Hye turned out to be a smokescreen to cover up the leaflet scattering operation that was carried out at the connivance of the authorities and the smear campaign against the north that has gone beyond the tolerance limit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We cannot but query is it Park's style negotiating tactics to produce a honeyed agreement in a bid to attain her goal and is it her special skill for \"confidence-building\" as she is unhesitatingly reneging on the agreement under such absurd pretexts as \"nature of social system\" and \"freedom of speech\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The leaflet scattering operation and smear campaign against the DPRK going beyond the tolerance limit are undisguised acts of declaring a war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park named the leaflet scattering against the DPRK a \"balloon operation\" and is making sure that a military posture is taken to cope with the possible counterattack of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the long run, this tells that she is aware that a leaflet scattering operation conducted under the signboard of \"balloon operation\" is a dangerous source of a military retaliation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We have long regarded the leaflet scattering by the south side as a declaration of a war and papers for sentencing death to human scum who orchestrated the leaflet scattering operations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Does she really want to see such leaflets becoming a source of war for reducing the base of provocations to ashes?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She should bear in mind that now is the time to make a choice herself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The more desperately Park is hurling betesnoires and conservative media into the smear campaign against fellow countrymen, the deeper she will find herself in an inescapable quagmire.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those who go frantic with the anti-DPRK leaflet scattering and smear campaign against compatriots going against the trend of the times can never be called human beings with normal way of thinking and fair media persons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All of them are without exception betesnoires disqualified to be members of the nation and top class criminals who will not be able to live in the peaceful and stable reunified country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The more zealously Pak harbors betesnoires, the worse smell she will feel. In the long run, she will earn the ill fame of being an owner of huge dumping ground.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ethics and morality are more important than politics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A politician should be more human than any others and pursue justice and truth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Otherwise she will consider the presidential chair as a commanding tower for smear campaign and make no scruple of throwing the nation into an abyss of misfortune by misusing it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean authorities are to have an elementary face to appear before the DPRK side, they should properly implement the north-south agreement, to begin with.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All compatriots are closely watching the moves of the south Korean authorities."

The spokesman for the Democratic Lawyers Association of Korea Saturday released a statement disclosing the illegality of the decision.\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement says:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The illegality of the decision finds its vivid manifestation in that the court selected a disqualified company as a successful bidder by fraud and swindle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Tokyo District Court had delayed the announcement of the results of auction of the Korean Hall of Chongryon, which was made in October of 2013. On March 20, it reopened the tenders for it for no reason all of a sudden and made the decision to allow the sale to the Marunaka Holdings Co. Ltd., Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As far as the above-said company is concerned, it had already been disqualified as it underbid others in October last year and took back bid bond from the court.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In particular, it is a precedent of the Japanese courts that in case the relevant court returned the bid bond to a disqualified company it would not make a decision to allow the sale to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Therefore, it was a crude violation of the law in every aspect that the court chose the above-said company as a successful bidder.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The illegality of the decision of the Tokyo District Court is also evidenced by the double-dealing attitude of the Resolution and Collection Corporation, a creditor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the issue of the Korean Hall presented itself, the Corporation made a hostile and discriminating demand that Chongryon should repay a total amount plus interest though it has settled issues with other debtors in a friendly manner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the Corporation kept mum about the decision of the Tokyo District Court to sell the Korean Hall at a price less than half the actual one.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese authorities has long regarded the Korean Hall of Chongryon on which the flag of the DPRK is fluttering as a thorn in their flesh and run the whole gamut of plots to seize it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That was why the Tokyo District Court staged an unprecedented farce in disregard of the Japanese law, precedents of the courts and practices of the basic procedures for tenders\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Democratic Lawyers Association of Korea categorically rejects the decision of the Tokyo District Court and declares internally and externally that the illegal decision is invalid, the statement says.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese authorities had better halt their moves to seize the Korean Hall, though belatedly, if it thinks of its face as a \"law-governed state\" even a bit and has real intention to improve the relations with the DPRK, the statement concludes."

And the two other clippers sailed close to our boat on its both sides, forcing it to sail southward.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As it grew completely dark, our engine stopped again, making it impossible to move any more.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The clippers completely encircled our boat, brandishing iron sticks and throwing iron hooks at it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We fell unconscious, hit hard by iron sticks of the enemies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was when the boat arrived in a place believed to be a pier of Paekryong Island that we came back to our senses. We were shackled and blindfolded.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hooligans of the puppet army took us to a certain building by a truck and asked us ages, names and others. They also asked us one by one if we had any idea of surrendering. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We did not answer but just said we were fishermen and would go to the embrace of the respected Marshal at once.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The enemies tried hard to make us change our minds, saying that \"Come over to the south. If you surrender, we will make you live well. We will provide you with living conditions and jobs.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sailors fought back the enemies, defying their appeasement and pressure in order to come back to the fold of the motherland.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t So, they could come back to the embrace of the motherland at around 02:00 on Friday.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Rim Chun Su said that it was only after he came back home that he learned the group of puppet hooligans could not but send them back in a great haste in the face of the strong measures taken by the motherland. He added: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was just several hours that we fought hard against the barbaric acts and pressure of the enemies to put us to submission.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t While fighting back the enemies, we realized what type the enemies were and made up our minds to settle accounts with them to the last.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We also keenly realized through our experience the immutable truth that there is nothing to be afraid of and that we are sure to win even though we are left alone in the vast sea or are put in custody by the enemies as long as there is the respected Marshal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We firmly pledge to make redoubled efforts to carry out our revolutionary tasks with surging indignation at the enemies who are running amuck to hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and its social system and thus further glorify our country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then the sailors answered questions raised by reporters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the press conference the participants watched a video dealing with the atrocities committed by the hooligans of the south Korean puppet army against the peaceable boat and personnel of the DPRK."

            "content": "Portavoz de AJDC denuncia la ilegalidad de resolucion de Corte Local de Tokio\r\nPyongyang, 29 de marzo (ACNC) -- En relacion con que la Corte Local de Tokio de Japon dicto la resolucion de permitir la venta del predio y el edificio de la Casa Central de la Chongryon (conocida como Casa Coreana) bajo el control trasero de las autoridades japonesas, la Asociacion de Juristas Democraticos de Corea (AJDC) hizo publica el dia 29 una declaracion revelando y denunciando la ilegalidad de esa decision.\n\t\t\t\t\tLa nota senala como sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa ilegalidad se manifiesta coherentemente en haber presentado con fraudes y estafas al licitador inhabil.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa Corte Local de Tokio retardo la publicacion del resultado de la subasta sobre la Casa Coreana, realizada en octubre de 2013.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin motivos justos, repitio de repente el dia 20 la licitacion y tomo la decision de permitir la venta a la compania japonesa Marunaka Holdings Co. Ltd.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta compania fue descalificada ya en la subasta de octubre del ano pasado por sus muy pocas ofertas y recibio el dinero de garantia de licitacion que le ha devuelto la corte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs una costumbre de juicio de los tribunales japoneses no autorizar la venta a la compania de tal antecedente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor lo tanto, la decision de definir a Marunaka Holdings Co. Ltd como licitadora resulta evidentemente en todos los aspectos un acto de violacion de la ley.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa ilegalidad se conoce tambien en la actitud dual de Corporacion de Resolucion y Coleccion, entidad acreedora.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Cuando surgio el problema de la Casa Coreana, la dicha corporacion busco la solucion mediante la reconciliacion con otros deudores, pero formulo la exigencia hostil y discriminatoria solo a la Chongryon de que reembolsara el monto de las deudas incluyendo hasta los intereses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  ?Por que habra guardado silencio esa organizacion tan calculadora ante la decision de la Corte Local de Tokio de autorizar la venta a precios baratos que no llegan ni a la mitad del valor de la Casa Coreana?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Historicamente, las autoridades japonesas consideraban la Casa Coreana, en que flamea la bandera de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea, como espina atravesada en la garganta y tramaron los complots de toda indole para arrebatarla.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En ese contexto, la Corte Local de Tokio orquesto esta vez dicha farsa nunca vista antes violando la ley de Japon, la costumbre de juicio de los tribunales y hasta los tramites de subasta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La AJDC protesta y rechaza rotundamente la decision de la Corte Local de Tokio y declara solemnemente al interior y exterior del pais la invalidez de ella.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Si las autoridades japonesas aprecian el decoro de su pais como \"Estado constitucional\" y desean la mejora de las relaciones con la RPDC, deberian sacar la mano de la campana para usurpar la Casa Coreana antes de que se haga tarde."
