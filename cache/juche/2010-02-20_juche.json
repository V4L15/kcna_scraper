Earlier, the U.S. secretary of Defense uttered that in case a war breaks out on the Korean Peninsula the U.S. would hurl its naval and air forces at its outset and additionally mobilize its ground force.\n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, the assistant secretary of Defense blustered the U.S. could win on the peninsula even without using nuclear weapons. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Saturday observes in a signed commentary in this regard: These reckless outbursts can be let loose only by those who consider the outbreak of the second Korean war as an established fact as they betray the invariable scenario of the U.S. to invade the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is paying lip-service to \"stability on the Korean Peninsula\" and \"the prevention of a war,\" but it has never given up its scenario for invading the DPRK and putting the whole of Korea under its domination.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. war-thirsty forces are making bellicose remarks, while holding confabs for invading the DPRK though it advanced an important and flexible proposal for concluding a peace treaty as the best way of building confidence for the denuclearization of the peninsula and has made every sincere effort for its materialization. This cannot be construed otherwise than an outright denial of peace and a declaration of a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is foolish and ridiculous for the U.S. to do harm to the DPRK by means of its naval and air force preponderance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the wildest fancy for the U.S. to stifle the DPRK by force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is sadly mistaken if it calculates it can go safe after igniting a war on the peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. bellicose forces had better behave themselves for the fate and future of their own country."
