Paektu to the academy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He called for erecting at the academy statues depicting smiling President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il, who trained a huge army of scientists and technicians and united them around the party as solid as a fortress, so that its scientists and technicians might always work and live, expressing their inmost feelings towards them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He looked round the revolutionary museum of the academy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underscored the need for the scientists and technicians to settle issues pending solution for economic development and the improvement of the people's living standard under a long-term plan and scientific and technological issues arising in realities and go beyond the cutting edge and thus make a shortcut to the building of knowledge-based economy so as to glorify the undying exploits Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il performed for the nation's development of science and technology to posterity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He spent hours to go round Manufactory No. 111, the IT Sci-Tech Institute and the Exhibition of Scientific Research Successes at the academy and learned in detail about scientific researches. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting science and technology is a driving force accelerating the building of a thriving nation, he set forth important tasks to be fulfilled to develop the nation's scientific researches on a higher level as required by the developing reality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He instructed the academy to intensify the scientific researches and apply in good time research successes in practice for giving full play to the might of the self-supporting national economy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Underscoring the need to steadily increase the role of the scientists and technicians in order to put the national economy on a Juche-oriented, modern and scientific basis and win victory after victory in the showdown with the enemies, he said the front of science is, indeed, a forefront in the battle for protecting socialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  In order to achieve successes in scientific researches it is necessary not to spare investment in the field of science and technology, he said, and took benevolent measures for strengthening the material and technical foundation of the State Academy of Sciences.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is nothing to spare for the scientists and technicians, precious treasures of the country, he said, adding that the party would make sure that a modern street for scientists would be built in the area of Unjong scientists where the State Academy of Sciences is situated by the party founding anniversary this year just as Unha Scientists Street was constructed last year. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He proposed naming the new street of scientists to be built \"Wuisong Scientists Street.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that there is no boundary for scientists but the scientists and technicians in the DPRK have the care of the socialist country and the care of the mother party. Expressing belief that they would make positive contributions to carrying out the cause of building a rich and powerful country by accomplishing bigger scientific and technological achievements with a high ideal and dream, he had a photo session with scientists and technicians of the State Academy of Sciences. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Right after providing field guidance to the State Academy of Sciences, he went to Lake Yonphung where a holiday home for scientists will be built. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was very pleased to watch the lake, saying that the beautiful lake and thick woodland around it looked fantastic, indeed, when he visited it in summer and added its scenery in winter was equally wonderful.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed the need to build the world's best holiday home for scientists on the shore of Lake Yonphung so that scientists and technicians may have good rest. He personally solved all problems arising in the construction of the holiday home including designing, supply of building materials and formation of the construction forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Choe Thae Bok, Han Kwang Bok, Ri Jae Il, Pak Thae Song, Hwang Pyong So and Ma Won Chun."

Korean Authorities to Stop Projected Joint Military Exercises\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPyongyang, January 15 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) issued the following statement Wednesday:\n\t\t\t\t\t Marshal Kim Jong Un in his historic New Year Address clarified the principled and sincere stand to ease tension and ensure peace on the Korean Peninsula and improve the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The address has commanded support and aroused sympathy from all Koreans and other people around the world. The public at home and abroad are hoping the situation on the Korean Peninsula is eased and the north-south ties are improved to open a new phase for reconciliation, peace and reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But ill-boding provocative remarks are heard from south Korea from the outset of the New Year and powder-reeking war exercises are being waged, vitiating the hope-filled atmosphere at the beginning of the new year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Despite the unanimous denunciation by the public at home and abroad, it was openly announced that huge Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military exercises will be staged for months from the end of February. This has created such a deplorable situation in which huge aggression troops of the U.S. are deployed in areas close to the Military Demarcation Line.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The projected military exercises will reportedly activate huge transport planes, landing ships, high-speed landing boats, surface-effect ship and landing armored vehicles of the U.S. and the puppet army of south Korea as well as huge marine and air war means. To be involved in the drills are ill-famed U.S. third marine task force from Okinawa which will wage the second biggest landing drill after the 1989 Team Spirit joint military exercises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and puppet warmongers are claiming that the purpose of the drill is to take control of nuclear facilities in the north and occupy Pyongyang in case of \"emergency in the north\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is another serious military provocation against the DPRK and an outright challenge to the good faith of the DPRK and the public opinion at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We take special note of the fact that the announcement of the saber-rattling is timed to coincide with the new year press conference given by the chief executive of south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Outwardly, south Korea welcomed the New Year Address and said that it hopes for opening the first button through the reunions of separated families and relatives, providing a fresh occasion and shaping the framework for mending the south-north ties. But behind the scene it is planning to wage war exercises against its fellow countrymen. How can this be understood?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prevailing situation proves that the south Korean chief executive made a lie and has an axe to grind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The north-south ties have suffered greatly from the war drills that were repeatedly held in south Korea every year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By straining the situation through such war drills as Key Resolve, Foal Eagle and Ulji Freedom Guardian from the outset of each year, they wasted away time, preventing anything favorable for improving the north-south ties from being achieved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the history of the north-south ties.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What was gained were only escalated tension, increased danger of a war and stalemate in the north-south ties and extreme discord, antagonism and hostility between the fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such an evil cycle can never be allowed to go on any longer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present situation shows who truly stands for detente and peace on the Korean Peninsula and who pursues confrontation and war and who is a hypocrite, provoker standing in the way of improving the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet forces are making extremely serious provocation like the DPRK-targeted war exercises together with outsiders. Yet, they are talking about \"provocation\" by someone. This is like a guilty party filing a suit first. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the puppet group, much upset by the disclosure of their bellicose nature and increasing voices of criticism, are claiming that those are \"annual exercises for defense\". But they should know that such deceptive and shameless sophism will never work on anyone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent announcement of the huge DPRK-targeted war drills by the U.S. and puppet warmongers is a total denial of the improvement of the north-south ties and dialogue and is little short of the declaration of a total nuclear stand-off.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We sternly warn the U.S. and the south Korean authorities to stop the dangerous military exercises which may push the situation on the peninsula and the north-south ties to a catastrophe.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should clearly understand that the north-south ties will plunge into a deadlock and unimaginable holocaust and that disaster will follow should they go ahead with the nuclear war drills and make military provocation, defying our warning."

His remark is no more than a deceptive rigmarole to calm down the resentment of the international community against Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lurking behind the group visit to the shrine by the \"gentlemen\" of political circles in Japan is the purpose to rearm the Japanese people with \"militarist patriotism\" by creating the atmosphere of \"respecting\" and idolizing militarists. In a word, this is aimed to instill into Japanese the idea that they should turn out to \"retake strong Japan\", regarding it as \"pride\" and \"honor\" to fall like \"Sakura\" (cherry) in the military aggression overseas like the war dead.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries should clearly understand that overseas aggression is not the way for Japan's prosperity, the commentary says, stressing the international community will never pardon Japan coming out for a war again."

Asi, Irak se ha convertido en un lugar caotico de  destruccion, saqueo y masacre, lo que demuestra el verdadero aspecto de la \"libertad\" y la \"democracia\" que EE.UU. trata de aplicar forzosamente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl pais norteamericano toma como una meta principal de la politica exterior la promocion de la \"libertad y la democracia\" en varias regiones del mundo. Considera que todos los miembros de la sociedad internacional deben vivir merecidamente segun el modo de politico norteamericano. Impone a otros paises y naciones seguir y aceptar el modo de politico occidental y el orden de vida, lo que significa el ejercicio de coaccion tendente a arrebatar el derecho a optar la idea y el ideal de otros pueblos y la negacion y la violacion a la democracia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl objetivo de EE.UU. que obliga obstinadamente a otros paises la \"revolucion de color\" reside en crear en ellos la inquietud, quebrantar la armonia social y finalmente exterminar todas las conquistas logrados por los pueblos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLuchar contra la \"democracia\" a modo occidental constituye hoy un importante tema que se presenta para defender la soberania y la dignidad del pais y la nacion y asegurar la autentica democracia."
