And he indicated the ways for further improving its supply service.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The workers at the factory are strong in revolutionary spirit and there will be nothing impossible to do when going together with such workers, he said, adding he would become an honorary manager of the factory, an expression of his deepest trust.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is no fortress unconquerable when our workers live and struggle like those of Kunja-ri in the 1950s, he said, stressing that it is advisable to conduct a higher level of mass movement for learning from the working spirit and traits of the Kunja-ri workers as well as the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had a photo session with the officials and employees of the factory, expressing belief that they would make positive contribution to the building of a thriving country by developing and producing more measuring instruments, true to the Workers' Party of Korea's line of building an economic power and its strategic plan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accompanying him were Kim Chun Sop, Jo Chun Ryong, Jo Yong Won, Hong Yong Chil and Yun Tong Hyon."
