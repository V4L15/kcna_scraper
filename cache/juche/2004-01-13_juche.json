How can this be called a reform? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people should mete out a severe punishment to the GNP in the \"general election\".    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is a crime against the nation and reunification to cooperate with the foreign forces keen to impose a nuclear holocaust upon the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans should hold aloft and thoroughly implement the slogan \"Let us pave a wide avenue for independent reunification through national cooperation under the banner of our nation-first spirit!\", a banner for the victory in the movement for national reunification, and thus bring about a decisive turn in their movement for national reunification this year.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
