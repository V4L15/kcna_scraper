This comes under fire by a signed commentary of Rodong Sinmun Monday.\r\n Such move of the Japanese reactionaries is aimed at legalizing and justifying their preemptive strikes at the DPRK and China as \"military actions for self-defence\" under the pretext of \"intercepting\" ballistic missiles, the commentary observes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is well known that the Japanese reactionaries have pushed forward the revision of the \"law on Self-Defence Forces\" for the purpose of buying cruise missile \"Tomahawk\" and \"intercepting\" ballistic missiles under the pretext of a \"precautionary measure.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-mentioned revision of the law is clearly aimed at mounting a preemptive attack, not for defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' proposed revision of the law allows the director general of the Defence Agency to order the interception of any missiles when there is the sign of flying towards Japan with the consent of the prime minister and the commander of a SDF unit to issue an order to intercept any missiles with his own decision in case of their surprise launch even in the absence of any sign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their planned deployment of the new type ground radar is a dangerous move to make preemptive missile strikes at the DPRK and China. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are also contemplating working out a \"plan for Japan-U.S. joint counter-action\" under the pretext of coping with an \"emergency\" in the surrounding areas. At the meeting of \"the U.S.-Japan security consultative committee\" held in February last Japan confirmed a \"common strategic goal.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These are also rash military acts of disturbing regional stability.    \r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- The moves to revive pro-U.S. forces in south Korea are an extension and a new version of the U.S. colonial rule over south Korea and interference in it. Those are also a product of the complicity of outside forces seeking a permanent occupation of south Korea with sycophantic traitors trying to prolong their remaining days by relying upon them. Rodong Sinmun says this in a signed article Monday.\r\n Alarmed over the anti-American sentiments mounting among the south Koreans and the advance of the progressive forces into the political circles in the wake of the June 15 event, the U.S. has tried hard to foster neo-conservative forces while consolidating the foothold of the traditional pro-U.S. conservatives, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The moves to revive pro-U.S. forces are a serious infringement upon sovereignty aimed to dampen south Koreans' daily-growing spirit of independence against the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The White House think tank conceived the idea of organizing new pro-U.S. reactionary organizations involving right-wing conservatives as part of its efforts to benumb the spirit of independence against the U.S. daily- growing among the south Koreans and stamp out the anti-U.S. struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is knocking into shape neo-conservative organizations with youngsters who turned renegade after being active in the student movement circles in the 1980s and those with conservative tendency, reactionary intellectuals and religionists and is nudging them to confrontation with the anti-U.S. independent forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The current U.S. moves are anti-peace and anti-reunification acts which would curb the reconciliation and unity of the Korean nation and spark off confrontation and escalation of tension between the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. which is in disfavor with the Korean nation's reunification has directly interfered with cooperation undertakings between the north and the south of Korea. It has also desperately undercut the nation's efforts for reconciliation and cooperation by manipulating right-wing conservative forces to spawn shocking incidents. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revival of pro-U.S. forces and their maneuvers against reunification have created an atmosphere of confrontation contradictory to the era of \"By our nation itself\" and barred the work for unity and cooperation from achieving due successes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revival of pro-U.S. forces is an odious fascistization move curbing the progressive advancement of the south Korean society and turning it pro-U.S. and reactionary. The south Koreans and all other Koreans should look straight into the danger of the U.S. crafty and dangerous moves to revive pro-U.S. forces and resolutely turn out in the struggle to foil them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on Idea of \"By Our Nation Itself\" \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Monday in an  article says the idea of \"By our nation itself\" laid down in the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration is a bright beacon lighting the path of independently shaping the destiny of the nation and the banner of victory.\r\n The author of the article continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unless the Korean nation upholds the idea, it is impossible for it to sustain its existence, to say nothing of its development and prosperity, today when the U.S. imperialists are getting more desperate in their moves against it and its reunification, while challenging its reunification cause with strong-arm practices, unilateralism and undisguised interference and obstructions. \"By our nation itself\" is, indeed, the only way for the Korean nation to independently shape its destiny. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The core of the idea is national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As specified in the joint declaration, national reunification should be achieved independently by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation, the master of reunification. Independently solving the reunification issue is the core and main idea of the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By stating that the reunification issue should be settled by the united strength of the Korean nation itself, the north-south joint declaration brought together the north and the south, which had been hostile to each other, as the parties directly concerned with reunification, and turned the inter-Korean relations into those of reconciliation and reunification and created a climate for defusing   military tension and danger of war on the Korean Peninsula.\r\n The idea of \"By our nation itself\" sets the great unity of the nation as the indispensable requisite. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The movement of the Korean nation for reunification which has advanced through trying ordeals and difficulties over the past five years has patently attested to the philosophical principle that the destiny and the future of the nation depend on unity. Our nation would defend everything and emerge victorious, given unity, but would lose everything and become a slave without it. This is the lesson taught by the history of the reunification movement.\r\n  Stressing that the Korean nation is a homogeneous nation with the same ancestry and language and the same culture and history, the article concludes:\r\n   The Korean nation can closely unite, transcending differences in idea and ideology, political view and religious belief, class and social stratum, and this will display inexhaustible might, provided that all the members of the nation in the north, the south and overseas advance toward national reunification together, putting the common interests of the nation in the foreground, guided by the single idea of patriotism.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It further says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Ministry of Education and Human Resources of south Korea sent the above-said plan to the high schools in which it instructed them to organize the SHDC and turn it into \"a war assisting organization\" the moment a war threat has come. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The plan requires the headmasters and other teachers to play the role of battalion commander or higher-rank officer and students to perform the role of platoon leader or lower-rank commander and rifleman. It also requires the students to carry numbers of members of the SHDC similar to serial numbers of servicemen even in peacetime. \r\n It is stipulated in the plan that even middle schoolers will be mobilized in wartime and the SHDC turned into a wartime organization in the event of \"Chungmu 2\" in which the situation is judged as a \"war threat\" short of a war. \r\n This plan contains even a clause calling for listing the left-inclined students and teachers in peacetime under the pretext of \"guiding the leftist students in wartime\" and \"specially overseeing them\" in wartime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities sent such plan to the high schools for the purpose of mobilizing even teachers and students for a war at a time when the U.S. moves for a war of aggression against the north have reached an extremely dangerous phase. We bitterly condemn this move because we cannot construe it otherwise than an act of cooperating with the U.S. bellicose forces seeking confrontation and war against the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The information bulletin demands the south Korean authorities face up to the reality and behave themselves, stop the racket of confrontation with the north and cancel at once the plan to operate the SHDC, a move going against the trend of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It calls on the south Korean youth and students and other people to determinedly come out against the revival of the criminal SHDC and wage a dynamic struggle for its abolition.    \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Pukhan in 661. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n People of Koryo (918-1392) made a \"rocket\" called Hwajon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hwajon was 726 millimeters long and its arrowhead 90 millimeters long. The arrow was shot by lighting the cartridge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to a historical record, Koryo manufactured lots of Hwajon around 1127 and deployed them in vantage points for national defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the basis of arrows with fire wicks made in the period of the three kingdoms, Koreans developed Singijon, the origin of multistage rocket, in the early 15th century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There were three kinds of Singijon according to their sizes, types and powder-cartridges. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The small one was a two-stage rocket. The medium one with one more small cartridge than the small one was a three-stage rocket, while the large one with four cartridges and wings was a four-stage rocket. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Having a great firing power, they could strike far-off targets on land and big warships. The weapons were widely used during the Imjin Patriotic War (1592) against the Japanese invaders and other battles against invaders.
