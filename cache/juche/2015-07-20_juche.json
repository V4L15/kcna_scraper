He promised to personally supervise this work and help it make progress.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed the need to conduct the drive for modernizing railways stretching across the country as an important policy issue, push forward it by focusing the efforts of the party and the state on it and buckle down to it in the spirit of breaking ground and thus turn the nation's railways into those to be proud of in the world as early as possible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Hwang Pyong So, Pak Pong Ju, Ri Jae Il and Kim Yo Jong."
