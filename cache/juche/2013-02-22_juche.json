Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The drills conducted by them this time show that it is necessary to put exercises on a scientific basis as required by a modern war, he noted, specifying ways to do so.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"As I emphasized while watching the exercise of KPA's Large Combined Unit 526, it is necessary to steadily study and round off the Korean style combat methods suited to the modern war and modernize the weaponry in order to defeat the enemy\", he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He called on the KPA service personnel to put spurs to making preparations for going into action, keeping themselves at maximum alert at all times. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Once the enemies make a provocation, you should give full play to the inexhaustible combat capability to deal deadly blows at them, giving them no time to come to their senses, and blow up their strongholds of aggression,\" he stressed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un invited the service personnel who took part in the drills to Pyongyang that evening to have a photo taken with them."

Not only progressive reunification movement organizations and figures but those who had previously been related to the former \"regimes\" including ex-\"presidents\", law makers, director generals of major media organizations, businessmen and even ministers and vice-ministers were subject to the surveillance.

This is clearly evidenced by the fact that the cases which the persecution investigated against its will numbered 500 and that it admitted its surveillance of dozens of VIPs including ex- and incumbent law makers and chiefs of autonomous organizations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The truth behind the death of former \"president\" Roh Moo Hyun, who fell victim to the illegal surveillance, was disclosed, astonishing people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On February 20, the Seoul Central District Court punished those who pushed Roh to death and inflicted irretrievable damage to his family, stressing that it was a sheer lie that he had an account by the name of other person.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This proves that the \"case of illegal fund\" which the prosecution claimed as a reason of investigation was a whopping lie.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts prove that traitor Lee Myung Bak is a chief culprit who engineered Roh's death."
