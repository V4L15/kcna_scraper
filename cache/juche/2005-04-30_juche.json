            "content": "Japan's Arms Buildup under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 29 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun in an article Friday notes that the Japanese militarists have openly revealed the militarist nature and entered the stage of carrying into practice the reinforcement of its aggression armed forces and preemptive attack, getting quite outspoken in advocating them when the situation has undergone a change in the international arena.\r\n The author of the article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The main point of the increase of the aggression forces by the Japanese militarists is to modernize them and arm them with long-range and up-to-date military hardware. Japan's military power has grown beyond comparison in the period of the current \"mid-term arms buildup program\" and, accordingly, Japan has joined the ranks of the world military powers in reality as well as in name. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While beefing up the strength of the \"Self-Defence Forces,\" the Japanese reactionaries have flung open the door of their overseas military operations. In 1992 Japan enacted the \"law on cooperation in the UN peace-keeping activities\" and then brought into effect laws allowing military actions one after another in the 90s of the last century and in the\r\nnew century, among them the \"law on emergency in the surrounding areas\" and the \"law on coping with arms contingency,\" thus restoring the right to participate in a war and the right of belligerency. Now the SDF is running about like a headless fly, openly jumping into strife-torn and war zones under the cloak of \"peace-keeping\" and \"international contribution.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Expanded to the extreme in military and economic respects, the militarist forces of Japan do not hesitate to commit provocations aimed at territorial expansion. Today the Japanese reactionaries are giving rise to confrontation with neighboring countries and deliberately rendering the situation strained in Northeast Asia over \"territorial issues.\" This is their intentional and premeditated acts for reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Here they make the Korean Peninsula as the first target of their attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nOne of the examples is their maneuvers to seize Tok Islet. The Japanese militarists blare that they are not afraid of a war with north Korea but want to attack the adversary before Tokyo turns into a sea of fire. This is little short of a declaration of war hinting that they will spark the flame any time to stage a comeback to Korea. Having made military preparations for the reinvasion of Korea for decades since the end of the Second World War, they are going to carry it into practice with the seizure of Tok Islet in\r\nthe 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is little different from the agitation of a war that the ruling quarters of Japan including the chief executive continue to visit the Yasukuni Shrine and distort the history textbooks in an effort to infuse militarist idea &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\ninto the younger generations and the Japanese people in general. Japan today has thrown away the veil of \"pacifist state\" and appeared on the scene as a dangerous aggressive state and war force bringing the dark clouds of reinvasion over the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Asia.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

No country can become a permanent member of the UN Security Council, if it fails to compensate for its crimes during the war, he added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The delegate of the Asia-Japanese Women's Resource Centre said the Japanese government, which denies its legal responsibility for the crimes related to the \"comfort women\" for the imperial Japanese army, is having its eyes on a seat of permanent member of the UNSC while failing to take any practical step to restore justice for the surviving victims. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The delegate of the Human Rights Association of Koreans in Japan strongly demanded the Japanese government take an urgent step to reinstate the honor of the \"comfort women\" for the imperial Japanese army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The delegate of the south Korean Federation of Women's Associations accused Japan of attempting to evade its legal responsibility for the sex slavery system for the imperial Japanese army and held that compensation to the surviving victims of sex slavery must be made by the Japanese government, not in the form of \"charity fund\" out of a non-governmental fund. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Delegates of other non-governmental organizations from different countries and regions demanded that the Japanese government and parties concerned sincerely reflect on themselves and make an apology and compensation, holding themselves fully accountable for the \"comfort women\" issue in keeping with the trend of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, delegates of the International Solidarity Council for Demanding the Settlement of the Past by Japan on April 7 visited the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and handed over to the high commissioner a collection of signatures put by more than 500,000 people of all social strata in many countries and regions against Japan's bid for the permanent membership of the UNSC.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is part of the U.S.  moves to disintegrate the south Korean society and benumb the people's national consciousness, that is,  a policy of exterminating the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries, too, are stepping up their moves for revival of militarism and reinvasion.  They persistently distort history in textbooks and seek to grab Tok Islet, instead of apologizing and compensating for the past crimes Japan committed during its aggression of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when the Koreans invariably preserve the national spirit and fully display it, can the spirit of independence prevail all over the country and can they accelerate the cause of independent reunification, shattering the outsiders' aggressive moves by their concerted efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans should reject the anti-national cooperation with foreign forces and realize cooperation for national independence, cooperation for peace against war and cooperation for reunification and patriotism to strikingly show how strong and mighty the spirit of the nation aspiring after independence against the outsiders is.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Slams Japan's Invariable Wild Ambition for Reinvasion\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 29 (KCNA) -- It was disclosed recently that in 1994 the Japan Defence Agency conducted a mock preemptive strike exercise under the\r\nsimulated conditions of \"countering the missile attack\" of the DPRK.\r\n The exercise required fighters of the Air \"Self-Defence Force\" to fly close to their destination at super-high altitude, supported by the U.S. forces in gathering information about the \"enemy\" and \"neutralizing its ground radars,\" before \"attacking its missile bases\" at a low altitude and flying back at super-high altitude. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also envisaged the event in which fighters ran out of fuel. In this case they were required to get an in-flight refueling from the U.S. forces or land on the base of the U.S. forces present in south Korea. The event also called on a pilot to parachute from his plane to the sea to be rescued by a warship of the \"Self-Defence Forces\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on the mock exercise, the military officers concerned were reported to have concluded that \"there was no problem from the military point of view.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This goes to irrefutably prove that the Japanese reactionaries' theory of \"preemptive strike\" under the pretext of the DPRK's \"missile threat\" has long been pushed forward.\r\n As the DPRK has clarified more than once, its armed forces for self-defence including missiles are means for just self-defence as they are aimed at protecting the national sovereignty and security from the evermore undisguised moves of the hostile forces to stifle it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It made it clear that its armed forces will never be a threat to Japan as long as the latter refrains from hostile acts against the former, respecting its sovereignty.  The mock preemptive strike exercise conducted by Japan against the DPRK already long ago indicates what its loudmouthed \"threat of missiles\" from the DPRK is after. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind it is a sinister plot of the Japanese reactionaries to accelerate its militarization in a bid to realize its wild ambition for staging a comeback to Korea and the rest of Asia at any cost, backed by the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As was the case with the previous exercises, this mock operation drill presupposed \"strong support from the U.S.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis was the militarist way of thinking and style of action peculiar to the Japanese reactionaries steeped in pro-Americanism to the marrow of their bones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through its active involvement in the establishment of the U.S. missile defence system (MD) Japan seeks to secure an \"unchallenged position\" as a military giant fully capable of applying the U.S. doctrine of \"preemptive strike.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has stepped up a joint research for developing the MD with the U.S. since 1999 as part of its move. It had equipped four Aegis warships of the Maritime \"Self-Defence Force\" with \"Standard-3\" type missiles and fitted 27 launching pads of the Air \"Self-Defence Force\" with \"PAC-2\" type missiles by 2003. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In terms of missile strike and interceptor Japan is the only country that possesses up-to-date Aegis warships except the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is the fifth largest military power in the world. Having secured war means more huge both in quality and quantity than in the \"Cold War\" period, Japan has a military force and system capable of undertaking a preemptive strike at the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, the Japanese reactionaries are free to let loose the war outcries that Japan may fight a war against north Korea and it should make a preemptive strike at north Korea even with the U.S. support before Japan is engulfed in a sea of fire due to the north Korean missile strike. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts go to prove that Japan is in the process of translating the scenario of preemptive strike at the DPRK, pursuant to the \"Bush doctrine\" which formally calls for a preemptive strike after the \"Sept. 11 incident\" and the possibility of the SDF's automatic involvement in the operation into a reality. It is the unanimous comment of the international community at present that the Japanese reactionaries may follow in the footsteps of the U.S., which had mounted a preemptive attack on Iraq even in the absence of the imminent threat, as they believe that \"the principle of exclusive defence\" has long been reduced to a dead one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan was defeated in the Pacific War it launched in a bid to become \"the leader of Asia\" and it is the only country in the world which has not shaken off the ill-fame of an \"enemy state\" though  60 years have passed since its defeat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Should Japan keep running wild in pursuance of the U.S. policy to stifle the DPRK, oblivious of its historical lesson, it will have to pay a high price for this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK will never tolerate the Japanese reactionaries' attempt at \"preemptive attack\" but mobilize all means to finally settle accounts with them.     \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
