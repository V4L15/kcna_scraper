And Northeast Asia will be the first region where the U.S. policy of aggression will go busted.    \r\n\r\n"

The issue can not be an agenda item to be discussed at the DPRK-Japan talks for normalization of bilateral ties as it should be solved between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is well aware of the fact that it is not in a position to assure the DPRK of its security from the U.S. threat. It is, therefore, illogical for Japan to talk about discussing the security issue with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As seen above, the assertions made by the conservatives of Japan can not be construed otherwise than a foolish logic of those unaware of what should come first and what next. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such an insincere approach to the talks would bring no results. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis is a serious lesson taught by the preceding DPRK-Japan talks.    \r\n\r\n"

No matter what vituperation the U.S. may let loose against the DPRK and no matter what threat and blackmail it may make against the latter the DPRK is not afraid of them but remains undeterred. It is ready to strike enemies no matter from any part of the world they may come in attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK does not conceal the fact that it is developing missiles to repel the aggression by the U.S. imperialists and defend its vital rights and sovereignty. Its missile program assumes self-defensive and peaceful nature from a to z. no one is entitled to take issue with this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will continue to increase its military capacity for self-defense to cope with the U.S. imperialists' escalated moves for aggression and their policy to stifle Pyongyang with nuclear weapons. \r\n The U.S. is undisguisedly pursuing the hostile policy to stifle the DPRK by force of arms, shunning the DPRK proposal for concluding a non-aggression treaty with it. It is a legitimate sovereign right for the DPRK to get ready to cope with this situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to positively respond to the DPRK proposal for concluding a non-aggression treaty, not clamoring about the non-existent \"threat\" from the latter.    \r\n\r\n"
