            "content": "Kim Jong Il's answers to questions raised by president of Kyodo News Service \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 14 (KCNA) - General Secretary Kim Jong Il today gave answers to written questions raised by the president of the Kyodo News Service with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's visit to the DPRK near at hand.\r\n The answers say: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nKorea and Japan are geographically close countries, and they had maintained relations from olden times exchanging visits with each other. But in the past century discord and confrontation have brought the relations between the two countries to an extremely abnormal state. The abnormal relations between them that have lasted for over half a century since the end of the Second World War are, in every respect, harmful to either of them. Normalizing relations between the two countries and developing good-neighbourly relations accords with the aspirations and interests of the peoples of the two countries, and it is an urgent demand of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Korea and Japan are Asian nations. They should live in friendship as nearest neighbours, not as near yet distant neighbours, and promote coexistence and coprosperity. This is our will and consistent standpoint. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The politicians of Korea and Japan are now entrusted with the historic mission to normalize the abnormal relations between the two countries. If responsible statesmen make decisions from a large point of view and get down to the task in order to realize the people's desires and interests and fulfil their noble historic mission, they will be able to find solutions to any problems existing between the two countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Prime Minister Koizumi will soon visit Pyongyang, and this will be a turning point in normalizing Korea-Japan relations. I welcome his visit to my country and believe that our meeting and talks will bring forth good fruits. We must open up a new chapter in the historical relationship between Korea and Japan by our common will and joint effort to improve their relations in every possible way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The basic problem that must be solved to normalize Korea-Japan relations is to clean up the past unpleasant events that have taken place between the two countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If nothing is done to the history of rancor that has accumulated for a whole century, neither the normalization of state relations nor good-neighbourly, friendly relations can be realized. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's settlement of past necessitates a sincere apology and due compensation that takes into full consideration the whole range of damage and sufferings it inflicted upon the Korean people. The lack of solution to these core issues has so far curbed the improvement of the bilateral relations and presented a variety of complicated problems. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The two countries are now tied up hand and foot, trapped as they are in mud-slinging over minor issues, but these will be settled smoothly when bilateral relations improve and mutual confidence is built. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An end to abnormal relations will also dissipate the security concerns of the Japanese people. Apparently the Japanese people are highly nervous about our defence build-up, but our defence policy is, to all intents and purposes, geared to self-defence. Our armed forces will mercilessly deal with those who provoke us, but we will never resort to force of arms against those who do not. If Japan gives up hostility for friendship towards us, it has nothing to fear about our defence upbuilding. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Finally, as for your question about my intention to visit Japan, I think there would be no reason why I should not visit Japan so long as bilateral relations develop favourably on a normal track. \r\n   \r\n"

            "content": "Improvement of DPRK-Japan relations is requirement of times \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 14 (KCNA) -- It is the common desire of the peoples of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Japan and the trend of the present era towards independence, peace and friendship to improve the bilateral relations and develop the good-neighborly ties between the two countries.\r\n A lot of problems have been solved in the international political arena through efforts made to resolve the complicated problems, leftovers of the past century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One of them is the issue of the DPRK-Japan relations which still remains unsolved. Though the two countries are neighbors, they are near yet far-off countries. It is high time the historical pending issue was solved and the two countries became near and close to each other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The improvement of the bilateral relations is, in essence, an issue of developing new good-neighborly ties in conformity with the interests and desire of the two peoples and the requirement of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Politicians of foresight have made efforts for the improvement of the DPRK-Japan relations with common understanding of the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint declaration adopted by the Workers' Party of Korea and the Liberal Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party of Japan and the ensuing joint agreements were the results of such common understanding and efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The problems existing between the two countries should be solved by political decisions without fail early this century with the common understanding. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The improvement of the DPRK-Japan relations is in full line with the desire of their peoples. It would be in the national interests of Japan, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The 21st century is the century for Asia. The Asian region finds itself in the centre of the international politics and economic progress in the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If northeast Asian countries including the Korean Peninsula have good-neighborly and friendly relations with each other, it will greatly propel the region's stable economic development, exchange and cooperation. In particular, the improvement of the DPRK-Japan relations will be of weighty importance in ensuring peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in the Asia-Pacific region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of the DPRK-Japan relations should be solved positively as required by the times and desired by their peoples\r\n"
