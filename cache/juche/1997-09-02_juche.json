And ultra-right reactionary organizations are preaching revanchism while news media are extensively agitating for war among people, allegedly for Japan's \"security\", the paper points out, and says:\r\n   The purpose of such moves is as clear as daylight.\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries are persistently seeking to realise the old dream of \"Greater East Asia Coprosperity Sphere\" the predecessors failed to bring into practice in the past. To this end, they are launching a campaign of inciting militarism to lay an ideological foundation for overseas aggression while stepping up military preparations.\r\n   That is why politicians of Japan, disregarding the strong protest at home and abroad, visited in groups \"Yasukuni Shrine\" to pray for the soul of the war dead and lauded them as \"fighters\" or \"patriots\" who made \"merits\" for \"prosperity\" of Japan.\r\n   Their revision of history textbooks is also for this purpose. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
