He highly praised her for having worked for bringing up children all her life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Looking round classrooms from the ground floor to the third floor, he asked officials where desks and chairs were made. He said they were made to suit pupils' ages and heights. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Passing through a corridor, he stressed the need to place benches with dress hangers so that pupils may hang wet winter clothes or raincoats in winter and rainy season.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the foreign language study room and the computer study room he was pleased that they are well equipped.

He checked if wind would not come from veranda windows.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the room for meals, he personally felt its floor and stressed the need to let children eat meals in the warm room.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Making the rounds of various education rooms and rooms for intellectual development, he said furniture and facilities have been distributed and arranged well to suit lovely children's mind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Underscoring the need to always pay deep attention to bringing up children, the future of the country, he said that the nurses of the Kyongsang Nursery should take warm care of children as their real mothers would do.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The last leg of his guidance was the Kyongsang Kindergarten.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After entering its playground, he proposed to provide a circular lawn to children, saying that if the playground is totally paved, children may get hurt while being engrossed in playing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round the room devoted to the history of the kindergarten.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was pleased to hear a report that under the loving care of leader Kim Jong Il the kindergarten successfully did the work to raise the educational level for children's intellectual development and cultural attainments, training a lot of little music talents and pleasing him several times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the playing room on the first floor he said it has been arranged well to suit children's mind and praised the Pyongyang City Designing Institute for designing it well. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Making the rounds of various rooms on each floor, he said the more he saw, the more he liked. He repeatedly said he was most pleased with this visit and he liked everything.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When he dropped in at the hall on the ground floor, he was told that children were waiting for him to see a performance. He would like to watch it despite the pressure of time, he said. He spared time to enjoy it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the performance was over, he asked the child who presented a vocal solo to come to him and kindly held the child in his arms. He learned the age of the child and the jobs of the child's parents and praised the child for singing well, fondling the child's cheek. He sat on the stage unreservedly and had a photo taken with children, holding them in his arms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kindly bidding farewell to the children saying goodbye to him, he told officials that he would visit the kindergarten again and meet with all kindergarteners without fail.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Jang Song Thaek, member of the Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee and vice-chairman of the National Defence Commission, Ri Jae Il, first vice department director of the WPK Central Committee, and Ryang Chong Song and Pak Chun Hong, vice department directors of the WPK Central Committee."

This saber-rattling is chiefly aimed at weakening the nuclear deterrent of China. This was commented by Russian experts.\n\t\t\t\t\t Voice of Russia said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The start of deployment of the U.S. missile defense system in Asia was officially proclaimed in April and it is reported that its elements will be deployed in Japan, south Korea and Australia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The chief editor of the magazine Defense Security said: The drill will demonstrate the capability of the missile defense system to be established in the future. The U.S. is zealously pushing forward the deployment of its missile defense system in Asia and expecting its allies not only to render military support but participate in the development of Aegis system. It is pinning hope on Japan, in particular. Experts assert that the drill is aimed at weakening the strategic nuclear deterrent of China.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The vice-president of the Academy of Geopolitics recollected that the U.S. listed China as a main geopolitical rival in the new national security strategy adopted at the end of last year. The U.S. is regarding the drill as a good opportunity of demonstrating its muscle to China, he said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The MD pushed forward by the U.S. in the Asia-Pacific region is totally targeted on China. The drill is aimed to round off the equipment to use armed forces and means according to MD. The basic features of MD in Asia lie in that radar detection systems and elements for intercepting ballistic missiles are based in the sea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In late April China and Russia staged the largest-ever joint military exercises in the East Sea of China in the recent period. Many experts termed the drill a cooperative step for strengthening common security as it was staged after the U.S. proclaimed the establishment of MD in Asia. In the final analysis, Asia tops the world list of joint military exercises in terms of their scale and number."

Detras de la asuncion y el fin de los sucesivos \"presidentes\" surcoreanos, estuvo siempre la mano de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy dia tambien, EE.UU. se dedica a los complots anti-RPDC instigando a los neoconservadores y conservadores surcoreanos, al tiempo de poner mas tensa que nunca la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas garras de EE.UU. se echan en el Sur de Corea justamente cuando los traidores encabezados por Lee Myung Bak lanzan ultimamente una brutal campana de represion contra las entidades y personalidades progresistas y partidarias de reunificacion, abogando por la llamada \"purga de fuerzas pro-Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl invertir a toda costa la situacion de \"elecciones presidenciales\" que seran un juicio contra el actual \"poder\" surcoreano, EE.UU. pretende mantener vigente la actual politica proyanqui del traidor Lee y reproducir la peor dictadura proyanqui apoyando al \"Partido Saenuri\", agrupacion de traidores proyanquis, y a la hija del dictador de \"renovacion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Como ensenan los hechos, mientras continue el dominio politico-militar de EE.UU. sobre el Sur de Corea, no se puede esperar nunca en la sociedad surcoreana la independencia verdadera, ni la democratizacion, ni el exito del movimiento por la reunificacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs muy justo que los habitantes de diversos estratos y los jovenes surcoreanos rechacen la politica vendepatria y servil a EE.UU. de la camarilla de Lee."
