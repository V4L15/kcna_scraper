It is nonsensical and impudent.\r\n   The south headquarters of Pomminryon and Hanchongryon have taken the lead in the reunification movement under the banner of national independence, reunification and patriotism in South Korea in the past ten odd years.\r\n   As they have fought for national unity and reunification at the risk of their lives, they are eligible for participating in the festival before anyone else.\r\n   The puppets are scheming to exclude these two organisations from the festival in a bid to  foil the festival.\r\n   They intend to send a venal organisation to the festival to let it make splittist utterances. \r\n   We make it clear once again that the festival without the south headquarters of Pomminryon and Hanchongryon is unthinkable.

Such a balance of power was not recorded in the world history of war.\r\n   The enemy started the landing operation on September 13 after turning the island into the sea of fire through three days of intensive bombing and firing from warships.\r\n   Its defenders allowed the enemy warships to approach the island up to 800 metres and then dealt a surprise  strike at them. In this way, they destroyed two enemy destroyers and sank two small vessels.\r\n   The enemy made desperate efforts to occupy the island, firing thousands of shells, but in vain.\r\n   Next day, macarthur and other bosses of the U.S. aggression army showed up at the sea off Inchon by a flagship to command the landing operation on the spot.\r\n   Its defenders sank one more destroyer and six landing ships of the enemy, bringing the attempt of the enemy to a rupture.\r\n   Only one gun and a few exhausted and wounded defenders were left in the island on September 15, the third day after the enemy started the attack.\r\n   Having failed in two rounds of landing operations, the enemy mounted a desperate attack on that day.\r\n   The enemy fired and dropped more than 3,000 shells and bombs on the island in 15 minutes before the start of the landing operation.\r\n   The KPA soldiers heroically fought in defence of the island until they ran out of shells. Then, they fired bullets at the enemy and, finally, went over to a hand-to-hand fight, thus honorably discharging their duty to defend the island for three days.\r\n   In this period, its defenders destroyed or sank 13 enemy warships including three destroyers and made great contributions to the KPA's operation to defend Inchon and Seoul.\r\n   At present, the mass heroism and matchless self-sacrificing spirit of the defenders of Wolmi Island serve as a model of the Korean people and servicemen. \r\n\r\n"
