            "content": "Balderdash about \"northern limit line\"\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 11 (KCNA) -- The South Korean war hawks, far from making an apology for the premeditated armed provocation committed by them in the West Sea of Korea on June 15, keep peddling the \"northern limit line,\"  raising a hue and cry over someone's \"violation\" of the Armistice Agreement  (AA). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun today says the \"northern limit line\" on their lips is a \"ghost line\" which is not stipulated in the AA and upon which  no agreement was reached by both sides.   The news analyst goes on:   The AA stipulates that the term \"coastal islands\" refers to those islands which, though occupied by one side at the time when this Armistice Agreement  becomes effective, were controlled by the other side on June 24, 1950. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAs a result, only five islands among those lying to the north and the west of the provincial boundary line between Hwanghae-do and Kyonggi-do were to be under the military control of the U.S. forces side, and the \"extension line of the Military Demarcation Line\" or \"limit line\" between those islands and the area of the north side were not fixed. It was the South Korean authorities themselves who,  talking about \"155 mile truce line\" so far, confined the MDL to the land demarcation line and clearly stated that the starting point west of it is the mouth of the River Han.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The waters in question  indisputably belongs to the north both in view of the international maritime law which defines 12 nautical miles as territorial waters and of the south side's \"law on territorial waters.\"  The war hawks' loudmouthed \"northern limit line\"  is intended to make it a fait accompli and thus find a new pretext for dispute, unbound to the AA, in a bid to ignite a fratricidal war at any cost.   The developments have placed the Korean peninsula at the crossroads of a durable peace mechanism or war.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We have already advanced a landmark overture on establishing a new peace mechanism between the DPRK and the United States  to replace the outworn and defunct AA.   If the U.S. had responded to the DPRK's proposal, such an armed conflict  would not have occurred. If the state of fragile cease-fire develops into a war any moment, the United States will be wholly responsible for this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWe make it clear once again that we  do not know the \"northern limit line\" or \"extension line of the MDL\"  claimed by the South Korean war hawks.   If they intrude into our territorial waters again and commit grave provocations at the instigation of the U.S. war hawks,  they will face more merciless punishment than  what they met before. \r\n \r\n"

The poems say:   The President lives forever in the hearts of the Korean nation and millions of peoples as the sun shining forever in the space.   He is the closest friend of the people and the revolutionaries, the iron-willed commander who sent shivers down the spine of the enemy of the nation and the beacon for all the revolutionaries and freedom fighters.   Although he passed away, the Korean people are carrying through his last instructions. As the great Marshal is standing in the van of the people, their cherished desire will certainly come true.   The greatness of the nation depends on the greatness of the leader. The Korean nation is a great nation blessed with the great leaders who are just the same in terms of personality, intention and ideas. \r\n\r\n"

The United States seeks  in this to have a military edge and establish an unchallenged domination on this continent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   That is why many Asian countries are taking military steps  to cope with this.  China and Russia agreed with each other to set up a joint missile defence system.\r\n   These moves of the U.S. have sparked  a new arms race in Asia. \r\nA series of actions taken by the United States to encourage and assist South Korea in its development of missiles are designed to egg it on to military confrontation  with the north and, furthermore, to use it as a shock brigade in its aggression to dominate Asia.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All these facts  go to prove that it is the United States and the South Korean ruling quarters who aggravate the situation in and around the Korean peninsula and threaten the peace and stability there.\r\n   The DPRK is compelled to channel its efforts to increasing its  defence capability by the United States' blatant moves to stifle it by force of arms. \r\n\r\n"
