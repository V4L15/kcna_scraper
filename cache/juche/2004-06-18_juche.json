The U.S. launched the invasion of Iraq on the basis of false information fabricated and modified by the White House. The CIA displayed here its skill as an expert in fabricating information and concocted, modified and highly inflated extraordinarily fanciful sheer lies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn cooking up plausible false information Tenet thought that in case it proved impossible to topple down the Saddam government by a secret war, the U.S. could attain its aim without difficulty if it mobilizes armed forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. history has been that of aggression, war and plunder, which were always preceded by the fabrication of information and intrigues related to it. It is none other than the CIA which played the major role in it. The CIA is a group of swindlers and tricksters who fake up, process, exaggerate and spread all sorts of information for aggression, military intervention and the replacement of legal regimes while the White House is a citadel of information-breeding which deliberately plans and orders the CIA to fake up information needed to meet Washington's political and military purposes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose forces have invaded Iraq by holding out false information in a bid to monopolize oil resources. They are now going to apply the same method to the DPRK. They are working overtime to disarm the DPRK under the pretext of the \"nuclear issue\" and vanquish it without difficulty. They have discarded the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework like a scrap paper after faking up a story about Pyongyang's \"uranium enrichment\" and these days they are kicking up a row to put pressure upon the DPRK over the nuclear issue while spreading rumors about \"secret sale of uranium hexafluoride.\" The fiction of the \"secret sale of uranium hexafluoride\" circulated by the Bush forces is a whopping lie reminding one of the story about Baghdad's \"purchase of uranium\" spread by them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will increase its military deterrent force in every way to protect the country's sovereignty and security from the U.S. aggression.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
