The Japanese authorities are, however, peddling it to make the world recognize it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese government is pushing ahead with distortion of history in real earnest in the wake of its clarification of its stand to exercise the \"right to collective self-defense\" through changed interpretation of its Pacifist Constitution last year.

Thanks to them, the Koreans live on this land free from war disasters. Yet, the puppet group is so foolish as to persist in its nonsensical trumpeting about \"threat\" from the nukes and missiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is an unpardonable thrice-cursed act of treachery that the Park Geun Hye group is keen on \"tightening alliance\" with the U.S. while pulling up the DPRK over its nukes and missiles that serve as a strong deterrent for preventing the U.S. from igniting a nuclear war and treasured sword for protecting the destiny of the country and all Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group is working with blood-shot eyes to escalate confrontation with the compatriots in the north and tighten \"alliance\" with the U.S. in a bid to calm down the indignation running high among the south Korean people against the man-killing \"government\" one year since the ferry Sewol sinking disaster and divert elsewhere the public opinion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t While keeping mum about the U.S. nukes and missiles that have brought constant danger of war to the Korean peninsula, the puppet group has desperately cried out for eliminating the self-defensive treasured sword that guarantees the peace and security of the nation, and \"resolutely coping with it\" in collusion with outsiders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the pretext of \"checking infiltration\" and \"coping with threat\" from the north, it is getting hell-bent on importing U.S.-made war hardware as evidenced by its recent decision to purchase 400 Hellfire missiles and 136 new-type Patriot missiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has staged large-scale war drills including Foal Eagle one after another in league with its master U.S., disturbing peace and escalating the danger of war on the Korean peninsula and in its vicinity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts go to clearly prove who threatens peace and security on the peninsula and in other parts of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group is working hard to evade the blame for the escalating tension by noisily trumpeting about \"threat\" from the north but it can never conceal its true colors as war maniacs bringing the dark clouds of a nuclear war to hang over the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is foolish for the puppet group to try to prolong its remaining days by depending on outsiders while turning its back on compatriots. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, it will only precipitate its final destruction."
