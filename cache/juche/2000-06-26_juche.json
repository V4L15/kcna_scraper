            "content": "Japan urged to mind its own business \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 26 (KCNA) -- The Japanese reactionaries again came out with the issue of \"six-party talks on 'security and cooperation' in the Korean peninsula and northeast Asia\" and are busy with despicable solicitation diplomacy to put it into practice. This has come in for criticism by a signed commentary of Rodong Sinmun today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As already known to the world, Japan-proposed \"six-party talks\" allegedly aimed to discuss and settle the issue of the Korean peninsula by the concerted efforts of its neighboring countries are an interference in the Korean nation's internal affairs and a grave violation of its sovereignty as the real aim of the talks is to solve the Korean issue in Japan's interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Through the \"six-party talks\" the Japanese reactionaries seek to edge themselves into the Korean issue and fish in troubled waters, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They do not want peace and reunification on the Korean peninsula but only wish to see it divided forever. That was why whenever the desire for reunification mounted on the Korean peninsula they worked hard to chill it and incite division. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"six-party talks\" peddled by them again are intended to achieve their sinister political aim to bar the north and south of Korea from making their efforts for its independent reunification by poking their noses into its reunification issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese  reactionaries are the sworn enemy of the Korean people and disturber of Korean reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan is well advised to make a positive option to honestly settle its past and improve the DPRK-Japan relations, instead of staging poor solicitation diplomacy over the \"six-party talks.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK will never pardon anyone seeking to achieve a sinister aim by getting involved in the issue of Korean reunification, the internal affair of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan had better properly judge the DPRK's will and stand and mind its own business. \r\n\r\n"
