            "content": "Kim Jong Il's Feats for Reunification Praised \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 28 (KCNA) -- In the joint New Year editorial the Workers' Party of Korea expressed the steadfast will to achieve the national reunification in the present generation, true to President Kim Il Sung's last instructions for reunification, and on this basis made a patriotic proposal for glorifying the June 15 era of reunification by attaching importance to the nation, defending peace and achieving unity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In response to this proposal, the government, political parties and organizations of the DPRK made public a joint statement calling on the Koreans to make this year a year of turning point in history whereby to usher in the new annals for national reunification.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint statement has served as a banner of powerfully encouraging all Koreans in the north and the south and overseas to the dynamic nationwide movement for glorifying the June 15 era of reunification, says Rodong Sinmun Friday in a signed article.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the joint statement attracted positive support and approval from all Koreans and the Koreans in the north and the south and overseas turned out as one in the drive to glorify the June 15 era of reunification from the outset of this year, the article goes on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Not a few achievements have been made in the development of the inter-Korean relations this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to the DPRK's patriotic will for reunification and initiative measures, there took place such talks of various forms between the north and the south as the premier-level talks, defence minister-level talks, ministerial-level talks, general-level military talks and the Red Cross talks. The agreements reached at the talks helped reconnect the severed railways between the north and the south and activate the north-south economic cooperation projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is entirely thanks to the tested and distinguished leadership of Kim Jong Il that the Korean nation's movement for national reunification has advanced as required by the times and desired by Koreans.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Firmly resolved to advance the June 15 era of reunification on a new high stage, he provided the historic inter-Korean summit in October and the adoption of the October 4 Declaration for the Development of North-South Relations and Peace and Prosperity. The adoption of the Oct. 4 declaration was one more event to be specially recorded in the history of the nation as the north and the south ushered in an era of national prosperity, a new history of the movement for independent reunification under the uplifted banner of \"By our nation itself.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The June 15 era of reunification advancing under the uplifted banner of \"By our nation itself\" will surely greet the dawn of reunified Korea in the near future as Kim Jong Il, the sun of the nation and the lodestar of national reunification, is wisely leading the cause of reunification.\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun today urges this in a signed article.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As commented by the fair world public, the primary task facing Japan today is to liquidate its inglorious past as early as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Redressing the past wrongs is a legal and moral responsibility Japan assumed before the times and history.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With nothing can Japan cover up the criminal aggression perpetrated by the Japanese imperialists against Korea in the past. It is under obligation to settle this most hideous crime without fail no matter how much water may flow under the bridge. The Japanese reactionaries have persistently refused to repent of and apologize for this crime and played sleight of hand to keep it buried into oblivion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ruling quarters and political parties in Japan keep mum about the issue of redeeming Japan's past crimes, while wasting time with the argument about the issue of adopting a new \"law on special measures against terrorism.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If there be any politicians capable of foreseeing a future in Japan, they should propose the issue of settling its past war crimes and turning over a new leaf and kick off a political debate on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to stop rummaging through the cesspool of militaristic politics giving off bad smell but be sensitive to the times, properly judge the world and make a fresh start.\r\n"
