            "content": "Inter-Korean General-level Military Talks Close \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 19 (KCNA) -- The 4th North-South General-level Military Talks which opened in the portion of the south side in Panmunjom closed Thursday.\r\n For the successful talks the north side made an analysis and review of the differences manifested in both sides' stands at the 3rd talks and in the subsequent period and on this basis advanced more specific proposals related to the agenda item.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The proposal for removing the very cause of military clashes in the waters of the West Sea of Korea and realizing joint fishing there and all other proposals put forward by the north side's delegation are fair and aboveboard offers which fully meet the requirements of the June 15 era of reunification and they indicate practical ways of defusing the tension as an urgent issue, the north side noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south side, while recognizing that these proposals serve as ways of settling issues, arbitrarily asserted that the \"northern boundary\" was defined as \"non-aggression sea boundary\" in the North-South Basic Agreement and its Annex on Non-Aggression which were adopted and effectuated in the 1990s. It went the lengths of insisting that the more than 50 years old boundary is the one that should be observed by the north and the south in the light of the requirements of either \"principle on the recognition of the mandate once granted\" or the \"principle on the prescription.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By the \"principle on the recognition of the right once granted,\" which cannot be considered to be a principle, the south side meant having a mandate once granted recognized by other party due to \"complex factors such as results of discussion, approval, connivance, etc., the north side noted, asking the south side with whom it reached an agreement on the \"northern boundary\" and with whose approval and at whose connivance it got such a mandate. The south side was not in a position to reply to this.\r\n In face of such strong censure from the north side, the south side brought forward what it called \"measures for improving the situation\" this time, throwing deliberate obstacles to the talks and, at the same time, resorting to delaying tactics by raising issues irrelevant to the agenda item. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Strongly criticizing such behavior of the south side as a disturbing behavior to sidestep the issue of removing the root cause of clashes in the waters of the West Sea and a hypocritical move to take secondary steps for confidence building while shelving the fundamental issues, the head of the north side stated that \"detente\" and \"building of peace mechanism\" oft-repeated by the south side are nothing but empty words. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of fixing the Military Demarcation Line in the waters of the West Sea is, among other things, a touchstone showing whether the south side stands for detente and peace on the Korean Peninsula or not, he said, noting that a top priority task of defusing the military tension at present is an issue of removing the root cause of clashes in the sensitive waters of the West Sea, above all, and solution to the issue may have a good or bad impact on the process to improve the inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In conclusion, he called on both sides to make sincere efforts to bring the discussion of the agenda item to the earliest possible successful conclusion, prompted by the wishes to make up for the precious half a century wasted due to antagonism and confrontation and achieve a good consensus, thus giving joy to all the fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He declared that if the south side comes out for the talks, truly ready to discuss the issue of fixing the MDL in the waters of the West Sea, then it will be possible to resume the inter-Korean general-level talks.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Its scurvy election campaign reminds one of the disgraceful acts of the Yusin fascist fanatics who tried to entice south Korean voters with crude liquor and rubber shoes while crying for the \"destruction of communism\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation can never remain a passive onlooker to the current situation in south Korea. The south Koreans should resolutely check and frustrate the fabrication of a pro-U.S. war servant regime which would bring a war and destruction to the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP's act of pulling a foreign war chariot as a party serving a foreign country like the U.S. must be decisively frustrated and the war servants should not be given even a slim chance to return to power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the fellow countrymen opposing war and valuing peace should properly distinguish between the peace ballot and the war ballot and make a correct use of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Everyone, be a politician, a businessman, an intellectual, a young man and woman, a student, a religious man, a housewife and even one who has so far raised hand for the GNP, should make a correct judgment and choice so that he or she may not feel regretful at this responsible moment on the threshold of the elections. The most correct judgment and choice are to give vote to the most promising candidates from the June 15 peace force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The manifesto calls on all south Koreans desiring peace and reunification and opposing confrontation and war to vote for the candidates from the peace force with the same zeal with which they supported and welcomed the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the patriotic-minded people should convert the whole of south Korea into the sea of candlelight against the U.S. and an active volcano against war and bring a shameful defeat to the U.S. and the GNP in the upcoming elections as they did in the past presidential elections, it concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Successes in Water Conservancy \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 19 (KCNA) -- Sixty years have passed since the ground-breaking ceremony of the River Pothong improvement project.\r\n President Kim Il Sung initiated the project after national liberation and turned the first sod for it with a spade on May 21, Juche 35 (1946). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The project, which could not be done for one decade during the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule, was completed within only 55 days, 15 days ahead of schedule, by the patriotic zeal of people under the wise leadership of the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Pothong River had been flooded in rainy season every year, taking a heavy toll of lives before the liberation. But the river improvement project served as a first torch for nature-remaking projects and marked the start in water conservancy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since then the Korean people have energetically conducted gigantic projects for controlling water. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They carried on the water conservancy work in full earnest in response to the call for putting a million hectares of arable land under irrigation, which was put forward at the Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea held in September 1958. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Large-scale Kiyang, Ojidon and other irrigation projects were carried out at a colossal sum of government expense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The first stage of the Kiyang irrigation project was successfully completed in April 1959, more than two years ahead of the set-time thanks to the revolutionary spirit of working hard displayed by the constructors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Tens of large-scale water conservancy works--irrigation projects in the western coastal areas including the River Aprok area and embankment projects in the eastern coastal areas--had been pushed ahead with success. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Within six months following the September Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee of the WPK, more than 9,900 irrigation reservoirs, pumping stations and other irrigation setups made their appearance, bringing 377,000 hectares of farm land under irrigation, three times that in the pre-liberation days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The gigantic West Sea Barrage was built and myriads of hectares of tideland were reclaimed in the western coastal areas including Kangryong, Kumsong and Taegye Islet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In one or two years from the end of the 1980s an 800 km-long waterway project was finished to form a large-scale circular irrigation system in the western region with the River Taedong as an axis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In particular, the one decade from the middle of the 1990s had witnessed the construction of the 4,000-km-long gravity-fed waterways including the Kaechon-Lake Thaesong Waterway and Paekma-Cholsan Waterway, the first of its kind in the irrigation history of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Kwangmyongsong Saltern, the Wonsan Bay Saltern and other saltworks were built in the eastern coastal areas.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Sim Kyong Ok, vice-chairperson of the Pyongyang City People's Committee, answered the question put by KCNA on May 14 in this regard.\r\n Hailing the proposal as a good offer suited to the June 15 era of reunification, she noted: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"Seoul-Pyongyang Football Matches\" began in 1929. It had been a long tradition for the Korean people to hold such matches demonstrating the spirit and dignity of the Korean nation in token of their resistance against the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule. Much upset by this, the Japanese imperialists suspended the football games in 1933 in a bid to tone down the anti-Japanese sentiment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people, however, did not abandon this national tradition despite the Japanese imperialists' suppression. In 1946, the year after the liberation of the country, they restored their national tradition and held a football match with splendor in Seoul in March. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. troops occupied south Korea, dividing Korea into the north and the south and blocking free visits between them. This has prevented the \"Seoul-Pyongyang Football Matches\" from taking place for 60 years since 1946 and, accordingly, this tradition is recorded in history as a mere thing of the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Restoring the tradition of Seoul-Pyongyang football matches despite the tragic division of the country and the nation would mark an event of great significance in the history of the nation, help further glorify the June 15 era of reunification and give strong impetus to the movement for the unity between fellow countrymen and the reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Pyongyang City People's Committee positively appreciates the proposal put forward by Kang Kum Sil reflecting the desire of the forces supporting the June 15 declaration and peace and will join the football association in the north in making positive efforts to put it into practice.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
