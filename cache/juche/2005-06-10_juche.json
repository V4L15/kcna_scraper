Korea Called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- Yun Ki Jin, chairperson of the South Headquarters of the National Alliance of Youth and Students for the Country's Reunification, reportedly issued on June 2 an appeal titled \"Let's Glorify the 5th Anniversary of the Publication of the June 15 Joint Declaration as Chapter Declaring Actions against the U.S. and War and General March for Independent Reunification\".\r\n The appeal said that a powerful struggle for independence against the U.S. that raged on the Korean Peninsula after the north's declaration of its access to nuclear weapons is rapidly gaining in scope and strength. It urged the U.S. to properly judge the tremendous might of the Korean nation making a general onward march to end the 60-year-long occupation of south Korea by the U.S. forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The appeal continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The June 15 grand festival for national reunification must mark a new turning-point in the movement for independent reunification and a starting point in the popular struggle. Now is the time for us youth and students in south Korea to have the responsibility and awareness to devote ourselves to the struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the pledge made by us before the nation to launch an all-out mass struggle for the withdrawal of the U.S. forces from south Korea, the appeal noted, calling for orienting all actions towards the pullback of those forces from south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It stressed the need to successfully hold in various areas on June 11 \"joint memorial services to commemorate the 3rd anniversary of death of Sin Hyo Sun and Sim Mi Son that falls on the same day and a ceremony of declaring joint actions for peace against war and for the withdrawal of the U.S. forces from June 13 to September 8\".    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

These standards are so ridiculous that when the opponents to the regime in any country are allowed to conduct undisguised legal activities against their government and social system America considers that human rights are respected there.\r\n This, in essence, is aimed at overthrowing the system in the countries falling out of the U.S. favor and this, therefore, has nothing to do with genuine human rights. The concept on human rights based on the American view on value can never be acceptable to other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These American standards can never be generally accepted because the United States has the poorest human rights record. The article cites concrete facts to prove that the U.S. is the world's worst abuser of human rights and a tundra of human rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that the Amnesty International put the United States on top of the list of the worst violators of the five major human rights in the world, the article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a mockery and a challenge to genuine human rights and democracy that the U.S. cited \"human rights record\" in various countries, shutting its eyes to this hard fact, and tried to impose the American model of human rights upon the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. style human rights standards are generally accepted, the world will turn into a lawless and dark one without human rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is ridiculous and brazen-faced for the U.S. to kick off such a fuss pulling up other countries over human rights issues, behaving as if it were \"a human rights judge.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. application of its double dealing human rights standards finds its manifestation in the fact that while keeping mum about human rights abuses by those pro-American forces and allies of the U.S., it is desperately pulling up those countries falling out of its favor over absurd \"human rights issues\" and using them as pretexts for interfering in their internal affairs and pressurizing them. It even seeks to bring down their social systems. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This evil practice of the U.S. only triggers off a vicious cycle of confrontation and antagonism.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This finds manifestation in the fact that the reverence for leader Kim Jong Il, the peerless patriot who provided the historic June 15 declaration, is firmly rooted in the centre of the ideological and moral world of the patriotic people in the south and has become their faith. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This finds expression also in the fact that the south Korean people�fs ideological sentiments for great national unity have grown after the publication of the joint declaration and that it has led them to throw off the noose of pro-U.S. flunkeyism and oriented them to the consciousness of independence against the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its another manifestation is that the declaration helped the south Koreans have a clear understanding of the obstacles to independent reunification (the U.S. imperialists and their followers) and its motive force (the northern brothers and sisters and themselves) and led the south and the north to form the driving force of the reunification movement.\r\n The Songun politics pursued by Kim Jong Il is the main factor in strengthening the south Korean people into a powerful driving force of the movement for national reunification, stated the chief of the mission, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the great Songun politics firmly defends the dignity and sovereignty of the Korean nation, it can stand against any aggressor and defeat him when it pools strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The hearts of all the Koreans following the great brilliant Songun commander are pulsating with the spirit of independence. Nobody on earth can bar the way of the Korean nation fighting vigorously to achieve the independent reunification of the motherland. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. scenarios of preemptive nuclear attack on the north such as �gOPLAN 5029-05�h and �gCONPLAN 8022-02�h can never break the will of all the Koreans for independent reunification against the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The vanguard fighters of the Anti-Imperialist National Democratic Front will turn out in the anti-U.S. showdown with death-defying readiness to defend the nation's independence and dignity and firm conviction of victory, put an end to the U.S. domination and occupation and bring earlier the new morning of national reunification to this land.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
