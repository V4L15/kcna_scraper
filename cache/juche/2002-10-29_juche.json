            "content": "Practical measures to conclude Non-Aggression Treaty called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 29 (KCNA) -- How the U.S. approaches the proposal to conclude a non-aggression treaty between the DPRK and the U.S. is a touchstone showing whether the U.S. has a true will to solve the nuclear issue and whether it intends to settle it through dialogue and negotiations with the DPRK or by a war.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary, urging the U.S. to respond to the DPRK's proposal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The public at home and abroad has warmly hailed and supported the important proposal advanced by the DPRK to conclude a Non-Aggression Treaty between the two countries in a bid to bridge over the grave situation prevailing in the Korean Peninsula owing to the U.S. unilateral and high-handed attitude. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The key to straightening out the grave situation lies in concluding a non-aggression treaty between the DPRK and the U.S. as proposed by the former. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. listed the DPRK as part of the \"axis of evil\" and singled it out as a target of U.S. preemptive nuclear strikes. This was an open declaration of a war against the DPRK and a brigandish act of completely ditching the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's right to existence is most seriously threatened by the U.S. reckless moves and the situation prevailing on the Korean Peninsula is so grave that a war may break out any moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This notwithstanding, ultra-right conservatives of South Korea are crying out for \"cooperation\" with the U.S. and inciting confrontation with the north, far from calling for the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No one can predict what serious consequences this row will entail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to properly understand the DPRK's revolutionary will and spirit and behave itself. It should opt for concluding the Non-Aggression Treaty to solve the nuclear issue. \r\n   \r\n"

            "content": "Germ warfare atrocities of U.S. Forces disclosed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 29 (KCNA) -- Lecturer of Shizuoka University Masataka Mori, representative of the society for disclosing the historical facts about germ warfare by the Japanese army, made public a report on on-site survey of the germ warfare by the U.S. Forces during the Korean War under the title \"We Disclose the U.S. 'Justice' Stained with Blood\".\r\n He visited the DPRK at the head of the Japanese group to investigate damage done by U.S. Forces' germ warfare during the Korean War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He cited testimonies to prove that the United States is not entitled to criticize other countries for possessing and developing mass-destruction weapons, clamoring about \"justice\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the report, the United States pushed forward the study and development of mass-destruction weapons, biological weapons (germ weapons), in an attempt to commit massacres right after the Second World War, and tested the \"successes\" made in this process in the Korean War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n it noted: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The international fact-finding groups including that of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers had already conducted on-site survey during the Korean War, concluding that the contagious diseases in North Korea and China were caused by the germ warfare by the U.S. Forces and this germ warfare was committed on the basis of the achievements of 'Unit 731' of the Japanese Imperial Army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the U.S. government has strongly denied this so far. So such fact has not been reported to the west and even it has not been probed. This time the fact-finding group visited the DPRK where it heard testimonies of victims and witnesses and found out a documentary film exposing the U.S. germ warfare. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The probe into the germ warfare of the U.S. Forces has just begun. The fact-finding group is chiefly aimed to contribute to establishing genuine peace in the process of calling those responsible to account and reinstating those who met grievous deaths.    \r\n\r\n"

In that case the survival of the South Koreans and the existence of any political parties and organisations and the operation of enterprises would have been unthinkable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the DPRK has increased its capability for self-defence in every way, pursuant to the army-based policy, peace has been preserved on the Korean Peninsula and the compatriots in the south have been safe under the self-defensive umbrella provided by the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's army-centred policy is not targeted against South Korea under any circumstances, but against the outside forces threatening the sovereignty of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This policy will neither threaten South Korea nor do any harm to it in the future, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a vital task of all Koreans in the north and the south and abroad to uphold the great army-centred policy under the present grave political situation where the sovereignty of the country and the cause of national reunification are seriously jeopardized by the vicious challenge of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unshakeable are the faith and will of the army and people in the DPRK to remain true to the great army-based policy to the last. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the only way of protecting the dignity and sovereignty of the Korean nation to give priority to the army in the world today where the law of jungle governs.    \r\n\r\n"
