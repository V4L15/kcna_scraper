            "content": "KCNA on U.S. diatribe against DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 5 (KCNA) -- As already reported, an unexpected exchange of fire between naval vessels of the north and the south occurred in the West Sea of Korea on June 29 owing to the reckless armed provocation on the part of South Korean warships, causing a loss of human lives of both sides and a warship of the south side.\r\n In this connection, U.S. secretary of defense Rumsfeld and a spokesman for the U.S. state department Boucher at a press conference on July 2 let loose sheer sophism, describing the incident as a \"provocation of the north\" and a \"breach of the armistice agreement\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is oft-repeated remarks made by the united states whenever a incident occurred. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But we cannot but clarify once again the truth behind the incident as the U.S. is resorting to such a dastardly campaign intended to spread misinformation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The incident occurred in the West Sea of Korea as the South Korean warships made preemptive strikes at the patrol boats of the navy of the Korean People's Army under the patronage of the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States and the South Korean military authorities are claiming that the KPA naval patrol boats crossed the \"northern boundary line\", talking about the \"breach of the armistice agreement\". The \"northern boundary line\" advocated by them is not mentioned in the aa. It is a bogus line unilaterally drawn by the U.S. as it pleased in the territorial waters of the DPRK without any agreement with it after the signing of the aa. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In view of the situation on September 2, 1999 the general staff of the KPA drew the sea demarcation line in the West Sea of Korea and proclaimed it to the world and as a follow-up measure the naval command of the KPA was authorized to fix and proclaim the \"order of sailing through five islets\" under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Forces' side that are located in the territorial waters of the DPRK side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. Forces and the South Korean military have ceaselessly infiltrated warships and fishing boats deep into the territorial waters of the DPRK side under the pretext of this bogus line and such provocations reached an extremely dangerous phase from early June. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Prompted by the desire to defuse the military tensions on the Korean Peninsula and considerate of the world soccer championships that was under way in South Korea, the DPRK navy has exercised maximum restraint. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States that has the prerogative of supreme command over the South Korean army took this as a golden opportunity to achieve its aim. On June 29 the U.S. instigated the South Korean military to infiltrate warships deep into the territorial waters of the DPRK side and mount a surprise attack on the patrol boats of the KPA navy on routine coastal guard duty, thus causing such tragedy in the long run. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such being the case, the U.S. let senior officials pull up the DPRK over \"its alleged provocation\" before probing the truth of the incident. This proves that the U.S. was deeply involved in the incident. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In recent years the desire for the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea is mounting higher than ever before on the Korean peninsula and the anti-U.S. Forces are rapidly growing in South Korea. Upset by this, the U.S. has waited for an opportunity to orchestrate a shocking incident intended to chill the atmosphere of inter-Korean reconciliation. It is a well-known fact. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. orchestrated this at a time when the world soccer championships was at its height, focusing the attention of the world community on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is well advised to admit the illegality of the bogus line so-called \"northern boundary line\" and make an apology for its backstage manipulation of the incident, instead of letting Rumsfeld and other officials be busy with anti-DPRK diatribe.     \r\n\r\n"
