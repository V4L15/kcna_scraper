            "content": "Japanese militarists' mounting war fever under fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 21 (KCNA) -- Senior officials of the Japanese government and military are openly calling for replacing the \"peace constitution\" by a war constitution and visited units of the \"Self-Defence Forces\" (SDF) to talk rubbish that the \"SDF's\" exercise of the \"right to collective defence\" is not contrary to the Japanese law and Japan should not be bound to the present law. And the \"legislation on emergencies in areas surrounding Japan\" is coming into force and its extremely ambitious arms build-up and nuclear plans are being pushed forward.\r\n In this connection Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the moves in Japan strongly smack of militarism and are of the nature quite different from the previous ones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan asserts that this is meant to defend Japan's security and prevent \"regional disputes\" through Japan-U.S. joint military actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This means that Japan intends to take a direct part in overseas military operations under the pretext of \"coping with the emergencies in areas surrounding Japan\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Being a war criminal state, Japan is not allowed to have aggression armed forces or undertake any collective military action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But, the Japanese reactionaries contend that they feel no need to read others' faces or to be afraid of them in carrying out their military policy as they did in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact they are putting their intention into practice. This is evidenced by the fact that Hatoyama, heavyweight of the Democratic Party of Japan, insisted that Japan is entitled to exercise the \"right to collective defence\", this should be enshrined in the constitution and the \"SDF\" renamed \"National Army\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to justify these moves the Japanese reactionaries are becoming more vociferous about  measures to cope with \"emergencies in areas surrounding Japan\" and kicking up a row to create the impression that something will happen right now to disturb Japan's security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan, hell-bent on the moves for overseas aggression, follows in the footsteps of the old empire, it will meet an irretrievable disaster just as a tigermoth is  bound to perish in flame.    \r\n\r\n"

According to the methods of cultivation, Insam is grouped into two kinds: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Sansam which grows on mountains and Insam cultivated in fields. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has been well known to the world as \"Koryo Insam\" or \"Kaesong Insam\" as it is widely cultivated in Kaesong area, which was the capital of Koryo, an ancient state of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Korea has a history of 1,700 year-long cultivation of Insam. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Insam cultivation and processing technique has been developed in Korea to promote people's health. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is grouped into several kinds according to the methods of processing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Undried Insam is called Susam while Insam dried in the sunshine is called Paeksam. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Insam processed by certain methods is called Hongsam and its rootlet dried in the sunshine is called Misam. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Insam can be used as a medicine in the shape of slices and a powder. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It increases mental and physical efficiency and is good for relieving mental and physical fatigue, protecting liver function, stopping diarrahoea, stimulating the central nerve system and treating cardiovascular system disorders, arteriosclerosis and other diseases.

            "content": "U.S. urged to stop its moves to stifle DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 21 (KCNA) -- The director of the U.S. Institute for Strategic and International Studies, when interviewed by a Japanese newspaper on November 15, disclosed that the U.S. forces' \"Win-Win Strategy\" to fight wars to settle big disputes on the Korean peninsula and other areas is likely to be included in its defence program (2001-2004) as before.\r\n The commander-in-chief of the U.S. forces in the pacific said on the same day while visiting Australia that it is necessary to keep deterrent forces against the DPRK, raising a hue and cry over the \"military situation\" on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson today in a signed commentary dismisses the  \"strategy\" as a war strategy which makes the U.S. military invasion of the DPRK a fait accompli. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The positive developments on the Korean peninsula are not a result of the U.S. maintenance of deterrent forces. Its theory of \"maintaining deterrent force\" adversely affects the developments on the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK cannot but take a serious view of this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While calling for \"dialogue\" and \"improvement of relations\" with the DPRK ostensibly, the U.S. has not yet rolled back its policy to militarily stifle the DPRK.        This diametrically runs counter to the elementary common sense and diplomatic practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. persistently pursues this policy, the DPRK is entitled to retaliate against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. conservative hardliners should immediately stop their moves to militarily stifle the DPRK, bearing in mind that military confrontation with the DPRK will only precipitate their destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
