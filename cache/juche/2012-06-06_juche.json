Primer Presidente del Comite de Defensa Nacional de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea, pronuncio la palabra de felicitacion en el acto nacional de la Organizacion de Ninos de Corea (ONC). \n\t\t\t\t\tEl Maximo Dirigente felicito calidamente a los delegados y miembros de la ONC de todo el pais, que acogen el 6 de junio, dia de fundacion de la organizacion, bajo la gran atencion y bendicion del partido y el pueblo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSaludo cordialmente tambien a los maestros y padres de todo el pais que se esfuerzan mucho por criar bien a los ninos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 6 de junio es la fiesta de la ONC, y al mismo tiempo, una efemeride preciosa de nuestro partido y todo el pueblo coreano, dijo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn este mundo, no hay otros ninos como los nuestros de la ONC que en el numero de millones, estan unidos compactamente en una organizacion poniendose panoletas rojas y se forman como futuros protagonistas, destaco. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara el PTC y la RPDC, los adorados miembros de la ONC son tesoros mas valiosos que los montones de oro y plata y simbolos de toda la esperanza y el futuro, puntualizo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Jong Un se refirio a muchos trabajos utiles realizados por los fidedignos miembros de la ONC en aras de la patria y el pueblo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl partido y el pueblo estan muy contentos y orgullosos de contar con la excelente ONC y le espera un futuro esplendido a la Corea del Songun porque hay ese contingente de millones de ninos revolucionarios, recalco. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSubrayo que la ONC llego a conocerse hoy en el mundo como poderosa entidad infantil de los continuadores de la revolucion gracias al Generalisimo Kim Il Sung y al Generalisimo        Kim Jong Il quienes tenian de connatural el noble amor a las generaciones venideras y al futuro,.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tProsiguio que en este mundo no hay otros grandes padres como esos Generalisimos, quienes presentaron el amor a las generaciones venideras como asunto mas importante del partido y el Estado llamando a los ninos como reyes del pais y dedicaron todo lo suyo para los escolares. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl PTC tiene la meta de legar a los miembros de la ONC un Estado prospero socialista mas ventajoso del mundo, dijo y agrego que la Corea prospera del futuro sera el pais mas poderoso, feliz y armonioso del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInstruyendo que los miembros de la ONC deben apoyar ese pais grandioso y construirlo mejor, indico las tareas correspondientes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos miembros de la ONC deben aprender los gloriosos periodos de infancia de los Generalisimos Kim Il Sung y Kim Jong Il como los girasoles teniendo siempre presente la gran confianza y beneficios dispensados por ellos, y continuar firmemente el linaje de la revolucion enarbolando las banderas con efigies de esos grandes hombres, seguidas de la bandera de la ONC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLes hace falta prepararse como verdaderos revolucionarios ninos y vanguardias infantiles de la era del Songun que sepan defender a costa de la vida al partido como los heroes del Cuerpo Infantil Antijapones y los ninos guerrilleros del periodo de la Guerra de Liberacion de la Patria, y avanzar directo por la senda indicada por el partido. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDeben prepararse tambien como revolucionarios competentes y pilares de la Corea prospera que tengan ricos conocimientos, nobles virtudes y buena salud. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs preciso aprender con el creciente afan sin pasar inutilmente ni un rato libre bajo la consigna de \"Aprendamos por la Corea prospera\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDeben hacerse ejemplares en estudiar, observar la moralidad socialista, amar en todo momento la organizacion, el colectivo y a los companeros, respetar a los maestros y los mayores, practicar al deporte y realizar trabajos provechosos con el alma patriotica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHan de participar sincera y voluntariamente en la vida organizativa de la ONC teniendo presente que el honor de militante del partido y la medalla de la estrella de oro del heroe tienen su origen en la panoleta roja y la insignia de la ONC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la parte final de su discurso, Kim Jong Un dijo que hoy dia, el partido deposita gran esperanza en los instructores de la ONC y los de los grupos filiales de la misma organizacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tExpreso la esperanza de que ellos sean raices y maestros genuinos que cuiden y amen a los miembros de la ONC con el afecto de padres, desarrollen sus talentos y los guien a los caminos correctos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl PTC y el gobierno de la RPDC tomaran como asuntos mas importantes del partido y el Estado las labores para las nuevas generaciones, en fiel acato al noble proposito del Generalisimo Kim Il Sung y el Generalisimo Kim Jong Il de amar a las generaciones venideras, y haran todo lo posible por formar a los preciosos miembros de la ONC como futuros trabajadores de la Corea del Songun mas felices y excelentes en este mundo,
