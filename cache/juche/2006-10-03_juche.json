Korea-U.S. Military Treaty Demanded \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 2 (KCNA) -- The south Korea-U.S. �gMutual Defence Treaty�h running counter to the requirements of the June 15 era of reunification and unanimously denounced by the whole nation must be repealed without delay, says Rodong Sinmun in an article Monday upon the lapse of 53 years after the conclusion of the treaty.\r\n The treaty which the U.S. imperialists fabricated on Oct. 1, 1953, by turning the Syngman Rhee clique round its little finger is a military treaty for aggression, which has hindered reconciliation and reunification of the Korean nation and brought unspeakable misfortunes and calamities to the south Koreans by justifying the U.S. imperialist aggression troops�f occupation of south Korea and their moves to provoke a war of aggression against the DPRK, notes the author of the article, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The treaty, a product of the U.S. imperialists�f heinous ambition to dominate the whole of Korea, runs diametrically counter to the desire of the south Koreans for independence, peace and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over the past half a century or more, the United States, basing itself on this treaty, has maintained and bolstered its military occupation and domination of south Korea and maliciously challenged the Korean nation�fs cause of independent and peaceful reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Monstrous are the misfortunes and pains, sacrifices and losses suffered by the south Koreans under the treaty. Lording it over south Korea as the ruler on the strength of the treaty, the U.S. has interfered in the internal affairs of south Korea as it pleased and intensified control over the whole of society and plunder of it, treating south Korea as its junior \"ally.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Korea which is allegedly provided with the �gsecurity umbrella�h of the U.S. under the treaty has had its national interests infringed upon with its sovereignty and dignity crudely violated. South Korea is now put to shame, failing to assert its own principle and interests while reading the U.S. face. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Korea is the only place in the world where such brigandish and aggressive treaty as south Korea-U.S. �gMutual Defence Treaty�h holds sway, ruthlessly violating people�fs freedom, democracy and even their rights to existence while preventing the nation from carving out its own destiny independently. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no justification for such aggressive treaty with outsiders as this treaty to exist in the present era when the north and the south of Korea are opening up the road of independent reunification, cooperating and exchanging with each other in accordance with the idea of �gBy our nation itself.�h    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a brigandish double-dealing logic and a revelation of its design to invade the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is contemplating deploying south Korean troops on the forefront when invading the DPRK in case of �gemergency�h on the Korean Peninsula. This April the U.S. agreed to deliver 42 Harpoons to south Korea. That�fs why it overlooked its cruise missile development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters here is the U.S. application of double standards. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Several countries are either developing missiles or launching them. The U.S. does not care at all whether they are in breach of international convention or not. Yet, it is taking issue with the DPRK only over its missile-launching exercise for self-defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are watching for a chance to attack the DPRK after amassing war means including all types of missiles in and around south Korea. It is quite natural for the DPRK to take counter-measures to cope with this situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a more serious attention is that the U.S. moves spark off a fresh arms race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has become evermore undisguised in its moves to establish the missile defense system (MD) in the new century since it scrapped the ABM Treaty, a cornerstone of strategic stability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. allies are actively joining in the MD. Such situation compels those countries having no missiles or possessing relatively a small number of them to contemplate measures to defend themselves from the U.S. missile threat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had better stop applying unreasonable double standards and sparking off arms race which escalate military stand-off and danger of a war on the Korean Peninsula.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is one more pro-U.S. treacherous action as it means selling out the national dignity and interests to the outside forces and zealously backing the U.S. in its moves for a war against the north.\r\n A spokesman for the North Headquarters of the Nationwide Special Committee for Probing the Truth behind the GIs' Crimes says this in a statement on Monday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the U.S. military bases, firing and bomb-dropping ranges and drill grounds in south Korea have been reduced to barren lands after being seriously polluted by poisonous substance. Such actions of the U.S. are a wanton violation of the dignity and sovereignty of the Korean nation and indelible crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean military authorities are now perpetrating such acts of treachery as offering land to outside forces as areas for war exercises even in the present June 15 era in which the Koreans are working hard to achieve peace and reunification by their concerted efforts. This brings into bolder relief their sycophantic and traitorous true colors as war servants for the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people can never escape from misfortune, sufferings and disasters nor can they expect Korea's peace and rosy future of the Korean nation as long as the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces and pro-American sycophantic and traitorous forces remain in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The root cause of these disasters should be eradicated.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Vigorous Anti-U.S. Struggle Urged \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 2 (KCNA) -- The October Popular Resistance in south Korea was an eruption of the south Korean people's wrath at the U.S. imperialists' military occupation and their policy of colonial enslavement and a patriotic anti-U.S. struggle to achieve the sovereignty and democracy of the nation and the reunification and independence of the country. Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a by-lined article carried sixty years since the outbreak of the popular resistance. \r\n The article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n People in different parts of south Korea rose in resistance against the brutal colonial fascist rule of the U.S. imperialists as it imposed extremely political non-rights, national misfortune and subhuman life upon them. This resistance developed into an all-people resistance with the struggle of at least 10,000 workers and citizens in Taegu on October 1, 1946 as a momentum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The resistance lasted for nearly two months until mid-November with about 2.3 million patriotic people from 73 cities and counties involved despite the U.S. imperialists' barbarous killings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The desire of the resistance fighters to set up a genuine people's government and lead an independent life in the society free from aggressors and traitors was mercilessly dampened by the U.S. imperialists in the guise of a \"liberator\" and the streets where they staged actions were drenched in the blood shed by them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists brutally slaughtered over 25,000 patriotic civilians and their families by mobilizing huge armed forces, but could not quell the south Korean people's indomitable spirit of independence and their patriotic stamina. They offered indomitable resistance defying merciless crackdown and murder. They called for independence, democracy and reunification and asked for revenge before falling victim to the suppression at the point of bayonet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over the past several decades since the October resistance the patriotic people and youth and students in south Korea have waged a ceaseless vigorous patriotic struggle against the U.S. imperialists' policy of military presence and domination, cherishing the desire of the resistance fighters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The truth taught by the above-said patriotic people in south Korea sixty years ago is that the U.S. imperialists are an enemy who seeks only to enslave the Korean nation through aggression and domination over Korea and an indomitable anti-U.S. struggle is, therefore, the only way for achieving the independence and democratization of the south Korean society and reunifying the country, concludes the article.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
