Korea\r\n Pyongyang, February 5 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today comments on brutalities of U.S. soldiers in South Korea that have taken place in succession in the New Year, too.\r\n   Some time ago, a soldier of the 473rd field backup company of the U.S. army killed a bar woman in Uijongbu, Kyonggi Province, before setting the bar on fire to conceal his crime. Earlier, four drunken soldiers of the U.S. second division committed a group assault on a passenger in a Seoul-bound train.\r\n   The news analyst of the paper says:\r\n   The continuous crimes and outrages of U.S. soldiers in South Korea are neither accidents nor individual events.\r\n   They are an inevitable outcome of the U.S. military occupation and colonial rule over South Korea. They are motivated by the disposition of Yankees imbued with misanthropy, racial contempt and chauvinism and given to murder and violence.\r\n   The point is that these atrocities are encouraged by the sycophantic traitors who remain indifferent to national sovereignty and dignity and live on services for aggressor forces.\r\n   The pro-American traitor Kim Young Sam provides the occupationists with extraterritorial status and defends criminals of the u.s. Army so that they can engage in murder, plunder and violence without hesitation.\r\n   Facts show that unless the traitors such as Kim Young Sam are removed, the outrages of aggressors cannot be eliminated nor can the South Korean people avoid bloodshed and death.\r\n    \r\n"

It is because the DPRK has adhered to the principle of independence, self-support and self-reliance in defence.\r\n   The geographical location of Korea and the unprecedentedly arduous and complicated revolution made it more vital than other countries to preserve the Juche character and the national character. \r\n   From the beginning of his revolutionary activities, President Kim Il Sung, rejecting flunkeyism and dogmatism, worked out lines and policies reflecting the demands of the Korean people and the actual conditions of the Korean revolution and thoroughly carried them out. He led the Korean revolution to victory with Juche-based lines and policies including the line of the anti-Japanese armed struggle, the line of party building, the line of setting up a people's government, the line of socialist construction and the line of building an independent national economy.\r\n   Particularly, the present realities clearly prove the validity of the line of building an independent national economy with priority to the heavy industry.\r\n   During the anti-Japanese armed struggle, he set forth the line of forming a united front of the nation and firmly rallied as one those who opposed the Japanese imperialists and loved the country.\r\n   After the country was liberated in Juche 34 (1945), he put forward the slogan \"those with strength, offer their strength. Those with knowledge, give their knowlege and those with money, donate their money \" which roused all the people to the building of the country.\r\n   By advancing this as the slogan for national unity, he led all the members of the nation to make tangible contributions to the cause of reunification.\r\n   \"10-Point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the Reunification of the Country\" formulated by him is reunification guidelines replete with patriotism and the spirit of national independence.\r\n   The Korean people are now firmly maintaining the Juche character and the national character with the firm conviction that if they defend socialism, they will win, but if they abandon it, they will go to ruin.    \r\n \r\n"

It has built waterway power stations in the areas with heads of water, floating power stations in streams and  methane-gas power stations in riverless areas.\r\n   Some time ago, it completed the construction of more than 30 minor power stations.    It is now stepping up the construction of dozens of more small- and medium-sized power stations.\r\n   An increasing number of towns, counties, industrial establishments and cooperative farms are self-sufficient in the supply of electric power from the minor power stations they built by themselves.    \r\n   Minor power stations in Janggang and Songgan counties, Kanggye city and others of the province  are supplying sufficient electric power needed for production and construction as well as for heating of dwelling houses and for the convenience of the people's life.\r\n   Its experience gained in the course of the \"arduous march\" clearly proves the validity and vitality of the teachings of President Kim Il Sung on building many minor power stations along with large power stations and the slogan of the Workers' Party of Korea \"only self-reliance is our choice \"    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
