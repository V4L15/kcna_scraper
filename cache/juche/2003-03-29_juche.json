Song Tu Ryul of Munster University of Germany. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Teachers and researchers in the field of social science of the DPRK were present as observers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The meeting discussed the matters arising in upholding and implementing the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and protecting national security and peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Heads of the north, south and overseas delegations made opening addresses, which were followed by speeches of delegates from the three sides. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Speakers referred to the signal achievements and progress made in the north-south relations and the movement for national reunification since the adoption of the historic joint declaration nearly three years ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that the basic idea of the declaration is \"by our nation itself\", they proved that it is the unshakable Juche-based stand of depending on the nation, not outside forces, to settle the issue of the nation. It is also a perfectly independent and realistic, just stand to solve the issue by the efforts of the nation in keeping with the demand and interests of the nation and specific conditions, they said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today when independence and reunification have become an irresistible trend of the nation's history, there exists on the Korean Peninsula the confrontation between the entire Korean nation and the United States, not distrust and confrontation between the north and the south, they noted. All the Koreans in the north and the south and overseas should join efforts and unite with each other on the principle of placing the common interests of the nation above anything else, irrespective of ideology, ism and system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Preserving peace on the Korean Peninsula is essential for the sovereignty and security of the nation, the creation of preconditions for the peaceful reunification of the country, the removal of misunderstanding and distrust between the north and the south and the national unity, they said, adding: the only way for it is for all the fellow countrymen to take the road of national independence, decisively frustrate the outsiders' moves for a new war and work hard to see a non-aggression pact concluded between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They called upon the Korean scholars in the north and the south and overseas to bear their heavy responsibility for the times and the nation deep in mind and strengthen cooperation, closely united under the banner of the joint declaration, so as to contribute to ensuring peace on the Korean Peninsula and accelerating the independent reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Closing addresses were made by the heads of the north, south and overseas delegations.    \r\n\r\n"
