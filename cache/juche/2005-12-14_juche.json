The Korean people's just cause of independence against imperialism is sure to triumph and the reunification of Korea certain to be achieved, he stressed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that Kim Jong Il set out the theory of giving priority to the ideological work and has paid particular attention to the political and ideological work in the army, he continued: The KPA has grown to be an army strong in ideology and faith under the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il.\r\n His love and trust in its soldiers is the source of the unity between the leader and the army and the unity between officers and men and the basic factor that made the spirit of devotedly defending the leader and socialism prevail throughout the army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Socialist Korea where the army and people are united close around Kim Jong Il is an invincible country which no one dare attack. \r\n A message of greetings to Kim Jong Il was adopted at the seminar. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, a film show on Korean film \"55th Anniversary of the Republic\" took place at the International Cultural Cooperation Centre in Egypt on Dec. 6 with personages from all walks of life including officials of the Egyptian ministries of Foreign Affairs and Culture attending.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "American-style \"Democracy\" Blasted\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 13 (KCNA) -- Whoever is truly concerned for the destiny of his own country and the nation and that of humankind should resolutely oppose and reject American-style \"democracy\", says Rodong Sinmun Tuesday in an editorial article.\r\n It stands out as an important issue related to the destinies of the country and the nation and humankind to clearly see through the reactionary nature and injustice of American-style \"democracy\" and resolutely stand against it, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n American-style \"democracy\" is unpopular \"democracy\" representing the interests of a tiny handful of big monopoly capitalists. It is nothing but a fig-leaf for hiding their political suppression of the popular masses and their dictatorial rule over them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This \"democracy\" is crudely violating people's political freedom and right by dictatorship disguised as \"democracy\". The state power is in the hands of a handful of big monopoly conglomerates, not in the hands of the people in the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is a tyrannical country and a dictatorial kingdom in which people's socio-political activities are brutally suppressed. The number of the agents enrolled for suppressing progressive ideology totals about 200,000 and that of violent organizations more than 21,000 in the U.S. This country that boasts the \"Statue of Liberty\" is being fascistized to be a military and police country serving monopoly conglomerates under the signboard of \"democracy\".\r\n American-style \"democracy\" represents the plutocracy which decides everything by dint of money provided by a handful of those conglomerates.\r\n It is neither the president nor Congress that rules the American society. It is money which actually rules the American society. Money and power decide the president and Congressmen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an undeniable stark fact in the U.S. that one can become president and ruling party leader only when one gets more financial assistance from monopoly capital. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Money precisely means the national policy in the U.S. Bourgeois politicians in the U.S. are no more than political waiting maids or puppets manipulated by the monopoly capitalists. All laws and decisions are to serve their interests. Unpopular policies such as huge defense budget are shaped to give a windfall to them and the demand for it is met with the taxes collected from the toiling masses. This is the true picture of the U.S. policy.\r\n \"Democracy\", \"equality\" and \"human rights\" allegedly called for by American-style \"democracy\" are just aimed to provide freedom and right to the monopoly capitalists to let them suppress and exploit the popular masses as they please, gain profits and exercise influence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This democracy is a hypocritical one as it has reduced the people's desire and right to freedom and equality to a plaything of a few billionaires.\r\n Herein lies the unpopular nature of American-style \"democracy.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This democracy is inhuman and unethical one as it blocks the sound development of human beings. This is reactionary one because it beautifies the corrupt American lifestyle under the pretext of \"freedom\" and spreads animal-like \"absolute freedom\" and \"equality\" diametrically running counter to the intrinsic nature of man as a social being throughout the society in a bid to animalize him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S.-style \"democracy\" serves as a hotbed of creating animal-like lifestyle subject to a jungle law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The American society is reducing people into beasts and animal-like beings who do not stoop to any infamy to meet their own interests. Americans only think of themselves and the strong sacrifices the weak in pursuance of their own ease, pleasure and profits. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S.-style democracy is like poison that degenerates people into the worst type. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is American-style \"democracy\" that has turned the U.S. into the world's kingpin of drug smuggling and a den of degenerates and gamblers under the motto of \"absolute liberty.\" It encourages Americans in carnal instinct, sexual urge and corruption and irregularities under the signboard of \"liberty.\" This is a crime against humanity as it benumbs people's consciousness of independence, corrupts them mentally and morally and reduces them to slaves obedient to the reactionary ruling system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S.-style \"democracy\" represents a criminal political mode of making people illiterates. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many Americans are being reduced to political illiterates who are utterly indifferent to their country and nation and society and the collective. All sorts of reactionary and corrupt ideologies and cultures flood the American society under the pretext of \"freedom of thinking\" and religious \"freedom\" and thus paralyze people's sound mentality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This democracy is also super-power-style \"democracy\" aimed to Americanize the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"spread of freedom and democracy\" touted by the U.S. rulers is, in essence, aimed to realize their dominationist ambition to convert the world into a uni-polar world dominated by the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This theory is gangster-like logic to Americanize the world by interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and nations.\r\n The U.S., styling itself a \"judge of democracy\" responsible for the practice of democracy in other countries, tries to interfere deep in the internal affairs of other countries in a bid to Americanize the social systems of those countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle of democracy is of universal nature and it, therefore, does not allow the application of double standards. The U.S. divided the world into pro-U.S. countries and anti-U.S. ones to pull up those anti-U.S. countries over the lack of democracy without any justifiable reason.\r\n It has openly interfered in the internal affairs of progressive countries under such absurd pretexts as \"election issue\" \"human rights issue\" and \"religious issue\", taking a double-dealing attitude towards the issues to serve its own interests. It, at the same time, launched the offensive of \"color revolution\" against some countries, complaining about \"retreat in democracy\" and the like.   U.S.-style \"democracy\" is a harsh policy for exterminating other nations as it is aimed at assimilating their peoples to Americans and thus Americanize the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There can be no Americanization of the world in political, economic, cultural and all other aspects now that every country and nation is carving out its own destiny under its own system guided by its own ideology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This \"democracy\" serves as a lever for perpetrating open aggression and plunder of other countries in a bid to Americanize the world by force.\r\n The \"war against terrorism\" is a product of the U.S. imperialists' unilateral military high-handed policy and a new doctrine for aggression to spread the American-style \"democracy\" to other parts of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. launched the \"war against terrorism\" with the September 11 incident as a momentum. It has painted brigandish aggression of sovereign states as one for defending \"democracy.\" The U.S. imperialists' \"war against terrorism\" is nothing but a slogan for aggression and plunder.\r\n The Iraqi war clearly proved that the U.S. imperialists are the most hideous war fanatics, man-killers and plunders who mercilessly violate the sovereign rights of independent states under the signboard of American-style \"democracy\" to meet their interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. \"war against terrorism\" has become the root cause of human rights abuses, division of countries and ethnic and tribal conflicts.\r\n American-style \"democracy\" brings decline and ruin of countries and nations and mankind, not their progress. The U.S. is the empire of all evils as it threatens global peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nothing can cover up the reactionary nature, hypocrisy and injustice of American-style \"democracy.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are working hard to spread its democracy to the DPRK. By spreading \"democracy\" they foolishly seek to realize the ambition for aggression which it has failed to do by force in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has recently escalated the offensive of pressure upon the DPRK after enacting even the \"North Korean Human Rights Act\" aimed at a \"regime change\" in it. No matter how vociferously the U.S. imperialists may talk about the above-said \"democracy\" it will never work on the army and people of the DPRK.\r\n The Korean people have the most advantageous socialist democracy of their own style chosen by themselves. It is an unshakable will of the Workers' Party of Korea and the people of the DPRK to defend the people-centered \"democracy\" of Korean-style under the uplifted banner of Songun.\r\n American-style \"democracy\" is bound to go bankrupt due to its reactionary nature and injustice.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
