Korea Military Exercises\r\n Pyongyang, March 2 (KCNA) -- The United States is going to stage together with the puppet army of south Korea large-scale joint military exercises codenamed Key Resolve and Foal Eagle from March 8.\n\t\t\t\t\t They describe the exercises as \"annual ones\" and \"defensive\" in a bid to cover up the dangerous and grave nature of the war maneuvers but this is nothing but sheer sophism which can convince no one. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The projected joint military exercises are nuclear war exercises aimed at mounting a preemptive attack on the DPRK to all intents and purposes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The military doctrine of the U.S. is one of war calling for a preemptive attack and the U.S. and south Korean puppet armed forces' scenario for a war against the DPRK is a scenario for a nuclear war based on the provision of \"extended deterrent\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All their military exercises are pursuant to the above-said war doctrine and scenario.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a matter of fact, the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle have so far been staged according to the \"OPLAN 5027\", a scenario for an all-out war to occupy the DPRK by a preemptive attack. Last year the U.S. and the south Korean authorities worked out even a document on the provision of the \"extended deterrent\" presupposing the use of nukes against the DPRK in contingency.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They do not conceal the fact that \"equipment, capability and manpower\" will be mobilized in the said joint military exercises to the fullest extent. This, needless to say, means the involvement of even the nuclear war forces in the war maneuvers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What merits a more serious attention is that the U.S. is set to stage such nuclear war exercises at a time when the international community is growing more vocal than ever before calling for a settlement of the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Obviously this is a deliberate attempt to disturb peace on the peninsula and torpedo the process for its denuclearization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has always stood in the way of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, pursuing only a war to stifle the DPRK, not seeking a solution to the issue on the basis of respect for sovereignty in relations with the latter. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is open secret that the U.S. administration ruled by the Democratic Party attempted to provoke a war against the DPRK behind the curtain of denuclearization in the 1990s. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is still increasing the nuclear threat through such nuclear war exercises as Key Resolve and Foal Eagle, driving the process for the denuclearization of the peninsula to a collapse. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality goes to prove that how urgent and crucial the conclusion of a peace treaty and the termination of the hostile relations are for finding a solution to the nuclear issue on the peninsula and how just the DPRK was when it took measures to have access to  nuclear deterrent to cope with U.S. constant military threat. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The process for the denuclearization of the peninsula can never take even a step forward as long as the DPRK and the U.S. remain technically at a war and the latter's threat of a nuclear war against the DPRK remains.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Should the U.S. persist in its unrealistic moves to stifle the DPRK in disregard of its realistic proposal, this will only compel it to boost its nuclear deterrent and its delivery means."

Pero, esta sofisteria no podra enganar a nadie.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Esos ejercicios devienen sin duda los simulacros de guerra nuclear para dar el primer golpe a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La doctrina militar de EE.UU. es la de guerra basada en el ataque preventivo y el guion de la guerra para agredir a la RPDC elaborada por ese imperio y los titeres surcoreanos propone la guerra nuclear basada en el ofrecimiento del \"disuasivo ampliado\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Todos los ejercicios militares de ellos se realizan segun esa doctrina y guion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Realmente, los simulacros arriba mencionados se efectuan segun el \"plan operacional 5027\", guion de guerra total para ocupar a la RPDC mediante el ataque preventivo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El ano pasado, EE.UU. y las autoridades surcoreanas elaboraron hasta el documento sobre el ofrecimiento del \"disuasivo ampliado\" que tiene como premisa el uso de las armas nucleares contra la RPDC en el tiempo de emergencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEllos ni siquiera ocultan el hecho de que en los \"Key Resolve\" y \"Aguilucho\" se movilizaran los \"equipos, la capacidad y el personal de todas las esferas\". Esto sugiere que seran incorporadas hasta las fuerzas belicas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo que no se puede pasar por alto es que EE.UU. desarrolla esos alborotos de guerra nuclear justamente cuando se hace mas fuerte que nunca la demanda de la sociedad internacional sobre la solucion del problema nuclear de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto deviene el comportamiento intencional para destruir la paz y obstaculizar la desnuclearizacion en la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA lo largo de la historia de relaciones con la RPDC, EE.UU. vino estorbando la desnuclearizacion persiguiendo la guerra para aplastar a la RPDC en lugar de solucionar el problema basado en el respeto a la soberania.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun un secreto ya descifrado, en la decada de 1990, la administracion democrata de EE.UU. intentaba la guerra con la RPDC detras de la cortina de desnuclearizacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHasta la fecha, el imperio lleva al fracaso la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana incrementando la amenaza nuclear con los alborotos de guerra nuclear como \"Key Resolve\" y \"Aguilucho\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa realidad demuestra claramente cuan apremiantes e importantes son la concertacion del convenio de paz y la eliminacion de las relaciones hostiles para resolver el problema nuclear de la Peninsula Coreana y cuan justa es la medida adoptada por la RPDC para disponer del disuasivo nuclear frente a la creciente amenaza militar de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras que persista el estado de guerra y prosigan las maniobras de guerra nuclear de EE.UU. para aplastar a la RPDC, el proceso de desnuclearizacion no podra dar ni un paso adelante.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi EE.UU. recurre a las maniobras irrealistas para aplastar a la RPDC despreciando la propuesta realista de esta, la segunda se vera obligada a fortalecer mas el disuasivo nuclear y el medio de su transporte."
