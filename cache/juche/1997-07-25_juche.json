Accordingly, \"military counteraction\" in essence can be said to be a pretext to attack the DPRK. It will only lead to their self-destruction.\r\n   They must clearly know that those who have resorted to a strong-arm policy toward the DPRK have never gone scotfree, their attempts proving to be ineffective.\r\n   Moreover, the \"four-party talks\" intended to ensure a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula is now put on the order of the day.\r\n   At this very juncture, they abused the political system of the DPRK, the other party to dialogue, and urged it to take the road of reforms and opening. This is a foolish act which can be done only by those who have no political and diplomatic knowledge.\r\n   There will be only one choice if the U.S. conservative hardliners and the south Korean puppets persistently try to lead the situation to the brink of war, extremely getting on the nerves of the DPRK. Needless to say, the choice will bring a fatal doom to the united states and the south Korean puppets.\r\n   They must stop acting rushly and control themselves.\r\n   They would be well advised to clearly know that our people will never pardon those who find faults with their dignified political system.\r\n   Our people and People's Army regard the anthropocentric socialism of their own choice as their life and soul. They are firmly determined to sacrifice themselves for the defence of their system.\r\n   If the U.S. conservative hardliners and the south Korean puppets persist in their hostile moves toward the DPRK, oblivious of this fact, they will be made to pay dearly for it. \r\n\r\n"
