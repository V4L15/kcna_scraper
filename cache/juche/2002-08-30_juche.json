The U.S. defense department has stepped up its moves to develop an unmanned fighter, an ultra supersonic missile, high-performance smaller nuclear bombs to destroy underground structures and other new-type weapons to round off its preparations to mount preemptive attacks. All this is to carry out a war of aggression against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK are keeping themselves combat ready with a high degree of vigilance against the U.S. imperialists' reckless moves to ignite a new war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should drop its foolish policy to militarily stifle the DPRK, well aware that mounting a preemptive attack is as foolish an act as inviting misfortune.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
