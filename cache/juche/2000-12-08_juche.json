            "content": "Pothong gate \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, December 8 (KCNA) -- The Pothong gate in Pothongmun-dong at the central district, Pyongyang, was built in the mid-6th century as the western gate of the middle castle of the walled city of Pyongyang, the capital of Koguryo (277 bc-ad 688), the first feudal state in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It served as the western gate of Sogyong (Pyongyang at present) in the period of Koryo (918-1392) and was called the Kwangdok gate and the Uyanggwan before it was called the Pothong gate. It is situated on the River Pothong, hence the name. In the period of the ri dynasty (1392-1910), great importance was attached to it in view of national defence and traffic as a gateway toward the north-western region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was rebuilt in 1406 and repaired in 1473, 1644, 1719 and 1777. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the present-day Korea, the gate spiced with traditional flavor links Chollima and Changgwang streets with others in Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The scene of seeing off guests at the Pothong gate was one of the eight scenic beauties in Pyongyang in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The gate is one of the oldest castle gate in Korea and consists of a stout embankment and a two-storey tower. The embankment is piled up with well-trimmed granite. At its center is an arch gate 4.55 metres high and 4.4 metres wide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe great wooden door is covered with iron plate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The two-storey tower has hipped roof whose facade is 14.8 metres long and whose side is 9.65 metres long. The middle room is planked and a pillar without joint on its both sides pierces up to the upper story which is faintly painted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The gate is in a good state of preservation in accordance with the national policy of preserving culture. It stands as a historical building with magnificent and well-balanced appearance. \r\n\r\n"

High-level delegations from Italy, the Philippines, Laos, Benin and many other countries and the European Union visited the DPRK to strengthen mutual confidence and cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently, there were some moves to improve the DPRK-U.S. relations, including their high-level talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many countries which were hostile to the DPRK in the past have expressed sympathy with its government's foreign policy whose basic idea is independence, peace and friendship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK established diplomatic relations with Italy and the Philippines and resumed diplomatic ties with  Australia this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK Foreign Minister clarified his country's official stand to establish diplomatic relations with Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Luxemburg, Netherlands, Spain and Britain to their foreign ministers and almost all of them positively responded to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This progress made in the DPRK foreign relations this year testifies to the justness of the sacred cause of the Korean people advancing toward the new century. \r\n\r\n"
