The paper-making technology has witnessed a rapid development from before and after the fourth century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The three kingdoms (Koguryo, Paekje and Silla) made paper called Maji and Joji respectively with hemp and paper-mulberry as raw materials. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The paper made from hemp in Koguryo (B.C. 277-A.D. 668) was famous for its well bleaching and smooth through fulling process. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The paper-making technology of the three kingdoms further developed in the period of Koryo (early 10th century-late 14th century). The quality paper made from paper-mulberry was exported to other countries in the 11th century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Koryo encouraged the cultivation of paper-mulberry trees and private paper-making industry from 1145 to meet the growing demand for paper thanks to the publication and export of the complete collection of Buddhist sutras. The Koryo government set up the \"Jiso\", a paper manufacturing unit, and mass-produced the tough and smooth paper. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hanji, traditional Korean paper, was also made in the period of Koryo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Paekchuji made from hemp was used in publishing some important books for its snow-white color and high quality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The paper-making technology made a rapid progress in the years of Ri Dynasty along with the invention of type printing technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Various kinds of paper were produced at that time according to their uses. Among them were Phyojonji, Jamunji, Kojongji, Ryuyopji, Ryumokji and Uiiji. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Phyojonji was used in presenting messages to the King on auspicious occasions and Jamunji in writing diplomatic documents. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kojongji made from oat and barley straws was mainly used as inside paper. Ryuyopji, Ryumokji and Uiiji were made from trunk and leaves of willow tree and Job's-tears. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Paekchuji was widely known to China for its good quality.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is the lesson given by the U.S. aggression on Iraq that their \"democracy\" ballad is followed hard on the heel by a bloody war and military intervention. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the imperialists' moves to spread \"democracy\" are allowed, they will entail catastrophic consequences. The collapse of socialism in the East European countries toward the close of the last century resulted from the lack of vigilance against these moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world people desirous of the independent development and progress of the countries should intensify the struggle to oppose and frustrate the imperialists' moves to spread \"democracy\", looking straight into their reactionary and dangerous nature.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
