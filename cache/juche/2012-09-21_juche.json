This was due treatment for the reactionaries of history who were going reckless, unaware of who their rival was.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the south Korean regime, oblivious of the lesson of their shame, are still persisting in the hostile policy toward the DPRK, a war policy, while watching for a chance to launch a new war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are speaking in public that the exercises to which the concept of \"preemptive exercise of right to self-defence\" has been applied helped \"round off actual scenario\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is peddling rumor that similar war scenario will be applied to Key Resolve joint military exercises due early next month, fanning up a war fever.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The war drills scheduled to be staged in the sky, land and seas of the Korean Peninsula and surround areas following UFG and nuclear war means hurled into them indicate the upcoming final battle with the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will never remain an on-looker to the U.S. increasing hostile moves against the DPRK but take active steps to cope with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Songun Korea will promptly retaliate against enemy's provocation and answer an aggression war with a just war for national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If enemies fire even a bullet into the area of the DPRK side, the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK will never miss the golden opportunity but lead it straight into a great war for national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This war will be a praiseworthy act of removing the root cause of all evil that harasses the world, and an admirable military feat that will shine long in history."

Now it seeks to round off a network of siege to the country by laying a springboard from which to blockade against the Far Eastern region by force of arms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In pursuance of the U.S. strategy to dominate the Asia-Pacific region the U.S.-Japan-south Korea military alliance has grown to be \"NATO of Asian version\" and the moves for deploying the \"missile defence system of Asian version\" have been pushed forward in real earnest. This is posing a threat to the Far Eastern region and, furthermore, Russia's interests in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Availing itself of the U.S. switchover in its military strategy, Japan has become evermore undisguised in tightening the military nexus with the U.S., in particular. This brings to light its attempt to stand in a showdown with Russia over the territorial dispute surrounding the Southern Kuriles, making the issue serious.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Russia is taking hard-line military counter-measures to cope with the grave situation created by the U.S. strategy to dominate Asia-Pacific. As far as research, development and deployment of latest type military hardware are concerned, it puts main emphasis on bolstering up its forces in the Far East.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There was successful first test-flight of fifth generation fighter of Russia T-50 in a city along its Eastern border. The imaginary target of this fighter was U.S. F-22. Experts said such test-flight conducted in the air over the area near the Pacific suggested Russia's determination not to make any slight concession in the Far East.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Russia declared that it would deploy in Kamchatka of the Far Eastern region ground to air missile C-400 and new-type amphibious warfare ships urgently needed for attack and defence of island. Anti-aircraft missile Tor-M2 and helicopter gunships Mi-28 were also deployed in dispute-torn islets between Russia and Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In recent years Russia deployed more than 100 types of warplanes in the Eastern military district which was described as the first large-scale military deployment. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Foreign press reports said the purpose of the above-said deployment is aimed to counter Japan ostensively but its real aim is to stand up against the U.S. behind it and this was an expression of Moscow's firm will to defend the Far East.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Timed to coincide with its deployment, Russia is giving spurs to the construction of military bases in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Russian Pacific Fleet plans to build a large naval port in Kunashir, one of the dispute-torn islands. It embarked on putting into practice the project for beefing up its forces stationed in the Kuriles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The building of a space launching centre in Vostochnii is making rapid progress. It is said that the launching centre will contribute to raising the IT level of the Russian forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t More missile launching bases are expected to be transferred to the Far East. It is the view of analysts that this will not only promote the construction of overall military bases in the region but pose a direct threat to the U.S. forces in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Russia is also demonstrating its military muscle under various codenames as a challenge to the U.S. strategy for dominating Asia-Pacific.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A typical example of this was the fact that Russia staged large-scale strategic operational exercises in 18 drill grounds with almost all services, arms and units involved under the command of the Russian Chief of the General Staff at a time when the U.S. just began carrying out its new strategy. Military analysts described these drills as a message to the U.S. that the interests of Russia can never be disregarded in the Asia-Pacific region. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Sources predict that the confrontation between Russia and the U.S. will be further escalated in the future with the Asia-Pacific region as a theatre."

            "content": "Maniacos belicos no evitaran derrota, senala ACNC\r\nPyongyang, 21 de septiembre (ACNC) -- Segun informaciones extranjeras, Estados Unidos y los titeres surcoreanos desarrollaron el entrenamiento tendente a atacar preventivamente y ocupar la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea en el marco de los ejercicios militares conjuntos \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\" efectuados en agosto pasado.\n\t\t\t\t\t Asi volvio a revelarse a todo el mundo el caracter enganoso de la sofisteria de los enemigos que lo califican de \"entrenamiento anual de defensa\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Frente a la politica hostil anti-RPDC de EE.UU. y nueva situacion militar y politica creada en la Peninsula Coreana, la RPDC ya aclaro la posicion sobre el presente simulacro de guerra agresiva.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La inspeccion del Comandante Supremo            Kim Jong Un a las unidades de defensa de islas situadas en la extremidad meridional del frente suroeste y su orden de combate por la reunificacion de la patria devinieron una gran declaracion historica que refleja la demanda de la situacion dada y la voluntad de todo el ejercito y el pueblo de aniquilar a los enemigos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La declaracion del Comandante Insigne sin par que conmovio a todo el mundo y la voluntad de la Corea del Songun de dar represalia convirtieron en un instante en una espuma el intento de los enemigos de provocar la nueva guerra aprovechando la oportunidad de dichos ejercicios. En visperas del inicio de las operaciones, los enemigos ya perdieron la iniciativa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  EE.UU. que actuaba arrogantemente y la banda titere que fanfarroneaba apoyandose en la fuerza de su amo gringo, perdieron completamente el animo desde el principio de simulacro.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En la \"etapa decisiva\" de dicha campana belica estaban confundidos avisando la suspension y la reanudacion de entrenamiento so pretexto del \"dano por tifon\" y al fin lo terminaron sin el resultado concreto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Los maniacos de guerra volvieron a sufrir la verguenza ante el mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Pero, ellos, sin sacar la leccion de su derrota, siguen recurriendo a la politica hostil anti-RPDC y la politica belica y acechan la oportunidad de desatar la nueva guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Sueltan oficialmente los disparates provocativos: \"se perfecciono el guion real\" a traves del presente simulacro en que se aplico la concepcion de \"derecho  de autodefensa preventiva\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Inculcan el fervor de guerra difundiendo ya el rumor de que dicho guion de guerra se aplicara tambien en los ejercicios militares conjuntos \"Key Resolve\" que se efectuaran a principios del proximo ano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Los ejercicios belicos que se desarrollan  de continuo despues de \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\" en el cielo, la tierra y el mar de la Peninsula Coreana y su contorno y los medios de guerra nuclear insinuan que se acerca cada dia el momento de la guerra decisiva  antiyanqui.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La RPDC no estara nunca con los brazos cruzados ante las cada dia mas crecientes maniobras hostiles de EE.UU. y hara frente con iniciativa y mas activamente a ellas fortaleciendo el disuasivo nuclear de autodefensa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  !A provocacion de los enemigos con el inmediato contraataque, a la guerra agresiva con la justa gran guerra por la reunificacion de la patria!, esto es la respuesta de la Corea del Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi los enemigos se atreven a disparar un solo proyectil al territorio de la RPDC, las fuerzas armadas revolucionarias coreanas lo extenderan a la guerra por la reunificacion de la patria sin perder esta oportunidad de oro.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa gran guerra por la reunificacion de la patria brillara como gran empresa justa para extirpar de raiz el origen de todos los males de esta Tierra y como proezas militares a elogiarse para siempre junto con la historia."
