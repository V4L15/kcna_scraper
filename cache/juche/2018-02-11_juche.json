Earlier to this, they walked off the former official of Chongryon without any clear evidence, on charges of \"violation of the law on secondhand dealers\".\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on the fact, Minju Joson Sunday says:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters is that the Japan police authorities justify their present anti-Chongryon suppression campaign under the unreasonable pretext of a \"record of remitting money\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the height of obstinacy and far-fetchedness.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The said record of banknote is the record made by its owner when remitting the cost of publications including Choson Sinbo to the official in charge of publicity and culture work of the Tokyo Metropolitan Headquarters of Chongryon in the days when he was working as an official of a branch of Chongryon. So it has no relation with the \"violation of the law on secondhand dealers\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What increases the suspicion and denunciation at home and abroad, however, is the act of the Japan police authorities which conducted once again such farce of little worth after three months since they ransacked every nook and corner of the house of the former chairman of the Katsushika branch of Chongryon on charges of the \"violation of the law on secondhand dealers\" in October last year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lurking behind this is a crafty and sordid political attempt peculiar to the island country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is so clear that its aim is to charge Chongryon, a dignified overseas citizens' organization of the DPRK, as an \"illegal organization\" and \"lawless body\", stoke atmosphere against the DPRK and Chongryon throughout Japan, escalate the tension on the Korean peninsula with it as an occasion and thus pave the way for realizing Japan's dirty militarist ambition."

This created quite a stir after its disclosure to the public.\n\t\t\t\t\t Against this background, domestic and foreign media, relating the \"operation\" to the facts that the appointment of a person informally designated as the U.S. ambassador to south Korea was withdrawn for his rejection of Trump's tough military plan and that the nuclear strategic assets and special units of the U.S. are being massively deployed in and around Korean peninsula, estimated that a military conflict may break out on the Korean peninsula in late March or early April after the Winter Olympics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this regard, Rodong Sinmun in a commentary Sunday says that the practical moves of the Trump clan for the realization of the \"bloody nose operation\" are an intentional provocation aimed to destroy the peaceful atmosphere on the Korean peninsula created by the initiative measures and efforts of the DPRK and turn the present situation back into confrontation and war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the invariable intention of the U.S. to realize its strategy for domination over Asia-Pacific while keeping the situation of the Korean peninsula constantly tense, the commentary notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is for this reason that the U.S. is trying to put a brake to the present current of improving north-south relations and lead the situation to the escalation of tension, being unhappy about the detente on Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the DPRK will not give up its option, being frightened by the threat and blackmail of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should stop acting rashly, mindful that it will face unimaginable tragic consequences if it provokes the DPRK through so-called \"bloody nose operation\"."
