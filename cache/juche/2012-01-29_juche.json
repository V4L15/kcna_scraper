But this is nothing but a crafty and sinister artifice to benumb the vigilance of the world people and cover up their aggressive and predatory aims.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Sunday says this in a bylined article.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prevailing situation requires the world people not to be taken in by the imperialists' crafty deceptive ruse, the article notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is necessary, first of all, to be vigilant against the imperialists talking about \"freedom\" and \"democracy\" while pretending not to seek any aggressive aim.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"freedom\" and \"democracy\" touted by the U.S. are part of its moves for \"globalization\" and its immediate goal is to do harm to and bring down the political system in the anti-U.S. independent countries and nations by sending them the wind of freedom.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is also necessary to guard against the imperialists' behavior of styling themselves as \"mediators\" and \"guarantors\" in settling disputes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the trite method of the imperialists to fish in troubled waters by sowing the seeds of discord and antagonism among other countries and nations and stoke them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is particularly important to be vigilant against the imperialists' trumpeting about \"peace.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They still keep military bases and troops for aggression in different countries and regions and stage ceaseless and reckless war maneuvers, while giving lip-service to \"peace.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the scenario of the U.S. imperialists to carry out their strategy for world domination by force of arms. Its main thrust is to bring Northeast Asia under their control and its core is to ignite another Korean war with south Korea as a base.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t One should not harbor any illusion about the imperialists. It is essential to unite close with a firm revolutionary stand against them and intensify the struggle against them. What is more important is to firmly maintain the principle of independence against imperialism and direct the spearhead of attack to it, not regarding its crafty deceptive ruse as a change in its intrinsic nature."
