As regards the north's claim to the legitimate right to the use of nuclear energy for a peaceful purpose at the six-party talks they even let loose a string of balderdash describing it as a far-fetched assertion.\r\n A spokesman for the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland in a statement on Sept. 22 noted that the GNP's outcries pleasing the U.S. and inciting confrontation with the north are intended to egg the pro-U.S. ultra-right conservative forces on to dampen the spirit of alliance with the north and independence rapidly mounting in south Korea, turn the trend of the times favorable for toeing the U.S. line and pursuing confrontation with the north and save its foundation from its collapse. The statement went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP is no more than a group of philistines who have already lost the worth of its existence. The ridiculous remarks made by the floor leader of the GNP are no more than rubbish of the guy breathing his last, washed away by a violent trend. \r\nThe June 15 era of reunification does not allow any political force going against national reconciliation and reunification to stay in this land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the south Korean politicians truly want to live as righteous politicians for national independence and reunification, they should throw away the signboard of the GNP, a symbol of shame and disgrace, and resolutely break with pro-U.S., ultra-right forces.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

At that time he grumbled that such monument standing there would touch off strong anti-Japanese sentiment among Koreans and this would not be in favor of Japan's enforcement of the rule of colonial enslavement over Korea. Then it was shipped to Tokyo in secrecy in 1906. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese aggressors considered the monument too wonderful and excellent in its stone material and sculptural art to destroy it. It has thus been preserved up to this date as \"a trophy\" from their colony. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is more serious is that it is now left in a corner of the \"Yasukuni Shrine.\" \r\n The monument taken away by the Japanese imperialists from the northern area of Korea at that time is the Korean nation's precious artifact of great historical value.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
