But, only attackers will know what kind of warhead will be loaded on the launched cruise missile. There is no guarantee that nuclear warhead will not be mounted. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During the early period of his office U.S. President Obama spoke loudly of his plan to build a \"world without nuclear weapons\". The U.S. has branded those countries going against the grain with it as \"nuclear criminals\" and put spurs to developing latest weapons under the pretext of destroying their \"nuclear facilities\". The U.S. plan for prompt global strike is designed for putting it into practice with an ultimate aim at a preemptive attack. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Clear is what Washington has in mind when spending a huge amount of fund for development and modernization of latest war hardware though it reels from serious economic crisis. Its attempt is to seek a way out of the economic crisis in a new war of aggression. The danger of a thermonuclear war is increasing in the world due to the U.S. arms buildup under the signboard of building a \"world without nuclear weapons\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. plan for a prompt global strike shows that it is going to ignite a war against any country of the world with the nuclear and conventional weapons. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. moves for a new war are criminal acts going against the trend of the times advancing toward disarmament and peace. They are also sparking off international arms race. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is anachronistic that the U.S. is resorting to reckless military acts as it is a chief culprit disturbing world peace and stability and escalating arms race. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a great mistake for the U.S. warlike forces to calculate that they would be safe while dreaming of a new world war."
