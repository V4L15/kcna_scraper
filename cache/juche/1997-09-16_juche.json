Korea\r\nPyongyang, September 16 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today comments on the reinforcement and modernisation of U.S. Forces in south Korea.\r\n   The news analyst says:\r\n   The United States plans to replace the tanks deployed in Waegwan area of south Korea with 116 new-type tanks withdrawn from Europe in two months' time. About 500 units of mobile combat equipment including 24 self-propelled mortars and armored combat vehicles withdrawn from Europe have already been transferred to U.S. Forces in south Korea.\r\n   This move is motivated by the aggressive U.S. strategy toward Korea.\r\n   This eloquently shows the U.S. attaches primary importance to Korea in its world strategy after the end of the Cold War and seeks to unleash war to implement it.\r\n   The U.S. schemes to intensify anti-socialist campaign mainly in northeast Asia where the bulwark of socialism is situated, now that the anti-socialist strategy has been carried out in Europe, which was the main front of the reactionary world strategy in the Cold War era.\r\n   The U.S. warhawks seek to stifle the DPRK by military strength. This is, however, a foolish dream.\r\n   Their reckless arms buildup will only aggravate military confrontation and belligerency between the DPRK and the U.S.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
