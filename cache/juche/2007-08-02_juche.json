            "content": "Abe Group's Moves to Disturb Six-Party Talks under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, August 1 (KCNA) -- Japan is keen to bar the improvement of its relations with the DPRK and derail the six-party talks aimed at settling the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula under the pretext of the \"abduction issue.\" This is based on the calculation of the ultra-nationalist forces of Japan represented by Abe that the issue of access to nukes by the DPRK now in the hostile relationship with Japan can be used as a good pretext for turning it into a military power and its nuclear weaponization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today observes this in its signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Abe group is busy with its mendicant diplomacy aimed at internationalizing the issue of abduction and putting international pressure upon the DPRK, insisting that it has not yet been solved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Abe is known to have regarded the \"abduction issue\" as a bargaining chip for the maintenance of his power and the realization of his political ambition. Some days ago, he let loose the jargon that he would buckle down to the settlement of the \"abduction issue\" with an \"iron will.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are making much ado about the issue, but it had already found a solution thanks to the sincere efforts of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the investigation into the issue and its handling came to an end thanks to the sincere efforts of the DPRK, the Japanese reactionaries invented new \"victims of abduction\" by putting in motion the \"society for the investigation into the issues of specified persons reported missing.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hundreds of people are reported missing in Japan every year and, therefore, the above-said forces may keep concocting new information about \"abduction\" as long as they are making much fuss about the \"abduction issue\" while staying in power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind the Abe regime's escalated provocations to the DPRK over the \"abduction issue\" are a sinister and wicked calculation and purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's \"departure from the postwar regime\" touted by Abe upon assuming premiership is intended to help Japan get rid of the status of a defeated country subject to military restrictions and establish a war system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is Abe's calculation that Japan must avail itself of the \"wind caused by the DPRK's access to nukes\" in order to lay a military foundation for the \"assertive diplomacy\" oft-repeated by him and to this end it is necessary to deter the six-party talks from making any progress and buy time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There will be only complications and difficulties in the way of the talks if Japan continues disturbing the talks, persistently insisting on the already-settled \"abduction issue\" irrelevant to the mission and purport of the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be left all alone and meet only frustration if it keeps standing in the way of the talks, making much ado about the \"abduction issue.\"     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Paektu, a famous mountain of Korea, has been called as an ancestral mountain from olden times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The mountain, which had been called as Pulham, Tothae, Thaebaek and Paek Mountains, was fixed as Mt. Paektu in the middle of the seventh century. In the light of its geological and geographical view, the mountain constitutes the origin of all the mountains and ranges of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The 1,470-kilometer long Grand Paektu Range runs from Mt. Paektu to Kujae Peak (Hadong County, South Kyongsang Province) in the coast of the South Sea at the end of Jiri Range, via Mts. Turyu and Thaebaek. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri Su Gwang, a pioneer of realism in Korea, wrote in his book \"Jibongryusol\" that the Paektu Range stretches southward through Chol Pass on Machonryong Range to form Mts. Kumgang, Odae and Thaebaek and ends at Mt. Jiri. He stressed that Paektu Range continues to extend under the sea to link all the islands of Japan and that Mt. Hanna is also part of the range. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Mt. Paektu is a famous and ancestral mountain of Korea. It is well illustrated by a map, appendix to the book \"Sinjungdonggukyojisungram\" published in the 16th century, the \"Taedongyo Map\" made by Kim Jong Ho in 1861 and other maps. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation has regarded Mt. Paektu as the birthplace of the national state and holy mountain associated with soul of the nation. According to historical records including \"Samguksagi\", \"Kusamguksa\" and \"Samgukyusa\", such orthodox states in Korea as Koguryo, Palhae and Koryo from Kojoson (ancient Korea), the first state, asserted that the state foundation was directly connected with Mt. Paektu and the states were built in the spirit of the mountain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean ancestors worshiped the mountain generation to generation. It observed a custom to perform a sacrificial rite for the God of Mt. Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koryo people related Koguryo with Mt. Paektu and believed the God of the mountain as guardian of Koryo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the period of Ri Dynasty, people began to connect Tangun, founder of Korea, with the mountain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Tangun tale, which is told in Miyama, Kagosima Prefecture, Japan also tells that Tangun is connected with Mt. Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today, Mt. Paektu is widely known as not only the famous and ancestral mountain of Korea but also the sacred place and mountain of the revolution.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He aqui la astuta intencion de aquellos reaccionarios japoneses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Si Japon sigue cuestionando obstinadamente ese polemico asunto, ya liquidado y desvinculado totalmente a la mision y el proposito de la cita a 6 bandas, solo creara complicaciones y escollos en ella y quedara aislado y perjudicado.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
