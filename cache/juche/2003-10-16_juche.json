The completion of the project made it possible to use water from a reservoir for sufficiently irrigating at least 11,000 hectares of land in Kangryong and Ongjin though it could hardly be used for that purpose in the past.\r\n As a result, at least 1,000 hectares of new land has been obtained. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A ceremony for its completion was held on the spot on Tuesday. Thanks from leader Kim Jong Il were conveyed to the officials and working people who contributed to its completion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A reporter and speakers recalled that Kim Jong Il laid down a task to carry out the project in order to satisfactorily solve the problem of water in Kangryong and Ongjin counties and wisely led the drive to fulfil it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Officials and builders of the South Hwanghae Provincial Tideland Construction Complex carried out a herculean task to remove more than 437,000 cubic meters of earth in a matter of one year and 8 months, thus building a new edifice in the Songun era, they said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that Kim Jong Il named the reservoir \"Lake Kangryong\", they called on all the officials and working people to repay his love and trust by achieving successes in the agricultural production. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present at the ceremony were Vice-Premier of the Cabinet Kwak Pom Gi, Minister of Agriculture Ri Kyong Sik and others. \r\n  \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japanese Racket over \"Abduction Issue\" Dismissed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 15 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary denounces the Japanese reactionaries for grossly violating the spirit and agreed points of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration and working hard to use the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. for meeting their selfish purpose.\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are now kicking up a racket, peddling the \"abduction issue\" in the international arena including the United Nations, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has pursued a hostile policy towards the DPRK for more than half a century without redeeming its past crimes committed against the Korean people, thus causing the hostile relations between the DPRK and Japan to persist and the anti-Japanese sentiment of the Korean people to grow bitter generation after generation. The \"abduction issue\" was an abnormal isolated phenomenon that occurred against this backdrop. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This issue had already been solved by the adoption of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration. There is neither reason nor ground for Japan to link the issue to the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is concerned, it surfaced as the U.S. has pursued a policy of stifling the DPRK after shipping nukes into south Korea. The nuclear issue is something to be solved between the DPRK and the U.S. But Pyongyang showed such magnanimity as allowing Japan to participate in the six-way talks to discuss the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S., taking its face into consideration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The real intention of the Japanese authorities is to compound the nuclear issue and not to see it settled peacefully and diplomatically under any circumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind this is a sinister design of the present rulers to step up the moves to turn Japan's domestic policy to the Right and militarize it under the pretext of the nuclear issue in a bid to consolidate their ruling foundation and establish a military fascist system for overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are fostering a war atmosphere, while getting more zealously involved in the U.S.-pursued strategy for international pressure and blockade against the DPRK than any others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality more clearly proves that Japan can do nothing for solving the DPRK-U.S. nuclear issue. Now that it is clearer that Japan is not the party that the DPRK can deal with it will never allow Tokyo to meddle in any form of negotiations for the settlement of the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should know that the noisier anti-DPRK racket Japan kicks up under the pretext of the \"abduction issue\" the more indelibly it will stain its own name. \r\n \r\n\r\n"

This is linked, in a way, with treacheries of the GNP toeing the U.S. line of stifling the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is viciously seeking to stop the trend of reconciliation and cooperation between the north and south of Korea and realize its policy of aggression against the north under the pretext of its nuclear standoff with the DPRK. Today when the destiny of the nation and the prospects of the inter-Korean relations are in danger owing to the foreign forces, the political parties in this land, leftist or rightist, conservative or innovative, should turn out to dispel the nation's disasters and promote the course of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nothing correct can be found in the policies of the GNP toward the north, external and internal. Its external policy is invariably pro-U.S. flunkeyist and blind tailing behind the U.S., its policy toward the north is anti-reunification and confrontational and its internal policy fascism-seeking.  What it pursues in its policy toward the north is anti-reunification and confrontation based on the \"doctrine of principal enemy\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present era is an era of reconciliation and cooperation between the north and the south to achieve peace and reunification by concerted efforts of the nation. It is a tragedy that the party is still desperately trying to find a way of returning to power, failing to draw a lesson from its setback. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In a word, the GNP is a useless party too far removed from the era of the independent reunification of the nation. It is high time the party disappeared from the historical scene. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP should make a bold decision and dissolve itself without delay.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is, therefore, the master key to finding a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue for the U.S. to make a switchover in its policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., however, has not shown any will to make a switchover in its anachronistic hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the contrary, it is set to further its hostile policy towards the DPRK aimed at stifling the DPRK militarily in the future, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is clearly evidenced by the U.S. ever more undisguised moves to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These U.S. moves compel the DPRK to steadily increase its self-defensive nuclear deterrent force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will continue strengthening its self-defensive measure. The U.S. should abandon its anachronistic hostile policy towards the DPRK and accept the proposal for the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty with the DPRK, the commentary urges.    \r\n    \r\n\r\n"

Defence industry is the lifeline in building a great prosperous powerful nation. \r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article, a summary of which reads: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The strengthening of national power and building of a great prosperous powerful nation are unthinkable apart from the development of a powerful defence industry. Today when powerful and weak states are distinguished by their military strength, greatest efforts must be directed to strengthening defences in order to truly achieve the prosperity of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the present times, military affairs are of top weight, defence industry is of primary importance and to develop it arises as a vital matter. Defence industry is the material foundation for increasing military strength and its practical potential. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Defence industry is now the hardcore and leading industry as it represents the level of the development of heavy industry and its might in each country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The defence industry of the DPRK has developed into a powerful one capable of modernizing the whole army, arming all the people and turning the whole country into a fortress on a higher level by successfully manufacturing modern offensive and defensive means, powerful military hardware and combat technical equipment of our style. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the DPRK has invincible revolutionary armed forces and a powerful military deterrent thoroughly prepared politically and ideologically and in military technique, it is shattering at every step all the aggressive moves of the U.S. which poses itself the world's \"only superpower\" and defending the sovereignty, dignity and peace of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and the people of the DPRK will further develop defence industry, holding high the great banner of Songun, and thus increase the national power in every way and build a great prosperous powerful nation of Juche on this land.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
