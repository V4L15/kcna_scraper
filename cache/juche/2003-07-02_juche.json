            "content": "KCNA flails Japan's moves to blockade DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 1 (KCNA) -- The Japanese government is contemplating the adjustment of the system of exchanging information about illegal export with other Asian countries under the pretext of \"preventing the illegal supply of weapons of mass destruction and missile substance.\" \r\n The adjustment of the system much publicized by Japan is aimed to set up an institutional mechanism of intercepting and inspecting vessels and aircraft that transport nuclear substance, missile parts or facilities and materials needed for manufacturing them. This is, in essence, designed to justify its blockade against the DPRK in all parts of Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Explicitly speaking, the DPRK has not acceded to the missile technology control system and, therefore, it is an independent sovereign state that is not bound to any law as far as export and transfer of technology are concerned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK government's policy of export of arms calls for making legal trade to meet demands of sovereign states for their legitimate self-defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Therefore, the Japanese reactionaries' view that the DPRK might have smuggled nuclear substance and missiles to terrorist groups can not but be an insult to the DPRK's firm stand against terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's intention to intercept and inspect the DPRK's vessels is an insolent act that wantonly violates international law which bans searching or seizing ships in the open sea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is that the Japanese reactionaries are acting a shock brigade in carrying out the Bush administration's policy to lay an international siege to the DPRK, taking advantage of its policy to stifle the DPRK in the wake of the U.S.-Japan summit talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a publicly known fact that Bush and Koizumi vowed to inspect the DPRK's ships under the pretext of preventing the \"smuggling of drugs and weapons and the illegal financial transaction\" at the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To this end, Japan discussed the issue of setting its maritime \"self-defence force\" in motion to \"intercept the DPRK's ships engaged in smuggling drugs, weapons and counterfeit money\" and the way of taking \"multilateral measures\" against its ships in the open sea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Moreover, the chief cabinet secretary of Japan officially declared that he would take all measures including the inspection of the DPRK's ships at 50 Japanese ports. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All this goes to clearly prove that by misusing the complicated and tense situation on the Korean peninsula the Japanese reactionaries seek to evade its responsibility to compensate for its hideous crimes committed against the Koreans in the past and realize its ambition for the reinvasion of Korea at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan infringes upon the sovereignty of the DPRK in cooperation with the U.S., prompted by a sinister intention, the DPRK will not hesitate to strongly retaliate against it.    \r\n"

On June 13 EP-3 electronic reconnaissance plane flew over Taebu islet, Hoengsong and Kangrung to spy on coastal areas and seabed of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aerial espionage getting more frantic in the wake of the \"conclusion\" of the Iraqi war of aggression clearly proves that the U.S. imperialists are becoming more undisguised in their moves to make a surprise preemptive attack on the DPRK over its \"nuclear issue.\"    \r\n    \r\n"

            "content": "U.S. deputy defense secretary's outbursts rebuffed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 1 (KCNA) -- Some days before U.S. deputy defense secretary Wolfowitz, addressing a meeting of the house armed services committee, said: \"the U.S. has the military  capabilities to defeat North Korea, using all of the means at our disposal, the enormously improved strike capabilities that the world had seen in Iraq.\" He uttered this while raising a hue and cry over the possibility of the DPRK's attack upon someone.\r\n And he said that \"the U.S. would make substantial investments to further strengthen the war fighting capabilities of the U.S. troops in South Korea and expect South Korea to significantly increase its military spending to cope with a possible war.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary says that in view of the war outcries made by Wolfowitz, the outbreak of the second Korean war no longer seems to be a hypothesis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. plan for a military attack upon the DPRK has already been put into concrete shape. The U.S. is persistently insisting on multilateral talks in a bid to shift the responsibility for the nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula onto the DPRK, while turning aside from the DPRK's constructive and principled proposals. This means that Washington is at the phase of making preparations for a military attack on the DPRK to stifle it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its next phase is to lay an international siege to the DPRK in a bid to suffocate it and, on this basis, launch a war to finally seize the whole Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the U.S. really seeks is not the settlement of the nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula but putting it under its complete military control. This is clearly evidenced by the massive deployment of ultra-modern military hardware and intelligence gathering means and the relocation of the U.S. troops in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. warlike forces provoke a war against the army and people of the DPRK, the Korean peninsula will turn into a graveyard of aggressors.    \r\n\r\n"

This is prompted by their sinister intention to further aggravate the situation on the Korean peninsula in a bid to realize their invariable ambition for reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ambition of the Japanese reactionaries to stage a comeback to Korea remains unchanged, the commentary observes, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are now getting very busy with putting the \"laws on emergency\" into force and revising the present constitution. All this is aimed to realize their ambition for reinvasion. They regard the escalating tensions on the Korean peninsula as a golden opportunity for realizing this ambition. It is their hope that the nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula will lead to the outbreak of a new war between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The possibility of a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is steadily waning while the outbreak of the second Korean war is becoming a fait accompli due to the U.S. moves to stifle the DPRK and the Japanese reactionaries' reckless moves to join in them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries had better think twice over the inescapable, strong retaliation to be entailed by their reckless moves to stifle the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"

Later, in ancient times, lute-shaped bronze daggers, narrow brass daggers, headband buttons of the horse and cart fittings, rings, bells, beads, necklaces and other articles of daily use and ornaments were turned out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the period of Koguryo metalwork made a rapid progress in a diverse way with marked national characteristics. Of particular note were gold crowns, earrings, necklaces, rings, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the Koryo dynasty, achievements of advanced science and technology and plastic art were turned to good account in employing a wide variety of new techniques and skills. The manufactured goods were of great artistic value. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Typical damascene objects of Koryo are water jugs with landscapes inlaid with gold and silver thread, plates inlaid with silver thread and mirror stands, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the period of the Ri dynasty the shapes of metalwork and ornaments were simple and natural, free from ostentation and exaggeration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the products show well Korea's long and rich tradition of metal crafts. \r\n Today metalwork makes progress at a new higher stage in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With the introduction of modern metal processing technique, precision casting method and new stamping technique, the metal crafts have become more delicate and precise. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The method of casting on the surface of actual object presented by the DPRK was awarded a gold-silver medal at the 24th international exhibition of inventions, new techniques and new products held in Geneva in 1996.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea is at the crossroads of war or peace. It is, in fact, hardly possible to preserve the cease-fire in Korea by the unilateral efforts of the Korean People's Army side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On May 31 the U.S. side announced its \"plan for arms buildup\" aimed to equip its forces present in South Korea with new types of weapons, thus totally ditching paragraph 13 d of the armistice agreement which calls for ceasing the introduction into Korea of reinforcing combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the \"plan\" the U.S. will allot 11 billion U.S. dollars as military spending in a short span of time in a bid to massively introduce modern unmanned aircraft, armed helicopters, latest missiles, precision guided bombs, infantry combat vehicles, electronic command system, etc. into South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such massive military reinforcement proves that the U.S. preparations for attack on the DPRK have reached the final stage under the new strategy of \"preemptive strike\", instead of the \"deterrence\" strategy which has been so far pursued. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the same time, the U.S. is seeking to impose \"sea and air blockade\" and lay an \"international siege network\" against the DPRK by instigating its allies, including Japan, in disregard of paragraph 15 of the Armistice Agreement, which stipulates a ban on blockade of any kind in Korea. This action is aggravating the situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such military reinforcement, massive concentration of armed forces and blockade against one side of the two signatories to the AA in gross violation of it will mean a war in fact. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dark clouds of war are gathering to hang over the Korean peninsula as the days go by. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has already begun relocating its forces in South Korea to areas south of the River Han in a bid to save the forces from the KPA artillery firing range and create conditions for making a preemptive strike at the DPRK any time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, there is no place in South Korea for the U.S. forces to escape from strike of the KPA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any possible war in Korea will not be such a limited unilateral war as that fought in Afghanistan and Iraq but the fiercest and hardest fought war, life and death battles unprecedented in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people have steadily made full preparations to cope with such a grave war, well aware of it, experiencing all sorts of misfortune and hardships caused by the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK for the past scores of years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK sternly warns the U.S. that it will be held wholly responsible for the irrevocable serious consequences to be entailed by its complete abrogation of the AA and horrible disasters to be inflicted upon the innocent South Koreans by its reckless war action, in particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. side applies sanctions against the DPRK and conducts sea and air blockade against it anywhere and starts bolstering up troops in and around the Korean peninsula, the KPA side will promptly regard it as a complete breach of the AA by the U.S. side and will immediately take strong and merciless  retaliatory measures against the infringement upon the DPRK's sovereignty by mobilizing all its potentials, completely free from the binding force of the AA.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
