He highly appreciated the merits performed by the soldier-builders, greatly satisfied with the successful construction of the farm.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went round pig sties, assorted feed and processing factories and various other places of the farm to acquaint himself in detail with its technical equipment and breeding.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He set forth important tasks which would serve as guidelines in managing and operating the farm and increasing the pork production, pleased to learn that the employees of the farm are mass-producing pork and quality processed products by establishing a scientific production system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to increase the production of pork on the farm, it is necessary to put the breeding on a scientific basis and make sustained efforts to raise the level of technical skill of the producers and, at the same time, to energetically push forward the work to introduce advanced technology, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that a scientific breeding system has been established at the chicken and pig farms that have mushroomed in recent years is now paying off profusely, he added that this reality eloquently proves that it is possible to bring about a change in the stock-breeding, too, in a brief span of time if full play is given to the people's revolutionary spirit and creative ingenuity on the basis of the advantages of the Korean-style socialist system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A solid material and technical foundation has been laid in the country to make a leap forward in the production of pork including the establishment of the system for breeding superior pedigree stock, he noted, underscoring the need to raise pigs in a big way by taking advantage of these favorable conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He called on all fields and units to wage a dynamic popular movement to further develop the stock-breeding so as to provide the people with a more affluent and highly civilized life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by KPA Generals Ri Myong Su, Hyon Chol Hae and Pak Jae Gyong.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japanese Reactionaries' Attempt to Grab Korea's Territory Denounced \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 8 (KCNA) -- Some time ago, the Japanese government informed the International Hydrographic Organization of its will to make measurements of waterway near Tok Islet until the end of June. In this regard, the Japanese ambassador in Seoul alleged that the waters to be measured is the exclusive economical waters of Japan. Even the Japanese chief executive said that Japan may resolutely take a physical countermeasure regarding the issue of Tok Islet.\r\n The Japanese reactionaries has tried in every way to grab Tok Islet, but never in such a brigandish way as now, says Rodong Sinmun Monday in a signed commentary.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's more naked moves for territorial expansion are a very grave and dangerous attempt. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To make the islet an area of international dispute and grab it is one of the cunning and impudent territorial rapacity methods peculiar to Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Tok Islet is not a controversial territory whose owner is uncertain. It is well known to the world that the islet is a hereditary islet of Korea. Nevertheless, Japan is going to make the islet an international controversial area to grab it, which is an imprudent action that can be done only by robbers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are also attempting to invade the islet by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Insisting on dominium over the islet, Japan is resorting to ill-boding military moves. Japan is keen to commit \"Self-Defense Forces\" to sea near Tok Islet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Marine resources are rich and natural gas and other energy resources are deposited plenty around the islet. The islet is very important militarily and strategically as it is situated near the Korean Peninsula. This is why the Japanese reactionaries are going to grab Tok Islet at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is foolish and reckless for them to grab the islet, an inalienable part of the Korean territory.    \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The pro-U.S. conservatives in south Korea are treacherous forces as they have pursued anachronistic country-selling politics, bringing only misfortunes and pain to the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All sorts of misfortunes and pain of the south Korean people are chiefly attributable to the U.S. imperialists' policy of domination and subjugation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This being a hard reality, the Grand National Party in south Korea hell-bent on flunkeyism and dependence upon foreign forces has followed such country-selling politics as zealously backing and protecting the U.S. imperialists' presence in south Korea and domination over it and clinging to their coattails though the Korean nation lives in the June 15 era of  reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people have been subject to unspeakable sacrifices and sufferings under the tyrannical rule of the successive fascist dictatorial regimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the GNP and other pro-U.S. conservative forces are making desperate efforts to repeat the crime-woven past history. They are openly whitewashing the fascist repressive regimes of the past dictatorial forces, talking about what they call \"the nature of their system\" and \"legacy of the right-wing,\" far from reflecting on the crimes committed by their predecessors. The GNP claims it will do something for the people whenever an opportunity presents itself, but it, in fact, turns its faces away from their misfortunes in pursuance of its partisan interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are only stoking the inter-Korean confrontation, opposed to national reconciliation and reunification, and thus adding to the people's misfortunes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are dead-set against the independent reunification of Korea. They have not yet uttered even a word of support to the June 15 joint declaration but persistently pursued north-south confrontation under the patronage of their American master. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The formation of a great alliance against the conservative forces would pave the way for eliminating the root cause of misfortunes and pain of the south Korean people and carving out an independent life, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
