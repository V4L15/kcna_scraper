            "content": "Rodong Sinmun rechaza acto de Japon para hacerse miembro de CS\r\nPyongyang, 3 de diciembre (ATCC) -- En el debate del informe y el problema de reforma del Consejo de Seguridad en el pleno del 63o periodo de sesiones de la Asamblea General de la ONU, efectuado hace poco, Japon explico de manera verbosa la \"legalidad\" de su ingreso en el CS de la ONU actuando atrevidamente para ocupar la posicion responsable de la ONU.\n\t\t\t\t\tEl diario Rodong Sinmun, en un comentario individual difundido en su edicion de este miercoles, lo califica de una imprudencia y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japon no tiene la calificacion de hablar del ingreso en el CS de la ONU, porque es el pais que cometio archi-crimenes anti-eticos en el pasado y que hasta la fecha no hace reflexion sincera ni indemnizacion merecida. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Los que niegan y tergiversan la historia criminal no pueden hacer una nueva partida ni tener el futuro, sino repiten los crimenes del pasado. Tales fuerzas no pueden desempenar el papel responsable en la sociedad internacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   El proceder impudico e indiscreto de Japon, que, sin darse cuenta de su situacion ni de la tendencia mundial, intenta hacerse miembro permanente del CS de la ONU, hablando de alguna \"legitimidad\", deviene una burla e insulto a la justicia y la conciencia de la humanidad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El puesto del pais miembro permanente del CS de la ONU no lo pueden ocupar con el deseo ni comprarlo con el dinero. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Antes de ambicionar atrevidamente el cargo responsable de la ONU, Japon debe liquidar sus crimenes del pasado, liberarse del pais enemigo y ganar la confianza internacional. Esto es la tarea inminente para la isla. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Si no, no puede evadir la frialdad y el rechazo de la sociedad internacional ni realizar su sueno con el ingreso en el CS de la ONU."
