The one is wide and long enough to wrap up body and the other is short and round in shape, both sides joined.\r\n   The upper part of skirt is pleated around waist and the lower part drops free.\r\n   The skirt for ceremony and for outgoing is comparatively long and the one for daily life is short. Length is different according to age.\r\n   Skirts are various in fabrics and colour according to age and seasons and their patterns are graceful.\r\n   The jacket is made short to cling to body. Neckband, strip and hem of the jacket look well. \r\n   In Korea women have been encouraged to wear this national dress suitable for their noble disposition and figure \r\n\r\n"

Korean authorities\r\nPyongyang, January 20 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today comes out with a signed commentary denouncing the South Korean authorities for frantically staging war exercises against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from the beginning of the year.\r\n   The South Korean warmaniacs have staged a cold winter tactical training from January 11 with the mobilisation of a unit of the army. They decided to supply 1.93 million gas masks to ordinary inhabitants allegedly to provide for the \"chemical, biological and radioactive warfare\" and announced a plan to pass tanks through downtown Seoul for a \"military training.\"\r\n   Commenting on the war hysteria, a news analyst of the paper says:\r\n   It cannot go unnoticed that the South Korean authorities have staged provocative military rackets at the time when the U.S. warmaniacs are making military moves to provoke a war on the Korean peninsula, reorganising the U.S. 8th Army Command into the Field Army Command.\r\n   Underlying them is a dangerous criminal design of the authorities to unleash a war against the north at any cost according to the war scenario they had already worked out along with their U.S. masters.\r\n   It is very clear that they are frantically trying to find a way out of their ruin in igniting a war against the north.\r\n   We warn again that they must not act rashly, mindful of the serious consequences to be entailed by their war hysteria.    \r\n \r\n"

The revised \"guidelines\" makes it possible to guarantee Japan's \"aid to the U.S. Forces\" in \"the emergency\" around Japan, not only in \"the emergency\" in Japan. In other words, the Japanese \"SDF\" has the \"lawful rights\" to joint operations with the U.S. Forces in the whole Asia-Pacific region and to reinvasion.\r\n   \"The emergency\" around Japan advertised by the U.S. and Japanese warhawks means \"the emergency on the Korean Peninsula\". This has vividly been proved by the facts that most of the seaports and airports chosen by the U.S. for Their use in \"the emergency\" according to the new \"guidelines\" are near the Korean Peninsula and that the operations the examination of which is now under way to cope with \"the emergency\" are all to be carried out in case of war in Korea.\r\n   The soon-to-be-inaugurated \"joint examination institution\" is aimed mainly at examining preemptive attack on the DPRK.\r\n   Clear is the ulterior intention of the U.S. and Japanese warmaniacs. They are now tempted by the wild ambition to stifle the DPRK by force of arms and establish domination over the Asia-Pacific region. They should be mindful that their war gamble will bring nothing good to them.\r\n   We have means to defend of the sovereignty and security of the country. We will make every possible effort to the end.    \r\n\r\n"
