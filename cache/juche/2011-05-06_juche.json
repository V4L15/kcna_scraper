Going round several places of the Tetron spun rayon fabrics shop, he acquainted himself in detail with the production there and technological features and efficiency of the new equipment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He looked at clothing and shirting materials made from Tetron spun rayon fabrics, cotton chequer and curtain cloth one by one and underscored the need to increase the production of clothing materials and varieties of fabrics liked by people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He enjoyed a performance given by members of the itinerant art squad of the mill on the spot and highly appreciated their splendid performance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He advanced important tasks facing the mill.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The second leg of his guidance was the Rakrang Ponghwa Garment Factory. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After looking round the room devoted to the history of the factory, he dropped in at different production processes to learn in detail about its management and operation and production there. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He praised the factory for assiduously managing its economic life, noting that though it is not long since it was commissioned, it widely introduced new technology and managed its business activities on the principle of profitability and, at the same time, waged a widespread mass technical innovation movement, thus keeping the production going at a high rate. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  It is important to increase varieties of garments and improve their quality, he noted, adding that to this end it is necessary to boost the production of varieties of garments for all seasons and favorite clothes for women's usual wear and steadily improve the quality of garment processing as required by the era by raising the skills of the workers. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The third leg of his guidance was the Ponghwa Soup Factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching varieties of quality washing soups churning out in an endless stream, he expressed great satisfaction over the fact that the workers and technicians of the factory have successfully built the soup production processes to greatly contribute to the people's cultured practice in hygiene and radically increased the production by devoting their wisdom and enthusiasm.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Greatly satisfied to hear a report that \"Ponghwa\" washing soups are high in people's demand as they are high in their quality, he was pleased that it has become possible to provide the people with a sufficient amount of quality washing soups.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The last leg of his guidance was the Pyongyang Mechanical Pencil Factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Making the rounds of various places of the factory including the room devoted to the history of the factory and the products showcase room, he acquainted himself in detail with production and updating there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The factory is a cutting-edge one in which all the processes from raw material feeding to packing and forwarding are streamlined, he said, praising the workers of the factory for mass-producing quality writing materials.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The officials, workers and technicians of the factory put the factory on a high level of CNC by pooling efforts with teachers and researchers at Kim Il Sung University and Kim Chaek University of Technology, he noted, adding that this shining success is a striking demonstration of the validity and vitality of the WPK's policy on attaching importance to science and technology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that reliable university students of the younger generation who received revolutionary and Juche-based education, teachers and researchers are making a breakthrough in the drive for building an economic power at the grandiose sites on the socialist front, he noted, adding that the large army of young scientists, the great pride of our party and people, are the driving force and treasure for national prosperity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Kim Ki Nam, member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the C.C., the WPK, Kim Kyong Hui, member of the Political Bureau and department director of the C.C., the WPK, Jang Song Thaek, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the C.C., the WPK and vice-chairman of the NDC, Thae Jong Su, alternate member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the C.C., the WPK, and Mun Kyong Dok, alternate member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the C.C., the WPK and chief secretary of the Pyongyang City Committee of the WPK."

Korea's Theory of \"Unification through Absorption\" Blasted\r\n Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Disarmament and Peace Institute of the DPRK Foreign Ministry Friday issued the following statement:\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities have recently taken an ill-boding move to peddle the theory of \"unification through absorption\" in the international arena.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Unifying the systems\" in the reality of the Korean Peninsula precisely means \"unification through absorption\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is well known that the present authorities of south Korea adopted \"unification through absorption\" as a state policy from the outset and have persistently pursued it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey advocated \"no nuke, opening and 3000 dollars\" right after they took office, called for instituting \"unification tax\" last year and advanced the proposal for achieving \"three-phase unification.\" All this was a policy for confrontation based on \"unification through absorption\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They invited ambassadors of neighboring countries to participate in the debate on unification in Seoul recently and staged a farce of advertising the above-said theory. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nonsensical and dangerous is the theory of \"unification through absorption\" touted by the present rulers of south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and Japan lost nearly 20 years due to their repeated DPRK policy failures under the miscalculation that the DPRK would collapse just as East European countries did. It was a hard reality that they compelled the DPRK to have access to nuclear weapons in the end.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the situation where there is deep-rooted distrust between the north and the south and huge armed forces are standing in confrontation with each other, any attempt on the part of a side to swallow the other side up would inevitably spark a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The neighboring countries are required to ponder over what consequences would bring to the Korean Peninsula by their behavior agreeing to the above-said theory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If they are truly interested in the reunification of the Korean Peninsula, they should pay attention to the proposal for achieving reunification by federal formula already solemnly clarified internally and externally by the June 15 joint declaration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The said proposal of the DPRK is the best one for peaceful reunification as it guarantees feasibility and helps avert war because it presupposes the co-existence of the present systems in the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The proposal is a reasonable one in line with the interests of the neighboring countries because it presupposes the neutrality of a unified state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A sinister aim is lurking behind the south Korean authorities' moves to internationalize the above-said theory in a bid to make the debate on it heated. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The so-called \"waiting strategy\" pursued by them in inter-Korean relations is now going bankrupt.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The international community is now aware that the tense situation on the peninsula reached the brink of war last year entirely because of the south Korean authorities' confrontation policy. It is now, therefore, becoming increasingly assertive for resuming the inter-Korean dialogue to defuse confrontation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Much upset by this, they are going busy to step up the debate on unification in a bid to create the impression that \"contingency\" is imminent in the DPRK and \"unification under liberal democracy\" led by them is drawing near.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pressurized by the public at home and abroad to resume dialogue and negotiations, they are giving lip-service to \"open-hearted\" dialogue but, in actuality, making it impossible for dialogue to open by craftily raising unreasonable preconditions unacceptable to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a base scenario for them to justify their \"waiting strategy\" and bar their allies from coming out for dialogue with the DPRK or feeling any need to give humanitarian aid to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those who study the reunification issue at home and abroad would be well advised to pay due attention to the truth about such debate on unification taking place in south Korea these days."

            "content": "CPRK Denounces S. Korea's Anti-DPRK Human Rights Campaign\r\n Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea Thursday gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA as regards the south Korean puppet group's unprecedented human rights campaign against the DPRK:\n\t\t\t\t\t As already known, the puppet group invited riffraffs of the U.S. and Japan to Seoul to stage a noisy campaign from April 24 to May 1 to seriously hurt the dignity and system of the DPRK and incite confrontation with fellow countrymen under the signboard of \"week for north's freedom\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Worse still, the puppet group is running the whole gamut of base moves to enact at any cost the extremely draconic \"law on North Korea's human rights\" which had been reduced to a dead paper by the public rebuff and condemnation. It let the puppet State Human Rights Committee stage such a burlesque as working out \"a report on human rights abuses in north Korea\" and making \"a survey of human rights situation\". It went the lengths of kicking off ridiculous diplomacy in the international arena in a bid to have an \"international investigation committee\" created.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is nothing but the last-ditch effort of those driven into a tight corner by the total failure of its domestic and foreign policies and the public judgment. In the past three years of the office of the puppet group south Korea has turned into the worst tundra of human rights and democracy, touching off the towering grudge among the people against the ruling quarters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The democratic freedom and rights are ruthlessly trampled down and people are deprived of their vital rights, plunging their living into destitution under the fascist dictatorial rule.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean people are threatened with a nuclear disaster, to say nothing of their rights, due to the reckless moves of the puppet group to escalate the confrontation with compatriots and ignite a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The returns of the April 27 by-election in south Korea clearly showed the bitter hatred of the south Korean public for the puppet group. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To make matters worse, the puppet group's reckless moves to escalate the confrontation with the DPRK and nuclear racket against it only rendered the group further isolated at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through its anti-DPRK human rights campaign the puppet group seeks a sinister aim to divert elsewhere the south Korean public's criticism of it and intensify the anti-DPRK smear campaign under the pretext of human rights in a bid to recover from its failure of the above-said policy and nuclear racket and thus tarnish the dignity of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the height of folly for the puppet conservative group to kick up an anti-DPRK human rights campaign in a bid to hurt the socialist system centred on the popular masses in the DPRK though it is standing public trial for having reduced south Korea to a graveyard of human rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The more vociferous the puppet group is becoming over the non-existent \"human rights\" issue of someone, the more saliently it will reveal its true colors as a group of maniacs seeking confrontation with fellow countrymen and anti-reunification elements.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean people will never pardon but severely punish those who try to do harm to the dignity and system of the DPRK even a bit."

They cannot repress resentment at the south Korean puppet forces who are keen to repeat the shelling exercises there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"Cheonan\" warship sinking case, the hideous conspiratorial case, and the Yongphyong Island shelling case seriously affected the national reconciliation and unity as they were provocations to the DPRK, products of the reckless ambition of the hostile forces to invade it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the south Korean puppet group has ceaselessly introduced a lot of modern military equipment into areas along the maritime demarcation line in the West Sea including Yongphyong Island and is staging military exercises in these areas almost every day, watching for a chance to provoke the DPRK. This is evidenced by the fact that it kicked off war hysteria, firing various types of artillery pieces into the waters off Paekryong Island and Yonphyong Island in March and it is talking about \"diverse provocations\" of someone in a bid to create the impression that it is exposed to great threat. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through such military confrontation as firing exercises on Yongphyong Island the south Korean military seeks to cast chill on the public opinion at home and abroad calling for the detente on the Korean Peninsula and improving the inter-Korean relations and ignite a war of aggression against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean belligerent forces would be well advised to stop their rash acts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those who seek danger are bound to perish therein."

Rodong Sinmun Friday says this in a bylined article. This is proved by the lapse of three years since the conservative forces came to power in south Korea, the article notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t Those forces have further intensified the above-said moves with each passing day to do harm to compatriots. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What frantic moves these forces have stepped up to bolster up the armed forces for invading the north find a vivid manifestation in the fact that the funds spent for arms purchase with the money collected from the people as taxes steadily swelled every year. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The bellicose nature of the ruling conservative forces was brought to light by the fact that they have staged madcap joint military exercises with outside forces almost every day since the outset of their office. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The number of the joint military exercises staged by the conservative authorities in collusion with outside forces over the last three years under diverse codenames steadily increased: 31 in 2008, 37 in 2009 and 50 in 2010. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From the beginning of their office they revived the \"theory of principal enemy\" and recklessly incited consciousness of confrontation with fellow countrymen throughout the society, letting loose such provocative remarks as \"preemptive attack\" on the north and \"retaliation and punishment.\" They also persistently conducted an anti-DPRK psychological warfare including reckless scattering of leaflets on the west coast and the central and eastern areas along the Military Demarcation Line. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Yonphyong Island shelling incident in which shells were fired into the inviolable territorial waters of the DPTK despite its repeated warnings and all what happened in the subsequent period bring to light the wild ambition of the conservative forces for invading the north. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the conservative authorities' moves to escalate the confrontation and start a war would not show them a way out but precipitate their self-destruction."

En tal circunstancia, si una parte intenta devorar a la contraparte, será inevitable la guerra. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos países vecinos deben reflexionar seriamente de las consecuencias que traiga a la Península Coreana su adherencia a la teoría en cuestión. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi ellos están interesados de veras en la reunificación de la Península Coreana, tendrían que prestar atención al proyecto de reunificación mediante el sistema federal, aclarado solemnemente al interior y el exterior del país mediante la Declaración Conjunta Norte-Sur del 15 de Junio. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste proyecto es el mejor y racional remedio para prevenir la guerra y conviene a los intereses de los países vecinos porque toma por premisa la coexistencia de los regímenes existentes en el Norte y el Sur y el neutralismo del Estado reunificado. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas pretenden internacionalizar la discusión sobre la \"reunificación mediante la absorción\" para alcanzar su siniestro objetivo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora está condenada al fracaso la llamada \"estrategia de espera\" que persiguen ellas en las relaciones Norte-Sur. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa sociedad internacional se dio cuenta de que la causa de las tensiones de la Península Coreana, que en el año pasado, habían llegado al borde de guerra, reside en la política conflictiva del Sur de Corea y alza las voces en demanda de la eliminación del ambiente de confrontación mediante la reanudación del diálogo entre ambas partes coreanas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara salir del atolladero, las autoridades surcoreanas intentan activar la discusión sobre la reunificación para dar la impresión de que es inminente la \"situación de emergencia\" en la RPDC y se aproxima la reunificación bajo el \"sistema democrático liberal\" y con el protagonismo de sí mismas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPresionadas por nacionales y extranjeras para que reanudaran el diálogo y negociaciones, dicen por una parte que \"su alma está abierta\" al diálogo y por la otra, lo impiden presentando taimadamente las injustas condiciones nunca aceptables para la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe esta manera, quieren realizar su sucio intento de justificar su \"estrategia de espera\" y convencer a sus aliados para que consideren innecesarios el diálogo con la RPDC o los suministros de cooperación humanitaria. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos estudiosos nacionales y extranjeros del problema de reunificación deberán prestar debida atención a lo que hay detrás de las discusiones sobre la reunificación que se abren últimamente en el Sur de Corea."
