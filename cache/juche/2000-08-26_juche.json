They are also instilling into the Japanese the idea that only those who take the lead in the war can be entombed there to be \"respected\" even after their death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In history textbooks and all other books without exception the Japanese reactionaries have described the war of aggression committed by the Japanese imperialists as one aimed to \"liberate\" Asia from aggression by western big powers and bring \"peace\" to Asia, and tried hard to cover up all the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists by claiming that they enforced a \"good rule\" in Asian countries. This is a brigandish logic. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan is now interpreting the provisions of its \"peace constitution\" as it pleases and is free to dispatch the \"Self-Defence Forces\" overseas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It has gone the length of openly revealing its intention to build a \"SDF\" military base in an Asian country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is planning to stage a comprehensive military drill in Tokyo metropolis under the pretext of \"preventing disasters\". It is expected to be participated in by division size units of \"SDF's\" three services, various types of vehicles, warships and fighter planes and nearly 100 institutions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What should not be overlooked is that the training will be staged under the command of the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff of the \"SDF\" as advocated by Tokyo metropolitan governor Shintaro Ishihara, an ultra right-wing element. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan is keen on continuously pushing ahead with the joint technological research with the United States to establish the \"Theatre Missile Defence\" system and further increasing its military spending. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan's ambition of reinvasion has become an established fact. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Its first target is the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But Japan is oblivious of the lesson of history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japanese imperialism was defeated not because of its weak strength but because it swimmed against the trend of history. \r\n\r\n"
