            "content": "NRI Holds U.S., S. Korea Responsible for Danger of Nuclear War on Korean Peninsula \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, May 2 (KCNA) -- The National Reunification Institute (NRI) on Wednesday made public a white paper accusing the U.S. and south Korean puppet forces of pushing the situation on the Korean Peninsula to the brink of a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t The white paper said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and its lackeys, south Korean warmongers have been responsible for all incidents of military confrontation that pushed the situation on the Korean Peninsula to the brink of a war and stunned the world for several decades. To cite a few examples, they provoked the Korean War in the 1950s and there were the incidents of the U.S. spy warship Pueblo and the U.S. spy plane EC-121 in the 1960s, the Panmunjom incident in the 1970s, the armed skirmishes in the West Sea of Korea and the Yonphyong Island shelling incident in the subsequent period.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S.-led hostile forces prodded the UN Security Council into fabricating an unreasonable \"resolution on sanctions\" against the DPRK over its legitimate satellite launch for peaceful purposes at the end of last year. This was a heinous provocation perpetrated in wanton violation of its dignity and sovereignty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To cope with this, the DPRK, as it had already warned, decisively countered the provocation of the U.S., the south Korean puppet group and other hostile forces by conducting the third underground nuclear test.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Much upset by it, the U.S. and south Korean puppet group got frantic in their moves to cook up additional UN \"resolution on sanctions\" against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By putting in motion its hand-raising machine, the U.S. cooked up the UN \"resolution on sanctions\" 2094 against the DPRK in March, 2013.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This was more provocative than the last UN \"resolution\" 2087. It was nothing but a vicious document of blackmail and a de facto declaration of war as it calls for isolating and stifling the DPRK by totally blockading its sky, land and seas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Timed to coincide with the fabrication of the UN \"resolution on sanctions\", the U.S. and the south Korean warmongers staged the large-scale Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military exercises in south Korea since March last.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These drills were staged according to such extremely dangerous war scenarios as OPLAN 5027 and OPLAN 5029 which are aimed to mount a surprise attack upon the DPRK and occupy it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the south Korean warmongers didn't conceal that the main aim of such saber-rattling was to mount a preemptive nuclear attack upon the DPRK and a precision strike upon its headquarters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They went the lengths of staging mock drills to destroy the symbols of the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK after working out a vicious plan for the operations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The spokesman for the U.S. Department of Defense, the commander of the U.S. forces in south Korea and the south Korean military openly blustered that the drills were aimed \"to demonstrate the capability for a nuclear attack upon the DPRK\", and \"to mount a preemptive strike upon the strategic bases of the north and to strike its bases of counteractions, supporting forces and even commanding forces in case it launches counterattacks\" and \"they were staged under the simulated conditions of not only a local war but a total war\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, the south Korean puppet forces and the U.S. inked \"the plan for jointly countering the provocation of a local war,\" making the U.S. forces' involvement in the inter-Korean military conflicts an established fact. They staged drills for implementing the plan for a local war and an all-out war and various war scenarios for provocation in five islands in the West Sea of Korea, widely opening them to public.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. military and the brass-hats of the south Korean puppet army let loose a spate of such outbursts that \"they are simulating the worst scenarios and getting ready to cope with them\", \"the drills might go over to the phase of actual punishment\" and \"there is no limit to the scope of retaliatory punishment\". They went the lengths of crying out for \"wiping out the north government from the surface of the earth\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts go to clearly prove that the U.S. and the south Korean warmongers are the arch criminals who escalated the tension and brought the danger of a nuclear war to the Korean Peninsula."

It is an insult to the south Koreans as well as a provocation against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This goes to clearly prove that the present south Korean authorities claim they are \"different\" from the previous regime and they made \"a switchover in its policy toward the north\" but there is no change in essence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already known, the IS, successor to the Security Planning Board which followed in the footsteps of the Central Intelligence Agency in the period of ill-famed \"yusin\" dictatorship, revealed its true colors as a traitorous machine as soon as it made its appearance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is due to the operations of the IS that democratic rights, freedom and other rights of the south Korean people have been  ruthlessly trampled down and pro-reunification patriots and organizations harshly suppressed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than the IS which has persecuted and punished south Koreans and progressive forces aspiring after independence, democracy and reunification, after terming them \"the forces following the north\" and it is again the IS which is getting frantic in the \"human rights\" racket against the DPRK and operations to scatter leaflets and abduct fellow countrymen of the north. It was IS gangsters who orchestrated the hideous scenarios for destroying statues of the great leaders in a bid to hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There was a regime change and the boss of the IS was replaced by another in south Korea but information-gathering and plot-breeding activities got intensified to strengthen dictatorship and escalate  confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is evidenced by the fact that the guy who defiled the history of the mass patriotic struggle waged by south Koreans such as the popular uprising on Jeju Island was appointed as the boss of the IS under the patronage of the present authorities and the whirlwind for \"eliminating the forces following the north\" became more furious.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A series of spy cases such as \"defectors from the north\" which have been disclosed one after another bring to daylight the true colors of the IS as a center for hatching political plots and carrying out politically motivated terrorism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is an inevitability of history that the south Koreans from all walks of life are denouncing the present authorities and the IS for their moves to bring back the departed soul of the \"yusin\" dictatorship.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation proves once again that the south Koreans should disorganize the IS, the general headquarters of the fascist rule, in order to pave a wide avenue for achieving the reconciliation and unity of all Koreans."
