On December 9 that year, I met a man on my way home from visiting my son living in Taehongdan County, Ryanggang Province.

I went across the River Tuman on the back of the man but there was not my younger sister in China.\r\n I met a Japanese journalist and two Korean-speaking men in Dalian. They negotiated with the Japanese consulate general in Shenyang to take me to Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In Japan I met my younger sister whom I had eagerly wanted to see and my old friends, but lived there with tears for yearning for my grandchildren as the days go by. I learned through phone calls and letters that my grandchildren are in university, which I could not image in my dreams. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n I was cheated by bad guys into returning to Japan but my children and grandchildren have been cared for in the DPRK, free from any discrimination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis hard fact once again made me feel thankful for the benevolent politics of leader Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This prompted me to harden my determination to go back to the DPRK, to the care of the leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n I intend to go back to where there is my house and my children and grandchildren are waiting for me, as a proud citizen of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present at the press conference were an official of the Information Department of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, media persons of China and foreign correspondents in Beijing.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is a war scenario more adventurous and provocative than any of the previous ones they had constantly supplemented and rounded off for a preemptive attack on the DPRK, says Minju Joson in a commentary today.\r\n The keynote of the newly drafted \"OPLAN 5029-05,\" the news analyst goes on, is that the U.S. and south Korea should play the main role in openly inducing a war on the Korean Peninsula. Herein lies the grave nature of this war scenario against the DPRK.\r\n According to it, the south Korea-U.S. \"combined forces command\" will undertake all actions from working out detailed plans to carrying out operations. Under the previous plans, the U.S. Pacific Command was to mainly take charge of military operations and actions. So, the \"OPLAN 5029-05\" is an adventurous scenario aimed at the provocation of a Korean war by the \"combined forces command\" any time, and it is a very dangerous document allowing a preemptive attack on the DPRK in a short time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The plan has made it all the clearer that the U.S. harbors in actuality the sinister intention to stifle the idea and system of the DPRK, though it makes free with the phrases of \"peaceful solution to the nuclear issue\" and \"resumption of the six-way talks\". Now that the U.S. seeks to contain the DPRK by force, the army and people of the latter have no alternative but to put up a total rebuff.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "\"Resolution\" of Meeting of UN Commission on Human Rights Rejected\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- A \"resolution\" malignantly slandering the DPRK was adopted at the 61st meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights held in Geneva recently.\r\n In this regard, a spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry released a statement today declaring that human rights precisely mean national sovereignty and the DPRK will take a decisive measure against the continued misuse of the human rights issue as leverage for anti-DPRK hostile campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will never recognize the \"resolution\", which groundlessly slandered it over the non-existent \"human rights issue\", and bitterly and categorically rejects it as part of the moves of the hostile forces to isolate and stifle it, the statement noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Like last year's, the recent \"resolution\" is peppered with poisonous articles and misinformation some dishonest forces of the world community have long cooked up to tarnish the image of the system in the DPRK and put pressure on it. It has reached the acme of politicization and selectivity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"resolution\" is chiefly aimed to overthrow the system in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is well known that the United States has regarded the human rights issue as well as the nuclear issue as main leverage to escalate the tension in the Korean Peninsula and isolate and stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In its annual \"report on human rights situation\", the U.S. has malignantly slandered the DPRK and other countries. Worse still, it adopted even the \"North Korean Human Rights Act,\" spending a huge amount of money for its anti-DPRK campaign over the human rights issue and plugging its allied forces and even non-governmental organizations into the campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The adoption of the recent \"resolution\", too, was one more sinister hostile act perpetrated by Western countries including Britain and Japan which have zealously joined the U.S. in the moves to stifle the DPRK at its instigation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a politically motivated document, a clear indication of the high-handed practice of the West keen on applying selectivity and double standards in dealing with the human rights issues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is urgent for resolving the present world human rights issues is quite clear to everyone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the UN Commission on Human Rights is to properly discharge its mission, it is urgent to focus the debate on the U.S. above all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is chiefly to blame for human rights abuses and crimes against humanity as it is beset with poor human rights performances at home and has committed massacres of civilians and maltreatment of POWs in such illegal wars of aggression as the Iraqi war.\r\n Such being hard facts, the recent meeting mentioned no word about the U.S., the world's worst violator of human rights. It only attacked those progressive countries which have independently advanced contrary to the ideology of the West. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This eloquently proves that the commission allegedly handling human rights issues in the international arena has miserably played into the hands of those forces seeking a sinister political purpose in the human rights issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent adoption of the \"resolution\" once again proved the truth that the human rights precisely mean national sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For anyone to talk about national sovereignty and dignity without any strength to protect oneself is nothing but an empty talk. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We are convinced of this through our past history and our practice today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe DPRK has invariably maintained the principle of reacting with the toughest stand to anyone who dares slander and provoke it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those countries which took the lead in seeking the adoption of the \"resolution\" hostile to the DPRK should clearly understand this and act with discretion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In particular, we will certainly force Japan to pay for having brought the already settled \"abduction issue\" to Geneva for its inclusion in the \"resolution\" and kicked up an anti-DPRK racket. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has not yet made any apology and compensation for the hideous crimes perpetrated against humanity in the past. It is, therefore, not qualified to be a leading member of the international community of good virtue and faith, much less having the face to talk about the human rights issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The man-centered socialism in the DPRK under which man is regarded as dearer than anything else and everything is made to serve him is happy home to its people as it provides them with genuine freedom and rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and its allied hostile forces should know that their despicable anti-DPRK human rights racket is as foolish an act as trying to sweep the sea with a broom. Such act will only harden the determination of the army and people of the DPRK to protect their ideology and system at the cost of their lives.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
