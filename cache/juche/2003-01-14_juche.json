If the United States dares challenge the DPRK with a \"military punishment\", the DPRK will take a thousand-fold retaliation against it and root out the very source of aggression on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists should drop its suicidal option, mindful that they will not escape an ignominious defeat in the DPRK-U.S. confrontation.    \r\n\r\n"

But they are chiefly attributable to the U.S. aggressive and hostile policy of blockade towards the dprk. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has pursued this policy for over half a century since its military occupation of South Korea in 1945. This was, in fact, aimed to deprive our state and people of their right to existence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. cooked up a \"COCOM\" in 1949, taking advantage of its monopolistic position in the capitalist world after the 2nd World War and has controlled the export of technology and trade with the DPRK in different fields. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It fabricated \"U.S. rules on controlling assets\" of hostile countries in December 1950 in a bid to apply a trade and financial embargo against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Inestimable is the mental and material damage done by this U.S. hostile policy to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' hostile policy toward the DPRK was escalated after they cooked up a military \"regime\" in South Korea and stepped up the preparations for a new war in the 1960s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to cope with this situation the DPRK advanced a line of simultaneously carrying on the economic construction and defence upbuilding and had no option but to direct enormous efforts to boosting the country's defence capability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since the 1970s the U.S. has carried on extremely adventurous and provocative moves to ignite a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula, annually staging \"Team Spirit\" joint military exercises. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. policy of aggression and blockade became more vicious and desperate in the 1980s and the 1990s under the pretext of the non-existent \"nuclear issue\" of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Taking advantage of the collapse of the former soviet union and other socialist countries in East Europe and their return to  capitalism, the U.S. escalated its political and military offensive to destroy the DPRK's socialist system and tightened its economic blockade and sanctions against the DPRK to bring its economy to a total collapse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a universally known historical fact that the DPRK was compelled to proclaim a semi-war state in 1993 as the U.S. desperately escalated its pressure and sanctions against it under the pretext of its \"nuclear issue\" through the IAEA and the UN. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. was so mean and perfidious as to grossly violate the spirit of the agreement reached between the two sides through a series of DPRK-U.S. talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It refused to implement the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework which calls for the provision of light water reactors to the DPRK in return for its freeze on nuclear facilities, thus causing a tremendous loss of electricity to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK have defended the sovereignty and the right to existence of the country and successfully carried out the \"arduous march\" and the forced march, despite the U.S. vicious and desperate blockade policy and war moves, thus opening a favorable phase for the building of a powerful nation. This was possible only thanks to the invariable correct policy of the Workers' Party of Korea and the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should stop falsifying truth with sheer lies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It should pay heed to the voices of the international community and drop its wrong anti-DPRK policy before meddling in other's internal affairs.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is also a legitimate self-defensive step against the U.S. moves to stifle the DPRK and the unreasonable behavior of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) which is being used as a tool for executing the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States instigated the IAEA to adopt a \"resolution\" against the DPRK on January 6 in the wake of a similar \"resolution\" made on November 29, 2002. The IAEA termed the DPRK \"a criminal\" and demanded it scrap its \"nuclear program\" at once by a verifiable way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the adoption of the \"resolution\", the IAEA director general did not hesitate to make an ultimatum-style remarks, even setting the deadline for its implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the recent \"resolution\", the IAEA insisted on the unilateral demands of the United States, keeping mum about its gross violation of the NPT and the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis reveals once again the falsehood and hypocrisy of the signboard of impartiality the IAEA put up as an international body. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK Government vehemently rejected the \"resolution\" of the IAEA as a grave encroachment upon the country's sovereignty and the dignity of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is none other than the U.S. which wrecks peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and drives the situation to an extremely dangerous phase. It has been evidenced by the belligerent and extremely hostile policy towards the DPRK pursued by the U.S. after the appearance of the Bush administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration listed the DPRK as part of an \"axis of evil\", adopting it as a national policy to oppose its system, and singled it out as a target of preemptive nuclear attacks, openly declaring a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. brought up another \"nuclear suspicion\" in a bid to shift the blame for its systematic violation of the AF on to the DPRK. It also stopped the supply of heavy oil, reducing the AF to a dead document, and answered the DPRK's sincere proposal for the conclusion of a DPRK-U.S. non-aggression treaty and its efforts for negotiations with such threats as \"blockade\" and \"military punishment\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. went so far as to set the IAEA in motion to internationalize its policy to stifle the DPRK, putting its declaration of a war into practice and intentionally eliminating the last possibility of a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present military situation on the Korean Peninsula is reminiscent of the touch-and-go situation created by the U.S. hardline policy to stifle the DPRK ten years ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under this situation, the people and the army of the DPRK are filled with the strong resolution to increase the self-defensive military capabilities under the uplifted banner of the army-based policy and decisively repulse the intervention and provocative pressure of the hostile forces seeking to encroach upon the sovereignty of the country and the dignity of the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Moreover, it reacted to the DPRK's sincere efforts for negotiations with threats of \"blockade\" and \"military retaliation\" and with the arrogant remarks that \"it may talk but negotiations are impossible.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nStill worse, the IAEA unilaterally adopted unreasonable resolutions against the DPRK on Nov. 29 last year and on Jan. 6 this year while keeping mum about the U.S. which scrapped the AF and is openly posing a nuclear threat to the DPRK after listing it as a target of preemptive nuclear strike, ignoring the nature of the nuclear issue, a product of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK, and the DPRK's unique status in which it declared a moratorium on its withdrawal from the NPT. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the prevailing situation where the U.S. seeks to destroy the DPRK by force and the IAEA is incapable of observing the principle of impartiality, the DPRK Government issued a statement on Jan. 10, 2003 declaring an automatic and immediate effectuation of its withdrawal from the NPT on which it declared a moratorium. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the statement, the DPRK will completely pull out of the NPT from Jan. 11, 2003.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
