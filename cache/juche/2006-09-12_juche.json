The U.S. and other allied forces of imperialism are desperately working to isolate and stifle socialist Korea but they can never bring the Korean people to their knees. This is because they are wisely led by Kim Jong Il and good enough to be fully confident of the justice of the Juche cause, the cause of socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is one of the great successes made by us in our recent Korean visit that we got a more profound understanding of the Juche idea, the Songun idea and the Songun politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is a developed beautiful country and Pyongyang, in particular, is a capital city kept in perfect order. All the monumental edifices were built on a high level. In a word, the DPRK is a great country where the Juche idea has been fully embodied.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Meanwhile, they have brought bourgeoisie publications and video and audio recordings into the DPRK through trade and foreign travelers to the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S.-led imperialists, however, miscalculate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people�fs faith in socialism is invariable as they have keenly experienced the validity of the socialist system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Korea�fs is the people-centered socialism under which they are the master of everything and everything serves them and that develops by the united strength of the popular masses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Contrary to the capitalist society which meets the individualist greed of a handful of ruling quarters, the socialist system of the DPRK embodying the Juche idea is defending the demand of the working class in a most thorough-going way and realizing the demand of the popular masses of all walks of life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It provides the independent and creative life to the popular masses in all fields, political, economic and cultural. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Having been the master of the political power, the Korean people enjoy a genuine political right and freedom and take a free part in the political life, glorifying their socio-political integrity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the DPRK where the social ownership over the means of production prevails, the working people are provided with the creative working life. They have long been freed from taxation and live a happy life thanks to the government's popular policies including free education and free medical service. They are not only the creator of the revolutionary culture but also enjoyer of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is inconceivable in the deformed material life, poor emotional and cultural life and reactionary political climate of the capitalist society where the jungle law governs and such social evils as immorality, corruption, murder and robbery are rampant. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality of the countries where socialism was collapsed and capitalism restored clearly shows that there is no ideal society more superior to socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The more viciously the imperialists perpetrate their moves, the firmer the iron will of the Korean people to achieve the ultimate victory of the socialist cause becomes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
