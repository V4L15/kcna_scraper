Korea Condemned by CPRK Secretariat\r\n Pyongyang, April 3 (KCNA) -- The 23rd Chemical Battalion of the U.S. Army based in Seattle City, Washington State was recently redeployed in the U.S. Second Division in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t It was reported that an official ceremony in this regard will taken place in Uijongbu, Kyonggi Province on April 4.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The battalion was stationed in the U.S. military base in Chilgok, North Kyongsang Province as it belonged to the 19th battle area support command of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces till 2004. It was withdrawn to the U.S. mainland. This battalion mercilessly killed many people in the Korean war and other wars. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) in its information bulletin No. 1028 on Wednesday said that the redeployment of the battalion in south Korea is a revelation of the heinous criminal attempt to inflict nuclear disasters and holocaust of a bio-chemical war on the Korean nation, another unpardonable provocation to the DPRK. The information bulletin went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During the Korean war, the U.S. indiscriminately used germ and chemical weapons against the Korean people, stunning the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. now seeks to make such crimes against humanity repeat.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The redeployment of the battalion amounts to an open declaration that it would commit such war crimes again.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and south Korean puppet forces are claiming that the redeployment of the battalion is \"a defensive one chiefly aimed to keep stability on the Korean Peninsula\" and bolster \"deterrent of south Korea-U.S. alliance\" in a bid to evade accusations at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But it is sophism to conceal their heinous crime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The redeployment of the battalion and attempt to ignite a chemical war go to clearly prove that even though the U.S. vociferates about \"prohibition of use of WMDs and prevention of its expansion\", it is the U.S. which is wantonly violating them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is intolerable is that the south Korean puppet group of traitors is becoming a dangerous accomplice of the U.S. moves for a chemical war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group is working with bloodshot eyes to inflict even disasters of bio-chemical war on the nation, not content with imposing nuclear disasters by toeing foreign forces in their war moves. It is the group of murderers who cannot live under the same sky, to say nothing of fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will never remain a passive onlooker at the reckless moves of the U.S. and south Korean puppet group to ignite a chemical war but wipe them out as it had already declared whether they come in attack with nuclear weapons or with bio-chemical weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the puppet group had better stop acting rashly, clearly understanding the will of the army and people of the DPRK to annihilate the enemies in an all-out action."
