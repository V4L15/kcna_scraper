Right-wing gangsters and ruffians of Japan are outraging and threatening Chongryon organisations at all levels, students of Korean schools and other Korean citizens in Japan and violating their human rights.\r\n   That threw a wet blanket over the shared desire of the peoples of the DPRK and Japan for peace and the improved relations between the two countries. It is a big blot on history.\r\n   Firstly, the Japanese authorities should immediately stop pursuing the hostile policy towards the DPRK and lift sanctions.\r\n   Secondly, news media of Japan should admit an announcement of the DPRK that the recent launching of the artificial satellite was for peaceful use and development of science and technology and replace biased reports designed to incite prejudice and hostility against the DPRK with unbiased ones.\r\n   He also strongly demanded that the Japanese authorities take steps to prevent the threats to and outrages against Chongryon and Koreans in Japan, particularly, students of Korean schools in Japan.\r\n   He warned that if an unexpected situation is created as a result of their refusal to take such steps, they cannot flee from the responsibility for the ensuing consequences.\r\n\r\n"

They have gone the length of saying that even though there is  the launch of an artificial satellite, they will not lift sanctions against the DPRK and that a \"blow\" should be dealt to a missile base.\r\n   In this regard, Rodong Sinmun today runs a signed commentary captioned \"Japanese authorities should stop acting rashly.\"\r\n  The Japanese authorities, groundlessly claiming that the launch of artificial satellite is that of a missile, are engaging themselves in a frantic anti-DPRK campaign. We cannot allow it at all.\r\n   All the Korean people bitterly denounce their reckless campaign as a vicious provocation against and challenge to the DPRK and the Korean nation, the news analyst says, and continues:\r\n   We are entitled to make Japan pay dearly for its past crimes. We are determined to do so with any conceivable means.\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries are  afraid of that determination, to the extreme.\r\n   They are now trying to find an excuse to realise their wild ambition for the building of Japan into a military power. By describing the DPRK's launching of the artificial satellite as the launch of a missile they intend to step up the building of Japan into a military power and make a breakthrough in overseas aggression.\r\n   The Japanese authorities attempt to frighten the Korean people with \"countermeasures,\" \"international pressure\" and \"blow.\" their attempt is a foolish daydream.\r\n   We have so far lived and will live in the future, too, without normalising the relations with Japan. We do not beg for the normalisation of the DPRK-Japan relations, leaving our pride and independence hurt. We will live our own way.\r\n   We mean what we said.\r\n   If the Japanese authorities misjudge the situation and continue acting rashly, they will entirely be held responsible for the ensuing catastrophic consequences.\r\n   The belated regret is of no use. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is  highly estimated for its impressive content and the vivid and plain acting of actors and actresses.\r\n   Yu Won Jun, winner of \"Kim Il Sung Order\", labour hero and people's actor, played the part of the family head.\r\n   He took  starring or leading roles in over 80 films while acting as an actor for more than 50 years.\r\n   He played a leading role in \"My home village,\" a film which was made for the first time in Korea after liberation. \r\nThrough it, he became well known to experts and people.  \r\nAfter this, he successfully played roles of positive and negative characters of different societies and social strata in many films  including \"Under the bright sun\", \"a Worker's Family\", \"the Family of Choe Hak Sin\", \"the Fourteenth Winter\" and \"the Tale of Chun Hyang\".\r\n  His special ability  was to quickly understand the inner world of  characters and vividly depict them. He also had rich power of acting and a clear creative  individuality. \r\nHis merits were a profound and delicate acting.  \r\n   Even when he was at an advanced age of about 80, he acted as if he was in his thirties. In his youthful days, he was an enthusiast for skating, weightlifting, basketball and boxing. So he had a strong physical body needed for an actor.\r\n   On June 10, 1998 he died of a fatal disease  at the age of 79.\r\n   General Secretary Kim Jong ll saw the last part of working-lass  part of the film \"the Nation and Destiny\" in which he played a leading role before the death.

He said with high estimation that Yu died while working with loyalty to the party and the leader.\r\n   Though Yu Won Jun died, his contributions to the development of film art of Juche will  remain in the hearts of the people. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
