After the national liberation (August 15, 1945), he made every possible effort to do away with the predatory tax system of the Japanese imperialists, establish a popular and democratic one in the country and lessen the tax burden of the people in a systematic way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK reduced the income tax of the factory and office workers by 30 percent, alleviated the tax burden of private traders and industrialists considerably and scaled down the agricultural tax in kind from 25 percent of grain output to 20.1 percent again in 1955 after the Korean war, and to 8.4 percent from 1959.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Along with the progress of the socialist construction, the growth of income of the state-owned economy and the heightening of the political and ideological awareness of the working people, the agricultural tax in kind, which had been introduced right after the liberation, was completely abolished by the year of 1966 in accordance with the publication of \"Theses on the Socialist Rural Question in Our Country\" by the President. The tax paid by the people accounted for some two percent of the state budget revenue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He promulgated his famous work \"On Abolishing the Tax System\" as a law of the Supreme People's Assembly and thus abolished the tax system for good and brilliantly realized the long-cherished desire of the people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The promulgation of the law was a historic event which brought to reality the ardent desire of the Korean people to live in a tax-free country and made them as the proud masters of the country free from tax. This opened up a new tax-free era for the humankind and demonstrated the incomparable superiority of the Korean-style socialist system and the might of the independent national economy."

They were unpardonable acts of wrecking peace as they escalated the confrontation and tension on the Korean Peninsula and increased the danger of a nuclear war. Leading papers Saturday observe this in signed commentaries.\n\t\t\t\t\t The Key Resolve and Foal Eagle were the biggest maneuvers for a nuclear war against the DPRK in history in terms of the aggressor forces involved and their duration, Rodong Sinmun notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said exercises staged by the U.S. imperialist warmongers defying the DPRK's repeated warnings and the concern of the public at home and abroad proved that there is no change in their hostile policy towards it and their ambition for invading it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through the recent saber rattling the bellicose forces at home abroad further rounded off the operational capability to mount a preemptive attack on the DPRK any moment and, at the same time, further aggravated the military stand-off and distrust between the DPRK and the U.S. and between the north and the south. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prevailing situation requires the servicepersons and people of the DPRK to bolster up the army of Songun to protect the sovereignty of the nation and defend the dignified socialist system as firm as a rock, follow with vigilance the moves of the bellicose aggressor forces at home and abroad and keep themselves fully combat-ready to beat back any surprise attack. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. imperialists and the Lee group foolishly ignite a war of aggression against the DPRK, its servicepersons and people will wipe out the aggressors at a single stroke with the unpredictable decisive and crushing retaliatory strikes and accomplish the historic cause of the country's reunification.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson notes: The United States would be well advised to drop its wild ambition to do harm to the DPRK by force and make a switchover in its anachronistic hostile policy towards the DPRK as early as possible. The Lee group of traitors should halt its racket of confrontation with the DPRK, mindful that its attempt to do harm to fellow countrymen in collusion with foreign forces would only precipitate its own self-destruction."

Rodong Sinmun Saturday observes this in a signed article. \n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A particular mention should be made of the fact that the imperialists are intensifying the offensive for imposing \"multi-party system\" and \"democracy\" upon those countries which work hard to achieve social stability by strengthening their political forces and stick to the line of independence in a bid to topple their governments.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The imperialists are busy with the smear campaigns against these countries, labeling them \"undemocratic states\" and the like, and seek to isolate them from the international community. It is part of these moves that the United States and other Western countries are imposing sanctions upon the anti-imperialist independent countries under that pretext as an allied force. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The imperialists are still today craftily using \"aid\" as a bait for forcing other countries to introduce \"the multi-party system\" and \"democracy\". They are going the lengths of threatening those countries to stop giving \"aid\" to them for the mere reason that they are opposed to such \"multi-party system\" and \"democracy.\" This suffices to prove their reactionary nature.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The developing countries would be well advised to clearly see through the reactionary and harmful nature of the above-said \"multi-party system\" and \"democracy\" and positively struggle against the moves of the imperialists to impose those things upon them, concludes the article."
