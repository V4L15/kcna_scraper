            "content": "Japan's Wild Ambition for Overseas Expansion under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 27 (KCNA) -- It is an invariable wild ambition of the Japanese militarists to realize their old dream of conquering Asia and other parts of the world at any cost, backed by a big power. Rodong Sinmun Thursday says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It cites facts to prove that the Japanese militarists are becoming evermore undisguised in their moves to realize their ambition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese right-wing conservative forces including Aso, former secretary general of the Japan Liberal Democratic Party, are recently taking much pain to extend the \"law on special measures against terrorism\" as its term is nearing its expiry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not difficult to guess why they are leaving no means untried to do so. Explicitly speaking, their ulterior intention is to remain war servants of the U.S. and launch overseas expansion, backed by their master. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are set to legalize the long-term presence and activities of the \"Self-Defense Forces (SDF)\" overseas under the pretext of \"military cooperation with the U.S.\" in a bid to lay a military springboard from which to stage overseas aggression. Precisely for this reason they are persistently insisting on the extension of the above-said law, talking about Japan's \"sustained contribution\" to the U.S. \"anti-terror war.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is regarding its policy of toeing the U.S. as a means for realizing its scenario for turning itself into a military power and carrying out overseas aggression and a lever for accelerating that process. It is as clear as a pikestaff that Japan's stepped-up policy of toeing the U.S. would only escalate its militarist arms build-up and the SDF's advance and operations overseas and, consequently, seriously threaten peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries would be well advised to bear in mind the lesson taught by history that those keen to survive in reliance upon foreign forces are bound to meet self-destruction, warns the commentary.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Deserters and lunatics are on the increase in the U.S. units. The number of the mentally deranged soldiers has gone beyond 40,000. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has also suffered incredible economic and financial losses. A survey panel of U.S. congress announced that the fund disbursed by the U.S. in the \"anti-terrorism war\" had run to a healthy 610 billion US dollars as of June this year since the outbreak of the 9/11 incident in 2001, of which 450 billion US dollars were squandered in the Iraqi war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. debt and financial crisis and the crisis of trade deficit have reached alarming levels in the \"war on terrorism\" that has been continuing for years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reactionary \"anti-terrorism war\" has also brought a big political loss to the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With the aggressive and dangerous nature of the war revealed more glaringly as the days go by, the U.S. finds itself an object of bitter denunciation and rejection in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe bankruptcy of the \"anti-terrorism war\" immediately means the end of the policy of strength of the U.S. The 21st century will be the century of the total fiasco of this policy.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It raised it as a major issue to ensure safe voyage of ships in more clean oceans and has since made a series of advances by exerting efforts to protect the sea environment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The theme of this world maritime day is for the IMO to meet the present challenges to the environment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK joined the IMO on Apr. 16, 1986.
