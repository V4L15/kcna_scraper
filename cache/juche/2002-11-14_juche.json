Their call for international cooperation is intolerable as it is a criminal cooperation for a war that may escalate the political and military tensions on the Korean Peninsula and spark a new clash on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits serious attention is that the GNP is not only echoing the U.S. call for international cooperation but also zealously spreading its stories about economic sanctions against the DPRK despite public criticism at a time when the U.S. is set to use South Korea as a shock brigade in effecting this cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To chime in with the U.S. call for imposing economic sanctions upon the DPRK, which is little short of a declaration of confrontation with the DPRK, can not be construed otherwise than a belligerent act to bring dark clouds of a new war to hang over the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a grave challenge to the favorably developing inter-Korean relations, a result of tremendous efforts, as it is a criminal breach of the basic spirit of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP group's desperate moves to hamstring exchange, cooperation, reconciliation and unity between the north and the south are clearly evidenced by their recent outbursts that an accident is unavoidable if an accelerator is always kept pressed without putting a brake on the policy toward the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nation will certainly force the GNP to pay for such treacherous acts as zealously spreading the U.S. talk about international cooperation and economic sanctions in a bid to check the development of the inter-Korean relations and drive the situation to a phase of confrontation.    \r\n\r\n"

The method is based on the combination of high-voltage shock and anti-cancer medicines.\r\n It perforates tumor cell walls with high-voltage shock and increases the rate of medicines infiltrating into cancer cells. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWith a smaller amount of anti-cancer medicines, it has greater anti-cancer effects. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The effects are controlled by the kind of anti-cancer medicine and the method of electric shock. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Researchers of the institute of experimental biology of the branch of biology of the academy of sciences and the cancer institute of the academy of medical science have applied this therapy to 19 patients with breast cancers at the first and second stages for more than three years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The efficacy of the therapy has reached 94.7 percent. The cancers of 16 patients have completely been removed and those of two reduced more than 50 percent. Only one patient still has the cancer unchanged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Of the 16 patients, 93.7 percent have had no relapse of cancer for three years.     \r\n\r\n"
