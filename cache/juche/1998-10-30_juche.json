The budget with no conditions, therefore, should be approved by the congress.\r\n   By setting unreasonable conditions for the supply the U.S. seeks to block the supply and attain a sinister political purpose through it.\r\n   As a matter of fact, the U.S. is using the supply as the lever to put pressure on the DPRK as well as means to disarm it.\r\n   With a view to disarming the DPRK the U.S. is now claiming that civil underground structure is an \"underground nuclear facility\" and crying for inspection. It is also crying for the control of missile development, deployment and export which belong to the sovereignty of the DPRK. The U.S. act is a product of a hostile policy it has so far pursued towards the DPRK. It can be more clearly seen in the fact that the members of the U.S. house of representatives from the republican party described the DPRK as a \"strange monster state which has been engaged in suppression of the people for half a century.\"\r\n   Their slander on the DPRK where the leader, the party and the people are united in one mind and all the people live in a large harmonious family is an open challenge to and vicious insult to the Korean people. \r\n   The U.S. conservative hard-liners are intensifying the anti-DPRK campaign as never before in accordance with the party interests and policy with the approach of the mid-term parliamentary election due early in November.\r\n    As a consequence, the DPRK-U.S. framework agreement has been exposed to a danger and the touch-and-go situation is prevailing in the Korean peninsula.\r\n   The U.S. and South Korean warmaniacs are staging large-scale joint military manoeuvres against the DPRK one after another. Under this situation all the Korean people and the officers and men of the People's Army are now in full combat readiness to defeat the aggressors at one stroke.\r\n   The U.S. warmaniacs are using the framework agreement for disarming us and threatening us by force of arms. Judging from the situation, it is only too natural for us to take a self-defensive countermeasure.\r\n    Belated repentance is of no use. If the U.S. warmaniacs break the framework agreement and take the road of war out of all reason,  we will take a self-defensive countermeasure. The U.S. will be wholly held  responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom. \r\n\r\n"
