It consists of 15 chapters (28-42). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chapters from 28 to 32 refer to the facts that in the first half of the 1990s he shattered the anti-socialist moves of the imperialists, firmly defended the socialist cause and further strengthened the People's Army, thus leading to a shining victory the struggle to smash the nuclear racket kicked up by the U.S. imperialists and defend the sovereignty of the country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chapters from 33 to 40 deal with the revolutionary activities he conducted under the uplifted banner of Songun in the period from July of Juche 83(1994) to the end of the 1990s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They recall the facts that he has significantly increased the defence capability through his ceaseless long journey for Songun leadership to cope with the U.S. imperialists' extremely undisguised moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK.\r\n Chapter 41 tells how he arranged the historic Pyongyang meeting which led to the adoption and publication of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and the opening of an epochal phase of national reunification and how he has developed the movement of Koreans in Japan onto a new higher stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chapter 42 deals with the facts that he made sure that the 55th anniversary of the Workers' Party of Korea was celebrated as a grand festival of victors of socialism and that he further augmented the might of the DPRK under the banner of Songun in the period from January of Juche 89(2000) to February of  Juche 91(2002).    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The Japanese reactionaries have staged them with the U.S. navy by mobilizing the maritime \"Self-defence Force\" in the East Sea of Korea. This is a dangerous step in Japan's drive for a comeback to Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Holding an ever bigger share in the U.S.-Japan joint military exercises are drills for coping with the \"emergency on the Korean Peninsula\".  The Japanese reactionaries set up a drill ground in Hokkaido which is similar to Korea in climatic and topographical conditions and let their ground SDF to stage joint war games frequently with U.S. troops. On the other hand, the SDF are intensifying mountain and nighttime warfare drills with the U.S. forces.  It is needless to say that they are, to all intents and purposes, a test war and a preliminary war to invade the DPRK.\r\n The danger of the exercises is all the greater because they followed hard on the heels of the U.S. publication of a \"national security strategy report\" in which it declared again the preemptive attack strategy as its national policy. In the joint military exercises against the DPRK, the U.S. and Japan have disclosed their sinister intention to mount a preemptive strike on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seeks to provoke a new war on the Korean Peninsula and spread it to other regions while Japan intends to open up a wide avenue through the peninsula for the reinvasion of Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTheir outcries over \"threat\" from someone are sophism to justify their war moves.\r\n The reckless war moves of the U.S. imperialists and the Japanese reactionaries are rendering the situation on the Korean peninsula and its surroundings tenser and pose a grave threat to peace and security in Asia.     \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is the true picture of the single-minded unity in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tradition of unity established in the early period of the revolution has been confidently carried forward and has fully displayed its vitality generation after generation despite all sorts of ordeals and tests of history. This is the stirring reality that can be seen only in the DPRK led by the great leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK army and people will successfully accomplish the cause of building a great prosperous powerful nation of Juche, singled-mindedly united around the headquarters of the revolution headed by Kim Jong Il just as all the Korean people resolutely turned out in the anti-Japanese national united front movement to defeat the Japanese imperialist aggressors and achieve the historic cause of the country's liberation under the leadership of President Kim Il Sung. It is the oath taken by the DPRK army and people with faith on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the ARF.\r\n It is a firm guarantee for the prosperity of the country and the victorious advance of the cause of Juche to firmly unite around Kim Jong Il. All the people should fully display the might of our single-minded unity in the general march of Songun revolution just as all the Koreans fought in close unity during the anti-Japanese war.\r\n Minju Joson calls for accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche and the cause of national reunification as early as possible by successfully carrying forward the idea of the great national unity set out by the President and the exploits performed by him.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
