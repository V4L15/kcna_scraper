The tighter the Japanese reactionaries cling to the moves to distort history, the clearer their aggressive ambition stands out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However desperately they may try to distort history and cover up Japan's past crimes, they cannot conceal the past marred by crimes nor can they evade their obligation to redress it. Knowing this clearly, they should give up right away their reckless moves to make distorted history textbooks.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
