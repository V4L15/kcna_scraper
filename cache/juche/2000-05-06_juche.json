It is quite obvious that the meeting was part of the Japanese ultra right reactionary forces' hostile moves against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We cannot but draw particular attention to this undesirable happening just before the DPRK-Japan intergovernmental talks slated to be held in Tokyo soon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As we have already clarified several times, the Japanese reactionaries' loudmouthed \"kidnapping issue\" is a security issue in Japan with which we have nothing to do. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their smear campaign against the DPRK over a sort of \"kidnapping\" is nothing but their expression of hostility toward it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Yet, we, taking the agreement reached between political parties of the two countries, the aspiration of the two peoples for the improved bilateral relations and the repeated request of the politicians and authorities of Japan into consideration, started an investigation into common missing persons from a humanitarian stand, and a serious probe is going on between the Red Cross organizations of the two countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such being the case, the Japanese reactionaries are becoming ever more clamorous about the \"kidnapping issue\" in a bid to build up public opinion. This cannot be construed otherwise than an act of casting a wet blanket over the investigation and our magnanimous and sincere efforts for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese authorities and politicians should ponder over the serious implications the ultra right reactionaries' moves will have on the DPRK-Japan relations and immediately take practical measures to stop them from a responsible stand. \r\n\r\n"

Reunifying the country by confederacy formula means building a unified national state, leaving the existing two differing systems and governments in the north and the south as they are, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Reunification by confederacy formula is the most reasonable and just way of reunification as it neither seeks upper hand or interests of any of the two sides nor does any harm to anyone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This reunification formula is aimed, first of all, at building a unified national state irrespective of the different ideologies and social systems in the north and south even if the issue of integrating the two systems there into one is left to the coming generations so that they can solve it smoothly in no hurry in future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   National reunification is a national issue related to the future destiny of the nation as it aims to realize the national independence. It is, therefore, quite natural to place the nation above any system in solving the issue of reunification, the national issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Reunifying the country by confederacy formula based on this conception is a patriotic way of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This reunification formula fully conforms with the specific conditions of our country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The history has already proved that it is impossible to reunify the country by the method of one side swallowing up the other either by means of war or peaceful means. It is the best way of solving the reunification issue smoothly at an early date to achieve reunification by confederacy formula under the situation where the two differing systems and governments exist in the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The process of reunifying the country by confederacy formula paves the way for the Korean nation to independently solve the reunification issue, free from dependence on foreign forces or from foreign interference on the principle of national self-determination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people will achieve its great unity as one nation and demonstrate its might to the world when the country is reunified by confederacy formula. \r\n\r\n"
