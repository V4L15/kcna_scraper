But it is steadily modernizing its nuclear arsenal, pursuing with increased zeal its scenario to dominate the world with nukes. It is busy developing and producing new type nuclear weapons, conducting ceaseless concealed nuclear tests. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. keeps proliferating nukes as evidenced by its recognition of Israel's access to nukes and discussion on a proposal for stepping up the nuclear weaponization with the member states of NATO in breach of the spirit of the NPT. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is speeding up the development and modernization of nukes under the pretext of denuclearization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is mulling investing a trillion U.S. dollars for modernizing nuclear weapons in nearly 30 years to come.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Last year it made the biggest financial allocation for the research, development and trial production of nukes since the 1950s. It is contemplating investing 355 billion U.S. dollars for modernizing nuclear warheads in nearly 10 years to come.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It built a base for producing new type weapon grade plutonium and nuclear test ground in Los Alamos, New Mexico State, and started enriching uranium in a new facility in Tennessee State.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is refusing to ratify the CTBT while pushing forward the establishment of a global MD system and the project to put its \"conception of prompt global strike\" into practice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Washington's nuclear policy sparked a race for nuclear weapons development and manufacture in the international arena and, consequently, the world is exposed to increasing danger of a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No one can vouch that such tragedy as what happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki will not repeat itself as long as Washington continues to brandish nuclear weapons\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. can never evade the responsibility for bringing the dark clouds of a nuclear war to hang over humankind."
