It has resorted to military threat and blackmail against the DPRK while steadily reinforcing armed forces and staging war maneuvers after making all legal and institutional mechanisms against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK has brought pain and misfortune resulting from division, chilled the desire of Koreans for reunification and laid obstacles in the way of improving the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. cooked up false cases and staged joint military exercises whenever the north-south relations got relaxed and the enthusiasm of the Korean nation for reunification ran high.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is getting frantic with north-targeted nuclear war exercises by introducing huge nuclear war hardware into south Korea and its vicinity. Consequently, the Asia-Pacific Region including the Korean Peninsula has become a hot spot.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ever more intensified large-scale joint military exercises of the U.S. in south Korea are not simply targeted against the DPRK only.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean Peninsula is located in the very important strategic vantage in the Asia-Pacific and interests of big powers are complicatedly intertwined there. A war to break out on the peninsula will precisely mean a nuclear war and this cannot but spill over to its neighboring countries and escalate into a global nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The issue of ensuring peace and security on the Korean Peninsula is a pressing issue directly linked with guaranteeing global peace and security.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is by no means fortuitous that many countries of the world are paying keen attention to the issue of ensuring peace, feeling uneasiness and concern whenever tensions escalate on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The publication of the joint press release at the north-south high-level emergency contact marked an important turning occasion in defusing acute military tension and converting the catastrophic north-south relations into ones of reconciliation and trust.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If one truly wants global peace and stability, one should value the positive situation on the peninsula and sincerely work for the final solution to the Korean issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the trend of the development of history in the present century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. would be well advised to behave properly, though belatedly, as it spawned the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula and has disturbed peace."
