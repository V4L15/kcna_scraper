They amount to acknowledging themselves before the world that the sanctions against the DPRK and moves to stifle it pursued by the Park regime together with their U.S. master so far have totally gone bust. They, at the same time, clearly revealed that they are driven into a tight corner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group accused the DPRK of \"violating the UN resolution\" and \"mocking at the UN\" and the like but, in actuality, it is none other than the U.S., the Park Geun Hye group of traitors and other vassal forces that wantonly violated and mocked at the UN Charter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is preposterous and shameful for the Park regime to dare find fault with the international position of the dignified DPRK as it is no more than the U.S. colonial puppets without any political independence and military sovereignty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The desperate efforts made by the Park Geun Hye regime to escalate the confrontation with the DPRK, failing to face up to the trend of the times, would only prompt the latter to take  a series of measures to bolster up its nuclear force and precipitate the former's final doom."

But thanks to the Songun politics the DPRK is demonstrating its might as a nuclear power which even the U.S., styling itself \"the only superpower\" in the world, dares not invade.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This stirring reality is entirely thanks to the Songun politics of the peerlessly great men of Mt. Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The validity and might of the politics is now being fully displayed under the present complicated international situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK clearly showed the world its declaration that it is capable of reducing the U.S. to debris with nukes is not hot air.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., obsessed with the \"weapon almighty doctrine\", is trying to browbeat the DPRK by ceaselessly introducing its strategic assets into south Korea, but the people of the DPRK remain unfazed by their muscle-flexing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. had better properly know that the DPRK is not such a weak country which can become a target of its muscle-flexing but a nuclear power possessed of even H-bombs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists are sadly mistaken if they calculate they can apply the logic of strength to the DPRK as it is doing to some countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The service personnel and civilians of the present generation will certainly inflict upon the U.S. its final doom in its history of wars."
