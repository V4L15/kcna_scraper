            "content": "Regard NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK issued a statement today as regards the barbaric bombing of the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia by the aggression forces of the United States and NATO.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The statement said:   The bombing caused many casualties among Chinese diplomats and journalists and seriously destroyed the building of the embassy.\r\n   This shows that the United States and NATO, much satisfied with their bomb policy, are  recklessly and arrogantly applying the strong-arm and arbitrary policies to big countries as well as small nations regardless of the international law and elementary common knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   When launching air raids, the NATO announced that it would take military objects of Yugoslavia as optional targets. Contrary to its announcement, the NATO instantly began indiscriminate bombings of civilian objects, hospitals, schools and kindergartens, revealing its barbaric nature. In a little more than one month and a half since the air raids, it has killed or wounded more than 6,000 civilians.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States and NATO, in an attempt to escape from the responsibility, described the bombing of the Chinese embassy as a mistake this time, too, as they did after killing many civilians. However, there is no one who will believe that the United States boasting of the world's best intelligence network and precision bombing technology would so frequently repeat similar mistakes in a systematic way.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The bombing of other country's embassy is a criminal act of most shamelessly and directly infringing upon its sovereignty. Such an outrageous act of the United States and NATO surpasses all the war crimes recorded in the current century in its unlawfulness and barbarity.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is only too natural that the Chinese government and people are strongly protesting against the bombing.    We, together with the peaceloving people all over the world, vehemently denounce the outrageous bombing of the United States and NATO against the present international relations tending toward independence and peace and express solidarity with the measures taken by the Chinese government and people in protest against it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The present stark reality in which the United States unhesitatingly bombed a country which it claims is its strategical partner eloquently proves the U.S. allegation that other countries should not possess missiles and other strategical weapons is very ridiculous and shameless.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States will not flee from the historical responsibility for having destroyed all the bases of international law and war regulations, products of human civilization. \r\n\r\n"
