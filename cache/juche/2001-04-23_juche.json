Korea joint military exercise under fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 23 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialist bellicose circle together with the South Korean military launched the provocative \"reception, staging, onward movement and integration\" war exercise on April 20.\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This military exercise is a very provocative and dangerous war exercise going on under the simulated conditions of an armed invasion of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Quite clear is the aim sought by the U.S. bellicose circle in persistently staging such a madcap war exercise against the DPRK in gross violation of the spirit of the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework which calls for refraining from threatening the other party by force of arms. They seek to bring the DPRK-U.S. and the north-south relations back to those in the era of confrontation before the adoption of the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework and the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and in the era of the Cold War in a bid to justify their occupation of South Korea and the continued division of Korea and stifle the DPRK by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such the prevailing situation compels the DPRK to take a serious view of the attitude on the part of the South Korean military authorities as they are joining the U.S. imperialists in the war exercise to harm the Korean nation in violation of the spirit of the north-south joint declaration which calls for reunifying the country independently by its own efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Staging sabre-rattling in collusion with the foreign forces is a treachery and a perfidy to the declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No process of reconciliation and cooperation, peace and peaceful reunification can be expected on the Korean peninsula as long as the U.S. imperialists continue pursuing their hostile policy towards the DPRK and escalating their moves to provoke a new war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and South Korean military authorities are well advised to ponder over the ensuing serious consequences of their joint military exercise.    \r\n\r\n"

This is a premeditated move to infuse a reactionary view on history into the Japanese people and thus accelerate the militarization of Japanese society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nowhere else in the world one can find such politicians as the Japanese right-wing politicians who are so shameless as to deny the history of aggression and crimes and falsify historical facts through textbooks in a bid to impart wrong views on history into the younger generation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This reflects their true intention to repeat Japan's crime-woven history, instead of repenting of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are well advised to think twice over what they are now doing, bearing deep in mind that it will only make the future of Japan more gloomy.    \r\n\r\n"
