Korean Regime for Escalating Confrontation with DPRK\r\n Pyongyang, July 17 (KCNA) -- The Switzerland-Korea Committee and the Swiss Group for the Study of the Juche Idea released a joint statement on July 11 denouncing the south Korean Park Geun Hye regime for escalating confrontation with the compatriots in the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t Recalling Park pulled up the DPRK, talking about its \"possibility of terrorism\", the statement said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park, at a \"state council meeting\" at Chongwadae on July 4, spouted rubbish that the north is attempting a variety of terrorism to cause a conflict among southerners.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Earlier, the \"prime minister\" of south Korea talked nonsense that there is concern that the north may kidnap south Koreans abroad or commit terrorism by instigating an international terrorist group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is hypocritical and shameless as the south Korean regime masterminded the group allurement and abduction of DPRK citizens in broad daylight.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As reported, the DPRK is firmly opposed to all forms of terrorism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park's rubbish is groundless.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities not only masterminded the group abduction of DPRK citizens but also insulted the dignity and social system of the DPRK, organized hideous terrorists groups like the \"association for bringing down statues\" and infiltrated human scum into the DPRK in a bid to bring down it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park's reckless behavior is the height of impudence."

            "content": "IAN de MINREX revela intento de EE.UU. en cuarta consulta tripartita de vicecancilleres\r\nPyongyang, 17 de julio (ACNC) -- Con respecto a que se efectuo recientemente en Hawai, Estados Unidos, la consulta tripartita a nivel de vicecanciller entre EE.UU., Japon y el Sur de Corea, el portavoz del Instituto para Asuntos Norteamericanos (IAN) del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea dio el dia 17 a la ACNC la siguiente respuesta:\n\t\t\t\t\tComo esta conocido por todos, en los ultimos dias EE.UU. introduce sucesivamente los medios de ataque nuclear incluso los submarinos nucleares y los bombarderos estrategicos, llevando al borde de la guerra la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana y el resto de la region. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn tal circunstancia, llamo el dia 14 a Japon y los titeres surcoreanos a Hawai y convoco la cuarta consulta tripartita de viceministros de Relaciones Exteriores. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInfaliblemente, en esta cita tambien EE.UU. prometio que seguira tomando las medidas necesarias a la seguridad de sus lacayos pretextando la \"amenaza\" de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo es casual que el presente debate se haya efectuado en la zona donde esos tres paises acabaron de realizar los ejercicios de alarma de misil. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa desde hace mucho tiempo, EE.UU. perseguia la ambicion de garantizar la hegemonia militar en la region mediante el establecimiento del sistema de defensa antimisil y la fabricacion de la alianza militar tripartita en la Peninsula Coreana y la region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste intento deviene un acto peligroso que puede destruir el equilibrio estrategico de la region, formar la estructura de nueva guerra fria y causar la guerra nuclear en la Peninsula Coreana y la region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. ya preparo el fundamento favorable al establecimiento del sistema antimisiles mediante la resolucion por el emplazamiento de THAAD en el suelo surcoreano y ahora se desespera por fabricar la alianza militar tripartita atrayendo mas a sus lacayos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa presente cita tripartita sirvio del motivo en que el imperio revelo abiertamente su intento de lograr a toda costa la hegemonia militar sobre la region y el mundo entero. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl mundo debe prestar una atencion debida a la evolucion de la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana y el resto del Nordeste Asiatico donde se forma la estructura de nueva guerra fria y se crea el peligro de la guerra nuclear debido a los complots de EE.UU. y sus lacayos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo ya hemos aclarado, tomaremos de continuo las medidas para fortalecer el disuasivo nuclear de autodefensa y las practicaremos en el nivel mas alto en lo cualitativo y cuantitativo para eliminar de raiz el peligro de guerra nuclear en el Nordeste Asiatico incluso la Peninsula Coreana y en ambito mundial."
