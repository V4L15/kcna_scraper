            "content": "CPRK Spokesman Urges S. Korean Authorities Not to Miss Opportunity for Improving North-South Relations\r\nPyongyang, July 23 (KCNA) -- The news that Marshal Kim Jong Un personally guided a match for examining the men's football of the National Sports Team to take part in the 17th Asian Games sparked off a big splash at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that the participation of the DPRK's sportspersons in the games would serve as an important occasion in improving the relations between the north and the south and defusing distrust and that they should positively contribute to promoting reconciliation and unity of fellow countrymen through the games. All Koreans keenly realize his firm will for reunification and noble patriotism through these meaningful words.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The decision made to send a players group and cheerleading squad to the games reflects the noble intention to rev up the atmosphere of the event to be hosted by fellow countrymen and make the games serve as an important occasion in improving the north-south relations and defusing distrust even though the situation remains tense and confrontation grows acute. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) in a statement Wednesday said that the DPRK is speeding up the preparations, expecting that the games would be more enlivened with the participation of the DPRK's players group and cheerleading squad and that they would greatly contribute to mending the stalled north-south ties and promoting national reconciliation and unity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the recent working-level talks the DPRK advanced the most realistic and reasonable proposals with due consideration into the present situation of the north-south relations while complying with the international practice over such technical matters as the scope of players group and cheerleading squad, travel course, means of transport, accommodation and cheering.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As for the expenses for stay, we even envisaged using our own ship and letting it anchor in Inchon Port for lodging and boarding to lessen the burden of the south side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Only to find fault with the participation of the DPRK players group and cheerleading squad in the games and argue each other, wasting time without elementary understanding of the good faith of the DPRK and its efforts cannot but be viewed as a shameless act of inviting criticism and disgrace from public at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the north and the south continue finding fault each other over trifling issues at a time when the relations between the two sides are at the lowest ebb, it will never be possible for them to unravel even one of the so many tangled knots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If there happens such an abnormal situation where the DPRK's players group and the cheerleading squad are unable to take part in the games to be held in Inchon, an area close to the Military Demarcation Line, this will leave an indelible disgrace to the Koreans and all generations to come.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No one should make such dishonest attempt to misuse the pure sports activities for meeting political purposes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Growing stronger in the country are expectation and interest of the people in the players group and cheerleading squad which are to take part in the games amid the sports enthusiasm that sweeps across the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should neither miss the golden opportunity for mending the north-south relations nor cast doubt as to the sincere will of the DPRK to take part in the games to contribute to national reconciliation and unity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should not try to judge it with a hostile conception.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will patiently approach the issue of sending the players group and cheerleading squad to the games from the viewpoint of actively contributing to achieving reconciliation and unity of the fellow countrymen and promoting friendship and peace among various countries in Asia and the rest of the world."

Jihye near Height 1211 where a KPA unit was fighting fierce battles to defend it.

He also suggested that a frontline rest home be set up for the weak soldiers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Encouraged by his loving care, all the servicepersons and civilians of the DPRK turned out in the battles to defend the country, fully displaying mass heroism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With this history of great war victory, the DPRK led by Marshal Kim Jong Un is now making full preparation to win the final victory in the showdown with the U.S.-led imperialists."

The DPRK's nuclear deterrence is an inevitable option for self-defence to protect its right to existence in the international area where high-handed practices based on the U.S.-style \"theory of force\" prevail.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As far as the policy of \"strategic patience\" which Obama shaped and is working hard to realize it is concerned, it is the DPRK's stand and pluck to wait for  with a high degree of  patience till the White House has its boss with normal realistic judgment and thinking power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's nuclear strike means, the powerful war deterrent, will be diversified and have stronger capability with the passage of time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It declared that the U.S. is its major target. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The more desperately the U.S. pursues its wild ambition for pressurizing the DPRK to dismantle its nuclear deterrent with brigandish assertions, the noisier conspiratorial \"human rights\" racket it kicks up to impair the prestige of the dignified DPRK and escalates the smear campaign against its social system and the more ridiculous fictions about \"provocation\" and \"threat\" it is spreading in a bid to push the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of a war, the deeper abyss of self-contradiction it will fall into and the more miserable its position of downhill turn will become. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Obama should make a political decision at an early date as required by the trend of the times by making a cool judgment of the U.S. harsh hostile policy toward the DPRK, though belatedly. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Chance is not always given to the U.S."

Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says this in a commentary. \n\t\t\t\t\t From the outset of the year the DPRK set forth a crucial proposal for improving the north-south relations and ensuring peace and stability, the commentary notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the U.S. massively introduced aggressor forces and weaponry into south Korea and staged Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military exercises. This time, too, it hurled nuclear war means into war drills, bringing the situation on the Korean peninsula to a dangerous phase. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The aim sought by the U.S. in staging war drills in south Korea with huge nuclear strike means involved, periodically aggravating the situation, is to strike the DPRK through a sudden preemptive attack, while perpetrating provocations against it, and put the whole of the Korean peninsula under control. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK are not scared by the U.S. nuclear blackmail and threats which are little different from \"gunboat diplomacy\" dating back to the last century. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nuclear weapons and IBM are not a monopoly of the U.S. any longer. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nothing is more naive than calculating that the U.S. mainland will be safe when the second Korean war breaks out. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will never be frightened by the U.S. attempt at a preemptive attack as it has military muscle strong enough to wipe out the enemies coming in attack at a single stroke and it is fully ready to go into action. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. war maniacs would be well advised to think about the security of its mainland before resorting to reckless nuclear blackmail and threat to other countries."
