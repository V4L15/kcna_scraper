Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 6 (KCNA) -- The South  Korean Catholic Priests' Council for Justice reportedly held a hunger-prayer meeting for achieving the right to existence and peace and punishing the GI criminals near the U.S. embassy on Dec. 2 in protest against the verdict of not guilty given to the killers of the girl students at the U.S. military court before entering an all-night hunger sit-in strike.\r\n Mun Kyu Hyon, permanent representative of the council, said before launching the strike: As the GIs were declared not guilty, our people look dead. But we want resurrection, not death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He called on all the people to make efforts to be reborn as a sovereign nation and an independent people in the national history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Yong Sik, priest of Andong Parish, called for waging a movement for the withdrawal of the U.S. troops, not just the revision of the South Korea-U.S. Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), shouting \"Yankees, quit South Korea\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That day, the participants in their statement demanded Bush's personal open apology, retrial of the GI criminals at the South Korean court, the total revision of the shackling SOFA, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rev. Jin Kwan of the Buddhist Committee for Human Rights, demanded the punishment of the GI criminals, hanging around his neck a poster reading \"the U.S. military trial of the killers of Hyo Sun and Mi Son was a false trial\", \"U.S. President Bush, apologize to the Koreans\", \"U.S. Forces quit South Korea at once,\" etc. in front of the U.S. embassy on Dec. 3.    \r\n\r\n"

Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 6 (KCNA) -- A funeral of the Security Law (SL) was held in Jongmyo Park on Dec. 1 under the sponsorship of the preparatory committee for the \"Funeral of the SL\" made up of at least 600 figures from all walks of life under  68 civic organizations, according to a news report.\r\n A letter to the \"candidates for the presidential election\" was read out at the funeral. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The letter demanded they release all the prisoners of conscience, stop the police search for those wanted, repeal the SL, withdraw the label of \"enemy-benefiting organizations\", attached to the south headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification, the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils and the South Korean Council of Youth Organizations, probe the truth behind all the charges of violation of the SL, reinstate all those punished by the law and compensate for the harm done to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Read out at the funeral was a resolution titled \"Let us usher in a new era of independent and democratic reunification through the complete abolition of the SL\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It said that neither democratization nor reunification is achievable as long as South Korea is tormented by the SL, the most draconic law which has defined the north as the \"enemy\" and incited confrontation between the north and the south and put many figures to death for exerting efforts for social democratization and reunification for over 50 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the end of the funeral, the participants staged a demonstration from Jongmyo Park to Maroni Park on university street. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Prior to this, the preparatory committee had a press conference in Anguk-dong, Seoul, on Nov. 29 to declare the SL dead. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Speakers at the conference explained the justice of the movement for the abolition of the SL. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then a \"medical certificate of death\" of the SL issued by the doctors council for humanitarian practice and a press release were read out at the conference. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, the preparatory committee put an ad on the \"death of SL\" on the newspaper Hangyore Nov. 29.    \r\n\r\n"

Paektu under the leadership of President Kim Il Sung is a historical root that gave an origin to the genuine patriotic struggle in Korea and a powerful engine energetically pushing forward the cause of building a powerful nation of Juche in the new century.\r\n Rodong Sinmun says this in an article on Friday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n it goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-Japanese patriotic tradition is an ideo-political source making it possible to build an invincible powerful country where the leader, the army and the people are singleheartedly united. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK, though small in its territory and population, is demonstrating its might as a political power steering the trend of the world politics today. This is entirely attributable to the steel-strong and single-hearted unity of the whole nation with leader Kim Jong Il as its centre. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Absolute worship and loyalty of the army and the people of the DPRK to Kim Jong Il are based on the noble revolutionary spirit of the anti-Japanese revolutionary forerunners who remained infinitely loyal to Kim Il Sung in the period of the anti-Japanese struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-Japanese patriotic tradition provides a source of strength powerful enough to build an ever-victorious country which no formidable imperialist enemy can provoke. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tradition is the one of the staunch anti-imperialist struggle whereby the Korean people fight with arms in a do-or-die spirit against the imperialists who violate the sovereignty of the country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tradition serves as a strong motive force enabling the army and the people to perform miracles and exploits in building an economically powerful nation in the new century.    \r\n\r\n"
