This is only a lame and sordid product of anti-DPRK conspiracy trumped up by Trump to save his \"face\" which has landed hard and flat on the muddy ground by the heavy blow from the DPRK's hard-line stance after carelessly wagging his tongue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What cannot be overlooked is that the riff-raff in the U.S. dared to cast slurs on the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The fact that the old lunatic Trump and his riff-raff slandered the sacred dignity of our supreme leadership, using bogus data full of falsehood and fabrications, only serves to redouble the surging hatred of our army and people towards the U.S. and their will to retaliate thousand-fold.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent developments teach the lesson again that we should never render leniency or any consideration on humanitarian grounds to the U.S., the DPRK's first enemy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Trump should ponder over the devastating consequences to be entailed by the anti-DPRK conspiracy and be fully aware that he and his clique shall be held totally responsible for all the undesirable turn of events to be caused by the careless and imprudent remarks that he gabbles on wagging his tongue in and out of his big mouth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will closely monitor the conduct of the U.S."

They are trying to justify their despicable acts of taking part in imposing sanctions and pressure on the DPRK as if it was meant for the peaceful solution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Political and economic sanctions and pressure to completely obliterate the sovereignty and the rights to existence and development of a sovereign state are hardly any different from the act of military aggression, and it cannot be justified as peaceful and diplomatic acts in any case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to counter the inveterate hostile policy and nuclear threat of U.S., the DPRK gained access to everything it needed including nuclear weapons. It would be a huge mistake to think the DPRK would do nothing about the heinous sanctions and pressure against it, let alone the threats of aggressive war from the U.S. and other hostile forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The primary mission of our invincible self-defensive military power with the nuclear force that we have developed at a huge cost at its core is to frustrate the military invasion and sanctions and pressure of the U.S. and protect the sovereignty and rights to existence and development of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will continue to march forward along the road we have chosen without the slightest deviation and we will respond to anyone who tries to stop us with tougher counteractions."

In particular, traitor Hong Jun Phyo, representative of the party, asserted that if the \"relocation of the U.S. tactical nuclear weapons\" is not realized, south Korea should \"develop nukes of its own accord\".\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on this, Minju Joson Thursday says that the \"LKP's\" moves to introduce the U.S. tactical nuclear weapons can never be allowed as treachery aimed to turn the inviolable land of Korea and its nation into the victims of the U.S. nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their reckless deeds are a manifestation of the wicked design to get rid of their crisis by rallying the conservatives under the pretext of \"security,\" the commentary says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to gratify their greed for power, the gentries of the \"LKP\" sent a \"special parliamentary group\" to the U.S. to curry favor with their American master keen to sell more weapons to south Korea, in defiance of protest and denunciation of the people from all walks of life, and begged for the \"relocation of tactical nuclear weapons\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"LKP\" is, indeed, a group of traitors without an equal in the world and a pronoun of shame.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural that south Korean people of all standings are pressing for dissolution of this party, a group of traitors, rejecting its begging for \"relocation of tactical nuclear weapons\"."
