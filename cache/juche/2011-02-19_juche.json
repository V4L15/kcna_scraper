All the soldiers and people of the DPRK enshrine the slogan \"Let us defend with our very lives the Party Central Committee headed by the great Comrade Kim Jong Il!\" as their faith. And the great army-people unity in thinking and work-style is demonstrating its might. This is the true picture of Songun Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to the belief of Kim Jong Il in Juche, the self-reliant national defence capacity of the DPRK has remarkably increased and Korean-style and Juche-style has been fully applied to all the fabrics of social life. In particular, self-supporting economy is becoming stronger day by day in the flame of the grand march for great surge to build an economic power. This is the brilliant fruition of the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il who regards the Juche idea as a treasured sword for invincibility."
