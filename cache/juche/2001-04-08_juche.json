Having organized an amphibious fleet with amphibious assault ships and mine-sweepers, the U.S. imperialists are busy staging with the SDF exercises aimed to explore sea routes leading to the coast of the DPRK and carry out landing on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The SDFf built high-performance pursuit ships under the pretext of coping with the infiltration of what it called \"operation ships\" and organized \"special guards\" and deployed them in various bases close to the East Sea of Korea. This is aimed to spark a military conflict under the pretence of pursuing those ships and give the green light to reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's arms buildup and war preparations pose a grave threat to the peace and security in this region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's attempt to unleash a war of reinvasion will only invite disasters.    \r\n\r\n"
