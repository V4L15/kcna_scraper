            "content": "U.S. Interference in Koreans' Affairs Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 6 (KCNA) -- All the Koreans in the north and the south and abroad should clearly see through the true nature of the U.S. interference and obstructions to the north-south economic cooperation and resolutely foil them, says Rodong Sinmun Monday in a signed article.\r\n The U.S. sent an official notice to the south Korean authorities that it would apply laws and regulations that ban the export of strategic items to what it called \"sponsors of terrorism\" to south Korean enterprises advancing into the Kaesong Industrial Zone. This is aimed to scuttle the construction of the zone, under the absurd pretext of \"possible exclusive use of them for a military purpose\", the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not the first time that the U.S. has interfered in the economic cooperation between the Koreans and stood in their way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has hindered the project of reconnecting the rail and road links on the eastern and western coasts and the construction of the Kaesong Industrial Zone ever since their start, talking about the \"approval\" by the \"UN Command\". The U.S. has hamstrung the Korean nation's efforts for reconciliation and cooperation by pressurizing the south Korean authorities to adjust the tempo of the improvement of the inter-Korean relations depending on the progress to be made in the settlement of the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAs if it were not enough, the U.S. is again working hard to put a physical brake on the construction of the Kaesong Industrial Zone, stretching dark tentacles to it. This can not but be an intolerable challenge and a mockery of the Korean nation advancing towards reconciliation and reunification under the uplifted banner of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This unwarranted interference in the construction of the zone is a premeditated move to disrupt the process of reconciliation and reunification on the Korean peninsula and this is little short of interfering in the affairs of the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. interference and obstructions against inter-Korean economic cooperation is a direct product of its criminal policy to dominate Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should correctly judge and handle all the issues proceeding from the stand of defending national independence and in the interests of the nation as befitting the era of reunification after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration and resolutely reject the U.S. unreasonable interference.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on Juche-Oriented Theory of State Building \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 6 (KCNA) -- The Korean people are leading a proud and worthwhile life under the banner of the glorious Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the international prestige of the DPRK is steadily rising higher. This is a clear proof of the greatness of the Juche-oriented theory of state building provided thanks to the energetic theoretical and ideological activities of the Workers' Party of Korea.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of power is important for hewing out the destiny of the popular masses, but it could not find a right solution in any era and revolution. It was only the WPK that perfectly solved the theoretical and practical issue arising in building revolutionary power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n President Kim Il Sung put forward the original line of building power based on the Juche idea and pursued the politics centering on the popular masses, thus successfully hewing the path of state building in the era of independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He gave an origin to the building of people's power based on the Juche-oriented principle as early as in the period of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle and further developed in depth the Juche-oriented theory of state building to meet the intrinsic requirements of socialist society. The Juche-oriented theory of state building provided by Kim Il Sung has thus been developed in depth with the progress of the revolution. \r\n This theory has been further developed and enriched at a new higher stage under the leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the theory of state building in our era as it is a full embodiment of the principle of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fundamental character of the theory of state building  Kim Jong Il has developed in depth as required by the Songun era is that it regards it as a great important affair and a basic principle of state building to increase military force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He set out the original idea of placing the army before the working class and has augmented the military force, considering it as the most important state affair. The reality clearly proves the justice of the Juche-oriented idea of state building that a country which pursues Songun is a true popular country and strong state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another important character of the theory is that it considers the perfect unity of the whole society on the basis of the revolutionary soldier spirit as a social and political foundation and a fundamental cornerstone for state building and the building of a great prosperous powerful socialist nation as an ultimate and basic aim of state building. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK's theory of state building serves as a great programme for state building in the 21st century as it correctly reflects the desire of humankind for building an independent powerful state.       \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They have, in fact, systematically abducted DPRK citizens for years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This was an organized and premeditated allurement and abduction carried out under the manipulation of the U.S. as part of its hostile policy toward the DPRK, the policy aimed to tarnish the dignity and the authority of the DPRK and undermine it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an open secret that the U.S. has deliberately dreamed up the issue of \"defectors from the north\" in a bid to internationalize and politicize it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pursuant to the U.S. policy to stifle the DPRK the south Korean authorities have set up in countries and regions close to the DPRK institutions and organizations staffed with many agents who specialize in alluring and abducting north Korean \"defectors\" to perpetrate systematic abduction and terrorism against DPRK citizens. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The authorities' planned act of alluring and abducting DPRK citizens has divided more families and relatives in the reunification-oriented era after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration, adding to the nation's pain and misfortune. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is something deplorable that families in the north and the south have lived separated from each other for more than half a century due to outsiders, without being able to visit or see each other.
