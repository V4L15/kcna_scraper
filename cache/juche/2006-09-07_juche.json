The U.S. is now placed in an awkward position. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Regarding the quandary of the U.S. in the Iraqi situation, the world public said: The civil war in Iraq originated in the Iraqi war ignited by the U.S.\" The Bush administration is at a loss unable to devise any appropriate measure or strategy to cope with the Iraqi situation, not knowing how it is developing. This is a due product of the Bush group's disability and belligerent action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is pursuing world domination, resorting to strong-arm action and the policy of strength. Since the September 11 incident the U.S. has divided other countries into two groups by saying \"You are either with us or against us\" and it designated those countries going against the grain with it as \"sponsors of terrorism\" to put pressure upon them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For its interests the U.S. did not bother to trample down on international treaties or norms and sacrifice others. The Afghan and Iraqi wars brought to light the brigandish nature of the U.S. The U.S. is paying dearly for the unreasonable internal and external policies of the Bush group. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Every sin brings its punishment with it. The international isolation of the U.S. is daily deepening and hastening its ruin. The U.S. is working hard to stop it, but there is no other way out but ruin for the Bush group.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The Iraqi army and people lacked the readiness, fighting spirit and faith that they should struggle against the imperialists in a do-or-die spirit and win victory over them at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The lesson taught by the case of Iraq tells that any country should have a correct view on war and high ideological awareness to destroy the imperialists to the last man. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order for any country to defend itself it is also important to augment its military power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What happened in Lebanon and Iraq prove the truth that a country with weak military capacity can neither defend its sovereignty nor contribute to the peace and security in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A war means a clash between the two different armies. No one can protect the sovereignty and destiny of other's country and nation. A country can reliably defend itself only when it manufactures necessary weapons by itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is essential to fortify the whole country. This is more essential in case of a modern war where there is no difference between the front and the rear. Fortifying the whole country would make it possible to beat back any invasion of the imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Entirely just are the policy of the Workers' Party of Korea for attaching importance to the army, the line of building self-defensive revolutionary armed forces and principles to implement it and Korean-style mode of military retaliation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. imperialists dare test its theory of strength against the DPRK, they will not be able to escape their final destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the progressive countries and nations of the world firmly defend themselves with their own military power, the imperialists and reactionaries will not be able to perpetrate aggression and war as they please.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Powerful arms are sure to guarantee socialism and peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The invincible single-minded unity around the headquarters of revolution is a sure guarantee for a final victory in the stand-off with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The single-minded unity is unbreakable as it has been forged and consolidated in the flames of the most hard-fought struggle against imperialism and the U.S. No force on earth can match the might of the unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will win a final victory in the showdown with the U.S. though the situation of revolution is now arduous and complicated.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Paektu, has covered the road of development as the true companion of the Korean women. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the year of Juche 35 (1946), President Kim Il Sung instructed officials to publish a magazine for bringing up, as able workers of the new society, the Korean women who had been subjected to oppression, maltreatment and ignorance for a long time. And he gave the title to the magazine and sent a congratulatory message on its foundation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe magazine is also associated with the warm love shown by anti-Japanese war hero Kim Jong Suk, who energetically led it to be a powerful ideological weapon arming the women with the ideas of the leader and vigorously arousing them to the efforts for building the new democratic Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The magazine, which has ushered in the heyday of its development under the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il, is fully discharging its mission and role as the organ of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Women's Union. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over the last decades, the magazine has done much for bringing up the women to be reliable pillars pushing one of the two wheels of the revolution through its brisk publication and propaganda activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The magazine has become popular among the women as it gives the immortal exploits performed by the three generals of Mt. Paektu in women movement and invaluable ideological and mental pabulum to the women. A lot of women have grown up to be loyal subjects defending the leader with their very lives, class vanguard firmly defending the socialist class position and heroes who have distinguished themselves in the socialist economic construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, the magazine gives knowledge and common living sense necessary for the women. They include literary works, history, geographical savvy, cooking, upbringing of children, needlework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its subscribers are ever increasing at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The magazine \"Korean Women\" No. 580 has been issued on the occasion of its 60th birthday.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
