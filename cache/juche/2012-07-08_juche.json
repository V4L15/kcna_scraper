The President is the eternal leader of our party and people who performed immortal patriotic exploits to shine for all ages under the uplifted banner of independence, Songun and socialism. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The patriotic cause of the President, who devoted all his life to the country and the people was steadfastly carried forward by Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to the energetic leadership of Kim Jong Il, the Workers' Party of Korea, army and state were developed into the party, army and state of Kim Il Sung, the revolutionary traditions of Mt.

Korean Regime's Sycophancy towards Japan \r\n Pyongyang, July 8 (KCNA) -- The south Korean \"government\" authorities' persistent moves to sign the General Security of Military Information Agreement with Japan are little different from what \"the five traitors of 1905\" did. This is a clear proof that they are steeped in the mentality of selling off the country to Japan to the marrow of their bones.\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson Sunday says this in a bylined commentary. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak group of south Korea is working hard to sign the military agreement with the Japan keen to impose even nuclear war disasters upon the Korean nation, openly calling for nuclear weaponization. This cannot be construed otherwise than an extremely dangerous action to hide the crimes committed by Japan against the Korean nation in the past and pave the way for the Japanese reactionaries' reinvasion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is that the Lee group's moves to sign the military agreement are aiming at doing harm to fellow countrymen in collusion with outside forces. It is as clear as daylight that in case the south Korean authorities conclude the military agreement with Japan, this will mean the completion of the \"tri-angular military alliance\" involving the U.S., Japan and south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through the alliance the U.S. seeks to invade the DPRK and, furthermore, maintain an unchallenged position in Northeast Asia. And on the strength of the alliance the Japanese reactionaries aim to realize their ambition for staging a comeback to Korea in collusion with south Korea, backed by the U.S. The Lee group of traitors seeks to use the alliance as a lever for doing harm to fellow countrymen under the patronage of outside forces. Owing to the Lee group's sycophancy towards Japan, the situation on the Korean Peninsula has reached the brink of war and the peace and stability in the region are facing a grave challenge. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts go to prove that the Lee group is a band of pro-U.S. and pro-Japanese lackeys who stoop to any infamy to hurt compatriots. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean nation will never be safe as long as this group is allowed to be at large."
