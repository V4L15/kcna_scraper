It is only the U.S. that is clamoring about \"threat\" from the DPRK in a bid to stifle it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A campaign of the bush administration to stifle the DPRK is escalating the tensions on the Korean peninsula. This deteriorates the bilateral relations and has a baneful impact on inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the removal of the confrontation between the DPRK and the U.S. and the north and south of Korea, a product of the cold war structure, and preservation of a lasting peace and stability in the Korean peninsula and the rest of the world it is necessary for the U.S. to drop its hostile policy towards the DPRK and pull its forces out of South Korea.    \r\n\r\n"
