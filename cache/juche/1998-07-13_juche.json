His utterances are nothing but a sophism  reversing black and white, which can be made only by a person with unreasonable way of thinking.\r\n   Cohen also said their policy of deploying U.S. troops in forward areas is \"making great contributions to stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region.\"\r\n   This is a mockery of the Korean and Asian peoples demanding the withdrawal of the U.S. troops, wreckers of peace and the source of aggression and war, and a crafty move to keep them in the Korean Peninsula and the Asia-pacific region for an indefinite period under the signboard of \"stability and prosperity.\"\r\n   The United States is trying to dominate all Korea by force of arms and, with it as a springboard, pave the way for aggression on Asia but it is an anachronistic daydream and an imprudent action going against the trend of the time.\r\n   The U.S. troop pullout is indispensable to genuine peace, stability, progress and prosperity in the Korean Peninsula and the Asia-Pacific region. \r\n \r\n"

Though they talk about \"acceptance\" as regards non-governmental pro-reunification events, they are in actuality describing the two organisations as \"illegal\" Worse still, they have gone the length of describing  those organizations as the \"forces of sympathising\" with North Korea.\r\n   They intend to rig up a pro-\"government\" organisation called  an \"all-people council\" with Hanchongryon and Pomminryon excluded  from the council for the non-governmental festival.\r\n   Their efforts cannot be construed otherwise than a treacherous act aimed at inciting hostility and consciousness of confrontation with the North Koreans who are fellow countrymen, dividing and alienating South Korean champions of reunification and democracy, disorganising the reunification movement from within and stamping it out.\r\n   If the South Korean authorities are interested in the improved inter-Korean relations and national reunification even a little, they should abolish the \"national security law\" which is used as a \"standard\" in defining Hanchongryon and Pomminryon as \"illegal organisations\" and take a resolute step to turn the anti-north policy of confrontation into a pro-north policy of reconciliation at an early date. \r\n\r\n"

This enabled them to boost up the production of pre-fab parts markedly.\r\n   Workers at workshop No. 2 ensured caisson production on a high level even under unfavourable weather conditions.\r\n   Workers at the gravel and sand workshop are stepping up production by making effective use of dredgers and barges, the drivers at the transport workshop are keeping the transport of gravel and sand ahead of all other work by increasing actual working ratio of the lorries.\r\n   All officials and workers at the factory are now working  hard to mark the 50th anniversary of the DPRK with splendid labour achievements. \r\n\r\n"
