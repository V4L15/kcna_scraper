Big portion of this fund will be diverted to the production of a space bomber called \"Falcon.\" The U.S. warlike forces are scheming to deploy this new type of space bomber for attack in their mainland and promptly strike and destroy any targets on the globe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is the fact that the U.S. war hawks are busying themselves developing HCV (hypersonic cruise vehicle) allegedly to mount preemptive attack on what they call nuclear-launching pads in some countries, including the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fact goes to prove that they zealously seek to contain those countries refusing to fawn upon the U.S. and gratify their ambition for world supremacy by accelerating the development and production of new space arms to secure the military edge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To attain the above-said aims, they have also been hell-bent on increasing modern nuclear arms such as development of smaller nukes, with continued investment of colossal amount of money, disregarding the just demand of the international community for nuclear disarmament. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some time ago, a spokesman for the Missile Defense Agency of the U.S. Department of Defense announced that the U.S. deployed tens of interceptor missiles aiming at north Korea in Alaska and California. This is an undisguised military provocation and threat and blackmail to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is busy with the arms buildup and the moves to provoke a war while reinforcing armaments on a large scale to realize its wild ambition for military supremacy and domination over the world. As a result, the situation is getting strained and the danger of war is increasing in different areas of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. warlike forces should discard their anachronistic design to grab military supremacy and hold sway over the world.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Intellectuals Called for Performing Great Feats in Building Great Prosperous Powerful Nation\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, November 28 (KCNA) -- The intellectuals in the DPRK are the ardent revolutionaries who have made a long journey of the Songun revolution under the leadership of the great Workers' Party of Korea and patriotic fighters who have gone through thick and thin in hearty response to the call of the Party and the country. Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the intellectuals grown up under the care of the great Party have become a mighty force for the building of a great prosperous powerful nation, the signed article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history in which the DPRK has grown strong and prosperous despite all sorts of ordeals is the one in which the DPRK has achieved great victories and brought about epoch-making changes thanks to the might of the writing brush as well as powerful arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary intellectuals in the DPRK have performed uninterrupted heroic feats in every period of the revolution and construction and at every stage of them under the guidance of the great leader and the great Party since the outset of the Korean revolution. The path covered by the Korean intellectuals since their meeting held 15 years ago occupies a particularly important place in this proud history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The past 15 years are a shining one during which all the intellectuals have been trained as revolutionary fighters of Kim Jong Il, keenly realizing the validity of the Songun line and Songun politics of the Party, and a proud one during which they together with all the servicepersons of the People's Army and people have brought the dawn of a great prosperous powerful nation to this land, turning adversity into favorable conditions and misfortune into blessings in the revolutionary soldier spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our intellectuals are strong in faith and will as they firmly believe in their leader only and follow him in whatever storm and stress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their revolutionary faith in the present era precisely means their faith in their leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our intellectuals are soldiers and disciples of Kim Jong Il who are entirely entrusting their destinies to him. Korean-style socialism is sure to triumph and they can work any epoch-making miracles as long as they are led by him. This is the unshakable faith they enshrined while following him. Having this faith, they made it possible for the country to become a proud possessor of a satellite and built lots of modern production bases and monumental edifices in different parts of the country by devoting their all wisdom and enthusiasm in the worst adversity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our intellectuals are the genuine Songun revolutionary comrades of Kim Jong Il who are sharing the same destiny with him despite rain or snow. It is the biggest privilege for our intellectuals transparent in faith in the leader to be an eternal companion, loyal helper and best adviser of the Party. Herein lie the great honor and pride of our intellectuals who have formed an unbreakable harmonious whole with Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Intellectuals are advocates of justice and pioneers of society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our intellectuals are vanguard fighters in the Songun era who have firmly equipped themselves with the Songun idea and dedicated their all to the victory of the Songun revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Invulnerable are the politico-ideological position and military position of Korean-style socialism. This would be unthinkable without the devoted struggle of our intellectuals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our intellectuals have performed proud feats in glorifying the country as an invincible one with strong military power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are standard-bearers in the struggle to make the shortcut to the building of a great prosperous powerful nation with their ardent patriotic enthusiasm and rich technological and cultural knowledge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There may be something difficult to be done by our intellectuals but there is nothing impossible for them as they have been tempered and nurtured ardent patriotism on the road of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are making a dynamic advance to greet the morning of a great prosperous powerful nation, full of conviction and optimism, having a huge unit of able intellectuals. This is entirely possible because they have Kim Jong Il at the head of the Party and the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now the vast ranks of the Korean intellectuals are displaying their tremendous might in the building of a great prosperous powerful nation. This would be unthinkable without Kim Jong Il's great politics of attaching importance to writing brush and intellectuals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He has successfully inherited the noble intention of the President who unrolled the political history of attaching importance to writing brush, making sure that the flag of the WPK was emblazoned with a hammer and a sickle along with a writing brush before its founding, thus building the ranks of intellectuals and steering the Songun revolution in reliance upon their might. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK's policy for intellectuals is the most revolutionary one as it calls for settling all issues arising in the revolution and construction by deeply trusting the ranks of intellectuals as a driving force of the revolution and relying on them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il's trust in our intellectuals is undisputed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our intellectuals will remain in sky-high spirit and our country surely reach the high eminence of a great prosperous powerful nation in the near future as long as he leads the powerful ranks of intellectuals and instills immense confidence and courage into them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the most important task facing the intellectuals of Songun Korea at present to give fullest play to their stamina in the building of an economic power as they have performed great feats in the struggle to build an ideological and military power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe article calls on them to live up to the WPK's political trust with great technological achievements.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
