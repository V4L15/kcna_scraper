            "content": "Japan's step for full-scale overseas aggression under fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 2 (KCNA)- The three ruling parties of Japan decided to significantly ease the norms for the use of weapons by the \"Self-Defence Forces\" (SDF) in the activities to \"rescue refugees\" and \"render medical assistance\" allegedly in line with the \"international standards.\" \r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary says: The Japanese reactionaries' projected dispatch of the SDF overseas and their step to significantly ease the norms for the use of weapons presuppose military operations overseas. It is intended to hurl the SDF into shambles of war and realize their dream of \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\" which they failed to do in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By realizing this dream they seek to put other Asian countries under their control, enslave the peoples and exercise their unlimited privilege as a colonial ruler. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The danger of the Japanese militarist aggression is looming as a real one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is well aware that it is made the primary target of the Japanese reactionaries' overseas aggression. They are going mad in their moves for overseas invasion under the pretext of \"threat from North Korea.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are running wild to swallow up the DPRK, bereft of reason. This may render its fight against them unavoidable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK are renewing their determination not to miss the chance to take a thousand-fold revenge upon the Japanese militarists if they dare encroach upon its sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are well advised to stop running wild, deeply mindful of the disastrous consequences to be entailed by their re-invasion.     \r\n\r\n"

The fellow countrymen should smash all their criminal moves and make them impotent with the concerted efforts of the nation for patriotism and reunification.     \r\n\r\n"
