Opposition parties and public organizations are calling Lee and Park just the same devils, while spreading the \"theory of punishing Lee Myung Bak-Park Geun Hye\" instead of the \"theory of punishing regime\". It is clear as noonday that the situation will turn unfavorable for the \"Saenuri Party\" of Park in the \"presidential\" election in December if it keeps patronizing Lee. This is the reason that Park is emphasizing \"distinction\" from Lee.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee and Park would only face stern punishment by the nation as they committed thrice-cursed crimes against the nation aligned with each other, concludes the commentary."
