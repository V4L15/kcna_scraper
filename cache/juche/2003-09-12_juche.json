Japan should have felt grateful for this and done its utmost to help discuss the basic issue at the talks sincerely and fairly. However, Japan soured the climate for the talks, persistently raising the abduction issue contrary to the purport and aim of the talks during the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's much-harped abduction issue is a matter that had already been settled through the publication of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration last year and the DPRK has done what it should do in this regard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, Japan is working hard to please its master and fish in troubled waters by supporting the U.S. pressure upon the DPRK even in the international arena. This is nothing but a foolish act of political imbeciles ignorant of the trend of the times and the situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan continues working hard to realize its sinister political purpose with the backing of the U.S. while evading its responsibility to liquidate its past as now, the DPRK will be left with no option but to take a strong countermeasure. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

General Assembly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts clearly prove that the U.S. imperialists are, indeed, aggressors who are gravely threatening the peace and security on the Korean peninsula and the world and an evil band of outlaws defying the U.N.

            "content": "KCNA Refutes U.S. Brigandish Demand\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 10 (KCNA) -- At the six-way talks in Beijing the United States did not show its political willingness to make a switchover in its policy toward the DPRK at all but took a more hard-line stand than before.\r\n It asserted that it can discuss the issue of the DPRK's concerns only when the latter takes a practical action to physically dismantle the \"nuclear weapons program\" in a verifiable and irreversible manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a brigandish demand that the DPRK should disarm itself and succumb to the U.S. It is little short of asking its rival to drop his gun first when both sides are leveling guns at each other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such demand of the U.S. in essence, means that the DPRK should waive its right of self-defence to defend its sovereignty which it regards as its life and soul and fall victim to the U.S. barehanded. This is an American-style mode of disarming sovereign states and a method of aggression to swallow up independent countries with ease. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By nature, verification is applicable only to criminals. The DPRK does not have any obligation to be subject to such verification under law as it has done its utmost for world's peace and stability. Moreover, the U.S. has no justification to bring up this issue as it spawned the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. and sparked nuclear confrontation between them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the international community recognizes unanimously, it is the U.S. that compelled the DPRK to build up a nuclear deterrent force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has so far used the verification issue through inspection as a leverage to stifle the DPRK system under the pretext of the Safeguards Agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency and is still trying to totally disarm the DPRK under the pretext of this verification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is an unbearable insult to the DPRK and intolerable as it is a wanton encroachment upon the sovereign state. \r\n It must be reemphasized that the verification issue might be discussed only after the U.S. drops its hostile policy toward the DPRK and the U.S. total removal of its nuclear threat to the DPRK is confirmed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the DPRK proposed at the six-way talks, the inspection issue will be automatically settled if all the measures are taken on the principle of simultaneous actions according to the DPRK's proposal for a package solution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. fails to do so, the nuclear issue can never be settled but it will entail irretrievable grave consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to stop insisting on such unacceptable brigandish assertion as \"verification\" of the DPRK, withdraw its hostile policy toward the DPRK, conclude a non-aggression treaty and improve DPRK-U.S. relations at an early date. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
