However, the GNP is begging for the U.S. forces' permanent presence in South Korea. \r\nPeace on the Korean Peninsula is unthinkable as long as the U.S. troops remain in South Korea. Yet, it is the GNP's intention to adamantly oppose inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The CPRF bitterly denounces in the name of the Korean nation aspiring after peace and reunification of the country the GNP's \"basic line toward the north\" as a declaration of a war against the DPRK as it is keen to implement the line by playing the role of a shock brigade in the U.S. war of aggression against the DPRK and an anti-reunification declaration to bar the independent and peaceful reunification of the country and perpetuate the national split. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the GNP hamstrings the process of improving the inter-Korean relations and puts a stumbling block in the way of the independent reunification as a dirty servant of the U.S., it will never escape a stern punishment of the whole nation.\r\n"

This laid bare its intention to use even nuclear weapons to stifle the DPRK. \r\nRodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not the first time that the U.S. imperialists' attempt at a nuclear attack on the DPRK was brought to light, the article says, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their moves to start a nuclear war in Korea and bring a nuclear holocaust to the Korean nation are already half a century long. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These moves have reached their height since bush's assumption of office. The hawkish bush group has become extremely arrogant while perpetrating high-handed and arbitrary practices in every part of the world. It has made no scruple of embarking upon the road of realizing its dangerous nuclear strategy to invade the independent DPRK in a bid to stifle it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. attempt at a nuclear attack on the DPRK is a link of the whole chain of its desperate moves to stifle the DPRK and indicates that they have reached the highest water mark. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. nuclear strategy is targeted against the Korean Peninsula. It is the U.S. sinister ambition to bring the Korean people to their knees and put the whole of Korea under its control even by use of nuclear weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Due to their reckless moves the Korean peninsula is exposed to a real danger of a nuclear war. They are gravely threatening the existence and progress of the Korean nation while hindering the process of achieving peace of the country and independent national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are, in fact, most barbarous aggressors keen to bring a nuclear holocaust to the Korean nation in a bid to stifle the DPRK and put the whole of Korea under their domination.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan urged to take proper attitude toward of DPRK-JAPAN relations\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 30 (KCNA) -- Japan's reactionary media and ultra-rightist forces are casting aspersions on the recent statement released by a spokesman for the central committee of the DPRK Red Cross Society.\r\n They are raising a hue and cry over the fictitious issue of \"kidnapping\" by the DPRRK claiming that \"it is still too soon to expect much from the statement\" as it was produced by an \"appeasement policy\" of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Turning aside the settlement of its past, Japan, an assailant, groundlessly takes issue with the DPRK, a victim, over the \"kidnapping\" issue invented by itself. This is just like a thief crying \"stop thief\" Rodong Sinmun today says this in a commentator's article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It further says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan committed never-to-be-condoned crimes against the Korean people during its past occupation of Korea and the Korean War, but has not yet made a clear-cut apology for them, to say nothing of compensation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, it is clamouring about such \"kidnapping\" issue while wearing an air of innocence as regards its past heinous crimes. It is an intolerable insult to the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is childish and maladroit of Japan to raise the \"kidnapping\" issue as a \"bargaining chip\", turning its back on the settlement of the past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The settlement of the past is the crux of problems to be solved for the improvement of the DPRK-Japan relations. It is impossible for Japan to expect the improved bilateral relations unless it makes an apology and compensation to the Korean people for its crime-woven past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a legitimate right of the DPRK to get apology and compensation. We will employ all means and methods to make Japan pay for its past crimes without fail in our generation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's attempt to drag out the settlement would only add to its crimes and increase the amount of its compensation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan continues peddling the non-existent issue of \"kidnapping\" in this century, covering up its past crimes and evading compensation for them, failing to read the Korean people's sentiment and will, it will give vent to their wrath toward Japan and accelerate its ruin.     \r\n\r\n\r\n"

And in his 40s he brought the U.S. imperialists who had boasted of being the \"strongest in the world\" to their knees, thus honorably defending the dignity and sovereignty of the nation, the article says, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The president advanced an original military idea that each country and nation should build up their military strength for self-defence and solve all military affairs by their own efforts with responsibility to defend themselves and steadily enriched it through revolutionary struggles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While leading the two wars against U.S. and Japanese imperialism he set out many original strategies and tactics to suit the specific conditions of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His generalship was Juche-oriented leadership art based on deep love and trust in soldiers and a revolutionary one that enabled them to fully discharge their position and role as masters in army building and military activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Il Sung was a genius of military affairs and an invincible general possessed of extraordinary military wisdom, steel-strong pluck and gut. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ever-victorious history of the Juche revolution started by him is given steady continuity by leader Kim Jong Il.     \r\n"

To try to apply the logic of \"reciprocity\" which has no measure of value common to the nation to the inter-Korean relations is to achieve the GNP's foolish aim to make a showdown with the north. And its talk about \"humanitarian aid\" under the \"conditions where transparency is guaranteed\" is meant to lead the DPRK to \"reform\" and \"opening\" with a petty amount of money and a few goods as a bait and destabilize it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It claimed in the basic line that \"no exchange and cooperation should be made unless peace is guaranteed.\" This is little short of declaring that the GNP would not involve itself in such red cross and humanitarian activities as the exchange of home-visiting groups of separated families and relatives as it reveals its criminal attempt to check cooperation and exchange between the north and south of Korea and hamstring the process of improving the inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A \"plan to develop the north\" contained in the basic line is, in essence, a replica and version of the preceding rulers' plan to \"restore the north\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is an intolerable challenge and provocation to the north that the GNP group is now working hard to draw up a \"plan to develop the north,\" a plan to \"unify the country by invading the north,\" after formulating \"unification under the liberal democracy\" in its party's line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP's \"basic line toward the north\" is, in the long run, a declaration to invade the north intended to implement the anti-DPRK aggressive policy of the U.S. imperialists who are threatening to mount a nuclear attack on the DPRK after singling it out as a member of the \"axis of evil.\" the line is also aimed to hinder the independent and peaceful reunification of the country and foster national division and confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson dismisses the \"basic line toward the north\" as a declaration to foster confrontation and division aimed to perpetuate the national split.     \r\n\r\n"
