Only the thorough implementation of the declaration would ensure national harmony and great unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north and the south should solve the issue of reunification independently in the common interests of the nation and in reliance upon the efforts of the nation and settle all the issues arising between the north and the south on the principle of promoting co-existence, co-prosperity and common interests and subordinating everything to the cause of national reunification under the uplifted banner of the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Positive efforts should be made to promote visits, contacts, cooperation, exchange, solidarity and unity in the noble idea of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The conception of confrontation should be discarded and the north and the south should negotiate and get reconciled with each other, build confidence and pool efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the fellow countrymen should be responsible for the implementation of the joint declaration.    \r\n\r\n"

Paekma, Mt. Hwanghae and Mt. Ryonggak are clad in forests of giant chestnut trees of 8 new species such as Obong chestnut, Subok chestnut and Soksan chestnut. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are in the county many co-op farms that have such forests, each covering hundreds of hectares. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This giant chestnut tree is quite distinct from other chestnut trees. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n First of all, it grows fast free from harmful insects. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chestnuts can be picked in 3-4 years after tree planting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its yield is 5-10 times higher than that of the tree of the native species. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also very nutritious and tasty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is good for preparing not only ordinary food but health and medicinal food. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Besides, Korea has many chestnuts of famous species including medicinal chestnut in Pyongyang and giant chestnut in Jongju.    \r\n\r\n"
