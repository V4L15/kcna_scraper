By this logic they mean that the Korean peninsula as well as Afghanistan and the middle east should be put under their control so as to hold the Asian continent. So, the U.S. seeks to launch an aggression against the DPRK with South Korea as its military stronghold in a bid to swallow up the whole of Korea and, furthermore, dominate other Asian countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Once a war breaks out it will spill over into many countries of Asia and the rest of the world and humankind will suffer untold disasters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., buoyed up by its self-claimed \"victories\" in a series of wars in recent years, are running amuck to ignite a new war in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. unleashes such a war of aggression in Korea, it will meet nothing but a bitter defeat and death. A war will bring nothing good to anyone. The U.S. must clearly know who is its opponent, renounce its policy to stifle the DPRK and opt for peace.    \r\n\r\n"

The number of aerial espionage cases by U-2 high-altitude strategic reconnaissance plane, EP-3 special operational plane and E-3 command plane totaled more than 30.\r\n Meanwhile, they conducted aerial warfare drills in South Korea for a surprise attack on the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On Dec. 26 alone, they had drills of air battle, ground attack, air transport and long-distance navigation flight in the skies above Wonju, Phyongchang, Taegu and other areas with over 120 fighter-bombers, assault planes, reconnaissance planes and transport planes involved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All those facts clearly betray their intention to make the DPRK the second Afghanistan.    \r\n\r\n"
