            "content": "Koreans Will Surely Force Japan to Pay for Its Past Crimes \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, August 21 (KCNA) -- The DPRK will never allow the sworn enemy Japan to keep the crimes committed by it against Koreans in the past buried into oblivion no matter how much water may flow under the bridge but employ every means and method to force it to pay for the blood shed by them without fail.\r\n A spokesman for the Association of Korean Victims of Forcible Drafting and Their Bereaved Families declared this in a statement released on Monday 96 years since the Japanese imperialists cooked up the criminal \"Korea-Japan Annexation Treaty\" by a coercive and fraudulent method on Aug. 22, 1910. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bitterly denouncing the monstrous crimes committed by Japan against humanity, the statement said: The Korean nation had undergone the sorrow of being a stateless nation for more than 40 years since Korea was deprived of its national sovereignty. However, Japan is justifying its past crimes and trying to go without making any apology or compensation for them even in this new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was by the force of the \"treaty\" that Korea was far removed from modern civilization, the Korean people were subject to the miserable fate of a ruined nation, the precious national treasures and cultural heritages that had been handed down from their ancestors were plundered as collections for luxury and pleasure of the Japanese robbers and rich natural resources shipped to Japan for the production of war supplies for its war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is more intolerable is that the Japanese reactionaries and right-wing politicians do not bother to let loose such reckless outcries as claiming that the annexation of Korea was \"legitimate\" under the situation that prevailed at that time, Japan's colonial rule over Korea \"contributed\" to Korea's modernization and the Koreans \"benefited\" from it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan, far from making a sincere apology and compensation for the crimes perpetrated by it against the Korean people in the past, has evaded its responsibility for liquidating its past though the last century was replaced by a new one and persistently pursued its hostile policy towards the DPRK, availing itself of the U.S. moves to stifle the DPRK. In recent years Japan, pretending to be a victim, adopted the \"North Korean Sanctions Law\" and applied \"sanctions\" against the DPRK like a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should redress its past crimes at an early date, paying heed to the towering grudge and resentment of the Korean victims and their bereaved families.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is the highest manifestation of independence to defend and strengthen this character. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Respecting the sovereignty of all countries is a major demand for realizing independence of the popular masses. There are countries big and small, developed and less developed, but all the countries are equal in the international relations and they have independent rights. No country has the right to impose its idea, system and way of life upon other countries. Especially the acts of forcing one's will upon others by a strong arm and encroaching upon others' sovereignty must never be tolerated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is impossible for all countries and nations to enjoy independent rights as full-fledged members of the international community, unless the principles of impartiality and equality are respected in the international relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The struggle for independence is, in essence, an anti-imperialist struggle. A resolute fight should be put up against imperialism without the slightest illusion about it. Herein lies the correct way of carrying the human desire for independence into reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To achieve the unity of the progressive people aspiring after independence is an important matter arising from the intrinsic demand of the present international situation and struggle for independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is truth borne out by the practical experiences of the Korean revolution that the way of achieving the prosperity of the country and the nation lies in sticking hard to the principle of independence. The Songun politics of the Workers' Party of Korea is the supreme manifestation of independent politics.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Its preface was written by the King. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In 1790, the 14th year following his enthronement, Muyedobothongji was printed in Chinese characters along with the first volume of Muyedobothongjionhae annotating the book in Korean. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Given in Muyedobothongji are picture-illustrated martial arts movements including handling of various swords and knives, boxing method, spear-handling and cudgel-handling. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The book reflects the traditional sword-handing methods. It introduces how to handle Korean-made swords, how to fight with two swords in both hands and how to use the sword with a long haft. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The part of boxing method of the book gives picture-illustrated basic movements of 25 boxing methods and 48 movements derived from them and then connects each separate movement into one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Figuring there are the traditional Thaekgyon (foot-kicking) methods of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The illustrations were drawn by famous artist Kim Hong Do (1760 - ?) and explanation and edition were made by realist scholar Pak Je Ga (1750 - 1805) and Ri Tok Mu (1741 - 1793). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Paek Tong Su, warrior of the government training center which was founded after the Imjin Patriotic War (1592 - 1598) against the Japanese invaders, gave technical guidance to the book compilation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists who had looked with covetous eyes upon the Korean cultural heritage prohibited the Korean people from playing all the martial arts games including a stone-throwing fight in 1908. And they, by dint of armed forces, broke into the national historical book storehouses in different parts of Korea to plunder priceless documents of the nation including the True Records of the Ri Dynasty and the Muyedobothongji. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The book Muyedobothongji, however, was defended by people in northwestern area of Korea centering around Pyongyang and it is now kept with good care in the Grand People's Study House. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The feature film \"Pyongyang Nalpharam\" now on screen in various places of the DPRK reveals the predatory nature of the Japanese invaders who fabricated the treaty on \"Korea-Japan Annexation\" at the point of bayonet in 1910 and wove every base plot to pillage the book and shows patriotic Pyongyang men of martial arts who defended the book at the cost of their lives.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
