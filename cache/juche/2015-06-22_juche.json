He highly appreciated them, saying that the girls' solo flight of supersonic fighters in which it is hard for men to fly is a success to be proud of in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the end of the training he met with Jo Kum Hyang and Rim Sol and congratulated them on their successful training.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Warmly taking the hands of the pilots weeping tears of joy after receiving bouquets, he said that they successfully conducted solo flight though there are a few countries with women pilots of supersonic fighters. This is not because their physical conditions and technological preparations are good but it is a revelation of the noble revolutionary spirit in which they cherished the warm love for the country and the transparent spirit of defending the country and ideologically accepted the Workers' Party of Korea's training-first policy and remained loyal to the intention of the Supreme Commander.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had a photo session with the pilots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Hwang Pyong So, O Kum Chol and Ri Pyong Chol."
