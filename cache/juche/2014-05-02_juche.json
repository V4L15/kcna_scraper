In this regard, Japan's Sankei Shimbun (Internet) said: the Korean Central Broadcasting contended that the DPRK's withdrawal from the NPT touched the U.S. on the raw, and quoted leader Kim Jong Il as saying that the U.S. should be well aware of the DPRK and it is a tragedy of the U.S. to have failed to get a good understanding of it still now.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the long run, the anachronistic deeds of the U.S., which had escalated the nuclear blackmail against the DPRK, having no understanding of it and constitutionally denying its ideology and social system, resulted in the successful 3rd nuclear test on the part of the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, the DPRK advanced a new strategic line of simultaneously pushing forward the economic construction and the building of nuclear force on the basis of its deterrent, which drove the U.S. into an abyss of self-contradiction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has been proved that time and justice stand by the DPRK, not the U.S. pretending to be \"the only superpower\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This being the hard fact, the U.S. still persists in the \"theory of disallowing the DPRK's possession of nukes\" while calling for \"resolute counteraction\" against \"provocation and threat\" from it to deceive the world public. It was well illustrated by Obama's recent junket to south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nowadays, the U.S. and its followers are viciously slandering the DPRK while clamoring about its \"possible fourth nuclear test\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this regard, the Rodong Sinmun, an organ of the Workers' Party of Korea Central Committee, stressed that the DPRK would never abandon its sovereign rights but decisively counter the hostile forces' challenge with its toughest stand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t And the DPRK, through the April 27 statement of a spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea, declared again that it was entirely just that it judged and determined it should counter the U.S., the sworn enemy, by force only, not words, and finally settle accounts with the enemy through an all-out nuclear showdown and that it would invariably go along the road chosen by itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is advised to grasp the meaning of this declaration, though belatedly. The more hell-bent the U.S. gets on the anti-DPRK nuclear racket with its worn-out \"strategic patience policy\", the more piteous plight it will be driven into.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK, which regards sovereignty and dignity, justice and peace as lifeblood, will never tolerate any slight encroachment on them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a tragedy of the U.S. that it has not yet got a good understanding of the DPRK."

Some philistines, in the meantime, did not hesitate to do such bullying acts as branding civic and public organizations that supported families of victims who demanded the probe into the accident as \"leftist forces\" and \"forces following the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent sinking case clearly proved the unpopular nature of the south Korean ruling forces that do not care for the human rights of the people."

But as months and years passed by, their hope turned into disappointment, rapidly touching off grudge and anger.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A flurry of censure and denunciation is directed to Park as she has lost all qualities as \"president\", human being and woman, a clear indication of the people's mindset.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park is like an \"owner of grave keeper's cottage\" as she turned the whole of south Korea into a cemetery.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On April 16 ferry \"Sewol\" sank in waters off Jin Island, South Jolla Province of south Korea. This was a hideous man-made disaster deliberately caused by Park.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After getting notified of the accident, she reluctantly made her appearance in the scene where the rescue operation was under way. There she simply said that \"she felt sorry\" and expressed sham consolations to the bereaved families, uttering \"they should trust the government\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As confusion was made in the rescue operation and a deliberate default was manifested in it, the bereaved families burst into bitter lamentation and criticism and grievances of people of various circles mounted high, Park convened a meeting of chief secretaries of Chongwadae on April 21 at which she began evading responsibility, as if she had nothing to do with the accident. She grumbled \"the captain of the ferry behaved like a murderer\", far from taking an appropriate measure. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park only admonished her stooges and trumpeted about responsibility with a cool look without clearly expressing any proper consolations and apology even though many days have passed since the tragedy. This inhumane act bereft of common sense has touched off extreme hatred and resentment among the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The preceding rulers of south Korea admitted responsibilities and made formal apologies whether they liked it or not, when huge disastrous accidents occurred, as they were unable to swim against the people's mindset.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But it was only Park who did not hesitate to show such a thrice-cursed behavior of mocking the people and evading responsibility.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That is why the south Korean public is branding Park, the boss of Chongwadae, as the \"owner of grave keeper's cottage\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park is a master-hand at slandering fellow countrymen and a woman confrontation maniac.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park's confrontational hysteria of hurting the dignity and social system of the DPRK has already gone beyond the tolerance limit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As she is keen on escalating the confrontation of the social systems, she, far from accepting with sincerity the series of fair proposals made by the DPRK for the improvement and development of the north-south relations from the outset of the year, viciously challenged them, calling them a \"camouflaged peace offensive for conducting overseas propaganda and for inciting conflicts among southerners\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park is an adventurous being who always goes to the extremes and has considered her fellow countrymen in the north as a principal enemy and target of confrontation and war. She is no more than a mentally deranged who does not have normal thinking faculty and insight, and a confrontation maniac just like a rabid dog always keen on biting others.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What she let loose day and night is just malignant mud-slinging at the DPRK's nuclear deterrence for self-defence, which only triggered off public jeers and censure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park made waste water-like reckless remarks slandering the DPRK's line on simultaneously developing two fronts after inviting her American master reminiscent of a wicked black monkey to visit south Korea on April 25.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The people are unanimous in deploring the fact that there is no remedy for curing Park's mental disease as she has gone so mad with hurling mud at the nuclear deterrence of justice which the fellow countrymen in the north have had access to prevent the outside forces from imposing a nuclear disaster upon them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Worse still, she is making a new ploy so called \"human rights issue in the north\" aimed at hurting and slandering the fellow compatriots. This is also part of her confrontational hysteria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If things had gone properly, Park should have looked back upon the pitiful reality of south Korea where students are choosing suicide owing to the unrealistic education policy and unpopular policy of discriminating against youth and children.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, she, at her American master's prodding, is unhesitatingly resorting to such thrice-cursed move to set up an international \"office for human rights in the north,\" not content with desperately pulling up the DPRK over its inviolable human rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She is no more than an old prostitute coquetting with outside forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What she has done, kowtowing to outside forces since she took office as \"president,\" clearly proves that she is no more than a dirty political harlot and old prostitute without an equal as she is steeped in sycophancy and treachery.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was none other than Park who drove all the fellow countrymen into the danger of a nuclear disaster by staging Max Thunder in the wake of Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military drills targeted at the compatriots in the north with huge nuclear war means of the U.S. involved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  She is adding to her thrice-cursed crimes by leaving to the tender mercy of the U.S. the \"right to command the wartime operations,\" a symbol of national sovereignty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  It is not hard for anyone to guess that the farce of postponing the transfer of the above-said right agreed with Obama in secrecy is a revelation of her sinister intention to make a preemptive attack on the DPRK, relying on her American master.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All Koreans are spitting on her as she is resorting to whorish and disgusting political prostitution only after leaving her soul or chastity violated at such old age of over 60.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The mindset of south Koreans is growing angry.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The voice of the people is the voice of God.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is impossible for her to check or escape the deep-rooted grudge of the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As long as Park is allowed to stay in power it is absolutely impossible to see the improvement and development of the inter-Korean relations and peace and reunification of the country and the south Korean society and all Koreans will suffer only disasters and misfortunes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is necessary to remove the root cause of disasters of the nation as early as possible."

Chongwadae.\n\t\t\t\t\tAl principio del mandato de Park, la gente se hacia ilusion atraida por las agradables \"promesas electorales\" de ella, pero ahora expresa desenganada gran odio e indignacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa avalancha de criticas a la mandataria surcoreana, quien perdio totalmente el honor de la \"presidenta\", el ser humano y la mujer, es un reflejo de la opinion publica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark es la \"duena de la casa de celadora de sepulcros\" que convierte todo el territorio surcoreano en un cementerio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 16 de abril pasado, ocurrio en el mar frente a la isla Jin de la provincia de Jolla del Sur el hundimiento del barco de pasajeros \"Sewol\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste incidente fue causado artificialmente por Park.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAlgun tiempo despues de informada del caso, ella aparecio a desganas en el lugar de accidente y se limito a decir a los familiares de victimas: \"!Que lastima!\" y \"Confien en el gobierno\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando los familiares expresaban el descontento por el disturbio y la negligencia en las labores de rescate quejando: \"Quieren que mis hijos fueran devorados por los peces\", Park convoco el 21 de abril una reunion de los secretarios superiores de Chongwadae en que trato de eludir las responsabilidades, en vez de tomar medidas necesarias, diciendo asi: \"el capitan del barco se porto como asesino\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLlegan al climax la indignacion y la colera de los habitantes por la conducta inhumana y anormal de Park, quien no pidio disculpas como se debe y critica solo a sus inferiores imputandoles la responsabilidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImpotentes de desoir la voz del pueblo, hasta los anteriores gobernantes surcoreanos reconocian en lugares publicos las responsabilidades pidiendo disculpas si ocurria algun desastre tragico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa opinion publica califico oficialmente a Park de la \"duena de la casa de celadora de sepulcros\" comparando el tejado azul de Chongwadae con el tumulo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark es gran maestro de demagogia y enfrentamiento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa paso el limite la fiebre conflictiva de Park que difama la dignidad y el regimen de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEnloquecida por la confrontacion entre los regimenes de ambas partes coreanas, ella critico los imparciales proyectos, presentados desde principios de este ano por la RPDC para la mejora y el desarrollo de las relaciones intercoreanas, como \"ofensiva de paz disfrazada\", \"para la propaganda al exterior\" y \"para provocar las discrepancias entre personas\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tElla no pasa de ser una discapacitada mental que no puede pensar y ver normalmente y se dedica solo al enfrentamiento como perra rabiosa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa incesante difamacion de Park sobre el disuasivo nuclear autodefensivo de la RPDC esta causando la burla y criticas de la opinion publica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, ella invito el 25 de abril a su amo gringo, parecido a un mono negro malo, y volvio a calumniar la linea de la RPDC de impulsar simultaneamente la construccion economica y la de fuerzas armadas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa opinion publica lamenta unanimemente que no hay en el presente ni habra en el futuro la medicina que pueda curar la histeria de Park quien difama obstinadamente el justo disuasivo nuclear poseido por los connacionales a fin de prevenir el desastre nuclear que quieren imponer las fuerzas extranjeras.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl llamado problema de \"DDHH del Norte\", que suele mencionar Park, tambien parte de la locura conflictiva de ella.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara ser correcto, Park tendria que atender primero la realidad espantosa del Sur de Corea donde cada dia se suicidan muchos jovenes  debido a la politica de ensenanza irrealista y la de discriminacion de la juventud y la infancia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, a la instigacion de su amo norteamericano, la mandataria surcoreana esta enfrascada en cuestionar los sagrados DDHH de la RPDC y no vacila en instalar hasta la \"oficina de DDHH del Norte\" de nivel internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark es una ramera vieja que coquetea a las fuerzas extranjeras.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde que tomara el poder, Park cometio acciones serviles a las fuerzas extranjeras demostrando su atributo de prostituta politica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs Park Geun-hye la autora quien empuja a todos los coreanos al crisol de desastre nuclear al realizar los ejercicios militares conjuntos \"Key Resolve\" y \"Foal Eagle\" y hasta el simulacro aereo combinado \"Max Thunder\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark trata de encomendar para siempre a EE.UU. hasta el \"mando de operaciones en el tiempo de guerra\", simbolo de la soberania.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUltimamente, Park prometio en secreto a Obama la dilacion del traspaso del \"mando de operaciones en el tiempo de guerra\", lo cual parte de su intencion de dar el ataque preventivo contra la RPDC con la ayuda de su amo gringo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los coreanos escupen en esa ramera politiquera que a pesar de mas de 60 anos de su edad, vive con la prostitucion politica sin espiritu nacional ni entereza.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa opinion publica surcoreana vibra de odio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa opinion publica es la voz del cielo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl clamor del pueblo llega al cielo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi se deja intacta a Park, no se puede alcanzar la mejora ni desarrollo de las relaciones intercoreanas, ni la paz ni la reunificacion del pais. Al contrario, provendran las calamidades y desgracias para la sociedad surcoreana y toda la nacion coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay que eliminar cuanto antes a Park Geun-hye, causa de desastres."

Por otra parte, unos politiqueros definen como \"fuerzas izquierdistas\" y \"pro-Norte\" a los familiares de victimas, que exigen la averiguacion del caso, y las entidades civiles y sociales que lo apoyan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl hundimiento del barco demuestra claramente la naturaleza anti-popular de las autoridades surcoreanas que no piensan ni en el sueno en los DDHH del pueblo."
