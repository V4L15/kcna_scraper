This is the most brilliant of his ideological and theoretical exploits. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the peculiarity of brilliant activities conducted by the President to lead the cause of global independence to steady progress and victory, the article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He had always maintained the stand of Juche that calls for contributing to the cause of global independence through the successful Korean revolution based on the organic combination of the national duty and international duty in making revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He had steadfastly kept the revolutionary principle of independence against imperialism under any circumstances and always rendered disinterested assistance to the peoples of revolutionary and progressive countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What holds the brilliant position in his distinguished revolutionary activities to victoriously advance the cause of global independence was that in the grim historic period when he was leading the Korean people's anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle, he ushered in the new era of the national liberation struggle in colonial countries and set the worldwide example in ensuring the international united front and joint action against imperialism and fully supporting the revolutionary struggles in other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He also led the Korean people's great Fatherland Liberation War against the U.S. imperialist aggressors to victory and thus brought about the beginning of decline for the U.S. imperialists for the first time in history and opened up the era of new surge in the struggle against imperialism and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Il Sung's historic exploits for global independence are now creditably being carried forward and glorified by Kim Jong Il who is identical to the President in ideology, leadership and personality.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And the Japanese government approved so-called main principle for emergency measure in relation to the MD, which makes it possible to fire interceptor missiles according to the defense minister's decision without prior consent of the prime minister, if necessary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality goes to prove that Japan wants to conduct active military actions as a belligerent in league with the U.S. and its preparation has been accelerated at very dangerous phase.

Korean Side\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, April 11 (KCNA) -- The issue of the participation of teams of the north and the south in the 2008 Beijing Olympics as a unified team still remains unsettled. This is chiefly attributable to the lack of the south side's Olympic Committee in the will to form a unified team on the principle of national cooperation, utterly oblivious of the duty it has assumed before the Korean nation in the June 15 era of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A spokesman for the DPRK Olympic Committee said this in an answer given to the question put by KCNA on Wednesday as regards the fact that the inter-Korean sports talks which have been under way to let the teams of the north and the south participate in the above-said Olympics as a unified team proved fruitless due to the unreasonable stand and attitude of the south side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north side put forward a principled and reasonable proposal for letting teams of the north and the south participate in the Olympiad as a unified team and has made every sincere effort to realize it. But the south side falsified the truth, asserting that it has never discussed the issue of their participation in the qualifying and elimination matches by forming a unified team at the five-five ratio already agreed upon by the north and the south and the International Olympic Committee in Lausanne, Switzerland. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Instead of advancing a new proposal, the south side far-fetchedly insisted on its unreasonable assertion that players be chosen for the unified team through competition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This barred the talks from yielding fruits though they were at a final phase thanks to the concession and sincere efforts made by the north side over the issues of the name, song and flag of the unified team and other matters from the stand to form a unified team in keeping with the expectation of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north side remains unchanged in its principled stand that the north and the south should form the unified team with an equal right and qualification in the idea of \"By our nation itself.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the belief of the DPRK Olympic Committee that if the south side's Olympic Committee accepts the reasonable proposal of the north side, both teams of the north and the south will be able to participate in all international sports games as a unified team, a long-cherished desire of all the Koreans, and thus demonstrate the spirit and wisdom of the Korean nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
