Kyongam stands in Sariwon, the capital of North Hwanghae Province. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Located in the city's south western part, it is 140 metres high above sea level. As it is surrounded by the plains on all sides, it looks like a precipice. On the top of the mountain there is a huge rock shaped like a cockscomb. Hence the name Kyongam mountain since olden times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Every season different flowers blossom and every kind of trees and plants grow here on the mountain, thereby varying its appearance according to seasons. The Kyongam pavilion at the northern foot and other historical relics add a special touch of beauty to the mountain scenery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In March Juche 55(1966) President Kim Il Sung came here and proposed turning it into a recreation ground in which the people could enjoy scenic attractions. After his visit, recreation and public service facilities, spa resorts, playing ground, artificial falls and a zoo were built. Fruit trees and flowering plants were added to send forth delightful fragrance. It is now a favorite haunt for the local people. \r\n\r\n"

But Japan let a non-governmental organisation pay a petty amount of money to former \"comfort women for the army\" in a bid to keep its past crimes buried in oblivion and avoid the governmental responsibility for the sexual slave-related crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Typical of this move is the \"Asia Peace National Fund for Women\" which was created by the Japanese government in 1995. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is important in Japan's compensation to the former \"comfort women for the Japanese imperial army\" is not the matter of whether victims receive money or not but the need for the government, the assailant, to own its legal responsibility and compensate for its crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Judging from this, the \"civilian fund\" cannot find a solution to the legal problem between the Japanese government, the assailant, and the \"comfort women\", the victim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In other words, whatever money the Japanese government intends to provide is to come from the \"civilian fund\" and, therefore, it has nothing to do with the victims of the former Japanese imperial army from a legal point of view. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSo, the \"civilian fund\" plays a mere role of collecting money from ordinary Japanese citizens and conveying it to victims. The \"fund\" is no more than a \"broker\" and the fund is nothing but charity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Therefore, the DPRK government has demanded the Japanese government immediately give up the \"civilian fund\" unacceptable from a legal and moral point of view, stating that it cannot avoid its responsibility for the human rights abuses it committed against the Korean nation and humankind by forcing over 200,000 women into sexual slavery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hong expressed hope that Murayama would clearly understand the feelings of the Korean people and the grudge of the former \"comfort women\" and conduct activities so that Japan may make a governmental apology and reparation for its past crimes instead of using the \"civilian fund\". \r\n\r\n"

But the recent carriage of the bill proves that Japan has totally thrown away the \"peace constitution\" which existed only in name and undisguisedly embarked on the road of overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The adoption of the bill poses great danger as it allows Japan's \"SDF\" to use armed forces against any vessel in any waters at its own will. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries seeking a way for aggression on the continent with the backing of the U.S. have provided a precondition for staging a comeback any moment under the pretext of \"coping with emergencies in areas surrounding Japan.\" Their military aggression will target against vast areas of Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson in a commentary brands the approval for the bill as part of the \"emergency legislative arrangements\" for a war of aggression on the Korean peninsula and its surrounding areas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is designed to provide a legal and institutional device for overseas aggression, the commentary notes, warning: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries should stop such reckless reinvasion moves at once if they do not want another bitter defeat. \r\n\r\n"
