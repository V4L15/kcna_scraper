            "content": "Japan Urged to Take Honest Approach toward Liquidation of Its Past \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 23 (KCNA) -- It is quite natural for Japan to remain distrusted by the international community as it does as dictated by the U.S. without its own principle and independence,  it thinks money is everything and is rushing headlong into aggression, far from drawing a lesson from its crime-woven past.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Friday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has dreamt of being a permanent member of the UN Security Council at any cost this year, but it has gone bust. It is due to Japan's persistent moves to become a political power and realize its wild ambition for overseas expansion, while shelving the issue of liquidating its past.\r\n This year, 60 years since the defeat of the Japanese imperialists, witnessed the evermore undisguised moves to incite militarism through the distortion of history and visits to the \"Yasukuni Shrine\" in Japan. Japan has escalated in real earnest the moves to revise the Constitution in a bid to turn Japan, which has professed to be a \"pacifist state,\" into a war state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The danger of militarization of Japan, a criminal state, and its wild ambition for overseas aggression has further increased this year than ever before. For this reason, the vigilance against Japan and anti-Japanese sentiment have mounted higher than ever before worldwide. There have been widespread signature campaigns against Japan's bid to become a permanent member of the UNSC in different countries of the world including Asian countries. An increasing number of countries clarified their official stands opposing Japan's bid in the international arena. It is the common view and stand of the international community that Japan should not be allowed to sit on that important international body having the heavy responsibility to ensure global peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's unsuccessful bid to become a permanent member of the UNSC this year proved that this membership can neither be bought nor can be won with the backing of a big country and it can never sit on it unless it gets the confidence of the international community.\r\nIf Japan is to gain trust of the international community as its member, it should take an honest attitude and stand towards the issue of liquidating its past and give up its militaristic moves.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

If the U.S. imperialists provoke a war of aggression at any cost, the army and people of the DPRK will mercilessly wipe out the enemies with the might of Songun to resolutely protect the dignity and sovereignty of the country and the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"
