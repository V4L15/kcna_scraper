            "content": "Bush administration hit for seeking aggression on Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 25 (KCNA) -- The world public bitterly denounces the Bush administration for its wild ambition for aggression on Korea.\r\n The chairman of the Guinean Committee for Supporting Korea's Reunification in a statement said that tension is still being kept on the Korean Peninsula by the U.S. and South Korea and the danger of war is growing there. The U.S. and South Korea should immediately stop their moves to ignite a new war in Korea, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bulgarian newspaper Rabotnicheski Vestnik in an article said that the U.S. provoked a war early in the 1950s to invade North Korea and, even after its defeat, it has been continuously resorting to the moves for aggression on the DPRK in violation of the armistice agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The central committee of the All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks in a statement said that the U.S. is likely to forget that it was defeated by the young DPRK in the Korean War (1950-1953). The statement warned that the U.S. is miscalculating that it will not be punished even if it ignites a war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Egypt-Korea Friendship Association in a statement strongly demanded that the U.S. and the South Korean authorities immediately stop their large-scale military exercises going against the desire of all the Korean people and the world community for reconciliation, peace and reunification on the Korean Peninsula through the implementation of the historic north-south joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The chairman of the labour union of Guyana in a statement said that if the South Korean authorities take part in the current war exercises in line with the U.S. war policy against the DPRK, they would be strongly protested and denounced by the peace-loving people of the world as a naked betrayal of the north-south joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Chinese Liberation Army Daily in an article said that the U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises destroyed the favorable atmosphere of reconciliation, cooperation and peace on the Korean Peninsula in violation of the spirit of the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework on refraining from threatening dialogue partner militarily and the spirit of the north-south joint declaration.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. mandarins' reckless remarks against DPRK refuted \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, March 25 (KCNA) -- A senior official of the Central Intelligence Agency of the united states asserted it is highly probable that the DPRK is pushing ahead with the \"preparations for a test-fire of an inter-continental ballistic missile\" capable of striking the U.S. mainland with \"nukes\" and the U.S. Defense Secretary said that the DPRK is active in \"developing weapons of mass destruction\" including \"biological and chemical weapons and nuclear weapons.\"\r\n Rodong Sinmun today carries a signed commentary in this regard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for the nuclear threat, the U.S. is to blame for posing it to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are more than 20,000 nuclear warheads stockpiled in the U.S. it is threatening the DPRK after deploying at least 1,000 nuclear weapons in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The hawkish bush group is working hard to put into practice its plan for a nuclear attack on the DPRK. It is running mad frequently raising a hue and cry over the DPRK's \"nuclear problem.\" but this is the height of folly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By zealously floating the fiction of \"nuclear development\" by the DPRK, the U.S. war hawks seek to convince the world of the \"danger of nukes\" from the DPRK and use it as a pretext to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on it. It is their intention to raise the cloud of the first nuclear mushroom on the Korean Peninsula in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That is why the U.S. is escalating its false propaganda about a \"nuclear threat\" from the DPRK and frantically stepping up preparations for a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is maintaining heightened vigilance against this false propaganda and keeps itself fully ready to cope with it. The DPRK will strongly retaliate against attacks to be made by the U.S. imperialists with either nuclear weapons or conventional weapons.    \r\n\r\n"

Its stand toward aggressors remains firm. The aggressors' escalated military threat and blackmail against the north will only compel it to further increase its capability for self-defence. The strike of the army of the DPRK at the aggressors will be merciless. A war to be launched by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean warmongers against the north will only lead to self-destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are well advised to stop acting rashly.     \r\n\r\n"
