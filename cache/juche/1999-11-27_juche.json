Korean economy \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, November 27 (KCNA) -- The Pyongyang mission of the National Democratic Front of South Korea held a press conference on November 25, 2 years after the South Korean economy was placed under the mandate of the IMF. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Addressing the press conference, Pak Kwang Gi, chief of the mission, said that the South Korean economy has been neither recovered nor improved but has gone bankrupt over the last 2 years of ruinous mandate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Recalling that more than 53,000 enterprises have gone bankrupt in the past 2 years, he noted that this predicts the total bankruptcy of the South Korean economy as a colonial comprador economy. He went on:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The imperialist monopoly capital's mandate over  the South Korean economy has brought nothing but an unprecedented collapse of the economy, the widening gap between the rich and the poor and enormous profits of the privileged circles, specified businesses and the foreign monopoly capital. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Kim Dae Jung group is, however, talking about \"economic growth and recovery.\" This is intended to hide its total economic failure, a product of its thrice-cursed crimes, and calm down the angry voices of the people.  \r\n\r\n"

The attempts of the U.S. and the Kim Dae Jung \"regime\" to escape from responsibility for the massacre are an unpardonable mockery of the Korean nation and the human conscience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The appeal calls for escalating the campaign for  condemning the GIs' June 25 massacre  of civilians and probing into the truth behind the spraying of defoliant into an anti-U.S. movement of the whole nation and leading it to the struggle for an end to the U.S. colonial domination  and the withdrawal of the U.S. troops from South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It also called for intensifying the struggle to liquidate the pro-Japanese, pro-U.S. elements to throw them into a rubbish ground of history and build a new independent country  on this land without flunkeyist and treacherous  politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The appeal underscored the need to unite the ranks of the anti-U.S. struggle closer and lift higher the beacon of the vigorous anti-U.S., anti-\"government\" struggle. \r\n\r\n"

Korean ruler's moves to develop missile\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Pyongyang, November 27 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the National Democratic Front of South Korea  issued a statement on Nov. 22 assailing the South Korean authorities' reckless moves to develop missiles, according to a Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The statement says that the moves to develop missiles pushed by the successive South Korean authorities against the north have become ever more undisguised under the Kim Dae Jung regime, thus turning South Korea into the biggest nuclear arsenal in the east. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The desperate moves of the Kim Dae Jung group to develop long-range missiles are aimed to ignite a war of aggression against the north on the Korean peninsula at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The statement vehemently denounced these moves as an unpardonable anti-national crime aimed at massacring the fellow countrymen and another grave threat to the peace on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This proves that the present chief executive of South Korea and his master the U.S. are the harassers of stability and peace on the Korean peninsula and that the threats of  missile and war come not from the north but from the south. The Kim Dae Jung group must stop at once its moves to develop long-range missiles and anti-north provocations which will lead to its own destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the U.S. sincerely wishes stability and peace on the Korean peninsula, it should not take issue with the DPRK's satellite launch but immediately stop its assistance to the South Korean authorities in the long-range missile development. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan jumps into development of \"TMD\" system\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, November 27 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today carries an article disclosing the ambition of Japan which has taken part in the development of \"Theatre Missile Defense\" system (TMD). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In mid-August Japan signed a memorandum of understanding which calls for a joint development of \"TMD\" with the United States. This is what Japan wanted, dreaming of overseas aggression, the author of the article points out, and says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nJapan seeks to step up its moves for turning itself into a military power through involvement in the \"TMD\" development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  In this development Japan committed itself  to making a light system of the missile for its launch into  outer space which is to be placed at the top of the three-stage interceptor missile. The \"system\" is used to detect infra-red of enemy's ballistic missile in outer space, track and strike the missile. Therefore, it is the key to the \"TMD\" development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As seen above, Japan seeks, through the establishment of \"TMD,\" not only to possess long-range ballistic missiles  but also to develop various missile technologies so as to equip itself with latest war equipment for overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It also seeks to trigger off arms race in the Asia-Pacific region, totally abolish its \"peace constitution\" and drastically beef up its military spending. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If Japan develops \"TMD\" together with the United States, other countries will be compelled to join in the arms race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn this case it will rewrite the constitution and squander money for reinvasion, under the pretext that their military movements pose a \"threat\" to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Another aim of Japan is to go ahead with the militarization of the economy in real earnest so as to save it from a serious crisis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan has to spend 20-30 billion yen for the development of the light system of the missile  and 80 billion for intelligence satellite. Since 1,000 billion yen is needed for the deployment of such system, its military spending will continue to increase. After all, stumbling munitions monopolies will be caught in a shower of money and grow as poisonous mushrooms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This ambition of Japan clearly shows that it, together with the United States, has grown to be main aggression forces threatening peace in Asia and the rest of the world. \r\n\r\n"
