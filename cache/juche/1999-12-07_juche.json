This is aimed to ignite a war of aggression when a chance presents itself in that course. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Through the close military links with the NATO the United States, Japan and South Korea are introducing NATO-style relations of military alliance and its principles of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The strengthened military alliance and its aggressive moves are bringing a great danger to Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The alliance is not targeted at the Korean peninsula only. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Underlying the strengthened military alliance is the U.S. strategy for domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the calculation of the United States that it can dominate the whole world if it retains a hold on the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   By making air strikes against Yugoslavia with the NATO involved, the United States paved the sure way for the expansion of the NATO, the main force in dominating Europe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Its next task is to deal with the Asia-Pacific region where there are big powers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States' control over this region through the tripartite military alliance would be little short of dominating the whole world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Therefore, it is a vital issue for the peoples in the region to frustrate the moves to boost the military alliance and its aggressive moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Only when the people maintain a sharp vigilance against these moves and decisively torpedo them is it possible to defend peace and stability in Asia and the rest of the world. \r\n\r\n"
