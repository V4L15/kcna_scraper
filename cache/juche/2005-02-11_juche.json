            "content": "DPRK FM on Its Stand to Suspend Its Participation in Six-party Talks for Indefinite Period \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 10 (KCNA) -- The DPRK Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement Thursday to clarify its stand to cope with the grave situation created by the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK.\r\n The statement says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The second-term Bush administration's intention to antagonize the DPRK and isolate and stifle it at any cost has become quite clear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As we have clarified more than once, we justly urged the U.S. to renounce its hostile policy toward the DPRK whose aim was to seek the latter's \"regime change\" and switch its policy to that of peaceful co-existence between the two countries. We have closely followed with patience what policy the second-term Bush regime would shape after clarifying the stand that in that case it would be possible to solve the nuclear issue, too.\r\n However, the administration turned down our just request and adopted it as its policy not to co-exist with the DPRK through the president's inaugural address and the state of the union address and the speech made by the secretary of State at the Congress hearing to get its approval, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The remarks made by senior officials of the administration clarifying the official political stance of the U.S. contained no word showing any willingness to co-exist with the DPRK or make a switchover in its policy toward it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the contrary, they have declared it as their final goal to terminate the tyranny, defined the DPRK, too, as an \"outpost of tyranny\" and blustered that they would not rule out the use of force when necessary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And they pledged to build a world based on the U.S. view on value through the \"spread of American style liberty and democracy.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The true intention of the second-term Bush administration is not only to further its policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK pursued by the first-term office but to escalate it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As seen above, the U.S. has declared a new ideological stand-off aimed at a \"regime change\" in the DPRK while talking much about \"peaceful and diplomatic solution\" to the nuclear issue and the \"resumption of the six-party talks\" in a bid to mislead the world public opinion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is nothing but a far-fetched logic of gangsters as it is a good example fully revealing the wicked nature and brazen-faced double-dealing tactics of the U.S. as a master hand at plot-breeding and deception. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has clarified its stand that it would not pursue anti-Americanism and treat the U.S. as a friendly nation if it neither slanders the political system in the DPRK nor interferes in its internal affairs. It has since made every possible effort to settle the nuclear issue and improve the bilateral relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. interpreted this as a sign of weakness, defiled the dignified political system in the DPRK chosen by its people and wantonly interfered in its internal affairs.\r\n The U.S., turning down the DPRK's request to roll back its anti-DPRK hostile policy, a major stumbling block in the way of settling the nuclear issue, treated it as an enemy and, not content with this, totally rejected it,  terming it \"tyranny.\" This deprived the DPRK of any justification to negotiate with the U.S. and participate in the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Is it not self-contradictory and unreasonable for the U.S. to urge the DPRK to come out to the talks while negating its dialogue partner? This is the height of impudence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. now foolishly claims to stand by the people in the DPRK while negating the government chosen by the people themselves. We advise the U.S. to negotiate with dealers in peasant markets it claims they are to its liking or with representatives of \"the organization of north Korean defectors\" on its payroll if it wishes to hold talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is now persistently pursuing its hostile policy toward the DPRK, toeing the U.S line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Moreover, it fabricated the issue of false remains over the \"abduction issue\" that had already been settled in a bid to  nullify the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration and stop any process to normalize diplomatic relations with the DPRK. How can we sit at the negotiating table with such a party? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the trend of the new century and wish of humankind to go in for peace, co-existence and prosperity irrespective of differing ideology, system and religious belief.\r\n It is by no means fortuitous that the world people raise their voices cursing and censuring the Bush administration as a group pursuing tyranny prompted by its extreme misanthropy, swimming against such trend of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We have shown utmost magnanimity and patience for the past four years since the first Bush administration swore in. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We can not spend another four years as we did in the past four years and there is no need for us to repeat what we did in those years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK Foreign Ministry clarifies as following to cope with the grave situation created by the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n First. We have wanted the six-party talks but we are compelled to suspend our participation in the talks for an indefinite period till we have recognized that there is justification for us to attend the talks and there are ample conditions and atmosphere to expect positive results from the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present deadlock of the six-party talks is attributable to the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no justification for us to participate in the six-party talks again given that the Bush administration termed the DPRK, a dialogue partner, an \"outpost of tyranny\", putting into the shade the hostile policy, and totally negated it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Second. The U.S. disclosed its attempt to topple the political system in the DPRK at any cost, threatening it with a nuclear stick. This compels us to take a measure to bolster its nuclear weapons arsenal in order to protect the ideology, system, freedom and democracy chosen by its people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the spirit of the Korean people true to the Songun politics to respond to good faith and the use of force in kind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We had already taken the resolute action of pulling out of the NPT and have manufactured nukes for self-defence to cope with the Bush administration's evermore undisguised policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its nuclear weapons will remain nuclear deterrent for self-defence under any circumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present reality proves that only powerful strength can protect justice and truth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. evermore reckless moves and attempt to attack the DPRK only reinforce its pride of having already consolidated the single-minded unity of the army and people and increased the capability for self-defence under the uplifted banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's principled stand to solve the issue through dialogue and negotiations and its ultimate goal to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula remain unchanged.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The forcible drafting and abduction of Koreans and the crime related to the sexual slavery committed by Japan in the past are the most hideous human rights abuses and the criminal must be punished by international law whoever he might be. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article brings to light the nasty trick and mean attempt of Japan to use the abduction issue as a shield to avoid the redemption of its past, means to isolate the DPRK internationally and realize its political strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean army and people are hating and cursing the crafty and wicked Japanese reactionaries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We have too many things to settle accounts with Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year will mark the centenary anniversary of the disgraceful \"Ulsa Five-point Treaty\" which was concluded by the Japanese imperialists' gangster-like act of aggression, the 95th year since the \"Korea-Japan Annex Treaty\" was signed and the 60th year since the defeat of the Japanese imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Time has come for the army and people of the DPRK to force Japan to pay for its past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should not miss this historical chance and fully repent of its criminal past and redeem it.

To cite an example, AA artillery positions cover at least 20,600 phyong in the area of the Changdok Palace registered as the world's cultural heritage by UNESCO. The military installations that occupy historic sites number eight in the area north of Kyonggi Province and five in the area of Seoul.\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun today says in a signed commentary: The U.S. is building its military bases even in the areas where there are tombs of forefathers, not content with desecrating the soul of the nation and looting precious historical cultural relics in south Korea. This is a hideous crime against the Korean nation and its history as it debases its dignity and tarnishes its history spanning 5,000 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialist aggression forces in south Korea chose areas with historical cultural remains as sites for their military bases and installations in a bid to dampen the spirit of the Korean nation, do away with the 5, 000 year-long history of the nation and enslave the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Throughout history foreign aggressors have employed a trite method of setting up all sorts of ruling bodies and military installations in the areas of historic remains under their occupation in a bid to distort the history of relevant nations and quell the spirit of national independence and resistance. The U.S. imperialists infiltrated a pirate ship into Korea to exhume the tomb of Prince Nam Yon more than a century ago. Since their of occupation of south Korea in place of the Japanese imperialists the U.S. imperialists have ruthlessly trampled underfoot a lot of areas of historical cultural remains. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The sovereignty in south Korea has been encroached upon for 100 years under the occupation of foreign forces and the areas of precious historical cultural remains of the nation are destroyed by the aggressor forces.
