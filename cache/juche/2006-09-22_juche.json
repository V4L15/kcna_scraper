            "content": "Japan's Moves to Grab Tok Islet Condemned \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 21 (KCNA) -- Japan even in its \"defence white paper for 2006\" absurdly claimed that Tok Islet is part of its territory, a clear indication of its evermore frantic moves to stage a comeback to Korea. This only betrays Japan's brigandish and shameless nature.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No one can vouch that there will be no military clash over Tok Islet, given the Japanese reactionaries' evermore undisguised moves to grab the islet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind their moves is a sinister intention to provide a military guarantee for the unlimited profits of the Japanese monopoly capital that has grown more inflated than ever before in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's economy has now swollen to a maximum extent. In order to get rid of this quagmire, Japan is making desperate efforts to put under its control sea lanes for grabbing new areas rich in raw materials and exploring new markets and secure more areas of resources badly needed for it. That is why the Japanese militarists have set their eyes on Tok Islet rich in such resources as natural gas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Tok Islet is also very important from a military point of view. It is the calculation of Japan that its seizure of the islet would make it possible for it to turn vast waters of the East Sea of Korea into its economic waters and zone for the military operation of its \"Self-Defence Forces\" by exercising the right to 200 mile economic waters. It is in pursuance of this aim that the crafty Japanese militarists deliberately sparked off a territorial dispute, absurdly asserting that the islet is part of their territory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their persistent claim to Tok Islet is also intended to launch the reinvasion of Korea under the pretext of retaking \"its land.\" Their moves to grab the islet are nothing but a prelude to staging a comeback to Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's assertion that the islet is part of its territory can never be justified. The more vociferously Japan advocates its claim to the islet, the more saliently it will reveal its ambition to grab other's land and its wicked scheme to reinvade Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialist war maniacs such as Tojo met miserable ends in the past while frantically waging the war of continental aggression in a bid to realize their \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries would be well advised to face up to history and the reality and awake from their foolish day dream of grabbing Tok Islet and staging a comeback to Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The story about a written warranty for a good citizen produced during the anti-Japanese armed struggle is an epitome showing her noble humanities.\r\n President Kim Il Sung dispatched her to Taoquanli in Changbai County in the northeastern area of China in March Juche 26 (1937), where she conducted underground activities.\r\n When underground organizations and comrades stood on the brink of exposure, she risked herself to protect them and was arrested by the enemy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The village head who was a member of the underground organization had \"friendship\" with the chief of the police station. He conducted negotiations with the chief of the police station over her release. The police station chief promised that he would recognize her as a \"good citizen\" and release her, if the village head prepared a warranty for a good citizen signed by 500 people. He was demanding this document in order to provide documentary evidence for shirking his responsibility, if his superior called the matter into account at a later date. It was common sense that there could not have been such a large number of secret organization members in Taoquanli with only some 200 households. And it was a common, popular mentality not to seal rashly with one's thumb a document testifying that a \"disturbing element\", spotted as a \"traitor\" or \"communist bandit\", was in fact a \"good citizen\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But so many villagers placed without hesitation their stamps on the document for her, who regarded herself as not an educator of people but a true servant and daughter of people. They were deeply moved by her human love shown by her for the villagers. She helped them in their household chores. One day a landlord banished his young kitchen maid, suffering from typhoid, into a hut on the mountain. Nobody dared to take care of that pitiable girl. On hearing this news, Kim Jong Suk went to the hut without hesitation and nursed her, sharing bed and meals with her. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the village head prepared such a written warranty and put it on the chief's desk, the chief's eyes almost popped out in astonishment and had no choice but to keep his promise to release her. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The warranty, signed by 500 seals and thumbs, was indeed a miracle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will always remember the devotion and love shown by Kim Jong Suk for the fatherland and the people.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The essential character of the method lies in the fact that one should always go into people and solve all the problems in reliance upon their strength and wisdom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President's historical on-the-spot guidance to the Kangson Steel Works(at that time) on December 28, Juche 45(1956) was typical of the embodiment of such method. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation of the country was very difficult at that time when it was going to buckle down to the first year task of the vast Five-Year Plan in the teeth of the worsening subversive activities of reactionaries at home and abroad after the Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That day the President called a consultative meeting of leading officials and model workers in the works at which he brought the difficult situation of the country, the requirement of the revolution and the intention of the Party home to workers there and called for producing 10,000 tons of steel more than the plan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n True to his instruction, the working class of the works turned out 120,000 tons of steel with a 60,000-ton-capacity blooming mill shattering all the antiquated ideas such as passivism and mysticism about technology and displaying the revolutionary zeal and creative ingenuity. Their efforts initiated the Chollima work-team movement which swept all over the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President, with the Juche-based work method, closely rallied the popular masses around the Party and gave rise to their revolutionary enthusiasm and creative ingenuity at each period and each stage of the revolutionary development, thus dynamically propelling the revolution and construction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
