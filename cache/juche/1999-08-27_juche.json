And members of the south headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification (Pomminryon), the National Alliance for Democracy and Reunification and the South Korean Confederation of Trade Unions who are being persecuted are all pro-reunification patriots praised by all the fellow countrymen for their contributions to the successful holding of the largest-ever August 15 Grand Pan-National Reunification Festival in which Koreans in the north, south and overseas took part for the reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All the Buddhists in the northern half of the country vehemently denounce the \"people\"-veiled rulers' fascist suppression of Jin Kwan and other participants in the August 15 Grand Pan-National Reunification Festival as a frontal challenge to the unanimous aspirations and desire of the entire nation for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The present \"people\"-veiled rulers of South Korea must properly judge the aspirations of the fellow countrymen for reunification, put an immediate end to the persecution of pro-reunification patriotic forces, release all the detainees including Jin Kwan and completely abolish the harmful \"National Security Law.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We believe that all the Buddhists in South Korea would launch more powerful actions to frustrate anti-reunification moves of the \"people\"-veiled rulers and to make the \"National Security Law\" abolished, true to the mission of Buddhists to promote the reunification of the country and the great unity of the nation. \r\n\r\n"

Korea-Russia \"cooperation\" in military field\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, August 27 (KCNA) -- The South Korean authorities are going to invite a high-ranking official of the Russian Defense Ministry to South Korea early in September to discuss such matters as \"military cooperation and exchange,\" provision of various kinds of war equipment and military technical facilities and \"missile launch\" of the DPRK, a foreign news report said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This move cannot but heighten our vigilance as it is a very serious matter, which will further aggravate the military confrontation in the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As known to everyone, the South Korean authorities are now massively introducing missiles and other up-to-date weapons from the United States while persistently seeking to import sophisticated lethal equipment from Israel and other countries in a bid to have a military edge on the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Meanwhile, the U.S.-Japan-South Korea military nexus has been strengthened through anti-DPRK war exercises including large-scale U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises and South Korea-Japan joint naval drill. As a result, a touch-and-go situation is prevailing in the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is against this backdrop that they are now scheming to equip their forces with weapons from Russia and seek cooperation from it over the issue of the north's \"missile launch.\" The developments glaringly show to what extent the desperate war moves of the present South Korean rulers have gone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The massive arms buildup of the South Korean warhawks is a criminal move to provoke a war against the north and militarily contain it, the move that should be condemned by all the fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What cannot be overlooked is that some countries get embroiled in such reckless war moves and cooperate with the South Korean authorities without principle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Despite our repeated warnings, they are selling various types of war equipment including modern submarines and missiles and military technical facilities to South Korea for a petty amount of money and interfering in our matter of satellite launch. This is as good as an act of exacerbating the tense situation on the Korean peninsula and undisguisedly joining the South Korean warhawks in war moves against the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   For those responsible for Korea's division to sell weapons to one of its two parts, that is to the South Korean authorities who seek permanent division and \"unification through absorption\" cannot be construed otherwise than an anti-DPRK deed of instigating the South Korean authorities to ignite a war against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The moves of the South Korean authorities, who are stepping up war preparations while aggravating the north-south confrontation, and those who are cooperating with them can never be justified but will certainly meet deserved retaliation. \r\n\r\n"
