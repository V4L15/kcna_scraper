            "content": "U.S. urged to properly understand DPRK's principled stand towards U.S. proposal\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 9 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary denounces the United States for throwing hurdles in the way of the resumption of the DPRK-U.S. dialogue while persistently insisting on the Washington-proposed unilateral, conditional and unacceptable agenda items for the last one month since it proposed the resumption.\r\n On June 19 the U.S. department of state hinted that it \"has no intention to change agenda items for the dialogue with the DPRK\" and next day U.S. secretary of state Powell said that it would be \"difficult to go ahead with a dialogue with the DPRK\" without discussing the \"issue of deployed conventional military forces\" of the DPRK. He pulled up the DPRK over its \"missile issue\" during his mideast tour. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. assistant secretary of state Kelly came out with a five-point \"principle governing the policy towards North Korea\" to the effect that any \"agreement\" with the DPRK requires \"verification.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. raised again the non-existent \"issue of kidnapping of Japanese\" by the DPRK. And it is kicking off a war racket, working hard to introduce new type of military equipment to South Korea and deploy up-to-date aegis warships in the East Sea of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is aimed to delay the resumption of the dialogue by hurting the DPRK's feelings and thus lead the dialogue and negotiations to collapse and shift the responsibility for it onto the DPRK, the commentary notes, and says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has never allowed \"verification\" and \"inspection\" as its national defence industry and military forces are vital to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It will neither permit \"verification\" and \"inspection\" nor accept the demand for the reduction of armed forces in the future, too, but further strengthen them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States should properly understand the DPRK's principled stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"resumption of dialogue\" is not a U.S. present to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even if the DPRK-U.S. dialogue is not resumed, the DPRK will have nothing to be afraid of or to lose. The DPRK has no intention to respond to the U.S. \"proposal for the resumption of dialogue\" while allowing its dignity to be impaired and its sovereignty to be infringed upon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. has a true will to have a dialogue with the DPRK it should adopt, above all, practical issues related to the implementation of the agreed points of the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework and the DPRK-U.S. joint communique as agenda items for negotiations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of compensating for the loss of electricity caused by the delay in the U.S. provision of light water reactors to the DPRK should be adopted as the primary agenda item for negotiations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK clarifies its principled stand once again that the DPRK-U.S. negotiations should take up, first of all, the U.S. drop of its hostile policy towards the DPRK and the pressing issue of compensating for the loss of electricity. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
