Missing in the plan are issues of setting up a special zone for peace and cooperation in the West Sea, replacing the armistice system with a peace mechanism, etc. which were contained in the first plan worked out during the Roh Moo Hyun regime in 2007.

The \"yusin\" dictator, who earned an ill-fame as a fascist hangman without an equal, left no means untried to dampen the desire of the people and seek long-term office.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As soon as she came to power, the present chief executive copied the ruling methods of the \"yusin\" dictator, the article notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet conservative group employed sleight of hand to get rid of the crisis caused by the case of the Intelligence Service's (IS) interference in the \"presidential\" election, while crying out for \"stop to partisan strife\" and \"people's living.\" At the same time, it passed a motion calling for judgment aimed to disorganize the Unified Progressive Party through the puppet State Council meeting under the pretext of \"preserving the nature.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The authorities are also shouting themselves hoarse for \"preserving the basic order of liberal democracy.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The case of the  IS's interference in the election, the fabrication of the attempted rebellion and the resultant frantic racket for \"eliminating the forces following the north\" are sparking off bitter rebuff and protest among south Koreans from all walks of life. These are just a few typical examples proving that south Korean society has returned to the erstwhile \"yusin\" dictatorial system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The history of shuddering fascist dictatorship should never be allowed to repeat itself in south Korea.

This is sophism that can never work on others.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet regime argues that \"the north must be prevented from using nukes\".

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun revela esencia reaccionaria de la \"doctrina de mantenimiento de principios\"\r\n Pyongyang, 14 de noviembre (ACNC) -- El diario Rodong Sinmun publico hoy el articulo de un comentarista que revela el contenido detallado y la esencia de la \"doctrina de mantenimiento de principios\", sofisma anti-reunificacion que presentan las autoridades surcoreanas como su politica sobre el Norte (de Corea).\n\t\t\t\t\t El articulo va como sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La \"doctrina de mantenimiento de principios\" de las autoridades surcoreanas es la teoria anti-reunificacion que niega totalmente la Declaracion Conjunta N-S del 15 de Junio y pretende volver a llevar las relaciones intercoreanas a la epoca de confrontacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Diciendo que las relaciones intercoreanas de hasta ahora fueron las \"anormales\" en que el Sur (de Corea) se dejaba llevar por el Norte siendo sometido y humillado por este, la banda titere surcoreana presenta como \"principio\" hacerlas \"normales\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Sin dudas, las \"relaciones anormales\", mencionadas por ellos, significan los vinculos N-S que vinieron desarrollandose positivamente despues del 15 de Junio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hoy dia, las relaciones intercoreanas resultaron destruidas y cortadas debido a la cruel campana de confrontacion de la camarilla surcoreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ocurrio por primera vez despues de la pasada guerra coreana el incidente de intercambio de fuego entre el Norte y el Sur y se ven amenazadas al extremo la paz y la seguridad de la Peninsula Coreana al llegar al climax la crisis de guerra nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El anuncio de la transicion de la \"anormalidad\" a la \"normalidad\" no pasa de ser un sofisma anti-reunificacion y anacronico para darle marcha atras a la era de reunificacion del 15 de Junio al tiempo de enfrentamiento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La susodicha \"doctrina\" es la criminal teoria de confrontacion de regimenes que niega la tendencia a la reunificacion de las relaciones intercoreanas y persigue la division y el enfrentamiento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Las relaciones Norte-Sur no son las entre un pais y el otro sino las especiales que se forman provisionalmente en el proceso de aspirar a la reintegracion territorial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En ese contexto, el Norte y el Sur acordaron en conjunto hace mucho tiempo el caracter de relaciones intercoreanas y los principios, reglamentos y disciplinas convenientes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Particularmente, las declaraciones intercoreanas aclaran totalmente los principios y los remedios para lograr el desarrollo de relaciones Norte-Sur, la reunificacion pacifica y la prosperidad comun de la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Entre el Norte y el Sur de Corea, no puede haber ningun principio unilateral ni norma internacional aparte de la pauta, principios y normativa, acordados en conjunto por ambas partes coreanas, ni mucho menos la concepcion de las \"relaciones de Estados normales\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La teoria de \"relaciones de Estados normales segun la pauta internacional\" de la banda titere es la nueva version de la criminal doctrina de \"dos Coreas\" preconizada por el dictador de \"Yusin\" (renovacion).\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La \"doctrina de mantenimiento de principios\" destruye la paz de la Peninsula Coreana, agrava la tension y persigue la guerra de agresion al Norte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Los titeres surcoreanos tratan de provocar la nueva guerra hablando de la \"firme disposicion de seguridad\", \"solida alianza Sudcorea-EE.UU.\" y \"fuerte disuasivo anti-Norte\", por una parte, y por la otra, presenta la \"intransigencia\" y la \"presion\" como otro \"principio sobre el Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Las expresiones como \"seguridad\" y \"disuasivo al Norte\" son el pronombre de la confrontacion militar y la campana de guerra y un disfraz para encubrir su mala intencion agresiva.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recurriendo a las maniobras de guerra de agresion al Norte, ellos suelen hablar de la \"amenaza nuclear\" y la \"provocacion\" de alguien en busca del pretexto de agresion, lo cual es una absurdidad que no puede persuadir a nadie.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Parte de la logica de bandido el hecho de que ellos cuestionan el justo disuasivo nuclear de la parte connacional defendiendo las armas nucleares de caracter agresivo del imperio yanqui y sus tentativas de guerra nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lo que hizo el actual \"poder\" desde su aparicion fue llevar a la ruptura las relaciones intercoreanas y agravar el peligro de guerra con las maquinaciones de guerra de agresion al Norte, la conspiracion anti-RPDC y la represion contra las fuerzas pro-reunificacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Los hechos muestran fehacientemente que la \"doctrina de mantenimiento de principios\" es la teoria proyanqui y servil a grandes potencias, la  de confrontacion conflictiva y de guerra de agresion al Norte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Es indudable que las relaciones intercoreanas nunca se mejoraran mientras que la banda titere surcoreana siga ateniendose a la \"doctrina\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Los Tres Principios de la Reunificacion de la Patria y el ideal de \"Entre nosotros, los connacionales\" son el unico principio conjunto a tomar firmemente por ambas partes coreanas."
