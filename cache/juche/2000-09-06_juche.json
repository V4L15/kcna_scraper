            "content": "Spokesman for President of DPRK SPA interviewed in Frankfurt \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 6 (KCNA) -- Kim Yong Nam, President of the presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly of the DPRK, and his party which had left Pyongyang to attend the UN Millennium Summit slated in New York had no alternative but to return home after canceling their plan to participate in it due to the unreasonable obstructions on the part of the United States. In this connection the spokesman for the President of the SPA presidium of the DPRK had a press conference with mediapersons of various  countries of the world in Frankfurt, Germany, on September 5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Present at the press conference were suite members of the President of the SPA presidium, and reporters of leading media of Germany, the U.S., Britain, Japan and other countries and South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Choe Su Hon, vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs who is the spokesman for the President, released a statement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The President of the spa presidium of the DPRK and his party which had been on transit in  Frankfurt airport to attend the UN Millennium Summit were compelled to return home after canceling their plan to participate in it due to the unreasonable obstructions on the part of the U.S. side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At the time the President and his entourage were about to board the already booked American Airliner \"AA 176\" after going through all transit formalities as per the publicly recognized regulation in Frankfurt airport on Sept. 4 those who style themselves U.S. Air Security Agents showed up there and treated them like criminals. They opened  the  luggage and hand luggage of all the suite members and pressurized them to undress and put off their shoes. They went the length of searching even such private regions of their bodies that baffle description. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They attempted to do such a rude thing against the President, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We lodged a strong protest with them against this after flatly rejecting such inspection on the spot and demanded they immediately report this to Washington. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The American Air Security Agents reappeared after their brief disappearance and said what they did was instructed by their superior. And they provocatively charged that anyone from North Korea and seven other countries labeled \"rogue states\" are unconditionally subject to the above said strict inspection, otherwise no one is allowed to board the plane. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They cancelled our seats in the plane without any prior agreement with us. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   This rude provocation of the United States to the President of the spa presidium who represents the DPRK, a dignified UN member, is a grave infringement upon the sovereignty of an independent state, an intolerable abuse and insult to human rights and a blatant challenge to the exercise of rights by the member countries according to the UN Charter and the United Nations and the summit organized by it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is, at the same time, a high-handed act of ignoring the international law and international usage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The incident cannot be construed otherwise than a deliberate and premeditated act conducted under a pre-arranged script of the U.S. administration.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. blocking of the entry of the President and his entourage into the U.S. even after issuing entry visas to them and inviting them even to a banquet to be hosted by President Clinton glaringly shows the sinister and cunning double-dealing trick of the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All this goes to prove that the U.S. is a typical state of rogues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We bitterly condemn this unreasonable act on the part of the U.S. as a flagrant violation and challenge to the UN Millennium Summit, the first of its kind in the history of the united nations, and the UN Charter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. side should formally apologize for the serious act committed against the President of the spa presidium and will have to own full responsibility for all the ensuing consequences. \r\n\r\n"

Officials of its defence agency are racking their brains to assert that the \"NMD\" system of the U.S. and the \"Theatre Missile Defence\" system (TMD) now being jointly developed by Japan and the U.S. are different from each other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan's contention is that the development of the \"TMD\" system should be continued regardless of the U.S. decision. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What should not be overlooked is that Japan is again citing a \"missile threat\" from the DPRK to justify its assertion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This irrefutably proves that Japan seeks to develop and round off the \"TMD\" system at any cost under the pretext of this \"threat\" from the DPRK to hold military supremacy in East Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The greatest destabilizing military factor in East Asia is not a \"threat\" from anyone, but the moves to develop the \"TMD\" system jointly stepped up by Japan and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the U.S. and Japan go ahead with the development of the \"TMD\" system, this will prompt other Asian countries to develop new types of weapons capable of destroying it or rapidly increase their strike capabilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This means a new arms race in East Asia and it will entail unimaginably serious disasters. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Defending independence against imperialism \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, September 6 (KCNA) -- It is an important task for the advance and victory of the people's cause of independence to wage an anti-imperialist struggle, says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In order to realize the common desire of humankind to live in a free and peaceful world, it is imperative to struggle for defending  independence against imperialism, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   By nature imperialism is opposed to independence. Its mode of existence is to  infringe upon the sovereignty of the popular masses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The imperialists work hard to preserve their old order of domination and rule by force of arms and bring the world under their control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They seek to establish political domination over the anti-imperialist independent countries and those countries which do not curry favour with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They are pushing forward the development of new types of nuclear weapons and the arms race under the signboards of \"peace\" and \"disarmament.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What is important in the anti-imperialist struggle is to maintain a principled stand on imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Unity is a decisive guarantee for the victory in the struggle for independence against imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The driving force in the struggle for independence in each country is its people and all the anti-imperialist independent forces are the engine of the struggle for global independence against imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All the anti-imperialist independent forces in the world can surely destroy imperialism and build a new independent world if they unite close under the banner of the struggle for independence against imperialism irrespective of ideology, system and religious belief to shatter all the imperialist moves for division and alienation.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
