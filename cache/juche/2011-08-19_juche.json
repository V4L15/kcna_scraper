            "content": "China-U.S. Distrust Remains Unchanged: Russian Newspaper\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMoscow, August 18 (KCNA) -- The Russian newspaper Nezabisimaya Gazetta July 28 carried an article titled \"China-U.S. Military Exchange Has Long Way to Go to Reach Confidence Building\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSome time ago, China warned that U.S. reconnaissance flights near the country were hurting confidence between the two countries and hampering the bilateral military ties and urged the U.S. to respect the country's sovereignty and security interests, the article said, adding: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBut Mike Mullen, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated such flights would continue, an apparent sign of turning down Beijing's demand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTwo weeks ago, Mullen visited China and had talks with Chen Bingde, chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. At that time he said the contact with China's top military officials inspired him with hope. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBack home, however, he said the U.S. would never give up its commitments to its allies and partners.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnalysts are of the view that his remark has a clear meaning. At the talks Chen Bingde told Mullen that not only the Obama Administration's promise to sell 6.4 billion dollars worth of weapons to Taiwan but the reconnaissance flights and approach of vessels near China were impeding confidence building. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe fact goes to prove that distrust between the two countries remains unchanged with no side willing to make a concession.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNow the U.S. is afraid that the Chinese army has modernized itself rapidly. U.S. officials believe that China is getting ready to challenge the U.S. in the west Pacific that has been under control of the U.S. Seventh Fleet for more than half a century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey are citing as proof the launch of China's first aircraft carrier, test of stealth bomber and modern submarines and development of 1 000-mile-range missile capable of striking U.S. carriers."

And the four nations will stage annual joint military exercises from 2013 in the framework of the NATO's existing rapid reaction force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFrom the general point of view, it is the conclusion of Western diplomats that the decision to form an independent military organization is a reaction of east European nations to the new development observed by the European Union and NATO. In other words, the development means that Germany is seeking a special role as the EU leader and trying to expand cooperation with Russia, while the U.S. capacity of taking part in overseas military operations is being decreased.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAccording to sources, it is under discussion to invite Ukraine to join the combat unit.
