It appeared as land sank almost in the same period when the lithosphere diastrophism took place. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The coast line of the sea is extremely indented in comparison with the east coast line. so there are more than 2,500 islands and islets, gulfs, peninsulas and capes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The average depth of the west sea is 39 meters and the deepest spot is 118 meters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are over 220 species of fishes in the sea. It has inexhaustible sea plant resources such as different kinds of bivalvia, lavar, seaweed and kelp. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The sea is characterized by shallow water and high and low tide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is unfavorable for sailing but provides good conditions for constructing tidal power stations, building salterns and tideland reclamation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
