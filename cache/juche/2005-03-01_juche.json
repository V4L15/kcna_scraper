            "content": "DPRK Foreign Ministry's Statement Supported in Switzerland \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 28 (KCNA) -- The Swiss Committee for Supporting Korea's Reunification made public a statement on Feb.12 in support of the Feb.10 statement of the DPRK Foreign Ministry.\r\n Recalling the open outburst of Bush that the ultimate goal of the U.S. administration was to put an end to someone's \"tyrannical policy\" and it would use arms for this, if necessary, the statement said: The U.S. warmaniacs must clearly know that it is a demand never to be gratified to urge the dialogue partner to come back to the negotiating   table, while trying to destroy the latter's political system. \r\n It went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a legitimate measure that the DPRK decided to suspend its participation in the six-party talks for an indefinite period in face of the U.S. administration's plot for a war and \"change of power.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Meanwhile, Japan, following the U.S. lead, has invented the problem of false remains over the already settled \"abduction issue\" to build up world opinion and put fresh muscles into its aggressive and hostile policy toward the DPRK in a bid to reduce the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration adopted in 2002 to a scrap of paper. Can the DPRK sit at the negotiating table with such one? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is due to the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK that the six-party talks have come to a deadlock. Unquestionably justifiable is the decision of the DPRK to beef up its nuclear arsenal for self-defense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The measure taken by the DPRK is the most correct answer to the impudent and arrogant threat and abusive language of the U.S., the most tyrannical and bellicose in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has the legitimate and independent right to possess nuclear weapons to cope with the deployment of a host of nuclear weapons by the U.S. imperialist aggression forces in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no need for anyone to feel misgivings over the DPRK's nuclear weapons which are for self-defense. The \"misgivings\" as to the DPRK over which the imperialists and their followers are raising outcries are their brainchild and crafty artifice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will prevent a war and defend peace by the recent measure.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This act cannot be construed otherwise than a folly which can be perpetrated only by such political imbeciles who go reckless, unaware of even the basic spirit of the declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already known, the basic spirit of the declaration is that Japan will redress its past and, on this basis, the two countries settle the pending issues between them and normalize their relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has sincerely fulfilled its commitments stipulated in the declaration with a view to making a substantial contribution to the genuine improvement of the bilateral relations and peace and security in the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries, however, have persistently raised the \"issue of abduction\" though it had already been settled, deliberately creating difficulties and complexities in the way of improving the relations.

At the meeting, he set forth a proposal of moving the main force of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army to border areas and the Mt. Paektu area and gradually extending the theatre of the struggle into the homeland. He also put forward new ways to bring a great upsurge to the whole Korean revolution centered on the anti-Japanese armed struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Nanhutou Meeting, which indicated the way for the Korean people to accomplish the historic cause of national liberation at an early date by themselves, marked a turning-point of history, which brought about a new upswing in the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since then, the Korean revolution has emerged victorious on the basis of the Juche-oriented stand and a powerful socialist country of Juche, independent, self-supporting and self-reliant in national defence, has been built in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will invariably advance, holding aloft the banner of Juche under the Songun revolutionary leadership of Kim Jong Il.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
