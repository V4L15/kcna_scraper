The U.S. is mulling steadily introducing ultra-modern war hardware into it. This is a very dangerous move to ignite a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. together with the south Korean puppet forces is busy staging the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle war maneuvers against the DPRK with nuclear submarines, B-52, B-2A and other strategic weapons involved, openly revealing its attempt to mount a nuclear attack on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, it is prodding the puppet warmongers into military provocations, vociferating about the \"plan for jointly countering the provocation of a local war\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reinforcement of the U.S. forces in south Korea is part of such moves for a war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pursuant to its pivot-to-Asia-Pacific strategy, the U.S. is set to use south Korea as an outpost for holding military hegemony in Northeast Asia and carrying out its strategy for \"world hegemony.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is kicking up a frantic racket for \"sanctions\" and intensifying war exercises against the DPRK over its legitimate satellite launch and nuclear test for self-defence, deliberately escalating the tension on the Korean Peninsula. This is aimed to secure a pretext for perpetuating the U.S. forces' presence in south Korea and provoking a war of aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Massive reinforcement of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces in south Korea will only result in straining the regional situation, escalating arms race and increasing the danger of war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This troop reinforcement should never be allowed and the public at home and abroad should keep vigilance against it and bitterly denounce it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. forces should should be withdrawn from south Korea at once.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will resolutely foil any aggression move of the U.S. and deal military retaliatory blows at the U.S. military bases and aggression forces in south Korea before anything else."

It was an all-out confrontation in political, military and diplomatic fields.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. made the story of \"collapse of social system\" in the DPRK an established fact and floated a story about its \"collapse\". It has desperately staged a conspiratorial farce to brand the DPRK as \"a proliferater of nuclear weapons and WMDs\", totally negating the stand of the DPRK's government to exercise the right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the new century it listed the DPRK as an \"axis of evil\" and a \"target of preemptive nuclear attack\" after suspending all dialogues and negotiations with the DPRK. It has escalated its moves for confrontation with the DPRK, describing it as \"an advanced base of tyranny \" and \"a target to be totally destroyed\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. also built international public opinion to shift the blame for the deadlocked six-party talks onto the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has been busy with a propaganda campaign to slander the ideology of the DPRK and its socialist system centered on the popular masses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It stooped to any infamy to fabricate the \"north Korean human rights act,\" distorting the human rights situation in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The U.S. spread fictions about \"drug trafficking\", \"counterfeit notes\", \"persecution of religion\", \"training of computer hackers\", \"arms smuggling\" in a bid to isolate the DPRK, stunning the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has persisted in its ideological and cultural poisoning and psychological warfare.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A group for \"bringing down statues\" was organized under the U.S. supervision.

presento una nueva linea estrategica de desarrollar paralelamente la construccion economica y las fuerzas armadas nucleares de acuerdo con las exigencias legitimas de la situacion actual y la revolucion coreana en desarrollo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta linea es la brillante continuacion, profundizacion y desarrollo a una nueva etapa alta de la original linea sobre el desarrollo paralelo de la construccion economica y la defensa nacional, presentada y ejecutada cabalmente por los Grandes Generalisimos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl foro apunto que esta nueva linea del PTC no es una contramedida temporal para hacer frente a la situacion en cambio repentino sino es la linea estrategica a ser mantenida para defender los maximos intereses de la revolucion coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas armas nucleares de la Corea del Songun no son una mercancia a ser cambiada con el dolar norteamericano ni un regateo politico o economico a discutirse en la mesa del dialogo con quienes intentan el desarme de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas fuerzas armadas nucleares de la RPDC devienen la vida de la nacion nunca renunciable ni cambiable con dinero, mientras existen en nuestro planeta el imperialismo y la amenaza nuclear, y patrimonio nacional de la Corea reunificada. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSolo cuando mantengamos con firmeza el escudo nuclear de autodefensa, podemos defender con firmeza nuestra ideologia, nuestro regimen y todas las riquezas socialistas conquistadas a precio de la sangre, el derecho a la existencia, la larga historia y la brillante cultura de la nacion, frustrando la ambicion del imperialismo norteamericano de apoderarse militarmente de la Peninsula Coreana y convertir al pueblo coreano en el esclavo de version moderna. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando se materialice cabalmente la nueva linea de paralelo, presentada por el PTC, la RPDC se convertira en la gran potencia politica, la militar y la economica socialista y en el pais civilizado que orienta la epoca de la independencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl foro planteo las tareas y remedios que se presentan en la materializacion de la linea para desarrollar paralelamente la construccion economica y las fuerzas armadas nucleares. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos funcionarios, los militantes del partido y otros trabajadores deben desplegar con la firme fe en el triunfo y la decision extraordinaria la campana ofensiva audaz y la batalla decisiva de todo el pueblo para avivar las llamas de milagros e innovaciones en todos los sectores de la economia nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDeben mejorar decisivamente los dominios avanzados de la economia nacional, o sea, las industrias basicas, para aumentar al maximo la produccion, concentrar las fuerzas en la agricultura y la industria ligera, dominios mas importantes de la construccion de la potencia economica para estabilizar y mejorar lo mas pronto posible la vida del pueblo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs preciso impulsar con vigor el desarrollo de la industria de energia nuclear independiente y de reactor para contribuir activamente a resolver el problema de tensa electricidad del pais. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDeben desarrollar y lanzar mucho mas satelites mas sofisticados dando acicate al adelanto de ciencia y tecnologia del cosmos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay

hasta que se realice la desnuclearizacion del mundo entero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Ejercito Popular de Corea debe perfeccionar los metodos y operaciones de combate, en rumbo a elevar el papel medular de las fuerzas armadas nucleares en todos los aspectos del disuasivo de guerra y la estrategia de cumplimiento de guerra, y completar la disposicion ordinaria de combate de las fuerzas armadas nucleares. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC, siendo responsable pais con armas nucleares, hara ingentes esfuerzos por prevenir la proliferacion nuclear, defender la paz y seguridad de Asia y el resto del mundo y realizar la desnuclearizacion del mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos organos de seguridad estatal, los judiciales y fiscales, los de seguridad del pueblo y el Ejercito de Seguridad Interior del Pueblo de Corea deben defender a riesgo de la vida el partido, el regimen y el pueblo frustrando tajantemente los viles complots de los reaccionarios imperialistas y los enemigos clasistas y asegurar en lo militar y legal la linea de paralelo del PTC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la lucha por materializar esta linea, las organizaciones del partido y las entidades de masas y los organos del poder deben elevar por todos los medios su funcion combativa y papel. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl conclave encargo al Presidium de la Asamblea Popular Suprema y al Consejo de Ministros tomar las medidas legales, administrativas y practicas para cumplir las tareas presentadas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la sesion plenaria quedo aprobada por unanimidad la resolucion sobre la primera
