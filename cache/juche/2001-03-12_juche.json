            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on reckless remarks of U.S. official \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 12 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary accuses the United States of trying to use \"issues of kidnapping and terrorism\" as a lever to bring pressure upon the DPRK.\r\n An official of the U.S. State Department, when meeting with a visiting \"group of relatives of Japanese nationals allegedly abducted,\" said that the \"U.S. does not have any intention to remove North Korea from the list of countries it believes are sponsoring terrorism.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK can not but clarify its stand once again as the U.S. persistently keeps the DPRK on its list of terrorist-supporting countries, the commentary says, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has nothing to do with kidnapping and terrorism and it has consistently opposed all forms of these acts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is not entitled to talk about \"terrorism\" as it is a terrorist kingpin.\r\n This is clearly evidenced by its airstrikes against Yugoslavia and its recent large-scale air-raids on Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is now escalating its military drills in South Korea and Japan, while beefing up its forces there. All this is aimed at committing state terrorism against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is foolish, indeed, for the U.S. to try to achieve a sinister aim by using \"issues of kidnapping and terrorism\" as a lever to pressurize the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pressure is not a solution to any problem. If the U.S. comes out with pressure and high-handed practices against the DPRK's patience it will have no option but to strongly react to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised not to resort to dirty moves but face up to the reality and think twice over them.    \r\n\r\n"

On Sunday they released a joint statement of north and south Korean workers denouncing the Japanese reactionaries' moves to tamper with history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint statement recalled that recently the Japanese reactionaries wrongly described in history textbooks for middle schoolers the illegal and invalid \"Korea-Japan annexation\" as justifiable one and the past aggressive pacific war as a \"war for the liberation of colonies.\" And they are seeking to bury into oblivion the vicious crimes Japan committed in that war of aggression, making no mention about them, the joint statement said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It would be a foolish dream to be dreamt only by the militarist maniacs of Japan preoccupied by fever of reinvasion if they think such heinous crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists against humanity in the past can be erased through distorted history textbooks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The representatives of the north and South Korean workers urge the Japanese reactionaries to stop such moves at once and make an apology and compensation to the Korean nation for the past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north and south Korean workers will never remain a passive on-looker to the Japanese reactionaries' impudent moves to distort history and revive militarism but staunchly smash them through a continued and valiant joint struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement expressed the belief that trade unions in different countries which value justice and peace would express full solidarity with the north and south Korean workers in their struggle to check the Japanese reactionaries' moves to twist the history and make them apologize and compensate for them.    \r\n\r\n"
