            "content": "Truth about emergence of nuclear issue on Korean Peninsula disclosed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 17 (KCNA) -- The information department of the Central Committee of the National Democratic Front of South Korea (NDFSK) on Feb. 11 issued a press release disclosing the truth about the emergence of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula.\r\n The press release said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue emerged on the Korean Peninsula because the U.S. has posed a constant nuclear threat to the DPRK after massively deploying nuclear weapons in and around South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. adopted it as its policy to deploy nukes in South Korea and worked hard to turn it into a nuclear base. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Right after the ceasefire of the June 25 war, the U.S. declared South Korea as its \"vital operation theatre\" for carrying out its strategy to dominate Asia and the rest of the world and adopted it as its policy to convert South Korea into its nuclear base. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To this end, the U.S. expelled the neutral nations inspection team from South Korea on June 9, 1956 and in June 1957 it unilaterally scrapped paragraph 13 d of the armistice agreement which bans the introduction of any new type weapons from the outside of Korea. On January 29, 1958 it openly declared the deployment of nuclear weapons in units of the U.S. Forces in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the 1960s it shipped Nike Hercules, Matadon and Hawk missiles, various other types of nuclear and guided weapons and nuclear mines and in the 1970s introduced more new type nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. moves to beef up its forces in South Korea reached their zenith in the 1980s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As recorded in the minutes 111 of the 125th South Korean National Assembly held in 1985, 1,720 U.S. nuclear weapons were deployed in South Korea. They include nuclear bombs and shells, missile nuclear warheads, neutron bombs and shells, nuclear mines and backpack nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Korea has turned into the world's biggest nuclear base as more than one nuke has been deployed in every 100 square km of its territory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. basic strategy aimed to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK so called a nuclear umbrella strategy remains unchanged even in the post cold war period. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This land covering more than 100,000 square km has been converted into the biggest nuclear arsenal in the Far East as it is covered with a huge number of tactical and strategic nuclear weapons, ground and air nuclear weapons, nuclear warheads and means of nuclear delivery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the U.S. moves to convert the areas around South Korea into its nuclear base, the press release pointed out: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has deployed nearly half of its nuclear weapons totalling over 20,000 and the majority of its strategic forces in the Asia-Pacific region around the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has in the region 560 military bases and facilities, at least 1,000 aircraft including strategic bombers and over 200 warships including 6 aircraft carriers and 34 nuclear submarines and over 6,500 nuclear weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is raising a hue and cry over the groundless \"nuclear weapons development program\" of the north, watching for a chance to attack the north after massively stockpiling nuclear weapons in and around South Korea. This is just like a provocation made by a thief turning on the master with a club. \r\n According to the supplemented and perfected nuclear war scenario, the U.S. has escalated its nuclear war exercises targeted against the north as part of its nuclear blackmail against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"9-Day War Plan\", \"5-Day War Plan\" \"3-Day War Plan\" and \"120-Day War Plan\", \"Operation Plan 5027\" and \"Operation Plan 5027-98\", war scenarios widely known in the 1980s and 1990s, the recently disclosed \"Contingency Plan,\" etc. are all aimed to make nuclear strikes at the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Washington's successive rulers and warhawks have made constant nuclear blackmail against the north, pursuant to its anti-north scenario. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear blackmail and threat to the DPRK has become all the more undisguised since the emergence of the bush administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On January 29, Washington did not bother to term the north a \"lawless regime\" and an \"oppressive regime\", which is little short of its declaration of a war against the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its plan to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK has been steadily supplemented and specified through its nuclear war exercises targeted against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Typical of them were \"Team Spirit\", \"Foal Eagle\", \"Ulji Focus Lens\" and \"Reception, Staging, Onward Movement and Integration\" exercises. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had staged more than 10,000 nuclear war exercises from the end of the June 25 war till 1999, counting only those large ones and a total of nearly 20 million troops had been involved there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even according to official information, war exercises staged against the north in 2001 were almost double as compared with those in the previous year and there was marked growth in their scale. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these facts go to clearly prove that the nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula is not attributable to any nuclear threat posed by the north, a fiction, but  a direct product of the U.S. strategy to dominate the whole of Korea and its moves to pose a nuclear threat to the north, pursuant to its policy of strength for hegemony.    \r\n\r\n"
