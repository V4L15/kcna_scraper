The U.S. is about to apply the same order of invasion against the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces seek a prompt adoption of a resolution on \"additional sanctions\" in case of \"the north's additional provocation\" and try to invoke Article 42 of Chapter 7 of the UN Charter which calls for military \"sanctions\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe above-said anti-DPRK \"sanctions\" racket is reaching a very dangerous phase.

Korea \"Status of Forces Agreement\" Termed Shackling One\r\nPyongyang, February 9 (KCNA) -- The U.S.-south Korea \"Status of Forces Agreement\" (SOFA) was concluded on July 9, 1966. Since it was put into force on February 9 the next year, it has legalized the crimes committed by the GIs who were put above the law of south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\tSouth Korea can not punish GIs' crimes when they assert that they were on duty and, on the contrary, they can be ruled guiltless. So, GIs, who ran an armored car over middle schoolgirls Sin Hyo Sun and Sim Mi Son, who were passing by, to death, on June 13, 2002 were delivered the verdict of not-guilty under this agreement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMany south Koreans were ruthlessly killed or wounded in Maehyang-ri and other places due to the U.S. imperialist aggression forces' war maneuvers against the DPRK but south Korea has not yet wrested an apology from them, to say nothing of compensation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGIs killed Yun Kum I, Ho Ju Yon, Jon Ji Na, Ri Ki Sun and many other south Korean women but the murderers are stalking the world, evading capital punishment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDuring Lee Myung Bak's rule, GIs committed all sorts of crimes in all parts of south Korea as they were granted privileges by the SOFA.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDrunken GIs wielded knives against south Korean residents and knocked down innocent people with a stick in Kyonggi Province. GIs also used violence against an old couple in their 70s and robbed them of a cell phone. There are a number of such crimes as arson, drug-related crimes, sexual assaults against women and extortion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGIs in the U.S. air force base in Osan found fault with south Koreans several times for no reason and committed assaults against them after handcuffing them. But the Lee group of traitors defended the GI criminals regardless of whether they were on their duty or not.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFrom 2010 till late August last year, robbery, theft, violence, rape and other violent crimes and drug-related crimes committed by GIs numbered more than 300. But police handled those cases without physical restraint except one case. This clearly proved the submissive nature of the puppet group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll facts prove that as long as the U.S. imperialists remain in south Korea and the group of such sycophantic traitors as Lee holds the post of power, such tragic situation, in which the crimes committed by the occupation forces are painted as legal, will continue."

The Lee regime plunged the north-south ties into a deadlock by escalating confrontation with fellow countrymen and the moves for a war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe document cited facts to prove that the group committed the crime of slandering the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK, the crime of violating the north-south joint declarations, the crime of kicking up nuke and missile rackets against the DPRK, the crime of kicking up a human rights campaign against the DPRK, the crime of escalating confrontation between social systems against reunification, the crime of disrupting north-south dialogue, the crime of hindering cooperation and exchanges, the crime of suppressing the reunification movement, the crime of committing the moves for a war against the DPRK and the sycophantic and traitorous crime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAccording to it, the Lee Myung Bak group committed the hideous crime of slandering and insulting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK, greatly enraging its army and people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen the nation suffered from a big loss, the regime seriously mocked at the Koreans who shed bitter tears, stricken with big grief, and prevented in every way south Koreans and other fellow countrymen from holding memorial services and paying condolatory visits to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe regime did not hesitate to fire bullets into the target portraying the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and went so impudent as to set up slogans and literature insulting it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt totally denied the north-south declarations by labeling them as \"pro-communist documents benefiting the enemy\". It worked hard to prevent them from being implemented.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt brought to naught all the achievements made in the June 15 era of reunification while describing it as a \"lost decade\". It cracked down on those who supported the north-south declarations and pushed former two \"presidents\" who signed them into deaths.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDuring its office the Lee regime caused the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, actively defended and followed the U.S. master who went reckless in the moves for a nuclear war against the DPRK and viciously kicked up nuclear and missile rackets against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe regime has gone reckless, citing \"additional provocation\", \"stronger sanctions\" and \"international cooperation\" in reaction to the tough measures taken by the DPRK against the unreasonable UN \"resolution on sanctions\" that wantonly violated its dignity and sovereignty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee regime worked hard to enact a \"law on human rights in the north\" at the puppet National Assembly. It even published the \"north human rights white paper\" and took riff-raffs to several countries to internationalize the \"north's human rights issue\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt has gone desperate in its moves to lure and abduct DPRK citizens and commit terror, destruction and subversion in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe ill-famed case of the \"association for bringing down statues\" proves what an extent the Lee regime has gone in its smear campaign against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee regime openly talked about the \"unification under liberal democracy\" and set it as the general objective of its \"north policy\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPursuant to this, the regime openly disclosed its ambition for confrontation between social systems while talking about \"change\" and \"opening\" whenever an opportunity presented itself. It also blatantly challenged the social system in the DPRK while making such rhetoric that \"the south can not live with the north in the bright world\", \"the north should not be regarded as fellow countrymen with whom the south can live together\" and \"the north's regime should be dealt with, being separated from its citizens.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDuring the traitor's five years in office, there has never been a dialogue between the authorities of the north and the south. Only confrontation escalated instead.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee regime checked the north-south cooperation and exchanges while touting that \"economic cooperation is impossible as there is a nuke\" and \"cooperation will not help improve the south-north relations\". It persistently hampered cooperation and exchanges with south Korean enterprises and NGOs while talking about \"transparency\", etc. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee conservative regime invoked a fascist evil law and harshly suppressed pro-reunification movement organizations and figures, branding them as \"forces following the north\", \"pro-communist elements\" and \"spies\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDue to the regime's fascist suppression of the pro-reunification movement organizations, south Korea has turned into a land reminding one of the dark age under the \"yusin\" dictatorship when people were arrested at random for uttering even the word \"unification\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDuring Lee's office, Key Resolve, Foal Eagle, Ulji Freedom Guardian and other joint military exercises between the U.S. and the puppet forces were held more than 180 times. South Korean puppet forces staged thousand and hundreds of exercises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo sooner had it taken office than the Lee regime cried out for the \"theory of prioritizing the relations\" with the U.S., while harshly insulting the idea of \"By our nation itself\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe traitor connived at the past crimes of Japan and fanned up its moves to become a military giant as well as its ambition for reinvasion and territorial expansion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee regime is making last-ditch efforts to make sure that its traitorous and anti-reunification confrontation policy is carried forward to the next regime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe document said that the successive anti-reunification and confrontation maniacs all met miserable ends, warning that the Lee group will meet the more disgraceful fate for its thrice-cursed crimes against the nation."

El imperio trata de aplicar esta formula tambien contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora, EE.UU. y los titeres surcoreanos intentan aprobar la resolucion de \"sancion adicional\" inmediatamente despues de que se reportara la supuesta \"provocacion adicional del Norte (de Corea)\" e incluir en ella el articulo 42 del capitulo 7 de la Carta de la ONU referente a la \"sancion\" militar. De tolerarse eso, se desatara finalmente en la Peninsula Coreana la guerra nuclear contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC esta preparada tanto para la \"sancion\" economica como para la \"militar\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos que atentan contra la dignidad y la soberania de ella no podra evitar el implacable castigo de venganza."
