            "content": "Foreign Ministry Spokesman Demands Clarification of S. Korea's�@Nuclear Issue \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 6 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA Wednesday in connection with the snowballing suspicion of south Korea's secret nuclear experiments raised in the process of the recent inspection of them:\r\n The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) made an inspection of a clandestine laser-aided uranium enrichment experiment that had been made in south Korea in 2000 in the wake of its disclosure in September last. IAEA said it would report the results of the inspection to its board of governors slated to be held in November. The case, however, is not confined to this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was disclosed in an unbroken chain that south Korea conducted secret nuclear experiments in the 1980s and the 1990s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard the international community is becoming increasingly suspicious about whether south Korea has pursued a clandestine nuclear weapons program although it declared its willingness to stop the program in the 1970s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One or two inspections were enough to increase this suspicion. However, it is only the United States which is zealously defending south Korea, saying that there is nothing to worry about what it did as it was no more than experiments for the purpose of research, even before the results of inspection are available. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It seems that the U.S. has inward trouble or seeks an ulterior aim while defending the criminal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is that senior officials of the IAEA in charge of the case are making remarks intended to hush it up as early as possible while downplaying the gravity of the case quite contrary to the stand they had taken on the case right after its disclosure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They might be influenced by the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK can not but remain vigilant against this, given the precedent in which IAEA had applied double-dealing standards when dealing with the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula in the past, away from the principle of impartiality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The point at issue is not how many grams of nuclear substance south Korea has extracted through the experiments or what was the concentration of enrichment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The gravity of the situation lies in that south Korea has pursued in secrecy the nuclear weapons program at the tacit connivance of the U.S. and with its cooperation and has now full access to the nuclear weapons development technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This can not but be a serious challenge to the efforts to denuclearize the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the six-party talks that had been held so far the parties concerned set the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula as their goal. This meant making the whole peninsula including both the north and the south nuclear-free. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality proves that the nuclear issue of south Korea should be discussed and clarified at multi-lateral negotiations in the future if any discussion is to be made on the issue of denuclearization of the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Moreover, given the fact that south Korea is under the U.S. nuclear umbrella the DPRK is of the view that it would not be possible for it to take part in any effort for a solution to the nuclear issue with confidence unless the nuclear issue of south Korea is settled understandably. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. keeps asserting that the DPRK must scrap its nuclear program first, defending south Korea as ever, in disregard of this hard reality, this would be little short of applying its double standards concerning the nuclear issue and throwing an insurmountable roadblock in the way of solving the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present reality strongly urges the DPRK to increase its nuclear deterrent force but it is exercising its utmost patience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will closely follow up with the international community the results of the IAEA's inspection and approach toward their settlement.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea's Moves for Nuclear Weaponization under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 6 (KCNA) -- South Korea's double-dealing nature as regards the nuclear issue has been laid bare by the recent disclosure of a series of its secret nuclear experiments. It is now arousing protest and condemnation at home and abroad.\r\n In this regard, Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says in a signed commentary: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since the disclosure of their moves to develop nuclear weapons, the south Korean authorities have employed cheap tricks to shirk off the responsibility for them, asserting that those are mere scientific experiments. But they are, in fact, clandestine nuclear-related experiments including uranium enrichment aimed at extracting weapon-grade nuclear substance. This is a clear proof that the activities to develop nuclear weapons have been conducted in a systematic and premeditated manner in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today south Korea has basic index for nuclear weaponization including extraction of nuclear substance, production of nukes, possession of means of nuclear delivery and stepped-up preparations for a nuclear war and all this has been put under an integral system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality clearly shows which force is really threatening peace on the Korean peninsula and the national security with nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a well-known fact that south Korea is under the protection of the U.S. nuclear umbrella. So, its moves for nuclear weaponization indicate that it is emerging an independent force to pose a nuclear threat to the north in the Korean peninsula. Moreover, the \"prerogative of command\" over the armed forces of south Korea is in the hands of the U.S. after being deprived of its sovereignty under U.S. harsh domination. It is, therefore, as clear as a noonday that if south Korea has access to nuclear weapons, they would be used against the fellow countrymen at the instruction of the U.S. keen to stifle the DPRK. The ever-increasing danger of a nuclear war to the Korean peninsula is being posed by none other than the U.S. and south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The truth about the secret nuclear-related experiments in south Korea gravely threatening the security of the Korean peninsula with nukes should be probed completely and thoroughly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should clarify the truth about their nuclear issue before raising a hue and cry over other's nuclear issue mindful that the development of the inter-Korean relations can hardly be expected unless the truth behind their secret nuclear experiments are probed.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This was strong support and encouragement to the just cause of the Korean people who were traversing an untrodden path to build a new country under the complicated situation created just one year after the foundation of the DPRK, Rodong Sinmun notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The establishment of the diplomatic ties was an epochal event of weighty significance in developing the friendly and cooperative relations between the DPRK and China. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The flower garden of the DPRK-China friendship was provided and tended by President Kim Il Sung and Chinese leaders of the elder generation, and it has come into fuller bloom generation after generation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In recent years leader Kim Jong Il paid historic visits to China several times and the DPRK was visited by respected Jiang Zemin and Wu Bangguo. These were significant events that opened a brilliant chapter in the history of the bilateral friendship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The successful China visit by Kim Jong Il in April this year, in particular, marked a momentous occasion of historic significance in developing the bilateral relations of friendship and cooperation on a new higher level. In the run-up to the 55th anniversary of the opening of bilateral diplomatic relations, a party and government delegation and an art troupe of China visited the DPRK last September, which clearly proved that a new collective leadership of China has attached great importance to the development of the bilateral friendly relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent fourth plenary meeting of the 16th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to nominate Hu Jintao as chairman of the CPC Central Military Commission, which is indicative of deep trust of the CPC, army and people in him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are rejoiced as over their own over the fact that the national power of China is growing stronger and its international position is rising. They extend firm solidarity to the Chinese people in their efforts for socialist modernization and complete reunification of the whole country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the common desire and will of the two parties and peoples of the DPRK and China to set store by the bilateral friendship sealed in blood and consolidate and develop it generation after generation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our party and people will as ever work hard to steadily strengthen and develop the DPRK-China friendship, the daily declares. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson says that the joint efforts of the two peoples to develop the bilateral friendship will bring the flower garden of the DPRK-China friendship into fuller bloom with the passage of time.       \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
