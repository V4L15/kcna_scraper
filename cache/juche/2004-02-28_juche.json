It was the first treaty imposed upon Korea by Japan whereby it infringed upon the sovereignty of the Korean nation by military threat and blackmail in a bid to invade Korea and put it under its control and it was the first product of the collusion between the U.S. and Japanese aggressors for the invasion of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article cites facts to prove that the Japanese aggressors deeply infiltrated into the political, economic, cultural and other fields of Korea on the strength of the treaty and finally occupied it by force of arms, thus forcing the Korean people to suffer untold misfortune, pain and disasters for more than 40 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is obliged to redeem its crime-woven past and apologize for all the crimes it committed against the Korean people in the past and compensate for them. However, it is whitewashing and justifying them in a bid to realize its ambition to reinvade Korea. It is clearly evidenced by the facts that the Japanese authorities are persistently pursuing their hostile policy toward the DPRK, evading their responsibility for liquidating Japan's past, the core issue of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration, paid visits to the \"Yasukuni Shrine\" from the outset of the year, adopted a legislation to apply economic sanctions against the DPRK, pursuant to the U.S. offensive to destroy the DPRK with nukes, and made a territorial claim to Tok Islet, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The Japanese reactionaries are gravely mistaken, however. The Korean people are not what they used to be in the past. If the Japanese reactionaries launch the reinvasion of Korea, they will meet nothing but a miserable destruction.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He attached primary importance to the ideological work of the Party from the early days of his guidance over the WPK and has wisely led it for the last four decades, he added, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il formulated President Kim Il Sung's revolutionary idea as an idea guiding our times at a time when the Korean revolution entered a historic turning-point and ushered in a new era for the development of the ideological work by proclaiming the programme for modeling the whole society on the Juche idea on that basis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This occupies a most brilliant page in his history of leadership over the party ideological work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He has consistently maintained the leadership principle of putting the ideological work above all other work throughout the history of the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His wise leadership over the party ideological work finds its vivid manifestation in the fact that he set a fine example of the party political work in the Songun era and made sure that it was followed by all party organizations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The single-hearted unity of the whole Party and all the people around the leader, the only central figure, has become stronger than ever before and the ideological position of socialism in the DPRK has been remarkably consolidated. This is the greatest achievement made in the Party ideological work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The party ideological education has been steadily intensified to meet the requirements of the programme for modeling the whole society on the Juche idea. As a result, the leader, the Party, the army and the people have achieved perfect unity and cohesion and they have formed indestructible ranks of Songun revolutionary comrades armed with the spirit of devotedly defending the leader in the Songun era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The major task before the party ideological workers at present is to strengthen in every way the driving force of the Songun revolution and arouse the whole Party and army and all the people to a struggle to defend socialism and to the building of a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the party organizations and ideological workers should help all the party members and other working people repose absolute trust in Kim Jong Il and devotedly defend him and display intense loyalty and creative enthusiasm in their efforts to accomplish the noble cause of modeling the whole Party and the society on the Songun idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter called upon all the party ideological workers to creditably discharge their historic mission they have assumed before the Party, the leader, the motherland and the people, highly honored to be ideological workers in Kim Jong Il's glorious era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The speakers said that great changes have been effected in all fields of the ideological work in the course of embodying  Kim Jong Il's Juche-oriented theory of ideological work. All the achievements made in the party ideological work are a precious fruition of his judicious and tested revolutionary leadership and a clear proof of the validity and the tremendous vitality of the programme for modeling the whole society on the Juche idea, they added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They evinced their pledge to successfully implement tasks set forth in the congratulatory message sent by the WPK Central Committee, bearing deep in mind the high awareness and responsibility of taking charge of the Party's ideological front.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
