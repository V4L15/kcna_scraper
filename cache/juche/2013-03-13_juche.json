            "content": "Armed Forces Ministry Blasts S. Korean Warmongers\r\nPyongyang, March 13 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Ministry of the People's Armed Forces of the DPRK National Defence Commission issued the following statement Wednesday:\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army on March 5 stated to the world the resolute determination of the army and people of the DPRK in the face of the anti-DPRK hostile acts that have become all the more undisguised on the part of the U.S. and other hostile forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean military warmongers have not yet come to their senses and are still going reckless.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOn March 6, the puppet Joint Chiefs of Staff let the chief of its operation headquarters call for \"punishing\" even \"commanding forces\", to say nothing of \"bases\" and \"reinforcements\" by mobilizing military means if the DPRK commences actions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOn March 8, the puppet Ministry of Defense also got its spokesman to dare hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the north and bluster that \"it would remove the north's regime from the the earth in reflection of the will of mankind\" if the nuclear-armed north launches an all-out action. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDefense Minister nominee Kim Pyong Gwan, who will replace military hooligan Kim Kwan Jin, also said that they will counter the north's all-out action with \"regime change or toppling of its regime including psychological warfare\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis frenzy kicked up by the south Korean warmongers is no way irrelevant with the swish of skirt made by the owner of Chongwadae.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIll-boding voices are being heard from the inner room of Chongwadae. They call for maintaining a high alert posture for \"security\", saying that \"a country can not be protected only with weapons\" and \"a country concentrating on beefing up military muscle only including nuclear weapons will bring about its own destruction.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMatter is that all these developments are timed to coincide with the U.S.-south Korea Key Resolve and Foal Eagle nuclear war rehearsals that have got into full swing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK cannot interpret those moves otherwise than a repetition of the long bankrupt confrontation stance of the Lee Myung Bak regime and an expression of utter ignorance of the precious asset of the nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAn army of the nation and people possessed of nuclear weapons can always win a victory in the struggle against formidable enemies and reliably guarantee the grandeur and security of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is a stark reality unfolded by the world where the law of the jungle governs and a bitter lesson drawn by the DPRK in the decades-long arduous confrontation with the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey, however, cried out for \"abandoning nuclear weapons\", the asset of which the nation can be proud before the world, and \"giving up Songun\" aimed at preserving peace on this land from outside forces' aggression and war moves in disregard of this stark reality. These are little short of jargons made by the idiots who lack any ability to judge the reality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK launched an all-out action to foil the war moves of the robbers attacking in groups in order to violate the sovereignty of the nation, but the south Korean trigger-happy forces painted it as \"provocation\". Not content with this, they are working hard to deprive the DPRK of its nukes built to defend the country and the nation. This amounts to a thrice-cursed act of treachery.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The people and servicepersons of south Korea must turn their rifles on the warmongers in response to the just all-out action of the DPRK, well aware that the sovereignty of the country and the destiny of the nation can never be left to such traitors to the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What they are doing is an anachronistic act of treachery as they are blindly following the brigandish assertion of their U.S. master keen to put the whole country and the nation under its control, unable to discern what is justice, what is injustice and what is hypocrisy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whatever the U.S. and other big powers decide, resorting to high-handed and arbitrary practices, can by no means be justice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whatever resolutions the UN Security Council adopts cannot be truth as it is a mere voting machine bereft of impartiality and equity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Injustice and lies can never become justice and truth and their hypocrisy is bound to be revealed in face of the times and history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK army and people's unyielding struggle to protect the sovereignty of the nation and the right to existence and defend its supreme interests is the just one as proved by history and the truth indicated by the times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They have had access to precision nuclear deterrence that has become diversified, tightening their belts, and chosen the arduous road of Songun out of many other alternatives. It is because herein lie justice and truth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean military warmongers can not understand the reality because they are traitors engrossed in sycophancy toward the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A man who takes to flunkeyism is bound to become an idiot and a nation that turns to flunkeyism is bound to ruin.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the law proven by long human history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's army and people will not remain an onlooker to the south Korean warmongers' disgraceful act of transferring the wartime operation control, life and soul of the army, to the U.S. and offering the soldiers as canon fodder to their master.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That's why the DPRK chose the U.S. and the south Korean military warmongers following it as the major target of the all-out action for defending the sovereignty and the first target of merciless strike.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The warmongers would be well advised to keep in mind that the Armistice Agreement is no longer valid and the DPRK is not restrained by the north-south declaration on non-aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is left to be done now is an action of justice and merciless retaliation of the army and people of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet forces should come to their senses."

The DPRK's peaceful satellite launch was branded as a ballistic missile launch, a reflection of inveterate repugnance against it. The approval of the \"resolution\" was a serious violation of international law and an insult to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hong Chol Hwa, director of the Legislation Institute of the Academy of Social Sciences, said that the another \"resolution on sanctions\" that was approved on March 7 does not deserve even a passing note as it was retrogressive remaking of the illegal past \"resolutions\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Completely unacceptable are documents of the UN Security Council, which blindly dances to the tune of the U.S., a country ill-famed for high-handed and arbitrary practices and swindling, bereft of impartiality, objectivity and equity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ho Hon Gil, vice-director of the Supreme Court, cited facts to prove that the U.S. is a main architect of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and an arch criminal who made the issue next to impossible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Many Koreans who were taken to Japan for military service and forced labor for the Japanese imperialists became the first and direct victims of the U.S. imperialists' nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During the Korean War, the U.S. planned to form a radioactivity corridor zone on the Korean Peninsula and blackmailed Koreans with A-bomb, forcing lots of families to live separated in the north and the south and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After their occupation of south Korea, the U.S. imperialists shipped nuclear weapons to south Korea. On January 29, 1958 they brought those weapons to south Korea in wanton violation of international law including NPT. They have turned south Korea into the biggest nuclear arsenal in the Far East. In the new century, too, the U.S. has continued nuclear blackmails against the DPRK after putting it in the list of targets of preemptive nuclear strike. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hong Chol Hwa said that the DPRK's third underground nuclear test marked an important occasion in defending the peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation proves that the successful nuclear test is a just measure for defending the sovereignty of the country and its right to launch satellite for peaceful purposes and safeguarding the right of the nation to existence, he stressed, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There can be no settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula unless the U.S. makes a switchover in its nuclear policy by which it regards the nuclear weapons as a basic means for stifling the DPRK."

So, it urgently needed the peaceful circumstances and stable situation but was compelled to counter the enemies' moves with such countermeasure as conducting the third underground nuclear test as the sovereignty and dignity of the country is more valuable than them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and its followers, far from drawing a due lesson from this, are resorting to tougher \"sanctions\" and seeking to ignite a new war at any cost through the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military exercises in line with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Steadfast is the will of the army and people of the DPRK to settle accounts with the U.S. imperialist aggressors and certainly achieve the historic cause of national reunification, the greatest cherished desire of the nation, concludes the commentary."

Nacional de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea hizo publica el dia 13 la siguiente declaracion: \n\t\t\t\t\tFrente a los cada vez mas brutales actos hostiles anti-RPDC de Estados Unidos y otras fuerzas hostiles, la Comandancia Suprema del Ejercito Popular de Corea declaro el 5 de marzo al interior y exterior del pais su firme decision que representa la voluntad de nuestro ejercito y pueblo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, los belicistas de la capa militar surcoreana actuan como perros rabiosos sin volverse en si.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl pasado dia 6, el jefe del departamento operacional de la Junta de Jefes de Estado Mayor del ejercito titere surcoreano dijo que cuando inicie la justa accion de la RPDC, movilizara los medios militares para \"dar el golpe de represalia\" no solo al \"foco\" de accion sino hasta a las \"fuerzas de apoyo y de mando\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl dia 8, el portavoz del Ministerio de Defensa Nacional del Sur de Corea calumnio atrevidamente hasta nuestra maxima dignidad diciendo que si la RPDC provista de armas nucleares entra en el enfrentamiento total, \"eliminara del planeta verde al regimen norcoreano con la voluntad de la humanidad\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEntre tanto, Kim Pyong Gwan, nominado como ministro de Defensa Nacional del nuevo poder surcoreano para sustituir al gangster militar Kim Kwan Jin, chismeo tambien que \"respondera al enfrentamiento total de la RPDC con la sustitucion o derrumbe del poder norcoreano usando hasta la guerra psicologica\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTal belicismo de la capa militar surcoreana no esta enajenado de las palabras virulentas de la inquilina de Chongwadae como \"hay que hacer todo lo posible para la seguridad\", \"no se puede defender el pais solo con armas\" y \"se arruinara el pais que se concentra unicamente a las fuerzas militares como armas nucleares, etc.\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl problema esta en que tales movimientos coinciden con la entrada en etapa crucial de los ejercicios conjuntos de guerra nuclear EE.UU.-Sur de Corea \"Key Resolve\" y \"Foal Eagle\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo calificamos de repeticion de la fracasada postura conflictiva del poder de Lee Myung Bak y de expresion de la ignorancia sobre el valioso patrimonio de la nacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa nacion y el ejercito del pueblo con armas nucleares siempre triunfan en la batalla aunque se enfrentan con enemigos poderosos y garantizan mas firmemente la prosperidad y la seguridad del pais. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto es la realidad, que nos da el mundo de hoy donde predomina la ley de selva, y la leccion de sangre que sacamos de la aguda confrontacion antiyanqui que continua siglo tras siglo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDemandarnos \"renunciar\" las armas nucleares, patrimonio de la nacion digno de hacer alarde al mundo, y \"abandonar el Songun\", que defiende la paz de este territorio desde la agresion y las maniobras de guerra de las fuerzas extranjeras, no pasa de ser un disparate de los idiotas incapaces de justipreciar la realidad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, es un crimen nunca tolerable describir como \"provocacion\" nuestro enfrentamiento total para frustrar las maniobras de guerra de agresion de los gangsteres, que se acometen en colectivo con el fin de acabar con la soberania nacional, y tratar de quitarnos hasta las armas nucleares preparadas para defender el pais y la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn correspondencia a nuestro justo enfrentamiento total, los habitantes surcoreanos y los oficiales y soldados del ejercito surcoreano deben apuntar sus fusiles a los cabecillas belicistas del circulo militar, al darse cuenta de que no se puede confiar en la horda de tales traidores la soberania ni el destino de la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa sucia locura de los belicistas de la capa militar titere es el acto traidor anacronico con que obedece ciegamente a la exigencia bandidesca del amo gringo tendente a ocupar lo todo de nuestro pais, nuestra nacion sin distinguir la justicia y la verdad de la injusticia y la falsedad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La supuesta decision de EE.UU. y otras potencias tomada con la coaccion y la arbitrariedad nunca sera la justicia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Igualmente la supuesta \"resolucion\"  aprobada por el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU convertido en el mecanismo de votacion sin la imparcialidad y el equilibrio, tampoco sera jamas la verdad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por mucho que se acumulen la injusticia y la falsedad, no seran la justicia y la verdad y se revelara su aspecto verdadero ante la epoca y la historia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La lucha indoblegable del ejercito y el pueblo de Corea por defender la soberania y el derecho a vivir de la nacion y el interes supremo del pais, es la justicia que demuestra la historia y la verdad que ilumina la epoca.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito y el pueblo de la RPDC poseyeron el diversificado disuasivo nuclear de precision apretando el cinturon y optaron el camino del Songun muy espinoso, porque alli hay la justicia que frustra la injusticia y la verdad que revela la falsedad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos belicistas de la capa militar del Sur de Corea no conocen tal realidad porque estan contagiados con la adoracion a EE.UU. y el servilismo a las grandes potencias.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe dice que el hombre y la nacion practican el servilismo a las grandes potencias el primero se convierte en tonto y la segunda se arruinara.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto es una ley comprobada en la larga historia de la humanidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito y el pueblo de Corea no estaran mas con los brazos cruzados ante las conductas groseras de los belicistas de la capa militar que encargaron a su amo gringo el derecho de operacion en tiempo guerra conocida como una vida del ejercito y le entregan a sus oficiales y soldados como carne de canon y de bala.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor esa razon, hemos definido a EE.UU. y sus satelites dentro del circulo militar surcoreano como blancos principales del enfrentamiento total por la defensa de soberania y como los primeros a ser exterminados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos belicistas militares surcoreanos deben tener presente que ya no es vigente el Acuerdo de Armisticio ni se comprometera a la declaracion de no agresion entre el Norte y el Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Lo que queda es la accion de justicia, o sea, implacable venganza de nuestro ejercito y pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Los titeres surcoreanos deben volverse en si."
