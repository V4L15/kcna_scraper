            "content": "National Cooperation Urged \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 3 (KCNA) -- National cooperation today stands out with great urgency for a progress in the movement for the independent reunification of the country, says Rodong Sinmun in a signed article today.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is throwing grave barriers in the way of Korea's reunification by persistently resorting to moves to stifle the DPRK under the pretext of the nuclear issue with it and is now bringing dark clouds of a nuclear war over the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National cooperation is the major way for building a structure of confrontation between the Korean nation and the U.S. by practical actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fanatic nuclear racket of the U.S. imperialists against the DPRK places at risk the destiny of all the Koreans, not that of the people in the north alone. Nationwide fighting ranks must be formed against the U.S. bent on harassing peace, hindering Korea's reunification and inflicting a nuclear holocaust upon the Korean nation. In other words, the structure of confrontation between the Korean nation and the U.S. should be built in the struggle to achieve peace and independent reunification of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National cooperation means solving all the problems of the nation related to its destiny and prospect by its concerted efforts, not relying upon outsiders, and keeping pace in this. Through active cooperation all the Koreans at home and abroad can form a strong common front of the nation against the U.S. which is seeking to draw water to its mill, in poking its nose into the internal affairs of the Korean nation and laying stubborn roadblocks in its way. Thus the structure of confrontation between the Korean nation and the U.S. must be built by practical actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National cooperation is the main guarantee for the Korean nation to win in the confrontation with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The driving force in the struggle against the U.S. and war is the Korean nation and its unity is the guarantee for victory. The Korean nation can drive away aggressive outsiders and achieve peace and independent reunification of the nation only when they wage a relentless struggle against the U.S. and war, closely united under the banner of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National cooperation is to reject outsiders and seek reconciliation and unity of all the Koreans. It makes it possible for the Koreans to pool their strength and wisdom and frustrate any moves to cooperate with the U.S. and maneuvers of outsiders against reunification and peace with the mighty force of great national unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National cooperation is immediately great unity and the guarantee for a decisive victory in the struggle against the U.S. and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans should build a structure of confrontation between the entire Korean nation and the U.S. by practical actions and win in the confrontation with the U.S. by definitely achieving national cooperation under the banner of the Korean nation-first spirit.    \r\n\r\n"

Mahbubl Huq, governor of the Central Committee of the Socialist Party, Dilip Barua, general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist), and other leaders of political parties and their members, members of organizations for friendship and solidarity with the Korean people and people from all walks of life. \r\n Nuran Nabie, general secretary of the Bangladesh-Korea Friendship Association, and other personages in their speeches charged that Japan's \"amendment to the law on foreign exchange\" is aimed at suffocating, isolating and stifling the DPRK economically. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They stressed that the progressive political parties and people of Bangladesh would positively support all the countermeasures taken by the DPRK against Japan's moves against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They strongly demanded the Japanese authorities lift the sanctions against the DPRK, though belatedly, with the reasonable way of thinking and fully apologize and compensate the Korean people for the unspeakable damage and sufferings Japan brought to them during its colonial rule over Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A letter of protest to the chief executive of Japan was adopted at the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It stressed that Japan's adoption of the \"amendment to the law on foreign exchange\" diametrically runs counter to the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration in which both promised to observe international law and refrain from threatening each other's security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It urged the Japanese authorities to stop their anti-DPRK moves and opt for improving the relations with the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

But Japan has not repented of the hideous crimes it committed in the past but is acting a shock brigade in executing the U.S. measures to stifle the DPRK, pursuant to its hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently the Japanese reactionaries passed through the Diet \"an amendment to the law on foreign exchange\" aimed at applying sanctions against the DPRK and stifling it and are working hard to adopt a \"bill banning portcalls of specified foreign ships.\" This is an unpardonable criminal act adding to their crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are persistently pursuing the hostile policy towards the DPRK to implement the U.S. policy to stifle the DPRK. But they should bear in mind they will get nothing by doing so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan, oblivious of its bitter past, sets out again on overseas aggression, toeing the US line, it will bring such fatal consequences as the disappearance of Japan, a country of islands, from this earth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries had better properly understand the will of the Korean nation to force Japan to redeem its crimes committed against the Koreans generation after generation and stop acting rashly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We earnestly call on the south Korean people from all walks of life to dynamically rise up in the sacred anti-U.S. and anti-Japanese resistance to decisively smash the moves of the U.S. and Japanese aggressors for domination, interference, aggression and war through national cooperation in order to defend the peace of the country and bring earlier the day of independent reunification of the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S. \"PSI\" is a measure to isolate and blockade the DPRK in the light of its origin and purpose. The U.S. is working hard to force other countries to follow its hostile policy toward the DPRK, not content with labeling the DPRK's increase of its military power for self-defense as a proliferation of WMD and even banning the export of goods for dual use. The U.S. is sadly mistaken if it thinks it can browbeat the DPRK through the \"PSI .\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. sincerely wants the \"non-proliferation of WMD\" and the peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, it should admit its responsibility for having proliferated WMD worldwide and take practical actions to drop its hostile policy to stifle the DPRK, first of all.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
