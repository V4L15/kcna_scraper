He energetically worked for strengthening and developing the party till the last moments of his life, it added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il has achieved the unity and cohesion of the party in thinking and will with his extraordinary wisdom and outstanding political caliber, while leading the WPK, thus helping protect its character as a party of Kim Il Sung and demonstrate the might as an ever-victorious party with original Songun politics, it stressed, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has defended socialism and brought about a turning phase for the building of a great prosperous powerful country, standing firm against the United States which styles itself the world's only super power, holding aloft the banner of Songun under the leadership of the WPK. This instills great strength and courage into us. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We extend full support and solidarity to the WPK and the army and people of the DPRK in their struggle to accomplish the cause of socialism with indomitable will and faith, single-mindedly united around Kim Jong Il.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
