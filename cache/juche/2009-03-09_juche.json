They are extremely adventurous ones for attack operation as they are characterized by arms buildup, infiltration into the rear, ground attack, coastal landing and surprise attack operations in contingency on the Korean Peninsula. They are, at the same time, a test war and nuclear war exercises for mounting surprise preemptive attacks on the DPRK from the land, sea and air.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA war will break out if the U.S. imperialists and the warmongers of the south Korean puppet military hurl the huge troops and sophisticated strike means to mount an attack on the DPRK while staging the above-said exercises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe madcap Key Resolve and Foal Eagle are extremely adventurous and dangerous military provocations which can be seen only on the eve of a war and an undisguised military threat to the DPRK and a sort of a declaration of a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK have grown stronger thanks to the Songun politics under the care of the great illustrious commander of Mt. Paektu. They will never remain a passive on-looker to the prevailing situation now that dark clouds of war are gathering to hang over the homeland and armed clashes are imminent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe KPA Supreme Command issued an order to all the servicepersons to be fully combat ready and follow every move of the aggressors with vigilance in view of the grave situation prevailing in the country and deal merciless retaliatory blows at them, should they intrude into the sky and land and seas of the DPRK even an inch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is a just measure for self-defence for protecting the sovereignty and dignity of the nation and Korean-style socialism as firm as an iron wall and a resolute stand and firm will of the strong revolutionary armed forces of Mt. Paektu to cope with the moves of the U.S. and the south Korean puppet warmongers to start a new war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe army and people of the DPRK love peace and do not want confrontation and war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhenever the U.S. and the south Korean puppet authorities staged joint military exercises targeted against the DPRK, it drew their attention to their danger and served them warnings enough to help them understand it, repeatedly urging them to stop their reckless preparations for a war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey, however, responded to our sincerity by blatant challenge and finally started the said madcap exercises aimed at launching the second Korean war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll facts go to clearly prove that \"stability\" and \"peace\" on the Korean Peninsula touted by the U.S. imperialists are nothing but sophism and they are war maniacs seeking the escalated tension and war only and the arch criminals prodding the north and the south into armed conflicts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis clearly proves once again that the pro-U.S. conservative group and warmongers of the puppet military of south Korea are a group of traitors seized with confrontation and war hysteria, staking their fate on outsiders in utter disregard of reconciliation and unity among Koreans, peace and reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWar maniacs should be dealt with arms, not with words.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUpon receiving the order of the KPA Supreme Command all the servicepersons of the KPA are fully determined to throw overboard the rubbish of history by fully displaying the inexhaustible mental power of the strong revolutionary army of Mt. Paektu and the might of the powerful arms built up under the Songun leadership.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere is no limit to the retaliatory measure of the KPA and no one can predict or evade it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf the warmongers dare launch a war of aggression defying our repeated warnings, our revolutionary armed forces will counter it with resolute and merciless just war for reunification."

Our revolutionary armed forces will counter the enemies' any slight hostile acts of violating the sovereignty of the country and intruding into its inviolable territory, territorial waters and territorial air with prompt merciless military actions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is the invariable stand of our revolutionary armed forces fully ready for all-out confrontation not to allow any enemies to intrude into our territory, territorial waters and territorial air even 0.001 mm.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. We will retaliate any act of intercepting our satellite for peaceful purposes with prompt counter strikes by the most powerful military means.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf the enemies recklessly opt for intercepting our satellite, our revolutionary armed forces will launch without hesitation a just retaliatory strike operation not only against all the interceptor means involved but against the strongholds of the U.S. and Japanese aggressors and the south Korean puppets who hatched plots to intercept it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tShooting our satellite for peaceful purposes will precisely mean a war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. As an immediate measure we will enforce a more strict military control and cut off the north-south military communications in order to guarantee the security in the opened Eastern and Western coastal areas under the control of the north and the south while the DPRK-targeted war exercises are under way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is nonsensical to maintain normal communications channel at a time when the south Korean puppets are getting frantic with the above-said war exercises, leveling guns at fellow countrymen in league with foreign forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAccordingly, our army will cut off the military communications, the last channel which has existed between the north and the south, from March 9.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee Myung Bak group of traitors and the U.S. and Japanese aggressors would be well advised to behave with discretion."

However, the U.S. and the puppet warmongers started the nuclear war exercises targeted against the DPRK. This is an undisguised challenge to the Korean nation and the world peace-loving people.
