Korea Blamed for Failed Inter-Korean Talks\r\nPyongyang, February 17 (KCNA) -- The south Korean authorities are busy shifting the blame for the failed inter-Korean  talks on to the DPRK, but they can never hide their true colors as the breaker of dialogue, says Minju Joson, a major newspaper of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t The blame for the ruptured preliminary talks for the opening of the north-south high-level military talks arranged with much effort is entirely on south Korea which took wrong attitude towards dialogue, the newspaper says in a bylined commentary Thursday, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet war-like forces of south Korea staged anti-DPRK war exercises from the day after the DPRK announced its important proposal calling for holding wide-ranging dialogue and negotiations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, they were busy with cooperation with foreign forces to hurt and stifle the fellow countrymen in the north calling for dialogue and negotiations intended to tide over the crisis on the Korean Peninsula and between the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In actuality, they laid an artificial obstacle in the way of talks under the unreasonable conditions and pretext at the talks on Feb. 8. They went the lengths of converting the venue of the talks into that of confrontation, insisting that their unilateral proposals be adopted as agenda items of the talks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities are misleading the public opinion to create impression that the DPRK is to blame for the recently ruptured talks. Lurking behind it is their black-hearted intention to avoid criticism by the public opinion at home and abroad through distortion of the facts and escalate the confrontation with fellow countrymen in collusion with foreign forces and thus realize their scheme at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The history will surely punish the south Korean authorities for having brought to collapse the north-south dialogue for defusing the tension and opening a new phase for peace and reunification and chilled the desire of all the fellow countrymen in a bid to attain their sinister aims."
