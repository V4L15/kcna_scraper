The nuclear warheads have been standardized to be fit for ballistic missiles by miniaturizing them, he noted, adding this can be called true nuclear deterrent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He noted with great satisfaction that Koreans can do anything if they have a will.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Being a proud nuclear weapons state at present, we have a firm guarantee for making a breakthrough in the drive for economic construction and improving the people's standard of living on the basis of the powerful nuclear deterrent, he stressed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that the WPK's line of simultaneously developing the two fronts is not a temporary counter-action for coping with the rapidly changing situation but a strategic line to be permanently held fast to as long as the imperialists' nuclear threat and arbitrary practices persist.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He called on the nuclear scientists, the frontline combatants responsible for the country's nuclear deterrent, to creditably perform their honorable mission and duty on behalf of the party, the country and the revolution on the first battle line for decisively foiling with a nuclear treasured sword the enemies' daily escalating reckless moves to stifle the DPRK and glorifying the country as the matchless nuclear power which no force on earth dares to provoke.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that our nuclear force's main mission is to deter a nuclear war, he added that the stronger our nuclear strike capability gets, the more powerful our deterrent to aggression and nuclear war grows and it is the most just and reliable way of preventing the country from a nuclear war disaster to firmly bolster up the nuclear force both in quality and quantity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The right to make a preemptive nuclear strike is by no means a monopoly of the U.S., he said, declaring that if the U.S. imperialists infringe upon the DPRK's sovereignty and right to existence with nuclear weapons, the latter will never hesitate to make a preemptive nuclear strike at them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed great expectation and belief that scientists and technicians in the field of researches into nuclear weapons would develop and produce more Korean-style various type nuclear weapons of Juche to completely contain the enemies with nuclear force and thus provide a firmer guarantee for the eternal future of Kim Il Sung's nation and Kim Jong Il's Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by KPA General Kim Rak Gyom, commander of the Strategic Force, Hong Yong Chil and Kim Yo Jong, vice-department directors of the Central Committee of the WPK."

            "content": "EE.UU. y Sur de Corea no deben menospreciar advertencia de RPDC, insiste ACNC\r\nPyongyang, 9 de marzo (ACNC) -- Pese a la advertencia de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea, Estados Unidos y los titeres surcoreanos comenzaron a partir del dia 7 los ejercicios belicos conjuntos Key Resolve y Foal Eagle 16 en toda la extension surcoreana. \n\t\t\t\t\tLos belicistas anunciaron que los presentes simulacros persiguen confirmar la posibilidad de \"OPLAN 5015\" que incluye la \"operacion de descabezamiento\" para atentar a la Direccion de la Revolucion Coreana, la operacion de desembarco sorpresivo para ocupar los importantes lugares estrategicos y el ataque preventivo nuclear a los medios de golpe nuclear de la RPDC y otros. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, los describen sin escrupulos como \"entrenamientos anuales\". De esta manera, demostraron a todo el mundo que es invariable su ambicion de aplastamiento a la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora la sociedad internacional desea el alivio de la tension de la Peninsula Coreana expresando gran preocupacion por la crisis causada por la injusta \"resolucion de sancion\" de la ONU aprobada acusando a la RPDC de primera prueba de bomba de hidrogeno y de lanzamiento del satelite de observacion de la Tierra Kwangmyongsong-4.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn tal circunstancia, EE.UU. y los titeres surcoreanos hacen ultimos esfuerzos desesperados por arrebatar la dignidad y la soberania de la RPDC movilizando enormes efectivos y hasta la mayoria de los tres medios estrategicos de ataque nuclear. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTales maniobras devienen un desafio frontal a la aspiracion de la sociedad internacional a la paz y la seguridad y testimonian la naturaleza de los agresores y perturbadores de la paz. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs imposible expulsar a los gangsteres armados con alguna logica o peticion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa severa realidad de hoy comprueba de nuevo que fue muy justa y clarividente la opcion de la RPDC por consolidar por todos los medios el disuasivo autodefensivo de guerra y la capacidad de golpe preventivo nuclear. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo nos asustamos nunca ante los ejercicios belicos conjuntos de mayor envergadura y la \"sancion\" superintransigente de EE.UU. y los titeres surcoreanos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs muy ridiculo el intento de derrocar atrevidamente a la RPDC que forma una fortaleza mediante la unidad monolitica, avanza con sus propias fuerzas y dispone del fuerte disuasivo nuclear de autodefensa. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora el ejercito y pueblo coreanos entraron en la ofensiva general para responder a la locura de guerra nuclear de EE.UU. y sus seguidores que insatisfechos con la violacion de la soberania y seguridad de la RPDC, se desesperan por acarrear a la nacion coreana los desastres de la guerra nuclear. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los medios de ataque militares incluso las armas nucleares ya emplazadas esperan el momento de disparo apuntando con precision los blancos principales de la zona operacional del Sur de Corea, las bases militares norteamericanas en la region de Asia-Pacifico y el territorio principal norteamericano, segun el plan operacional de la Suprema Direccion sobre la liberacion del suelo surcoreano y el castigo a EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi los enemigos cometen la aventurera invasion armada, despreciando la voluntad de venganza implacable de la RPDC, el ejercito y pueblo coreanos convertiran en un instante en el mar de fuego y en las cenizas los nidos de provocadores con el autoctono e inimaginable modo de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC no habla por hablar."
