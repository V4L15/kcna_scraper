At the meeting we put forward an important proposal for opening a way out for the nation independently with unity of the north and the south.\r\n   The South Korean rulers should make a policy switchover towards national independence, replace the wrong anti-north confrontation policy with a pro-north reconciliation one and make efforts to shape the destiny of the nation by pooling efforts with the north.\r\n   For the implementation of the programme, it is imperative to maintain the principle of national independence. All the compatriots at home and abroad, aspiring after national independence and rejecting outsiders, should demand the U.S. troop pullout from South Korea and fight to check such treacherous acts as trying to slay fellow countrymen with the backing of outsiders.\r\n   They should unite closely for the reunification of the country, irrespective of difference in ideology, idea, political view, religious belief, class and stratum.    For This purpose, the \"National Security Law\" and the \"Agency for National Security Planning,\" which are standing in the way of national unity, should be eliminated in South Korea.\r\n   Anti-war, peace-keeping activities should also be conducted to thwart new war preparations and arms buildup by local and foreign warmongers.\r\n   If the great unity of the whole nation is to be achieved, the political parties, organizations and compatriots of South Korea and overseas should actively join the three-way solidarity struggle for national reconciliation, unity and reunification, in hearty response to the proposal of our joint meeting.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Under this situation they cannot achieve reconciliation and unity any time. Nor can they take any positive steps for the improvement of north-south relations and the reunification of the country.\r\n   The \"National Security Law\" should be unconditionally abolished and the \"Agency for National Security Planning\" be immediately dismantled in South Korea. The \"NSL\" and the \"ANSP\" are an obstacle to reconciliation and dialogue between the north and south and a stumbling block in the way of national reunification.\r\n   Arms buildup, introduction of vast sophisticated military equipment and joint military manoeuvres with foreign troops for a war against the fellow countrymen and escalating tensions of the country should be discontinued.\r\n   South Korea should turn its back on the anti-national, anti-reunification past and make a policy switchover for the sake of the nation and reunification.\r\n   All the fellow countrymen in the north, south and abroad should work harder for the reunification of the country in hearty response to the 10-Point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation laid down by President Kim Il Sung and the great reunification programme advanced by General Kim Jong Il so as to make this year a year of historic advance in achieving the reunification of the Korean nation, stressed the reporter.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
