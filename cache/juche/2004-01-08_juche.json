It will improve good-neighborly and friendly relations with all the countries in the world on the principle of independence and international justice. It will also strive to improve relations with those countries that had been hostile toward it in the past if they respect the sovereignty of the DPRK and drop a wrong policy toward it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Such pro-U.S. one-sided policy of Japan will only render it further isolated in Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has made every possible patient effort to improve the bilateral relations, prompted by its noble intention to contribute to global peace and stability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government had better drop its outmoded conception of confrontation and boldly drop its present short-sighted policy towards the DPRK.\r\n This would also do Japan good.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Its much talk about the six-way talks over the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. is nothing but high-flown rhetoric. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north, the south and abroad should achieve national cooperation and wage a valiant anti-U.S. and anti-war struggle irrespective of ideology, political view and religious belief in the era of independence and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They will pool efforts and deal a sledge-hammer blow at the U.S. arrogant moves to launch a war of aggression against the DPRK and reject the sycophantic traitors in south Korea cooperating with the U.S. in its anti-peace and anti-reunification moves.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
