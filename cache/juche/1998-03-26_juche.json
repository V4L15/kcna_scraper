Sentiment and keep the position of the only superpower. What is more serious is that their deployment and exercise are  taking aim at the DPRK.\r\n   It is known to all that strategic nuclear bombers are frequently flying to South Korea from Guam island for  military manoeuvres to make a surprise attack on the DPRK. \r\n     \r\n"

            "content": "For what is \"deterrent force\"?\r\n  Pyongyang, March 26 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Wednesday brands a study report on main elements of deterrent force after the cold war published by the strategic command of the U.S. Defense Department as a brigandish logic like a thief crying \"stop thief\".\r\n   The study report says it is proper for the United States to keep nuclear weapons in order to \"deter\" the potential \"nuclear attack\". Lurking behind it is a sinister attempt, the daily says, and goes on:\r\n   The United States is describing its nuclear weapons as \"deterrent force\" to block someone's \"nuclear threat\". This is a shameless sophism to justify its manoeuvres of aggression and war.\r\n   Today when disarmament is becoming a  global trend, the United States should dismantle nuclear weapons, but it rather intends to keep them. To this end it needs a new pretext. That is why it is insisting on argument about \"deterrent force\"  allegedly to block other countries' \"nuclear threat\" by nuclear weapons.\r\n   Under the pretext of \"deterrent force\" the United States is directing a focal point of its nuclear strategy to the developing countries after the cold war came to an end. The spearhead of the main attack is directed to the DPRK.\r\n   If the United States is interested in peace, it should fully eliminate the nuclear weapons,  pull out all the nuclear weapons from its military bases in South Korea and other countries at an early date and completely remove nuclear threat against those countries which have no nuclear weapons. \r\n        \r\n\r\n"

And Ham Se Hwan was a voluntary soldier who joined the KPA in a newly liberated area of South Korea during its first southward advance and fought against the enemy with arms in hands.\r\n   The South Korean authorities are crying that the unconverted long-term prisoners are not pows but \"criminals\" because they were arrested while being engaged in guerrilla activities in South Korea.\r\n   The 1929 special convention on pows and the 1949 convention on treatment of pows made clear the status of resistance organisations such as guerrillas.\r\n   The repatriation of the unconverted long-term prisoners also conforms with humanitarianism and the standards of human rights on free choice of residence, emigration, travel and citizenship.\r\n   As mentioned above, they should have been repatriated scores of years ago in view of international law, the Korean Armistice Agreement and humanitarianism.\r\n   But they are still kept in south korea due to the persistent anti-north confrontation policy pursued by the successive South Korean rulers.\r\n   The South Korean authorities are openly revealing their intention not to return the unconverted long-term prisoners to the north. The authorities allege that they would \"not repeat the past mistakes.\" This makes us suspect that the present ruling quarters of South Korea are following in the footsteps of the successive dictators who were engrossed only in inter-Korean confrontation, turning their back on  the improvement of north-south relations, reconciliation and reunification.\r\n   They must not duplicate the criminal records of the successive rulers who used the repatriation of the unconverted long-term prisoners for their sinister political purpose but they must take a measure to send them back to the north without delay.    \r\n \r\n"
