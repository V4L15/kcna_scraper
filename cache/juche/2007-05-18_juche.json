The present ruling quarters including Abe, however, are openly denying the past history of crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is evading the state responsibility for the issue of \"comfort women\" forcibly recruited for the Imperial Japanese Army and refusing to admit the past war crimes. This cannot be construed otherwise than an attempt to repeat the past doings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Abe revealed Japan's intention to be a permanent member of the UN Security Council when he said at the end of last year that it is necessary for countries with sufficient will and capacity to see international peace and security guaranteed by involving themselves in the process of the adoption of UNSC resolutions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is impudently overreaching itself in an attempt to grab a UNSC permanent seat. This is not for making any \"international contribution\" but for its hideous purpose of securing a springboard favorable for the building of a military power and overseas expansion and racing headlong along the road of aggression unhindered. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The criminal scheme of the Japanese reactionaries to bound along the road of the building of a military power and overseas aggression under the showy veil of \"building a beautiful country\" has become a target of sharp alert at home and abroad.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
