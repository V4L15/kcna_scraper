For its thin technical  feasibility and a colossal amount of money needed for it, however, Japan has gone ahead with only a technical study  with a little investment under the pretext of \"Japan-U.S. joint study.\" but it is now entering a full-fledged stage of development including the manufacture of accessories.        \r\n   Japan is alleging that the decision is part of \"defence steps\" to counter nuclear missiles with increasing \"international fear of possible nuclear proliferation\" caused by nuclear tests of India and Pakistan.               \r\n   The allegation is only aimed at fooling international public opinion.                                              \r\n   What Japan is really seeking in the development of the TMD system is to modernize military equipment with the backing of the united states and gain military supremacy in the whole of Asia.                                        \r\n   Japan already carried out h-2 space rocket launching tests several times under the pretext of the \"development of the space.\" h-2 rocket is capable of delivering nuclear  warheads and striking any target on the globe. Japan has technologies enough to manufacture nuclear weapons any time and has stockpiled large quantities of plutonium.            \r\n   Nobody can predict what Japan, which has already made full preparations to possess strategic nuclear missiles, will do after the development of the TMD system.             \r\n   What is clear is that the Japanese reactionaries want to gain military upperhand and establish their sphere of domination in the Asian region by gratifying their ambition for converting Japan into a military power.                  \r\n   However, they are seriously mistaken. Asia is not what it was when the Japanese imperialists were marching with the  sun flag in their hands, singing the army song.             \r\n   The Korean and other Asian people are closely watching the reckless military buildup of the Japanese reactionaries and will take strong measures to counter them. \r\n \r\n\r\n"

He said it is high time for them to invest in South Korea, and asked them to make active efforts for this.\r\n   While trying to introduce foreign capital to save the economy which has gone bankrupt owing to foreign capital, the puppet clique is allowing foreign businessmen to buy South Korean enterprises.\r\n   It is clear to any one that the introduction of foreign capital leads to the further dependence of  the key industries of South Korea and harsh colonial plunder.
