The papers say that the repatriation of 63 unconverted long-term prisoners one year ago was a clear evidence of the greatness of leader Kim Jong Il and a historic event that fully demonstrated the might of the single-hearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses and the advantage of Korean-style socialism of Juche.\r\n Their repatriation was a result of Kim Jong Il's boundless love and comradely obligation to the revolutionary soldiers and his tireless and wise leadership, they say.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun says that the last one year the unconverted long-term prisoners spent under the care of the homeland was a year of glory when they deeply felt the honor and pride of being the soldiers of the Workers' Party of Korea and the leader. It was also a year of happiness when they enjoyed genuine human life to their heart's content under the deep solicitude of the party and the leader, it notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unconverted long-term prisoners are men of faith and indomitable fighters who kept their pledge to the WPK and the homeland to the last despite the sufferings beyond human imagination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They remained true to the cause of national reunification with optimism and confidence in its victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Indeed, it is the great pride and happiness of the WPK and the nation to have such men of faith and indomitable patriotic fighters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson says that the immortal exploits of Kim Jong Il who realized the group repatriation of the unconverted long-term prisoners will be handed down forever with the history of the nation.    \r\n\r\n"

It dealt a heavy blow to the U.S. and its followers by taking such countermeasures for self-defence as withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and declaring a semi-war state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK defended the dignity of the nation and socialism in this confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has become a powerful country which the U.S. dare not provoke and the U.S. lost its face before the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. failed in its policy to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the 20th century was drawing to its end, the Clinton administration, though belatedly, recognized the system in the DPRK and buckled down to the work to improve relations with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a lesson drawn by the Clinton administration that the U.S. can never stifle the DPRK and such a suffocation policy will place the U.S. in a perilous position. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration is well advised to draw a proper lesson from it.    \r\n\r\n"

But it is as foolhardy as trying to revert the trend of history. What is more powerful and mightier than weapon is the strength of the popular masses advancing the history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Asian people will never allow the U.S. to frame up a structure of confrontation in the vast Asian continent advancing toward a bright future and bring a black cloud of war to it.    \r\n\r\n"
