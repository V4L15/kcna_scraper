Korean warships intrude into north\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 6 (KCNA) -- The South Korean ruling quarters committed a grave military provocation of illegally intruding warships deep into the territorial waters of the north side southeast of Ssanggyo-ri, Kangryong county, South Hwanghae Province, on June 5, military sources said.  Three warships of South Korea, having watched the movement of fishing boats of the north which were catching fish at sea off Soyonphyong Islet, proceeded northward at full steam across the sea boundary line in an attempt to commit hostile acts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   No sooner had a patrol boat of the Navy of the Korean People's Army defending the sea post of the country with vigilance sailed to the scene than the enemy's warships fled southward in a hurry.   This provocation act is a premeditated move to lead the inter-Korean confrontation to its extreme pitch by artificially aggravating the situation on the Korean peninsula. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's military expansion and S. Korea-Japan military tie-up exposed \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 6 (KCNA) -- The central committee of the National Democratic Front of South Korea (Hanminjon) issued an indictment on June 2 as regards Japan's military expansion and the South Korea-Japan military tie-up which are becoming all the more serious, Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The indictment said:   Japan's military expansion and its moves for overseas aggression are impending beyond the danger line.   It is drastically increasing military expenditure the growing rate of which places first in the world.   The military expenditure in 1950 when the police reserves of the \"Self-Defence Forces\" were founded, was 131 billion yen, 156.9 billion yen in 1960 and about 5,000 billion yen in 1998. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By putting spurs to equipping the \"SDF\" with ultra modern and long-distance weapons, Japan has up-to-date fighter planes including F-15 and F-16 as main force planes and has up-to-date submarine, a large transport ship which can be used as an aircraft carrier and aegis missile escorts. \r\nParticularly, it is stepping up the development of new-type long-distance missile to mass-produce all sorts of missiles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The British newspaper Sunday Times said Japan has ten types of missiles which can be charged with nuclear war heads.   Recently Japan decided to launch four intelligence satellites till 2000 on the pretext of \"missile threat\" from the DPRK. This is the last stage for its military expansion and overseas aggression.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is making  preparations for military action to cope with the \"emergencies\" on the Korean peninsula.   It took active part in the execution of the \"operation plan 5027\", a U.S. war plan for aggression on the DPRK, in 1994 and approved more than 1,000 provisions of cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt was closeted with the United States in top secrecy on three occasions last year and worked out a \"war plan\" designed to invade the DPRK.   It is also zealously involved in introducing the U.S.-led \"Theatre Missile Defense\" system.   Contacts and exchange between military personnel of South Korea and Japan are unprecedentedly brisk and their scope is expanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nMutual studying at all military academies of South Korea and Japan, joint riding in up-to-date planes and mutual test flight are in full swing and confabs are repeated to set up joint military bodies and carry on joint military operations and joint military training. Accordingly, intelligence, telecommunication and alarm systems for joint military operations and opening of transport canals for military personnel and materials are being supplemented and completed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The formation of the South Korea-Japan military alliance is being promoted at the final stage and the U.S.-Japan-South Korea triangular military alliance, Asian version of NATO, has been rounded off.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Through the military tie-up between South Korea and Japan, the latter seeks reinvasion of Korea. Japan is scheming to invade Korea at any cost before its reunification and use it as a springboard of aggression on Asia to realize its old dream of \"Greater East Asia Coprosperity Sphere\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Siding with this, the Kim Dae Jung \"government\" intends to intensify military tie-up with Japan and  make an attack on the north with the backing of Japan.   The treacherous Kim Dae Jung group should act with discretion, mindful that the act of doing harm to the fellow countrymen in the north with the backing of Japan will only result in inviting fire on the roof of \"Chongwadae\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan is not an \"unsinkable aircraft carrier\".\r\n   Japan should ponder over the fact that a powder magazine of military expansion extremely heated will catch fire and Japan will be sunken in the pacific forever before its missiles are launched toward the continent. It should give up  at once the reckless war policy  that can invite its self-destruction. \r\n\r\n"

Minju Joson says this in a commentary today.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The news analyst goes on:   Their right of learning is trampled underfoot and even their right to existence deprived of owing to the anti-social misrule of the \"people's government\" rulers.   The rulers are undisguisedly cracking down on the youth and students organizations including Hanchongryon (South Korean Federation of University Student Councils).   It is only too natural that the young South Korean people are setting out on the anti-\"government\" struggle under this situation. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
