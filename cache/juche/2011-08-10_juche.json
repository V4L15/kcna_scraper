            "content": "Truth about Shelling Fabricated by S. Korean Military Warmongers Exposed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPyongyang, August 10 (KCNA) -- The south Korean military warmongers are faking up again the burlesque that the army of the DPRK committed shelling \"provocation\" in the waters around Yonphyong Island and kicking up an anti-DPRK racket by mobilizing major media including KBS, MBC and Yonhap TV.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe head of the north side to the north-south military working-level talks gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA today in this connection:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt a time when a dynamic drive is making successful progress to build a thriving nation in all parts of the DPRK, there was normal blasting in the area of South Hwanghae Province close to the five islands in the West Sea of Korea on August 10 as part of the brisk construction of a gigantic object aimed at improving the standard of people's living,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFrightened by this, the south Korean military warmongers spread misinformation that the army of the DPRK perpetrated a shelling \"provocation.\" They went the lengths of militarily reacting to this under that pretext. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was preposterous in the age of science when latest detecting and intelligence means are available that they mistook the blasting for shelling and they proved shells fell in the waters around the \"northern limit line\" though no shells were fired. It was a tragicomedy that they indiscriminately reacted to what happened with counter-shelling even without confirming the truth about the case in the sensitive waters of the West Sea of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn order to paint the case as a \"provocation\" of the army of the DPRK, the south Korean military is making much fuss that its forces made a prompt \"retaliatory action\" as the firing of three shells was heard from near Yonphyong Island in the West Sea and one shell might have flown across the \"northern limit line, \" a sheer fiction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn order to make their farce sound plausible, the south Korean belligerent elements made much fuss. They urgently increased the number of combat warships and flew fighters in the air near the five islands in the West Sea and alerted the frontline units. They, at the same time, ordered all the fishing boats of the south side to stop their operations and sail back to their ports and evacuated inhabitants.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe army of the DPRK cannot overlook the actions taken by the south Korean military to orchestrate another poor anti-DPRK charade in broad daylight on the basis of their misjudgment of the normal blasting made in the course of peaceable construction as shelling provocation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe recent military racket was an extension of the inveterate bad habit of the tricksters. They fabricated the \"Cheonan\" warship sinking case, the hideous conspiratorial farce unprecedented in the history of the nation, launching an all-out confrontation with fellow countrymen.  Not content with this, they committed the Yonphyong Island shelling, driving the situation on the Korean Peninsula to the worst war phase of exchange of fire. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSuch burlesque is a product of the deliberate moves of the belligerent forces of the south Korean military to vitiate the atmosphere of dialogue in the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity and push the inter-Korean relations to the worst phase of confrontation and clash.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK side sent an open letter to the U.S. and the south Korean authorities in the name of the Panmunjom mission of the Korean People's Army, urging them to cancel their projected Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military exercises this year. What merits a serious attention is that they faked up the above-said case to achieve their sinister aim to stage this saber-rattling as planned at any cost, defying the warning, in a bid to strain the situation on the Korean Peninsula again. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLurking behind the recent racket is an ulterior aim: To secure a pretext for staging the above-said saber-rattling through the shelling case in a bid to have justification to launch an actual war of aggression against the north any time, while inciting atmosphere of confrontation with the DPRK through the fabrication of all kinds of \"spy ring cases\", \"cases of the violation of the National Security Law\" and \"attempted assassinations\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPlots and fabrications are trite methods employed by those in a crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat has become clear once again through the recent case is that the south Korean authorities, belligerent forces of the military, in particular, are the master hands at plots and fabrications who stoop to any infamy to escalate the confrontation with fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe criminals can never escape a stern judgment by all the fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe army and people of the DPRK will resolutely shatter all the plots and fabrications of those confrontation-minded elements against the DPRK and keep advancing to improve the inter-Korean relations and achieve the peace and reunification of the nation."

According to it, 20 oil supply companies in Zulia State and their properties were owned by the state and a step was taken to nationalize the U.S. oil company in Monagas State.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn June last year the country nationalized 11 oil facilities under the U.S. companies, thus laid a foundation for tightening the government control over the economic sectors and developing the oil industry.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Venezuelan president in a TV address affirmed that the nationalization would mark the beginning of the establishment of an industrial complex and lay a solid foundation for the victory of socialism. The Venezuelan working class will clearly show the whole world how they would carry out the revolution, he said, re-clarifying the government's stand to push forward the nationalization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe oil deposit prospected and secured by Venezuela so far amounts to 296.5 billion bbl, the largest in the world, a press report said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe government aims to increase the daily average oil production to 4 million bbl till 2015 from 3.1 million bbl at present and to 6 million bbl till 2019.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEfforts are making rapid progress to facilitate housing construction and secure more jobs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tProjects are now under way in Miranda State to build 20 000 flats and 1 200 flats in Aragua State.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe government is planning to undertake large-scale housing construction from this year to 2017 with huge investment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was reported that in order to fully settle the unemployment issue in eight years to come, the government would provide 3.5 million jobs and, at the same time, carry out a new plan for vocational education.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe government is also directing big efforts to bolstering the defense capability to provide a military guarantee for the successful building of socialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUnder the situation where the U.S. is undisguisedly revealing its attempt at aggression after building its military base in Colombia, the Venezuelan government is making sure that all the servicepersons and people are keeping themselves combat-ready to cope with this.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Venezuelan president underscored the need to defend the inviolable sovereignty of the country and the Bolivar revolution from the aggression by the imperialists and their stooges. To this end, one should be ready to sacrifice oneself and all the services of the army, the Bolivar police and people should take arms in hands and get fully prepared to go into action, he stressed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe government and people of Venezuela are sure to build good Venezuela-style socialism, overcoming all difficulties and ordeals as they are confidently advancing along the road of independence, believing in their strength."
