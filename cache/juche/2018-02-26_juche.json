Por esta razon, su responsabilidad recae totalmente sobre el mismo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo podia aparecerse jamas el problema nuclear de la Peninsula Coreana si no hubiera la politica de hostilidad a la RPDC, practicada por el pais norteamericano desde el dia de la fundacion del pais socialista ni extendiera esta politica como abierta chantaje y amenaza nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin saber correctamente la esencia y la causa del problema nuclear de la Peninsula Coreana y hablar ni una palabra a EE.UU., culpable de la agravacion de la situacion, el cuestiono las medidas justas de la RPDC. Calificamos esto de un acto vil que partio del extremado prejuicio carente de la imparcialidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl secretario general de la ONU debe dejar de imitar al sonambulo al saber correctamente que la amenaza nuclear viene de EE.UU. que desarrolla todo tipo de las armas nucleares modernas y expone la ambicion de ataque preventivo nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas fuerzas armadas nucleares de la RPDC devienen el poderoso disuasivo que frustra cualquier amenaza nuclear de EE.UU. y controla a este imperio para que no pueda hacer la aventura militar. Y nunca seran la amenaza a ningun pais y region mientras que no se violen la soberania y los intereses de nuestro Estado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi el secretario general tiene de veras un interes en la resolucion del problema nuclear de la Peninsula Coreana, tiene que aplaudir el actual proceso de la mejora de relaciones entre el Norte y el Sur de Corea y someter prontamente al Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU el tema de exigir a los paises vecinos que no cometan acciones obstaculizadoras, segun la demanda de la carta del canciller coreano fechado 31 de enero."
