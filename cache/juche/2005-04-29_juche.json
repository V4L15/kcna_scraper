            "content": "Italian Newspaper's False Report Refuted\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 29 (KCNA) -- \"Cheyuk Sinmun\" (sports newspaper) Friday carried the following commentary titled \"Facts should not be falsified\":\r\n Media should not falsify facts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are publications which have become a laughing stock of the public for having made unreasonable comments on the basis of what their reporters heard from others or some scenes shown by television without witnessing what actually happened. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera is one of them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its recent issue carried a report misrepresenting what spectators protested against the unfair refereeing at the end of the match held between the DPRK team and the Iranian team for Asian qualifier B of the 18th World Cup on March 30. This seriously hurt Koreans' feelings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A reporter of the newspaper wrote a story on the basis of his narrow-minded view without watching for himself the match held in Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt was peppered with a lot of nonsensical assertions that \"it was a product of popular commotion\" and the match ended in the free-for-all on the field. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis was a practice of mixing sports with politics. Then why is this newspaper free to use such nonsensical words as \"commotion\" or \"disorder\" without any ground? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Every spectator is obliged to discern or watch if any match is underway according to the rules. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This being a hard fact, how can the reasonable protest made by spectators against the unfair refereeing at the end of the match be interpreted as a \"commotion\" or \"disorder\"? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Truth to tell, Korean spectators remained tolerant when they watched the chief referee of Thailand going without giving an 11m penalty kick twice during the match between the DPRK eleven and the Bahraini team. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAn 11m penalty kick was not declared against the Iranian team when it committed two foul plays during the match held in the same stadium five days later. This could not but lash the spectators into fury at the end of the match. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Had there been any \"popular commotion\" in the stadium as claimed by the newspaper, the match would not have taken place properly due to the rash acts of the supporters. In fact, there was nothing that hamstrung the match. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The newspaper claimed there was a fight between Korean supporters and the referee. When did it take place and when did they throw stones on the field? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This was a sheer fabrication. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Not a single supporter went down to the field, much less touching even a hair of the referee during the match. It is preposterous, indeed, to depict the 90 minute-match as a \"fight\" and a \"commotion\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The referees could not leave the stadium soon after the match was over entirely not because somebody stood in their way. This happened because extremely unfair refereeing made them feel guilty conscience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The newspaper went the lengths of claiming that the crowd that assembled outside the stadium was intended to assault referees or players of the rival team. After the match was over, supporters wished to encourage the Korean team which suffered a regrettable defeat due to the partial attitude of the chief referee, much less an move to hurt somebody. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Spectators witnessed such unfair refereeing as refusing to give an 11m penalty kick four times at the international soccer match held in the same stadium at a five day-interval. Much displeased with this, some spectators protested against this unfair refereeing from their seats and some excited ones threw a few empty cider bottles and chairs just before them. Was this \"commotion\" or \"disorder\"? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Explicitly speaking, Korean spectators did nothing to obstruct the match nor did they do anything to threaten the safety of players of the rival team or the chief referee.\r\n The newspaper said something about the unfair refereeing of the match. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe recent protest was staged entirely because the chief referees of Thailand and Syria partially refereed the matches quite contrary to the rules of the matches. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This admits of no further argument as this was witnessed by the supervisors dispatched by FIFA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The long world history of football records great many soccer matches but knows no such precedent of refusing to give crucial 11m penalty kick for serious foul plays in two matches as what happened in Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This unfair refereeing had an irrevocable adverse impact on the development of the world sports and cast a shadow on its prospect. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite natural for the world opinion to be unanimous in expressing indignation at the malpractices during the recent soccer matches. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If such extremely partial refereeing as wicked Syrian and Thai chief referees' is allowed as what happened in Pyongyang, such practice will be rife in other places in future to mar the popularity of world soccer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard, we sent video tapes on which the matches are recorded to FIFA and issued a statement in protest against the unreasonable behavior of the referees on behalf of the DPRK Football Association in accordance with Paragraph 12 \"Violation of the Rules and Unfair Practice\" of the rules of matches. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even the newspaper and broadcasting reporters and TV announcers of various countries who covered the matches complained that \"the chief referee should have impartially refereed the matches.\" And even officials of the Iranian football team said:\r\n \"We know the crowd was angered by the referee's malpractice and it is quite natural for the people strong in national self-esteem to do so\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One may say that this represents the unanimous view of those who watched the matches. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We can not but take a serious note of the fact that the above-said newspaper far-fetchedly linked the recent happening with the political issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An international referee represents FIFA, not his own country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We, therefore, only lodged a protest with FIFA against the referees' practices that tarnished its image. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This issue is related to the qualifications and conscience of the chief referees mandated by FIFA, not an issue concerning the relations between countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This newspaper, however, was so impudent as to paint this issue as a crack in the relationship between countries. This cannot be construed otherwise than a sinister intention and a \"black-hearted design\" to drive a wedge in the relations between the DPRK and other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWorse still, this newspaper handles what Koreans did the same way as it does demonstrations and protests staged in other countries under the absolutely different political systems. This is nothing but a ridiculous and naive attempt of the political dwarfs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The newspaper should know that the so-called \"commotion\" and \"disorder\" did not happen in the DPRK as it is a society where the people are single-mindedly united. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our people do not allow anyone to falsify truth and facts or hurt their self-esteem. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the hope of the Korean people and the world soccer fans that the prestigious FIFA will prevent referees' unfair refereeing of international matches and ensure impartiality in those games. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Then the fascist dictatorship would be revived and the elementary fruits of democratization which have been won would be trampled underfoot in south Korea. Worse still, the June 15 joint declaration would be gone like a puff of smoke and the inter-Korean relations would bounce back into the phase of confrontation and war and the flame of a nuclear war would leap on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people cannot live a life of ease, the peace and security of the country would be exposed to a constant threat and a higher hurdle be thrown in the way of the country's reunification with the GNP, a group of pro-U.S. flunkeyists and anti-national and anti-reunification clique, left alone.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Commission on Human Rights on April 11 referred to the issues of assaults against Korean students in Japan and the education in the distorted history.\r\n A delegate of the Japan Human Rights Committee of Workers said that many cases of assaults against Korean students, descendants of the Korean victims of Japan's colonial rule, are now reported in Japan, adding that there took place at least 400 cases of threatening the lives of Koreans including those of tearing to pieces Korean school girls' chima and Jogori (traditional Korean jacket and long skirt) with knives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite intolerable that innocent Korean students are exposed to assaults irrespective of what has happened in the political relations between the DPRK and Japan, the speaker stated, requesting the commission to urge the Japanese government to immediately stop all forms of discrimination against the Korean students in Japan.\r\n  A delegate of the Asia-Japan Women's Volunteers' Centre charged that the Japanese government has not only hidden a lot of documents on the Second World War but connived at and supported the education of the rising generations aimed at barring them from knowing about historical facts about the war of aggression in the past such as the sexual slavery for the imperial army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The speaker queried how can the young Japanese do their bit since they have been educated in the distorted history and is it not the practice of depriving them of the rights to know about truth and live in peace with the neighboring countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan wishes to be part of the international community, it should properly approach its past wrongs and apologize for them, she held, asking the commission to urge the Japanese government to stop the acts of preventing the youngsters from knowing about truth and follow the example of other countries.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 28 (KCNA) -- An All-people oath-taking meeting against war and the U.S. and for the pullout of the U.S. troops and the defense of national independence reportedly took place on April 24 in front of the U.S. military base in Ryongsan, south Korea.\r\n It was cosponsored by the Reunification Solidarity, the South Headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification, the south Korean Federation of University Student Councils, the south Korean Federation of Peasants Associations and the south Korean Federation of the Poor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Speakers there said the security policy initiative and the meeting on strategic flexibility now going on between south Korea and the United States, the \"OPLAN 5029-05\" mapped out by the U.S, and the scheme to expand the U.S. military base in Phyongthaek are premised on the conversion of the U.S. troops in south Korea into \"an Asia-Pacific task force\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. troops in south Korea are converted into such task force for a preemptive strike at the DPRK, it will not only hurl a grave obstacle in the way of the peace and reunification on the Korean Peninsula but also bring serious disasters to the Korean nation, they warned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Stating that a decisive chance to deal a blow to the U.S. can be created only when the south and the north unite their strength, they called for an early formation of the South-North Joint Measure Committee for the Withdrawal of U.S. Forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They called upon all the people to turn out as one in the struggle to check the expansion of the U.S. military base in Phyongthaek, saying the year of the withdrawal of the U.S. forces and the year of reunification must not be chanted in words only. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the meeting the formation of a group of expeditionary trip to areas of crimes and murder committed by U.S. soldiers present in south Korea was declared by cultural organizations in Pusan and Ansan districts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the end of the meeting, its participants attempted to force their way into the U.S. military base, tearing up the U.S. flag and shouting the slogans \"We oppose war and the U.S.\", \"Let us realize  national cooperation\" and \"Let us achieve peaceful reunification by the withdrawal of the U.S. forces.\"    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japanese-Korean Woman Interviewed after Her Return Here  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 28 (KCNA) -- Japanese-Korean woman An Phil Hwa who had been abducted to Japan was interviewed by mediapersons at Pyongyang Koryo Hotel Thursday.\r\n She said at the press conference: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n I was born in Katsushika Ward, Tokyo metropolis in November 1938. In December 1959 I came to the DPRK together with my Korean husband and have since lived here for 43 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Early in December, 2002, I met a man on my way home where my daughter lived after visiting my son. The man asked me to meet my younger sister who he said had been waiting for me in a place not far away from there. Preoccupied by the eagerness to meet my younger sister, I believed what he said and was thus lured by him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In Dalian, China, Japanese journalists, officials concerned of the Japanese consulate general and Korean-speaking men affiliated to an anti-DPRK plot-breeding organization took me to Japan, taking me as \"something to cover\" and a \"bargaining chip\" to be used in their anti-DPRK campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that she was coaxed into going to Japan by those manipulated by the Japanese right-wing reactionaries to be used for an anti-DPRK smear campaign, she went on to say: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They forwarded a \"request\" concerning me to the Japanese government under the pretext of a \"humanitarian issue.\" This was an intolerable anti-DPRK operation and an abuse of my rights as it was to serve their purpose of using me for the anti-DPRK campaign against my will. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In Japan I lived in a rented room. Destitution forced me to work as a cleaner at a race-course. Those from Korea are usually subject to discrimination in Japan. It is hard for them to get jobs there and they are paid less than Japanese. Defectors from the DPRK earn their living by providing misinformation to anti-DPRK organizations there. Even Japanese say that it is hard to distinguish truth from lies because they tell too many lies about the \"abduction issue.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though I was born in Japan, I had hardly any affection for it.  It was like a land alien to me. I grew increasingly disillusioned with the Japanese society bereft of humanity and morality and missed very much my family members and the close neighbors in the DPRK who were helping each other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nUpon hearing news that my son and daughter are living as usual free from any discrimination and my grandchildren are studying at universities, I could neither sleep nor eat with an easy mind. I have learned the truth of life that the land where my family members live in harmony, inhabitants help and lead each other forward and a worthwhile life is guaranteed is my motherland although they are not fed and clad well.\r\n 43 years in the DPRK have been the happiest and most fruitful days in my life. My grandchildren's happy life and study at universities would be unthinkable without leader Kim Jong Il's all-embracing benevolent politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The press conference was attended by mediapersons in Pyongyang, foreign correspondents and officials in charge of the press of different embassies here.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
