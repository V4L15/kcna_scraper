            "content": "Japan emerges dangerous war force \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 18 (KCNA) -- The Japanese reactionary ruling quarters are hell-bent on establishing a wartime system as evidenced by the legalization of the overseas dispatch of the \"Self-Defense Forces\" (SDF), the preparations stepped up by them for actions of aggression troops, taking the U.S. war against terrorism as a good chance, and the fascistization of the domestic policy.   In this regard Rodong Sinmun today says in a signed article:\r\n The article of Japan's constitution banning a war is now defunct. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government and the ruling party passed through the diet the bill on the dispatch of \"SDF\" abroad, a bill on the revision of the \"law on the SDF\" and a bill allowing the SDF to open fire at \"unidentified ships,\" the three bills for a war of reinvasion included in \"the anti-terrorism special law,\" under the pretext of \"supporting the u.s. forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The legalization of the dispatch of Japan's troops abroad made the article of the constitution banning Japan's possession of the army and a war defunct. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The exercise of \"collective right of self-defense\" has also been legalized to enable Japan to dispatch the SDF abroad to participate in combat operations under the pretext of \"supporting\" the U.S. forces though it is not threatened by any outside attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan, the world's second largest state in military spending, is hastening its preparations for the dispatch of its aggression forces abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government decided to send an additional fleet of warships including ultra-modern \"aegis\" to the Indian Ocean by late November to join the U.S. in its war against terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Three warships of Japan have already been dispatched there recently. The maritime \"Self-Defense Force\" is scheduled to conduct a joint exercise with southeast Asian countries in December. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The air SDF is getting ready to send transport planes to Pakistan while the ground SDF decided to send troops to East Timor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the spurs put by Japan to establishing a wartime system including the stepped-up militarization and fascistization of the country and moves to revise the \"law on emergency,\" the article notes: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has emerged the most dangerous aggressor and war force threatening the peace in Asia and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n History clearly proves that a war of aggression leads Japan only to destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This reality signifies a prelude to Japan's tragedy.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
