Charter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these are an undeniable and indelible part of the world history of the 20th century. it does not make any sense to write down the history of Japan in the first half of the 20th century without referring to those crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the Japanese right-wing reactionary forces have persisted in their moves to teach young Japanese distorted history and the Japanese government has gone the length of officially joining in those moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The government connived at and backed the reactionary moves to rewrite history textbooks from the outset and finally justified and legalized them, thus committing one more unpardonable crime before humankind and history in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan will have to pay a very high price for such anachronistic acts.    \r\n\r\n"
