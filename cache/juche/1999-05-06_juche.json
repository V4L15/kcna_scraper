He noted with great satisfaction that the employees of the fish farm have supplied lots of freshwater fishes to people and soldiers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The officials and workers of the fish farm, he said, should put the fish culture on a scientific and technical basis to further increase fish production and, at the same time, make a rational and effective use of water to breed much more fishes of various species.   After going round the fish farm, he proposed highly important tasks which will serve as a guideline in further developing the nation's fish culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Noting that our country has favourable conditions for fish culture as it abounds in rivers and lakes and resources of spring water suitable for raising such fishes of high quality as char and rainbow trout, he said only if officials carry on a well-organized work and make energetic efforts it is possible to produce a great deal of freshwater fishes with less cost.   He underscored the need to build many new fish farms after surveying all places suitable for raising fishes including streams of spring water so as to breed fishes wherever there is water.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Jong Il elaborated on increasing the efficiency of fish culture, establishing a system of food production and supply, intensifying scientific researches into fish culture and on introducing advanced method of fish breeding.\r\n   He earnestly instructed all domains and units to raise fish in a nationwide movement and thus realize as early as possible what the  President Kim Il Sung had wished so ardently in his lifetime to supply the people with more fishes. \r\n\r\n"

This is, however, a ridiculous farce, the commentary observes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It continues:   The United States and Japan are putting spurs to maneuverings to unleash a war of aggression on Korea and the plan for major military exercises is part of them.\r\n   U.S.-Japan joint military drills are  fraught with  potential danger in their scale, offensive character and criminal  aim.   What should not go unnoticed is that the \"SDF's\"  maneuvers hold a big proportion in the joint military drills.\r\n   What merits a particular attention is maneuvers  of the ground \"SDF\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The original strategy suggested by the Japan \"SDF\" was to defeat the enemy in Japan proper, which was  replaced by a new one in 1985 the aim of which was to wipe out the enemy at sea.\" it means the  shift of battle fields to sea from Japan proper.\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries consider the ground \"SDF\" to be the weakest link of their strategy. Hence, they have intensified the ground \"SDF's\" maneuvers in recent years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The ground \"SDF\" built an exercise base in Hokkaido  which has weather and topographical conditions similar to those of Korea and  let units stationed in Japan proper undergo training there twice a year so as to get them familiar with  the conditions of a real war in the Korean peninsula.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The situation  is growing more tense on the Korean peninsula due to the criminal attempt of the Japanese reactionaries to launch a reinvasion.\r\nThe DPRK is fully prepared to  promptly frustrate  any surprise preemptive attack of the enemy. \r\n\r\n"
