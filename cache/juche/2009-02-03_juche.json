            "content": "Kim Jong Il Provides Field Guidance to Co-op Farm\r\nPyongyang, February 3 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il gave on-the-spot guidance to the Tongbong Co-op Farm in Hamju County.\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Kim Ki Nam, secretary of the WPK Central Committee.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Jong Il looked round the monument to President Kim Il Sung's field guidance and the room dedicated to the history of the farm.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He recalled with deep emotion the proud course covered by the farm, saying that the farm, which was once called a barren land, a place unfit for human inhabitation, had turned into a paradise of happiness enjoying rich harvest under the wise leadership and meticulous care of the President.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Being briefed on the farm before the map on its panoramic view, he learned in detail about the construction of the farm village.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed great satisfaction over the fact that the village has been turned into a beautiful rural town, after looking at the modern dwelling houses lined up at the foot of Mt. Tongbong and cosy and neat school, kindergarten, people's hospital, cultural hall, shop and other cultural and welfare facilities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round the Tongbong shop located in the heart of the village, he learned about the supply of commodities to the farmers and indicated the orientation and ways for further improving the supply of goods.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He met and had a cordial talk with Mun Kum Nyo, a woman of merit in the Songun era, and highly praised her for having faithfully discharged her duty as a workteam head for decades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t One of the most important problems in opening the gate to a great prosperous and powerful nation is to boost the agricultural production, he said, advancing the tasks to be fulfilled by the farm.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The main factor that helped radically increase the farm produce on the Tongbong Co-op Farm in recent years lies in the fact that the farm has thoroughly implemented the policy of bringing about innovation in the selection of seed, he said, stressing the need to steadily push ahead with the drive to introduce the good seeds suited to the climate and soil of the farm by giving full play to the creativeness of the officials and agricultural working people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that a key to solving the food problem in our country where crop area is circumscribed is to decisively increase the per-hectare grain yield. To this end, it is necessary to steadily increase the fertility of soil and, at the same time, do farming on a scientific and technological basis as required by the Juche method of farming, he stressed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The comprehensive mechanization of agriculture should be realized to successfully ease the strain on the labor force in keeping pace with the steady increase of the level of intensification and scientification of agriculture, he said, showing deep love and benevolence for the farm by making it sure that necessary machines are provided.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that a solid foundation for radically boosting the agricultural production has been laid through the dynamic drive for rural construction in different parts of the country in recent years of trials and hardships, he said that this signal achievement serves as a sure guarantee for successfully building a thriving nation by finally solving the agricultural problem, the problem of peasants and the rural question in our country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said: The three revolutions are being dynamically carried out in the countryside and the support to it and the state guidance to the co-op farms have been intensified. Thus, the assimilation of farmers to the working class and the industrialization of agriculture have been rapidly realized and the appearance of the countryside renewed with each passing day, considerably decreasing the distinctions between towns and the countryside.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a vivid manifestation of the validity and the great vitality of the socialist rural theses set forth by the President and the advantageous socialist agricultural system in our country, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Stating that the drive for rural construction is a sacred work to turn our countryside into affluent and modern socialist countryside equipped with state-of-the-art technology, he called for directing sustained and big efforts to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The agricultural front is one of the major fronts for the building of a great prosperous and powerful nation, he said, urging the whole country and all the people to continue concentrating all-out efforts on farming so as to bring about a radical turn in the agricultural production."

This is a challenge and insult to those Koreans who have unhesitatingly dedicated even their lives to the struggle to achieve the country's reunification, opposed to the division of the country for more than half a century, and the most unpardonable act of treachery aimed at turning the back the wheel of history.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Tuesday observes this in a signed commentary. It goes on: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since its appearance at a time when all the compatriots were confidently advancing towards a new era of independent reunification, peace and prosperity the Lee Myung Bak regime has rushed headlong into the moves to bring back the era of fascist dictatorship and the inter-Korean confrontation in total negation of the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration, the great programmes for independent reunification. In consequence, the inter-Korean relations have reached the brink of war, leaving neither way to bring them under control nor any hope to improve them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK followed with patience the challenge the Lee regime made, denying everything positive that had taken place in the inter-Korean relations since the publication of the June 15 declaration after its emergence in south Korea last year and repeatedly advised it to make a genuine policy switchover for the sake of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the Lee group has kept to the road of serving foreign forces, not the road of cooperation between compatriots, and to the road of inter-Korean confrontation, not the road of national unity, lending no ear to the magnanimous urge of the DPRK and its just warnings. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group's persistent opposition to the moves to improve the inter-Korean relations is not simply aimed at perpetuating the division of the country and delaying its reunification. Its gravity lies in that it is a factor of escalating the political and military confrontation between the north and the south and bringing irrevocable national disasters. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK told the south Korean authorities more than once that the inter-Korean relations should be developed on the basis of the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration on the principle of \"By our nation itself\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group, however, has worked hard to escalate the confrontation with the DPRK, lending a deaf ear to all its advices. This is, in fact, a declaration on severing the relations with it and an undisguised challenge to it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under this situation, one can hardly speak of national reunification and everything between the north and the south has been brought to naught. The Lee group will be held accountable for this before history and the nation."

            "content": "Lee Group's Unpopular Stand on Tragic Incident Flailed\r\nPyongyang, February 3 (KCNA) -- The tragedy in Ryongsan of south Korea is not a tragedy that occurred by accident but a tragic murder perpetrated under the unpopular rule of the Lee Myung Bak fascist \"pragmatic regime.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Tuesday observes this in a signed commentary.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Explaining the reason why the tragedy occurred, the proceeding of evacuees' protest and how it was suppressed, the commentary says that traitor Lee is behind the brutal crackdown. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This being a hard reality, \"Chongwadae\" and the \"Grand National Party\" gentries have the effrontery to talk about \"force behind the scene,\" openly defending the killers instead of punishing them. This is a revelation of their criminal intention to divert elsewhere the angry public criticism of the perpetrators of the above-said murder and gloss over the case at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group remains unperturbed by the death of innocent people and is keen to pass the buck for it to the victims. This fully discloses its unpopular attitude and stand. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has become clearer that traitor Lee's \"pragmatic policy\" is nothing but an unpopular fascist rule utterly indifferent to people's lives and interests and a man-killing policy of turning the whole of south Korea into a tundra of human rights and a graveyard of democracy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said tragedy teaches the south Korean people once again the bitter lesson that they can neither realize their strong desire for independence, democracy and national reunification nor protect their lives as long as the above-mentioned \"fascist regime\" is allowed to ride roughshod. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean people's resentment at the Lee group is running high as it has enforced such unpopular misrule since it came to power. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Neither appeasement nor deception nor fascist suppression on the part of the group of traitors can calm down the angry south Koreans."

            "content": "Lee's Loudmouthed \"Resumption of Red Cross Dialogue\" Ridiculed\r\nPyongyang, February 3 (KCNA) -- Recently Lee Myung Bak was reported to have instructed the puppet president of the Red Cross to \"resume south-north Red Cross dialogue\" and expressed \"his hope\" that \"it would have dialogue with initiative\".\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on this, Minju Joson Tuesday observes: Had Lee felt even an iota of sense of shame, he should have apologized to the nation for having driven the inter-Korean relations to catastrophe before talking about \"the resumption of Red Cross dialogue\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Citing facts to prove that far from doing so, Lee brought to light his ulterior intention to further bedevil the inter-Korean relations this year, blaring that the said relations cannot be improved through cooperation, the commentary goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What he is seeking through his talk about \"resumption of Red Cross dialogue\" is to shift the blame for driving the inter-Korean relations to catastrophe onto others and divert elsewhere the bitter criticism of him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sinister aim sought by Lee in calling for the resumption of the above-said dialogue is proved by the fact that he appointed Hyon In Thaek who conceived the watchwords \"no nukes, opening and 3,000 dollars\" aimed at confrontation with fellow countrymen as minister of \"Unification\" whose job is to handle issues concerning the inter-Korean relations. It is needless to say that Lee's talk is nothing but a deliberate scheme to put a bar on the gate to inter-Korean dialogue. Such being a hard fact, \"resumption of Red Cross dialogue\" touted by him is a criminal act of mocking at the people's mindset.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He is working hard to use the issue of resumption of inter-Korean dialogue as a lever for tiding over his ruling crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is as clear as noonday that inter-Korean dialogue can never be resumed as long as the crafty political swindler remains in power as his deeds do not agree with his words. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee would be well advised to stop trumpeting about \"the resumption of dialogue\" as he is not entitled to say anything about it and step down as demanded by the people."
