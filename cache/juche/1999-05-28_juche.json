It is clear that the Japanese reactionaries who have made the legislation, a wartime law, will work hard to implement it. The implementation of the legislation just means overseas aggression.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Thus, the Japanese \"Self-Defence Forces\" have come to set out on overseas aggression as they wish with the backing of the U.S.  Their first target is the Korean peninsula.   As the Japanese reactionaries are openly crying, the \"emergencies\" in areas surrounding Japan mean the \"emergencies\" on the Korean peninsula.   In case the U.S. unleash a second war of aggression on Korea, the Japanese reactionaries will take part in it and cooperate with them and carry into practice their ambition for aggression.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They intend to invade Korea, a vantage-point of geopolitical, military and strategical importance, use it for a bridgehead for aggression on Asia and thus set out on the road of the all-out aggression on Asia as they did in the past.\r\nOur revolutionary armed forces and people are resolved to deal thousand-fold retaliatory strikes at the Japanese reactionaries and mercilessly wipe them out once they train the fuse of reinvasion again, forgetting the lesson of their past defeat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries must ponder over consequences to be entailed by their moves for reinvasion.\r\n   They must not precipitate a second defeat day by themselves. \r\n\r\n"

It is no more than a pretext to justify its nuclear arms build-up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Now in the world there is no nation that attempts to wage a war against the United States and its allies or to launch a nuclear attack at them.\r\n   That is why it can never be justifiable for the United States to increase nuclear arsenals and regards nuclear weapons as a \"deterrent\" means and \"security umbrella\" to cope with \"challenges\" and \"threats\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Since its nuclear opponent has disappeared after the end of the Cold War, the United States has expanded the theatre of nuclear strategy to a global scale and regards as its objects of nuclear strategy the developing countries and, in particular, the countries that go against the  grain with it and stand in the way of establishing the U.S.-led unipolar world order.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This illustrates that the U.S. nuclear threat has gone beyond a specific object and a specific region in the Cold War era and expanded to the world's scale, many countries and peoples being targets of U.S. nuclear offensive.\r\n   Now the Korean peninsula is a region ridden with the biggest danger of a nuclear war in the world because the spearhead of the U.S. nuclear strategy has been directed to Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The fiction of the DPRK's \"missile threat\" and \"nuclear suspicion\" loudmouthed by the United States is to invent an excuse for a nuclear preemptive attack on the DPRK.\r\n   The United States, who is the most dangerous nuclear criminal and the enemy of peace, is sure to be punished by history. \r\n\r\n"
