Under this situation, arms of justice should be upheld to defend each country and realize its people's independence. The popular masses' independence is guaranteed by the arms. Strong military power is a military foundation of an independent and sovereign state. Without military strength, is it impossible to protect the sovereignty of a country and a nation.

Independence can never be protected in words and prosperity and development of a country cannot be achieved by solicitation. Military strength is the most powerful guarantee for sovereignty of each country and nation and their prosperity and development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The desire of humankind to lead a happy life in a free and peaceful world has not yet been realized due to the imperialist reactionaries' moves, whereby danger of war is being created in different regions including Asia, Africa and Latin America and the independent rights of sovereign states violated. So, Songun is the only way for saving the above-said situation and realizing the human cause of independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Songun is the way of staunch struggle making it possible to fight against imperialism with toughest stand. The Korean people have triumphantly advanced always along the road of socialism thanks to the most powerful and superior Songun policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The forces for independence against imperialism, the progressive humankind, should firmly take arms to cope with any moves of the imperialists. Military strength is decisive of ensuring the human cause of independence in the present times when a life-and-death confrontation is taking place with arms. Songun helps provide a solid foundation for strengthening the driving force for the human cause of independence and steadily enhance its role.

This is the view and contention the U.S. imperialists' domination over south Korea implanted into the minds of the aggressor forces and criminals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is due to the shackling alliance between the U.S. and south Korea and the way of thinking of the occupation forces enjoying extraterritorial rights that there occurred in an unbroken chain such inhumane atrocities as evidenced by the fact that a soldier of the aggressor troops slapped a former lawmaker of south Korea on the face in broad daylight, an armored car drove over young schoolgirls to death and a GI raped an old woman. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is a problem which should not be overlooked as far as GI crimes are concerned. The pro-U.S. right-wing conservative forces in south Korea including the Grand National Party (GNP) protect such group of criminals as their ancestral tablet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people can expect neither genuine human rights nor social progress as long as the U.S. imperialists' policy of occupation of south Korea persists and the pro-U.S. conservative forces including the GNP are allowed to run wild, backed by them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fact that the above-said old woman was sexually abused by a GI brought the same disgrace and misfortune to the nation as the murder of the schoolgirls by the armored vehicle.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Who on earth would treat such country cordially? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the proverb \"It is like beating the air\" goes, permanent membership of the UNSC is hardly obtainable for the island country as it remains distrusted by the international community for having refused to draw a lesson from its crime-woven past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A guilty party is obliged to make due apology and compensation for any wrong doing. This is an elementary practice and morality to prevail not only in the relationship between individuals but between countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an unavoidable legal and moral responsibility for the land of Japs to honestly apologize and compensate for the crimes it committed against the Korean and other Asians in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There can be no the present apart from the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an impudent, reckless and ridiculous act for the land of Japs to try to hold a responsible post at the UN though it has neither fulfilled its commitment to redress its past crimes nor shaken off its ill-fame of being a war criminal state. The authorities in the land of Japs should bear in mind that they can hardly obtain any post unless it is trusted by the international community. The more impudently they behave, failing to fulfill any commitment, the bitterer shame they will suffer under the eyes of the world.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is none other than the U.S. imperialists who are bringing dark clouds of confrontation and war over the Korean Peninsula under the pretext of fictitious \"threat\" from the DPRK and it is again them who are egging the ultra-right conservative forces including the \"Grand National Party\" on to set off the counter wind of fascism and anti-reunification. The GNP traitors, with the backing of the U.S, imperialists, are making last-ditch efforts to drive back the June 15 era of reunification to the era of confrontation. This being the situation, the cause of independent reunification promoted by the Korean nation itself is facing a grave challenge and snag. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality shows that the advance of the June 15 era of reunification is accompanied by a life-and-death confrontation with separatist forces within and without standing in its way.

Dialogue and military actions can never go together. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. talks a lot about \"dialogue\" and \"negotiations\" at the negotiating table but, in actuality, persists in their moves to strangle the DPRK by force of arms.
