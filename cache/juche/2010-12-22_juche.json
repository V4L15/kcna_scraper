He walked round the construction site to learn in detail about the project.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Making the rounds of construction sites alive with a high-pitched labor drive, he was greatly pleased with the rapid progress made in the project.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The devoted drive of the builders of the power station including soldier-builders who created the Huichon speed, a new Chollima speed, opened a bright prospect for finishing the huge construction before 2012, he said, extending warm salute to all the soldier builders working hard in the revolutionary soldier spirit and the spirit of fortitude. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to the heroic struggle of the soldier builders, the power station will be completed before long, causing a large man-made lake to appear, he said, once again earnestly calling on them to make a courageous last charge to bring earlier the day of completion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Appreciating pencil drawings and other literary and art pieces created by soldier-builders in the stirring construction site, he heard beautiful stories about them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He indicated important tasks to serve as guidelines for completing the power station earlier than scheduled.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to meet rapidly growing demand for electricity, it is necessary to increase power production and, at the same time, build more power stations in different parts of the country, he said, adding that it is of particularly weighty importance to finish the above-said power station with high capacity in a short span of time. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underscored the need to wage a great offensive by mobilizing the whole party and army and all the people in order to wind up the construction of the power station before the centenary of birth of President Kim Il Sung. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed the need to pay particular attention to providing the builders with good living conditions including lodging so that they may not feel any slightest inconvenience.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Kim Jong Un, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission of the WPK, Kim Kyong Hui, member of the Political Bureau and department director of the C.C., the WPK, Jang Song Thaek, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the C.C., the WPK and vice-chairman of the NDC, Pak To Chun, Choe Ryong Hae, Thae Jong Su, and Kim Phyong Hae, alternate members of the Political Bureau and secretaries of the C.C., the WPK, and Hyon Chol Hae and Ri Myong Su, department directors of the NDC."

The forum was held on December 17 as an event of the 17th world festival of youth and students.\n\t\t\t\t\t The attendants of the forum indicted the U.S. for its hideous act of keeping the Korean nation divided into two and inflicting untold misfortune and pain upon it and strongly demanded the U.S. troops immediately pull out of the Korean Peninsula, according to the appeal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They were unanimous in that the three principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity laid down by President Kim Il Sung serve as immutable guidelines for reunifying the country.  They also spoke highly of General Secretary Kim Jong Il for ushering in the new era of independent reunification with his Songun politics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We appreciate that thanks to the historic north-south summit and the publication of the June 15 joint declaration ten years ago, the north-south relations turned to those guided by the spirit of \"By our nation itself\" from those of distrust and confrontation and signal changes were brought to the Korean nation's history of the reunification movement. We were firmly convinced that the only way to put an end to the history of north-south confrontation and reunify the country is to implement the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration, a programme for implementing it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The appeal called on the world progressive youth and students to wage a widespread international solidarity movement for the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It called for escalating the international pressure on the U.S. to pull out of south Korea and support the Korean people's struggle to establish lasting peace-keeping mechanism on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The appeal called for dealing sledge blows at the U.S. and the Lee authorities as they cooked up such thrice-cursed hideous farce as the warship sinking case, pushing the inter-Korean relations into total collapse, and perpetrated such reckless military provocation as the Yonphyong Island shelling incident, driving the situation on the peninsula to the brink of a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It underscored the need to wage a more dynamic international solidarity movement for the purpose of positively supporting the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration as the most fair and aboveboard programme for reunification and making sure that they are steadily carried out. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The appeal expressed the conviction that the youth and students and all other peace-loving people the world over would become louder in their voices expressing international solidarity with the Korean people's just struggle against the moves of the U.S. and its followers for a war of aggression."
