Convinced that the implementation of the Juche-oriented line of the Korean revolution advanced by President Kim Il Sung was precisely the way for the resurrection of the nation, she hardened her mind to dedicate her youth and life to the struggle for protecting the leader of the revolution with her very life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the grim days of the anti-Japanese war, she, with a thorough-going thought that any slightest mistake should not be permitted in guarding the President, frustrated at every step the enemy's wicked scheme to hurt the revolutionary headquarters at camping sites and on march. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She guarded the safety of the President with her body on the fierce battlefields including the battles at the entrance to Dashahe, Fusong County Seat and Hongqihe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She also regarded supporting the revolutionary idea of the President as the loftiest and honorable duty of the soldiers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She resolutely struggled against the renegades of the revolution who were frightened by the enemy's bluff in the period of the most difficult trial during the anti-Japanese armed struggle and thus defended the purity of the revolutionary ideas of the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She also set a brilliant example in thoroughly carrying out the revolutionary line and operational plan of the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She was often assigned important duties of political work from the President and conducted activities for awakening and organizing masses in vast areas and the homeland, making a special contribution to expanding the Association for the Restoration of the Fatherland, promoting the preparatory work for founding the Party and to maturing the all-people resistance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When she was given a task to make 600 suits of military uniform in a month, she, together with several sewing members, fulfilled the task with poor sewing tools only in 20 days. Like this, she devotedly carried out the orders given by the President, thus becoming the brilliant paragon to be followed by the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She invariably paid special attention to protecting the safety of the President as a \"bodyguard\" in the years of building a new country and exerted her heart and soul to accomplish his nation-building line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Indeed, the noble feat performed by Kim Jong Suk to protect the fortune of the Korean people who were blessed with the illustrious leader President Kim Il Sung peerless in the 5,000-year-long history of the nation by devotedly defending him will shine for ever in the history of the fatherland.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
