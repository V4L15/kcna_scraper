            "content": "Japan urged to stop acting rashly \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 19 (KCNA) -- Japan is stepping up the joint research into the ballistic missile defense technology with the United States under the pretext of a \"missile threat from North  Korea\", while contemplating the introduction of the interceptor missile system from the U.S. to make up a \"vacuum\" to be created before its actual deployment.\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' hue and cry over the \"missile threat\" from the DPRK only compels the DPRK to heighten its vigilance as it betrays their reckless intention not to redress Japan's past crimes but reinvade the DPRK, still considering the DPRK as an \"enemy\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's missile program is of purely peaceful nature and does not pose a threat to anyone. It is the DPRK's legitimate exercise of its sovereign right to go ahead with its missile program of peaceful nature. The DPRK's armed forces show no mercy to those provoking it but it does not use force against anyone who does not hurt it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan is friendly toward the DPRK, it does not need to fear the DPRK's missile program and its efforts to increase its defence capability at all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is in a great hurry to introduce the U.S. interceptor missile system not because of the \"missile threat\" from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the black-hearted intention of the Japanese reactionaries to realize their wild ambition for reinvasion of Korea by taking advantage of the U.S. policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they act without discretion, bereft of reason, they will suffer an irrevocable setback. If Japan, unaware where it stands, keeps acting recklessly, toeing the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK, it will have to pay dearly for it. The Japanese reactionaries are well advised to behave with decorum, properly assessing the situation.    \r\n\r\n"

They are quite unrealistic and illogical. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. hardline conservatives' assertion that North Korea poses a threat to the U.S. is sheer sophism which reminds one of a thief crying \"stop the thief\" and which can convince no one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We would like to strongly demand once again the U.S. hardline conservatives clearly understand the socialist system in the DPRK and behave with decorum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This system is not the kind of which they think. It is foolish of them to contend that the socialist system in the DPRK can exist only under their protection or with their aid. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ours is Korean-style socialism centered on the popular masses chosen and built by the Korean people under the banner of the great Juche idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our socialism remains indestructable as long as there are the great army-based policy and single-hearted unity. This is the unshakable faith and courage of the servicemen and people of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. hardline conservatives' attempt to destroy this socialism is as foolish an act as trying to sweep the sea with a broom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to clearly face up to the reality and behave with decorum.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Provocative Rsoi flailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 19 (KCNA) -- The U.S. and South Korean warhawks started Rsoi, a new South Korea-U.S. joint military drill, today while staging a provocative Foal Eagle war exercise in full swing. The U.S. imperialists decided to resume the espionage flight against the DPRK by use of RC-135 strategic reconnaissance plane and hurled stealth fighter bombers into the war exercises.\r\n The evermore reckless saber-rattling of the U.S. imperialists is, in a nutshell, a premeditated move to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The news analyst goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Adventurous war exercises which are little short of a test nuclear war against the DPRK are going on and aerial espionage on it is being escalated at a time when an aircraft carrier, strategic bombers, stealth fighters and other nuclear attack means are being amassed in and around South Korea. This alarming development can never be overlooked as it cannot be interpreted as a mere military threat to the DPRK or a demonstration of U.S. military muscle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is painting North Korea as a \"dangerous state\" while vociferating about its nuclear issue. As shown, it is none other than the U.S. that seeks to unleash a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula and disturbs the peace in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has steadily soured the nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula while turning aside the DPRK-U.S. direct dialogue and the proposal for concluding a non-aggression treaty between them, the only solution to the nuclear issue. It admits of no argument that the ulterior aim sought by the U.S. in that move is to ignite a nuclear war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. frantic war exercises targeted against the DPRK are intolerable acts of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any attempt of the U.S. to mount a nuclear attack on the DPRK will meet a merciless retaliation by its powerful means. \r\n\r\n"
