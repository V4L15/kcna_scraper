In consequence those countries aspiring after justice and taking the road of independence are falling victim to interference in their internal affairs, military aggression, economic sanctions and blockade and other high-handed practices perpetrated under the pretexts of \"protection of human rights\", \"non-proliferation of mass destruction weapons\", etc. and even listed as targets of preemptive nuclear attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These disturbing developments in various parts of the world, a product of unilateralism, and the grave situation prevailing on the Korean peninsula, in particular, clearly prove the vitality and validity of the DPRK's Songun politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK government recently put forward broad-minded and flexible proposals to settle the nuclear issue and reap substantial results prompted by a sincere desire to contribute to peace and security on the Korean peninsula, Northeast Asia and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's proposal for \"reward for freeze\", the first-phase action for a package solution on the principle of simultaneous actions, is the only way of settling the nuclear issue stage by stage as it took into consideration the actual situation where there is no confidence between the DPRK and the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula will find a smooth solution should the U.S. commit itself to drop its hostile policy toward the DPRK and take practical measures for reward for freeze on the principle of \"words for words\" and \"action for action.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reunification of Korea is the long-cherished desire of the Korean nation and an essential requirement for durable peace and security on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The June 15 North-South Joint Declaration whose basic idea is national independence and great national unity is a declaration on national independence and peaceful reunification as it calls for rejecting foreign interference and achieving national reunification by the concerted efforts of the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He extended thanks to the governments of the member countries of the NAM for having supported the Korean people in their cause of the national reunification and expressed hope and belief that they would continue to do so in the future, too.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Desperately pursuing, among other things, unilateralism, arbitrariness and military strong-arm policy, the United States is wantonly encroaching upon the sovereignty and independence of sovereign states and harassing the order of peace. This has created a complicate situation in different regions and confusion and instability across the world. The situation and reality today make it urgent for the non-aligned movement to enhance its role as an independent political force, a mighty anti-imperialist revolutionary force in the era of independence. The non-aligned countries should actively encourage the movement to fulfill its duty and mission and intensify their struggle for independence against imperialism, peace against war with united efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the steadfast external policy of the DPRK to strive to materialize the noble idea of the movement and strengthen and develop it. The DPRK will as ever remain loyal to the principles and idea of the movement and work energetically for a closer unity and cooperation among all the non-aligned countries and the advance and victory of the cause of global independence.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

According to him, 15 days after its seeds are sown in a bed, its seedlings are transplanted in plots. It takes 35-40 days for the cabbage to grow enough for harvest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In case the cabbage is sown to be harvested in the middle of August, its output is 30 tons per hectare. And that in the middle of September and October is 40-60 and 60-80 tons respectively. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The new species is proof against a high degree of humidity. It is little different from the autumn cabbage in content of low molecule organic compounds such as vitamin C, valuable elements and sugar. It, with a small amount of cellulose, is soft and tasty.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
