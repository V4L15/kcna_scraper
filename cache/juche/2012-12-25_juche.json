Paektu along the road indicated by General Secretary Kim Jong Il, is triumphantly advancing, they noted, and continued: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un strengthened the KPA to be scouts and strong mainstay for the Songun revolution and provided original Songun leadership, performing undying exploits in the history of building the revolutionary armed forces of Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He wisely led the launching of satellite Kwangmyongsong 3-2 to success, thus demonstrating the overall national power of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il's Korea and bringing about a great victory of Songun Korea which brilliantly decorated this significant year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The workers and the members of trade unions should become passionate fighters and Songun revolutionary comrades who protect Kim Jong Un politico-ideologically and at the risk of their lives and devotedly implement the line of the party."
