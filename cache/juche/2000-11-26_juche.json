            "content": "Great national unity \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 26 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article says that the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation and the five-point policy of great national unity serve as a patriotic banner for achieving the unity of the Korean nation and accelerating national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is essential, indeed, for achieving the independent and peaceful reunification of the country by the efforts of the Korean nation and shaping its future destiny to uphold this programme and policy, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The programme and policy clarify that the general goal of great national unity is to build a pan-national reunified state, and patriotism and the spirit of national independence are the ideological basis of great national unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They also say that the principle to be adhered to in achieving great national unity is for all classes and strata to place the common interests of the nation above all, promote coexistence, co-prosperity and common interests and channel all efforts into accomplishing the cause of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to achieve national harmony and reunification under the situation where two differing ideologies and systems exist in the north and the south of Korea it is necessary to build a federal state in which the north and the south are represented by the two governments on an equal footing, a pan-national reunified state representing all members of the nation, on condition that the north and the south tolerate the existing two systems and two governments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no other way than this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All members of the Korean nation in the north, the south and abroad have stronger patriotism and higher spirit of national independence than any other nations. This precisely serves as a solid ideological basis of the great unity of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The validity and tremendous vitality of the programme and the policy have been fully proved by the historic Pyongyang meeting and the publication of the north-south joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north, the south and abroad can achieve true national unity when they unite under the banner of patriotism and national reunification irrespective of ideology, system, political view, religious belief and interests of classes and strata, the article concludes. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. urged to fulfil its commitments in good faith \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 26 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today carries a signed commentary accusing the United States of delaying the construction of light water reactors (LWR) it committed itself to provide to the DPRK though six years have passed since the adoption of the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is one of the key articles of the agreed framework calling for simultaneous actions on the part of the two sides that the United States should build a LWR power station with a capacity of two million kw and hand it over to the DPRK by 2003 in a responsible manner, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is wholly to blame for the delay of the project. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States set about the project without sincerity from its outset and has not done what it should do on one pretext or other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States seeks an ulterior aim in delaying the project deliberately. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By dragging on the project it is attempting to block the development of the independent nuclear power industry in the DPRK, weaken its economic and military potentials and watch for a chance to stifle it by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This perfidious action on the part of the U.S. has brought a great economic loss to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the United States continues to remain insincere in implementing the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework. Not giving up its sinister purpose, the DPRK will take a corresponding measure. This will be an exercise of its right on the principle of simultaneous action. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
