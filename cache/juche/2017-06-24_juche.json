Korean Authorities\r\n Pyongyang, June 24 (KCNA) -- The Consultative Council for National Reconciliation (CCNR) issued an open questionnaire addressed to the south Korean authorities on Friday.\n\t\t\t\t\t In the questionnaire, the Council said that the statement of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Country of the DPRK, which clarified the principled stand to usher in a new era for the improved north-south relations and independent reunification on the basis of the noble idea of By Our Nation Itself on the occasion of the 17th anniversary of the June 15 joint declaration, has commanded unanimous support of all the fellow countrymen in the north and the south and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the present south Korean authorities keep mum about the fundamental and principled issue for improvement of the north-south relations, reading the faces of the U.S. and the conservative group, and do not hesitate to reveal their scheme for sanctions and pressure on the DPRK, finding fault with its legitimate step for bolstering the nuclear force for self-defense, it pointed out.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that due to such irresolute and inappropriate attitude, the north-south relations still fail to escape from the mire of catastrophe even an inch, in like manner as the period of the conservative regime, the CCNR made the following open questionnaire to the south Korean authorities in the name of the whole nation:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Do you have a willingness to reject cooperation with foreign forces and solve the north-south relations independently on the basis of the idea of By Our Nation Itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Can you make a decision to stop the south Korea-U.S. joint military exercises, main factor of aggravating the situation on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Do you have a will to unconditionally stop all sorts of mud-slinging inciting mistrust and animosity between the fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t4. Can you respond to the DPRK's stand on taking practical measures to remove military conflicts between the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t5. Are you ready to come out for a dialogue with the DPRK, without raising \"the north's nuclear issue\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t6. Can you retract the stand for \"sanctions and pressure accompanied by dialogue\", recognizing that it would only worsen the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t7. Can you take bold steps to liquidate the wrongdoings of the conservative group of traitors that brought catastrophic results--total rupture of the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t8. Can you show their willingness for improved north-south relations by repatriating DPRK women citizens who were abducted by the conservative group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t9. Can you actively join in the unanimous desire and efforts of all the fellow countrymen in the north and the south and overseas for holding a pan-national conference.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should give definite answers to these questions reflecting the will of the whole nation, mindful that all Koreans are watching their attitude, the Council stressed."

And prior to the Korean war, its State Department formed groups in charge of preparing documents and resolutions to be presented and adopted at the UNSC and UN General Assembly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On the eve of the war, American warmonger Dulles promised traitor Syngman Rhee of south Korea that if the south Korean puppet army held out for only two weeks after the war outbreak, the U.S., in the meantime, would prosecute north Korea for attacking the south at the UN and pressure the UN into mobilizing multinational forces in the name of UN.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On June 25, 1950, the south Korean puppet clique unleashed a war against the DPRK at the instigation of the U.S. imperialists. At the same time, the U.S. imperialists brought the issue of Korean war to the UNSC and railroaded the resolution No. 82 to brand the DPRK as an \"aggressor\". And on June 27, they cooked up the UN resolution No. 83 to justify their armed intervention in the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On July 7, the U.S. imperialists convened a UNSC meeting again to adopt an illegal \"decision\" on organizing the U.S.-led \"UN forces\" by using their yes-men.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thus, one third of the U.S. ground force, one fifth of its air force and most of its Pacific Fleet and troops from its 15 satellite countries, including UK, France, Canada and Turkey, were fed into the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All these facts clearly show that the U.S. imperialists are the provoker of the Korean War."

The British magazine Economist claimed that the U.S. could not but ignite a war as something sensational was badly needed for it to tide over its crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Van Fleet, a defeated general of the U.S., asserted that if it had not been Korea, another country should have fallen victim to the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Dulles, a \"special envoy\" of Truman, \"inspected\" south Korea in order to finally check preparations for the Korean War and decided to ignite the war on Sunday, the \"Sabbath\" for Christian countries. The sly nature behind this scenario was fully disclosed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the U.S. is still working hard to provoke the second Korean war, styling itself \"liberator\" and \"apostle of peace\", in a bid to evade its responsibility for provoking the Korean War and shake off its disgrace as a defeated country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war by massively bringing its strategic assets one after another to put under its complete control the peninsula, which is of geographical importance in realizing its regional and global hegemony.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the commander of the 2nd division of the U.S. forces in south Korea blustered that GIs would come back to the peninsula any time to fight, the U.S. hostility and war hysteria against the DPRK are getting evermore undisguised.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This shows that the U.S., which provoked the Korean War and invaded the DPRK, remains unchanged in its sinister design although 67 years have passed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the U.S. should never forget the lesson taught by its defeat. It was Korea where the myth of its \"mightiness\" knowing no defeat in more than a hundred wars was broken, and it was also Korea where it had to sign documents of apology over decades, suffering humiliations of defeat.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the will of the army and people of the DPRK to deal an unheard-of terrible blow at the U.S. which has committed untold crimes against the Korean nation century after century, and realize the historic cause of national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. will meet only an ignominious defeat in today's Korea which has emerged a nuclear power in the East to strike terror into the enemy and a rocket power in Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. had better recollect once again the cries made by its defeated and buried generals in the 1950s who confessed that the U.S. fought a wrong war against a wrong rival at a wrong time in a wrong place."
