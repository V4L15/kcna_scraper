Sherman, commander of the U.S.-south Korea Combined Forces:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is now working hard to paint the aggressive and offensive nature of Ulji Freedom Guardian joint war exercises against the DPRK as \"annual and defensive\" while contemplating staging them together with south Korea. It is also making a serious mockery of the DPRK by sending \"a prior notice allegedly based on trust and transparency\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is hostile towards the DPRK behind the scene while publicly uttering it had no intention to invade the DPRK. Not content with this behavior, the U.S. hatched a plot to perpetrate the above-said terrorism and is escalating the war maneuvers against the DPRK. This is the U.S. hostile policy toward it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK have grown stronger in their will to take revenge on the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Clear is the stand of the DPRK on the projected joint military exercises. This was fully reflected in a statement issued by a spokesman for the DPRK National Defence Commission on July 29.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their reckless saber-rattling against the DPRK would get nothing but disgrace and self-destruction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK once again clearly states the KPA will never deal with the \"UN Forces Command\" which exists in name only.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the reply of the KPA to the U.S."

This brings to light the scenario of the U.S. to prod its stooges into building a reliable pro-American military alliance in Northeast Asia in a bid to use it as a shock brigade for carrying out its strategy for dominating the Asia-Pacific region in contingency.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already known, after declaring its \"return to Asia\", the U.S. singled out the completion of the triangular military alliance and the building of a missile shield, etc. as major tasks for implementing its new strategic plan and is busy with its moves to carrying out them as quickly as possible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has increased its forces in the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity under the pretext of coping with \"nuclear and missile threat\" from someone and \"its measures to bolster up combat capability.\" It, at the same time, has steadily imposed increasing burden for their upkeep upon the south Korean puppet regime and Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　In recent years, the U.S. has employed such method as urging Japan to increase its \"military role\" and calling on the south Korean puppet regime to tighten nexus with Japan, taking into consideration its snowballing state debts, experience in proxy war in the Middle East and pro-American stooges' rule over south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　That is why the U.S. is interpreting Japan's revision of its Basic Law on Atomic Energy and the extended conception of its Pacificist Constitution, etc. from the stand that there is almost no possibility of militarist rearmament.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　 It is busy letting loose a spate of balderdashes about \"strategic importance\" of the U.S.-Japan alliance and \"importance of cooperation in the issue of the Korean Peninsula\", utterly indifferent to the concern of the Korean and other Asian peoples. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　U.S., Japan and south Korea have further intensified joint nuclear war exercises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the intention of the U.S. to fill up its military vacuum in the region and retain its military hegemony through Japan's increased \"military role\" and the final completion of the triangular military alliance based on it. Herein lies the reason why the U.S. is so zealous in backing Japan in the revival of its militarism and rearmament and facilitating the conclusion of such military agreement though it ostensibly was cautious towards the matters. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. moves to ignite a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula and the region only compel the DPRK to take the toughest stand including the bolstering of nuclear deterrent. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t]"

In a word, this is nothing but a call for staging a comeback to Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tok Islets are part of the inviolable territory of Korea which has been recognized by historical evidence and international law. This fact is proved not only by Korean historical materials but by Japanese historical materials.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan persistently insists on the \"claim\" despite historical facts because it regards the islets as a point for launching its reinvasion of Korea. Such persistent \"claim\" of Japan is escalating the tension on the Korean Peninsula and forming a structure of acute confrontation between the Korean nation and Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's persistent wrong assertion about the islets is mainly attributable to the Lee Myung Bak regime's pro-Japanese policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The anti-Japanese resentment is running high among the south Koreans over the issue of the islets. This being a stark fact, the Lee group of traitors has just issued statements of regret at Japan's brigandish bid to grab the islets for the last three consecutive years. This is another sycophantic and treacherous act as it is aimed at easily abandoning part of Korea which has belonged to its territory generation after generation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group opted for the conclusion of the General Security of Military Information Agreement, the first military agreement to be signed with Japan. This is as outrageous an act as allowing Japan to reinvade Korea and pave the way for doing so.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is a criminal state which brought unspeakable misfortunes and sufferings to the Korean nation. It is, however, beautifying the bloody history of aggression against Korea and evading apology and reparation for it, far from admitting it. The Korean nation should never pardon Japan's evermore undisguised \"claim\" to the islets as it is an attempt to reinvade Korea in a bid to realize the old dream of \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a pipedream for the descendants of the Japanese imperialists to realize their ambition for grabbing the islets with ease with the backing of the Lee group, oblivious of the lesson taught by history. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries eyeing the islets and the Lee group, its lackeys, are bound to face a stern punishment by the Korean nation."
