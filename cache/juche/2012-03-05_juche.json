In the wake of the Yonphyong island shelling incident, he issued a dangerous skirmish instruction called \"take action first and report later,\" giving the officers of the puppet army on the forefront the right to fire as they please. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hoodlums of the puppet army set up target boards bearing slogans hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and its system and fired bullets and shells at them.
