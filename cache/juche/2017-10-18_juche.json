Against this backdrop, the government authorities openly hint at the possibility of nuclear tests, saying the issue of whether to resume the nuclear test or not will be \"discussed further.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Politico, the New York Times and other U.S. media report that the Trump administration can resume nuclear tests to extend the shelf-life of the existing nuclear weapons and to verify the performance of newly developed nuclear warheads.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. nuclear test resumption moves have become all the more serious as they were carried out on the extension of Trump's ferocious nuclear confrontation racket calling for \"increasing the nuclear capabilities to greater extent until the world can get discretion of the U.S. strength\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Soon after taking office in the White House, Trump assigned the Defence Department with the task to reexamine and estimate the nuclear force, complaining that the U.S. nuclear force has been left far behind other countries, and has squandered a great amount of funds into its modernization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent NBC report that Trump called for increasing nuclear weapons ten-fold at a security session in July to the shock of all the audience clearly proves to what extent the U.S. chief executive has reached in his nuclear hysteria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. attempt at the resumption of nuclear test is becoming a reality at Trump's zealous instigation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t B61-12 tactical nuclear bomb test in Nevada a month ago is just a prelude to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has conducted more than 1 000 nuclear tests and has a stockpile of the greatest number of ultra-modern nuclear weapons. Not content with this, it is planning to resume nuclear tests. This is an indication of its sinister hegemonic ambition to dominate the world with an unchallenged nuclear edge.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the U.S. gangster-like logic that all the countries have to be its slaves under its nuclear stick or die.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. nuclear tests will naturally lead to nuclear arms race among big powers, disrupt international NPT system and further increase the danger of a nuclear war on the earth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Furthermore, the U.S. is the empire of evil which inflicted the nuclear holocaust on humankind for the first time in history. This fact makes the international community closely watch the nuclear criminal state which has strong proclivity to commit the crime again.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. chiefly to blame for threatening world peace and security is still holding the DPRK-targeted large-scale nuclear war drills in south Korea and in waters off it, watching for an opportunity to mount a preemptive nuclear strike. It, therefore, does not make any sense for the DPRK to abandon nuclear weapons under this situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will continue to bolster the military capability for self-defence and preemptive attack with the nuclear force as a pivot as long as the U.S. and its followers' nuclear threat and blackmail continue, and this will last until all the nuclear weapons are abolished on the earth."
