            "content": "KAPPC on Case of Hyundai Group in S. Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 20 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee Thursday released a statement in connection with the fact that Hyundai Group of south Korea recently divested Kim Yun Gyu, chief director and vice-president of Hyundai Asan who has been a key player in the undertakings for economic cooperation with the north, of all his posts on charge of his alleged \"involvement in a scandal,\" triggering off public furor.\r\n The statement said the case is a serious matter as it adversely affects not only the relations between Hyundai and the north but overall north-south economic cooperation, adding that yet Hyundai Group side totally dismissed Kim Yun Gyu from his office, inviting strong criticism of the public at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement cited facts to prove that the north takes issue with the case of Hyundai because it sets store by the desire of south Koreans to tour Mt. Kumgang and wishes to remain true to the confidence between the north and Hyundai and the strong sense of obligation towards the predecessors of Hyundai Group. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is now no one known to us from Hyundai Group as it has no longer Kim Yun Gyu, who had taken the places of Jong Ju Yong and Jong Mong Hon after their deaths. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hyundai is no longer what used to be as it retains no original appearance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hyundai Group side claims that its removal of Kim from his office was \"a measure taken under unavoidable circumstances,\" but this is nothing but deception and hypocrisy of the coldhearted guys who have gone against the nation's desire and reneged on the bilateral good faith and sense of obligation.\r\n It is something surprising that the ties of cooperation between the KAPPC and Hyundai based on good faith and sense of obligation have broken up overnight due to a few elements who know nothing about the meaning and peculiarity of the north-south cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that Hyundai is no longer what used to be and has backpedaled its earlier good faith, there arises doubt as to whether it would function as a counterpart in the cooperation with the north as it did in the past. This, therefore, compels the north to comprehensively examine all undertakings with Hyundai and readjust them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for the issue of tour of Kaesong high on the agenda at the moment, we are not in a position to continue cooperation with Hyundai over this issue and, therefore, compelled to pursue consultation for it with other institutions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"seven-point agreement on cooperation \" which the Hyundai side concluded with the KAPPC side in August, 2000 is premised on going through the relevant legal procedures and getting approval by the authorities of both sides and it allows necessary modification, supplementation and re-consultation. \r\n As the signatory party is no longer available, there is no reason for us to remain bound to the agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This abnormal thing that happened in the relations between the KAPPC and Hyundai is entirely attributable to the Hyundai side's improper behavior.\r\n Hyundai's unreasonable action seriously marred the significance of the north-south economic cooperation and laid a stumbling block in the way of the cooperation expected to make a fresh leap forward. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hyundai should be held fully responsible for the present situation and all the consequences to be entailed by its ingratitude and indiscreet behavior.\r\n The GNP should drop its bad habit of viewing others from its own viewpoint. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is still a prospect and a way out for Hyundai. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is our view that if the current situation was created by the higher body of Hyundai against its will, it must feel sorry for it and deeply repent of it.\r\n If they break with those parasitic high-flyers and take a right path, we will become so generous as to pave a wide avenue for south Koreans' tour of Mt. Kumgang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is our hope that the present higher body of Hyundai will face up to the desire of the nation and the trend of the times and choose a right path.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
