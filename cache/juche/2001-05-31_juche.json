Korean military taxed for joining in anti-DPRK campaign \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 31 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary lashes out at the South Korean military authorities for joining foreign forces in their moves for confrontation with the DPRK aimed to block Korea's reunification.\r\n The military authorities are staging war exercises of various scales one after another in different parts of South Korea to launch invasion of the north after conducting with the U.S. military last April the \"reception, staging, onward-movement and integration\" exercise, a large-scale joint military drill under the simulated conditions of the invasion of the north. meanwhile, they are putting spurs to the arms buildup and the modernization of military hardware which is clearly evidenced by their recent purchase of up-to-date missile launchers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Korean military bosses including the \"minister of national defense\" do not bother to let loose a spate of belligerent outbursts that \"cooperation system\" with the U.S. should be further strengthened and the \"idea of designating the north as the principal enemy\" can never be changed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These are unpardonable anti-national and anti-reunification crimes as they are aimed to antagonize their fellow countrymen and contain them by force of arms in conspiracy with outsiders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists, by nature, are not desirous of peace and reunification process on the Korean peninsula. The new U.S. administration is keen to derail the hard-won inter-Korean dialogue and isolate and stifle the DPRK, pursuant to its anachronistic policy of confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By agitating confrontation and straining the situation on the Korean peninsula the U.S. imperialists mainly seek to invent a ground for their continued military presence in South Korea and realise their strategy to hold hegemony in the Asia-Pacific.  Their loudmouthed fiction of \"missile threat\" from the north is aimed at establishing  the \"Missile Defense\" system under the pretext of a \"threat\" from the DPRK in a bid to put the world under their domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the South Korean military authorities are working hard to tarnish the nation's dignity and sovereignty and hurt their fellow countrymen with sabre-rattling, while chiming in with the outsiders' policy to exterminate the nation and perpetuate its division. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they opt to commit crimes against the nation and reunification in conspiracy with foreign aggressors, they will never escape a stern punishment by history.    \r\n\r\n"
