This war will turn out to be decisive battles between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A signed commentary of Minju Joson says that the U.S. hawkish forces should refrain from pointing an accusing finger to the sovereign states' exercise of their legitimate rights to increase the self-reliant defence capability and immediately stop their development of weapons of mass destruction and moves for a war of aggression.    \r\n\r\n"

He read an important document concerning the reunification issue and signed it just before his heart stopped beating. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The three charters of national reunification provided by him in his lifetime have enjoyed unrestricted support from the entire Korean nation as an immortal banner for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n General Secretary Kim Jong Il, true to the president's instructions for reunification, arranged the historic Pyongyang inter-Korean summit meeting and the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, opening up a new phase of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation will surely achieve national reunification in line with the three charters, the most just and realistic guidelines for reunification, and build a powerful and prospering nation.    \r\n\r\n"
