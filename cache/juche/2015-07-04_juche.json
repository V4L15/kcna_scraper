Kumgang\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, July 4 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Guidance Bureau of Special Zone for International Tour of Mt. Kumgang gave an answer to the question put by KCNA Saturday as regards the south Korean regime's desperate bid to evade its responsibility for the suspended tour of Mt. Kumgang.\n\t\t\t\t\t He said: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently, south Koreans are becoming increasingly vocal calling for the resumption of tour of Mt. Kumgang which has long been in a hiatus due to the desperate obstructions on the part of the conservative group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those concerned of the Kumgangsan Businessmen Council of south Korea have urged the regime to pay compensation for the losses caused by the seven year-long suspension of the tour that seriously decayed and damaged their facilities at Mt. Kumgang resort built with their investment. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are bitterly complaining that the regime has neither taken any measure nor paid compensation for their losses amounting to astronomical figures.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an expression of curse and indignation at the puppet regime that has blocked the resumption of tour in a bid to attain its sinister politically-motivated purpose only, utterly indifferent to the aspiration and wishes of the south Korean people and their right to existence. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the south Korean authorities are misleading public opinion, asserting that such problem occurred because the north refused to respond to their call for dialogue aimed to resume the tour. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The tour of Mt. Kumgang called as an offspring of the June 15 joint declaration was suspended because the south Korean conservative group has deliberately blocked its resumption by abusing the incident of a south Korean tourist for the confrontation with the fellow countrymen in the north and describing it as a financial source for the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is that the puppet group made nonsensical talks about \"the north's abrogation of the agreement\" and \"violation of international law\" over the international tour of Mt. Kumgang conducted by the DPRK. Not content with this desperate effort, the group is visiting other countries to implore them not to send tourists and investors to Mt. Kumgang and even threaten and blackmail businessmen overseas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter what rhetoric the puppet group may use to cover up stark reality, no one would pay heed to it."

Such historical facts clearly proved the validity of the three principles of national reunification and their tremendous viability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There can be no change in the fundamental principles for national reunification, no matter how much water may flow under the bridge and no matter how complicated the situation remains.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Only when all the fellow countrymen at home and overseas struggle, united close as one, holding high the banner of independent reunification as inspired by the great sun of the nation, they will see a new phase for improving the inter-Korean relations and surely achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the country."

This is the height of impudence and shame.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The establishment of the office is nothing but a base move to disturb the improvement of the north-south relations ardently desired by all Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We vehemently denounce the establishment of the office.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We extend full support and solidarity to all countermeasures taken by the DPRK."
