With nothing can the U.S. justify its action of ignoring the UN and take its place.\r\n Rodong Sinmun says this in a signed article Thursday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the U.S. attitude toward the UN to use it as a tool for carrying out its purpose of aggression, a stage for establishing an order of hegemonic domination over the world, the article notes, and observes: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Typical examples of disregarding the UN are the U.S. imperialists' invasion of Iraq, their moves to pressurize Iran over the nuclear issue and their intensified policy of military occupation of south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. arrogant act of ignoring the UN is exerting a great influence on world peace and human civilization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Owing to the U.S. arrogance the major principles of international relations including the UN Charter, international law, international justice and impartiality have been violated and the world plunged into confusion and disorder. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the U.S. to ignore the UN is as good as ignoring the world and debasing and rejecting humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to prevent the U.S. highhanded and arbitrary practices and establish a new fair international order in the international arena, all the countries including the UN member nations should resolutely fight against the U.S. policy of aggression, the policy of ignoring the UN. And they should enhance the authority and role of the UN as required by the new century so that the U.S. may not act at its own discretion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those who turn their back on the people and block the trend of the times are bound to face international isolation and ruin. The U.S. is now in such a position. It had better understand its plight clearly and stop committing such criminal acts as ignoring the UN and resorting to highhanded and arbitrary practices.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The fiber is made with the help of latest fiber processing technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As its surface is very rough and has many prickles according to the microscopic examination, the plastic fiber ensures powerful adhesion with cement solution. Therefore, the plastic fiber building materials are good in quality and have a long serviceable life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In addition, the production cost of the plastic fiber building materials is nearly 50 per cent lower than that of other ones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ho Ho Yong, a section chief of the DPRK General Bureau of Invention, told KCNA that according to the survey of international inventions and industrial patents, the plastic fiber processing technology is superior to others not only in the economic aspect but in technical features.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
