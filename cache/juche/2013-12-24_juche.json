Korea\"\r\n Pyongyang, December 24 (KCNA) -- The United States is nowadays getting more vociferous about \"threat from north Korea\", announcing that it would build THAAD in Guam to cope with the \"unpredictable threat\".\n\t\t\t\t\t Such assertiveness on the \"theory of threat\" was prompted by an insidious scheme to justify the U.S. strategy for domination over the Asia-Pacific region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As openly asserted by officials of the U.S. Defense Department, THAAD, to be established in vast area from Alaska to Australia including south Korea, Japan and Philippines, is tantamount to a siege to target for regional powers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"theory of threat from north Korea\" is nothing but a smokescreen to cover up such scheme, and the real aim of the U.S. is to contain its potential rivals by speeding up arms buildup in the Asia-Pacific region with establishment of MD system involved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This fact is well illustrated in a report of the \"U.S.-China Economic Security Review Subcommittee\" released in November.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the report, the U.S. said that China's military muscle is challenging the U.S. forces' influence over the Asia-Pacific region, adding that the modern and rising Chinese military capabilities are able to strike the U.S. military bases in Guam. The report also noted that the regional equilibrium of forces is changing with the decrease of the U.S. military strength due to the forced reduction of domestic defense expenditure, in contrast to the increase of China's military capabilities, and the U.S. pivot to Asia-Pacific strategy is weakening in terms of restraint.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The facts show that the U.S. intensified establishment of THAAD is aimed to contain its rivals growing in strength and maintain its military hegemony in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such moves of the U.S. triggered off strong concern and repulsion from regional powers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the situation, the U.S. B-52 bombers flew in the air defense identification zone set up by China, without giving notice in late November. And a spokesman for the U.S. Defense Department announced that those bombers passed through the air above Senkaku Islands, in a bid to irritate China. Consequently, the China-U.S. friction got more serious, rendering the regional situation strained. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With the case, the U.S. felt the need to urgently round off the establishment of such combat and operational systems as MD in line with the acute military confrontation with regional powers. So, it raised again the worn-out \"theory of threat from north Korea\" to divert elsewhere the attention of regional countries. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But no one can get deceived by such petty tricks. On the contrary, accusation against the U.S. wrong assertion is growing stronger among the world public, which contended in general that the U.S. counteraction to the DPRK is fairly asymmetric and that the U.S. establishment of MD is undoubtedly intended to control the nuclear potentials of China and Russia, its geopolitical rivals. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In a word, the \"theory of threat from north Korea\" is a sheer sophism. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Intolerable is the U.S. scheme to spoil the situation of the Asia-Pacific region trending toward peace and development."

            "content": "?Para quien se necesita doctrina de \"amenaza del Norte de Corea\"?, pregunta ACNC\r\nPyongyang, 24 de diciembre (ACNC) -- En estos dias, Estados Unidos difunde ruidosamente la teoria de \"amenaza del Norte de Corea (Republica Popular Democratica de Corea)\".\n\t\t\t\t\tAnuncia que estableceria en la isla Guam el sistema interceptor de misil frente a la \"amenaza imprevisible del Norte de Corea\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, la verdadera intencion de EE.UU. es justificar el cumplimiento de su estrategia de hegemonia sobre la region de Asia-Pacifico. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHasta los relacionados del Departamento de Defensa norteamericano insisten publicamente en que el sistema de defensa antimisil que abarca desde Alaska hasta el Sur de Corea, Japon, Filipinas y Australia forma un gran cerco sobre las potencias regionales.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa \"doctrina de amenaza del Norte de Corea\" de EE.UU. parte del astuto intento de acelerar el aumento armamentista en la region incluso el establecimiento del sistema antimisiles y resistir a los rivales ocultos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA citar por ejemplo, en el informe del \"comite de revision de economia y seguridad EE.UU.-China\" publicado en noviembre pasado, el imperio insistio en que desafia a la influencia de sus tropas en la region de Asia-Pacifico la capacidad militar de China, ampliada y modernizada vertiginosamente y dotada de capacidad de ataque a las bases militares norteamericanas en la isla Guam. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY agrego que a diferencia del fortalecimiento de la capacidad militar de China, se debilita el poderio militar norteamericano debido a la reduccion forzosa de gastos de defensa nacional, y por su consecuencia, se cambia el equilibrio de fuerzas en la region y se disminuye la influencia disuasiva de la estrategia de dar importancia a la region de Asia-Pacifico. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe aqui la esencia de la cuestion. EE.UU. acelera el establecimiento del sistema de defensa antimisil para resistir a sus rivales regionales y mantener y fortalecer de continuo su supremacia militar. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTales maniobras del imperio provocaron gran preocupacion y resistencia de las potencias regionales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA finales de noviembre pasado, los aviones norteamericanos B-52 navegaron sin aviso la zona de identificacion de defensa aerea fijada por China, mientras el vocero del Departamento de Defensa norteamericano anuncio publicamente que sus cazabombarderos norteamericanos \"navegaron el espacio del archipielago Senkaku\". De esta manera, se ha agravado el conflicto entre China y EE.UU. y se ha creado una nueva tension en la region. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA medida que se agrava mas la confrontacion militar con las potencias regionales, EE.UU. sintio la necesidad de perfeccionar cuanto antes el sistema de combate y operaciones incluso el sistema de defensa antimisil y vuelve a presentar la vieja \"doctrina de amenaza del Norte de Corea\" con el fin de desviar la atencion de los paises regionales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, nadie sera enganado por esta artimana pueril. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl contrario, por doquier del mundo se alzan las voces que revelan el caracter enganoso de la doctrina estadounidense. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa opinion publica mundial estima que \"las medidas anti-RPDC de EE.UU. son asimetricas\" y que \"el establecimiento del sistema antimisiles de EE.UU. es indudablemente para mantener a raya a las potencialidades nucleares de China y Rusia, rivales geopoliticos\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPues, la \"doctrina de amenaza del Norte de Corea\" es una sofisteria. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs intolerable el intento de EE.UU. que lleva a la fase de tension y catastrofe la situacion de la region de Asia-Pacifico aspirante a la paz y el desarrollo."
