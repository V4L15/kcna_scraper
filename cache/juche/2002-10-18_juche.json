            "content": "Kim Jong Il inspects South Hamgyong Province \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 18 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Il gave field guidance to industrial establishments in South Hamgyong Province on Thursday.\r\n He first visited the commissioned Kumjingang Power Station and learned in detail about its construction and production. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The difficult and vast construction of this station has been successfully finished by people in Jongphyong county in 18 months. It has made it possible to put the dwelling houses in the county seat under an electrical heating system, satisfactorily irrigate tens of thousands of hectares of paddy and non-paddy fields in the basin of the Kumjin river and obtain several hundred hectares of new arable land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an admirable great miracle that the county has completed by itself the project as gigantic as a large hydropower station, he said, highly praising the youth shock brigade members and other people in the county for their proud feats performed in building such an edifice of eternal value through a heroic drive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The appearance of the country is changing with each passing day thanks to the devoted efforts of our people ready to flatten even a mountain and empty a sea once they are called upon by the WPK to do so, he said, adding: such inexhaustible mental power clearly proves the faith, will and fighting stamina of the Korean people determined to build a powerful nation by themselves without fail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He also went round the sideline stock-farm built by the young builders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then, he moved to the dam construction site of the Hungbong Power Station. Looking round the vast reservoir area and the site of the dam construction making rapid progress thanks to the energetic efforts of people in Hamju county, he acquainted himself in detail with the construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Building power stations in all rivers and streams is one of the gigantic nature-harnessing projects to give facelifting to land, he said, stressing: this honorable work should be creditably carried out in our generation to hand down the people's land of bliss to posterity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The next leg of his visit was the June 1 Youth Electric Appliance Factory. He highly praised party members and other workers of the factory for having updated the production processes to meet the requirements of the new century and advanced many valuable invention and rationalization proposals through a brisk mass technical innovation drive, true to the WPK's policy of attaching importance to science. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The factory has a big role to play in putting the industry on a Juche-oriented, modern and scientific basis, he said, advancing tasks to be carried out by it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He posed for a picture with innovators of the factory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He also inspected the Hamhung Basic Foodstuff Factory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since basic foodstuff production bases have been laid, it is important to keep its production going at a high rate, he said, adding: strict measures should be taken to provide a sufficient supply of bean and other raw materials. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Repeatedly giving a high appreciation to the province for having done a lot of work in recent years, he expressed the expectation and belief that its working people would continue to creditably play the role of a shock brigade in implementing the WPK's economic policies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Accompanying him were officers of CC of WPK and government. \r\n   \r\n"

This is, after all, a challenge to the UN. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such arrogant deeds as listing other countries as part of an \"axis of evil\" and \"targets of nuclear preemptive strike\" for one's own interests are based on the doctrine that strength is all-mighty, he said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the UN member nations should respect the un and its charter and remain faithful to its purpose and principle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is important in doing so is to adhere to justice and the principle of impartiality in international relationship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Without the principles of international laws and impartiality, is it impossible to find a proper solution to any problem. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the issues can be solved in a fair way only when the UN Charter is respected and implemented to the letter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The delegate called for decisively enhancing the function of the UN General Assembly and reforming the UNSC in an overall way to meet the demand of all the un member nations. \r\n"

The Russian side, too, is vigorously pushing forward the project to put its railways on a modern basis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some time ago, Russia proposed to hold tripartite talks of railway officials of the DPRK, Russia and South Korea, as part of the steps to connect inter-Korean railways and trans-Siberian railroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We hail this proposal, considering that it will be conducive to successfully carrying out the Korea-Russia railway connection project in the spirit of the DPRK-Russia Moscow joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the proposed tripartite talks would offer an opportunity to discuss at length various issues arising in connecting the inter-Korean railways and trans-Siberian railroad and produce positive results.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA on world daily's smear campaign against DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 18 (KCNA) -- Seoul-based daily review Syegye Ilbo (World Daily) is acting a political waiting maid of the United States.\r\n As already reported, the bureau of investigation of the U.S. Congress recently released a report to the effect that the international community's humanitarian food aid to the DPRK has been distributed to the military and privileged classes on a priority basis. The report does not deserve even a passing note as it is a product of anti-DPRK hostile policy intended to tarnish its international image. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits attention is that the daily made a malignant diatribe against the DPRK, taking advantage of this mean smear campaign launched by the U.S. The daily did not bother to use such words as abuse of the international community's good faith and humanitarian spirit and betrayal of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This only goes to prove that the daily is being reduced to a paper representing the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK. It is nothing but a hack paper as it has discarded the elementary mission of the press to champion justice and truth and lead the public opinion to a right path. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Members of several international aid organizations in Pyongyang are watching and confirming on the spot how food and other humanitarian aid materials are distributed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such being the hard fact, the daily released the story of hostile nature based on the U.S. congressional report which says that the most of food aid is exclusively used for a military purpose. This can not but be an insult to the international community's humanitarian spirit and a perfidy to the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This only goes to prove that the daily is taking the lead in supporting the U.S. moves to hamstring the international community's humanitarian aid to the DPRK and isolate and stifle it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By committing such an act of treachery the daily even left a blot on its image though it has to fulfil a mission to report truth free from any distortion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the daily wants to fully discharge its mission as a genuine paper it should refrain from doing such a disgraceful act as falsifying truth in line with the U.S. political operation.    \r\n\r\n"
