This fact alone fully illustrates the extreme level of the insane military provocations of the Trump administration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. missile warning drill is aimed at accelerating the building of the Missile Defence System and the formation of tripartite military alliance of the U.S., Japan and south Korea to maintain the military supremacy in the Asia-Pacific region under the pretext of coping with the \"nuclear and missile threat\" from the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSuch attempts by the U.S. will inevitably bring about a new arms race and a new cold war in the Korean peninsula and Northeast Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe missile warning drill aimed at putting maximum pressure upon the DPRK follows the largest joint naval and air drills staged recently by the Trump administration, mobilizing the three nuclear aircraft carriers and hundreds of fighter planes with a great number of nuclear preemptive strike means.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe will never tolerate the on-going dangerous war games conducted by the U.S. while condemning the strengthening of the DPRK's self-defensive nuclear deterrent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe reality shows that the DPRK was absolutely right in having strengthened its powerful nuclear deterrent which could end for good the 60-year-long nuclear threat and blackmail of the U.S. against the DPRK and firmly guarantee the security and prosperity of the Korean nation and peace of the Korean Peninsula and the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAny country, if it is really interested in stability of the Korean Peninsula, should condemn the continuous nuclear war provocations and hostile policy of the U.S. against the DPRK, instead of criticizing the DPRK's efforts to develop its strategic nuclear weapons for defending the sovereignty, the territorial integrity and peaceful life of its people from the U.S. nuclear threat and blackmail."
