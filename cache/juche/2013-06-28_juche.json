The U.S. war-like forces claimed that the June 25 war \"was a victorious war\" but it has been called a \"forgotten war\" as it was fought between the Second World War and the Vietnam War. Now is the time to re-estimate the war as the \"forgotten victory,\" they added. Echoing what their master uttered, the south Korean puppet forces are describing the battle in Chunchon area, the battle on the River Rakdong and the operation for landing in Inchon as \"three major war victories.\" They are busy staging burlesques for \"demonstrating strong alliance\" with the U.S. and its allies.\n\t\t\t\t\tRodong Sinmun Friday observes in a bylined commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThose, who signed a paper of surrender, deplored that they waged a wrong war against wrong \"enemies\" in a wrong place at a wrong time.

            "content": "S. Korean Authorities Flayed for Branding Pro-Reunification Champions as \"Wartime S. Korean Abductees\"\r\nPyongyang, June 28 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of Korea (DFRK) on June 28 gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA as regards the south Korean puppet regime's such reckless action as defining as \"wartime south Korean abductees\" the pro-reunification patriots who came to the DPRK in quest of justice and truth during the past Fatherland Liberation War:\n\t\t\t\t\tRecently the puppet regime branded 274 pro-reunification patriotic figures including Kim Kyu Sik as \"wartime south Korean abductees\" at the 10th meeting of \"the committee for probing the truth behind abductions of south Koreans during the June 25 war and reinstating the abductees.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe \"wartime abductees\" were those who came to the embrace of the DPRK of their own accord, disillusioned with the rule of the Syngman Rhee's puppet regime, pro-U.S., sycophantic and unpopular, during the Korean War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe puppet regime's action is an intolerable insult to those people and their bereaved families and the DPRK and another base provocation to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs for Kim Kyu Sik, he participated in the Joint Conference of Representatives of Political Parties and Social Organizations in North and South Korea held in Pyongyang in April 1948 and had the honor of being received by President Kim Il Sung. Deeply moved by the great, patriotic will and broad magnanimity of the President, he bravely fought against the moves of the U.S. imperialists and their stooges to partition the country and ignite a war after going back to south Korea. After coming back to the north under the care of the President in September 1950, he devoted himself to the struggle for national reunification as vice-president of the Consultative Council of Former South Korean Politicians in the North for the Promotion of Peaceful Reunification till the last moments of his life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Kyu Sik dedicated his whole life to the service to the country and the nation after coming to the care of the President and now enjoys an eternal life. The action taken against him clearly shows what a reckless stage the puppet regime has reached in the smear campaign against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClear is the aim sought by the puppet regime through the action.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is a revelation of the black-hearted intention to hype the issue of \"the wartime south Korean abductees\" as one more \"issue of the human rights in the north\" in an effort to intensify the smear campaign against the DPRK in the international arena, insult the pro-reunification patriots who came to the care of the DPRK and tarnish its image.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lurking behind this is its sordid intention to put on the table the issue of \"wartime south Korean abductees\" together with the issue of \"ROK army POWs\" and \"abductees by the north\" when dealing with the north-south ties in the future, create complexity and attain its sinister politically-motivated aim.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Abductees by the north\" and \"ROK army POWs\" were all made up by the puppet group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"The committee for probing the truth behind abductions of south Koreans during the June 25 war and reinstating the abductees\" recently defined pro-reunification figures as \"wartime south Korean abductees\". The committee, a base for hatching plots against the DPRK, is under the office of the puppet \"prime minister\" and run by Chongwadae and him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe puppet group is working with blood-shot eyes to kick up a racket for escalating confrontation with fellow countrymen through the definition of the \"wartime south Korean abductees\" but such a sinister attempt and dirty and shameless deception will not convince anyone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe anti-DPRK smear campaign by the puppet group will only disclose its dirty nature as confrontational maniacs, touching off stronger censure and denunciation by the entire nation and the world conscience.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe will never pardon the puppet group but will keep tabs on their criminal acts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe puppet group should face up to the desire of the nation and the trend of the times and immediately stop the confrontation racket."
