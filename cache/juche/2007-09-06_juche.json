Their duty was also to obtain original texts of documents of the DPRK including the state and military secrets and the ideological tendencies of the people and, at the same time, to create illusion about the \"free world\" among senior officials and lure them out to third countries if possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After it infiltrated the hired spies into the DPRK, the foreign intelligence service sent an intelligence agent to the DPRK under the guise of a trader to command their activities on the spot. He carried with him a digital camera battery to which the GPS was attached. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He met the spies in secrecy and received results of their activities. And then, he handed over the GPS to them. As the headquarters of the intelligence service dictated, the agent gave to them a directive on collecting the secret on the object as early as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went to the area surrounding the military object under the pretext of the \"spot survey\" and directly commanded the activities of the spies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The counter-intelligence officers of the DPRK who sharply watched every movement of the enemy arrested the spies and intelligence agent on a spot when they handed over the GPS and the collected data with each other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the judgment of experts, the intelligence apparatus consists of up-to-date highly efficient GPS processor, Flash and contact plate antenna branded with SONY.\r\n In connection with the case, a press conference was held at the People's Palace of Culture in Pyongyang on September 5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An officer of the Ministry of State Security of the DPRK, to begin with, informed the reporters of the content of the case and a video-tape showing the written pledge of a spy hired to the foreign intelligence service, scenes showing him committing crimes and others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then reporters raised at the conference questions regarding the forms and methods of the ever-intensified anti-DPRK psychological war-fare of the enemy, dealing of the arrested criminals and others.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

As a result, it is predicted this will adversely affect the agricultural production this year in no small measure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The flood further increased the possibility of the spread of all kinds of contagious diseases. On top of this, at least 560 hospitals and more than 2,100 clinics were destroyed and lots of medical supplies washed away across the country to increase the damage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This time the DPRK received medicines and other emergency aid materials given by international organizations including the UN and many countries including China, the U.S., the EU, Russia, Australia and Egypt with sincerity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK feels thankful for this aid. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It will help the DPRK recover from the flood damage and bring the living of the inhabitants in the afflicted areas to normal.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Blasts U.S. Justification of Its Forces' Presence in S. Korea  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 5 (KCNA) -- Shortly ago, the U.S. chief executive cited its forces' presence in south Korea as an example to justify its forces' presence in Iraq. He went the lengths of asserting that but for the U.S. involvement in the Korean war and its close relations with south Korea after the war millions of south Koreans would have lived, subject to oppression under the savage and tyrannical regime. This was a blatant provocation to the DPRK. \r\n This cannot but be sheer sophism aimed to justify the division of Korea and slander the socialist government in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n September 8 marks the lapse of 62 years since the U.S. forces' occupation of south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. forces' occupation of south Korea brought untold pain resulting from division as it was a product of the U.S. strategy to put the whole of Korea under its control. It is well known that the south Koreans have suffered horrible disasters and pain due to the U.S. forces' violence and atrocities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The socialist government in the DPRK is displaying its advantages and vitality before the world as the days go by as it is a genuine popular government chosen and built by the Koreans themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The piffle let loose by the U.S. chief executive to justify its forces' presence in south Korea and slander the government in the DPRK despite the above-said hard fact clearly proves that the U.S. has not yet discarded the way of thinking dating back to the Cold War era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will never allow the U.S. to justify its forces' presence in south Korea and impair the dignity and prestige of the government in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is that the hard-line conservatives in the U.S. are working hard to keep the DPRK listed as a terrorism sponsor in a bid to throw an obstacle in the way of improving the DPRK-U.S. relations, raving that north Korea is a dangerous country which has a big possibility of transferring nuclear technology to terrorist organizations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, the U.S. poses the greatest danger of nuclear proliferation as it keeps stepping up the modernization of nuclear weapons while testing nuclear weapons of the new generation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No wonder, the world is greatly concerned about the dangerous nuclear program of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The conservative forces of the U.S. are persistently pursuing the hostile policy toward the DPRK while making the profound confusion of the right and wrong. Such foolish act can be perpetrated only by those who are forsaken by the times as they seek confrontation, failing to face up to the trend of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is the consistent stand of the DPRK to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula and achieve peace and stability on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Not only the unbiased international public but the U.S. public are becoming increasingly assertive that the U.S. administration make a switchover in its policy to improve relations with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The hard-line conservatives in the U.S. should refrain from fanning up the hostility toward the DPRK and chilling the atmosphere of the process to improve the DPRK-U.S. relations.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This constitutes an immortal exploit of national historical significance performed by the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President's Juche-oriented educational idea and undying feats have been successfully carried forward under the outstanding and tested leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over the last three decades since the publication of the theses the advantages of the socialist educational system in the DPRK have been fully demonstrated and great achievements made in the education under the wise guidance of the WPK and the leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has produced a large number of revolutionary intellectuals firmly equipped with the revolutionary world outlook and noble traits by strengthening the politico-ideological education true to the Party's educational policy. As a result, the politico-ideological might of the revolutionary ranks has steadily grown strong and those who cherish loyalty to the Party and the leader as their faith came to take charge of the important posts of socialist construction. It is something to be highly proud of that the young people who will carry forward the tradition of the revolution have been fully prepared politically and ideologically. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The intense loyalty to the leader, transparent faith in socialism, ardent love for the country and its people and noble sense of moral obligation towards comrades, strong organization and discipline, hard-working spirit and simplicity--these are the ideological and moral features of the Korean young people who have received the Juche-oriented education under the care of the Party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The editorial calls for bringing about signal innovations in the education as required by the developing reality, true to the Party's idea of attaching importance to education and science, and thus successfully train the younger generation into dependable revolutionary intellectuals for the building of a great prosperous powerful nation and powerfully demonstrate the prosperity of Songun Korea.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

On display at the festival are more than 200 calligraphic works created by calligraphists and fans in the capital and local areas, school youth and children, former unconverted long-term prisoners who have been known as reunification champions and patriots, and calligraphists of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Among them are works depicting with individual calligraphic styles the revolutionary and significant words, militant slogans and lyric verses, which well represent the working spirit of the Korean people and the proud development of the Juche-oriented calligraphy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such works as \"Mt. Paektu\", \"The Sun's Nation\" and \"Storm of Songun\" successfully reflect the immortal exploits of President Kim Il Sung and the greatness of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Flag of the DPRK\", \"People's Country\", \"Cradle of Life\", \"By Our Nation Itself\" and other works vividly show the truth that the socialist motherland is the cradle of happiness providing the Korean people with genuine life, and their ardent desire for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its opening ceremony was held at the Pyongyang International Cultural Center on Wednesday.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
