If a country hostile to the U.S. conducts a military drill in the geographically near region such as Mexico and Cuba, the U.S. would noisily brand it as a military threat and provocation to itself, he added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the world knows, the excuse of the U.S. talking about \"defensive nature\" of the joint military drill cannot work on anyone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Ulji Freedom Guardian is a very dangerous nuclear war drill as its purpose is to easily \"achieve\" invasion of the DPRK by \"neutralizing in the shortest period\" the military commanding system of the DPRK, its nuclear and rocket bases, in particular, through toughest preemptive strike by all attack means of the three services.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ahead of the military drill, the U.S. tried to mislead the opinion by claiming it was a military game while talking about \"reduction of U.S. troops\" and \"computer war game orientation\". But the south Korean KBS on August 18 confirmed that the priority of the drill would be to \"early expel the north headquarters under the simulated conditions of a total war.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The operation for \"preemptive attack\" and \"elimination of headquarters\" in the joint military drill is just the same with war frenzy of the U.S. administration vociferating about \"fire and fury\". This clearly proves its aggressive and provocative nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Four American brass hats who are responsible for the operation of military attack on the DPRK flew into south Korea and directly supervised the joint drill on the spot during the period.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality goes to prove that the U.S.-south Korea joint military drill, held every year according to the U.S. strategy for world domination, is not for \"defense\" but for attack and real war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"annual and regular joint military drill\" touted by the U.S. is the annual and regular hostile policy and nuclear threat and blackmail toward the DPRK. This fact shows that the U.S. admitted the responsibility for the escalated tension on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will never step back even an inch from the road of bolstering the country's nuclear force unless the U.S. hostile policy and nuclear threat are radically liquidated."

            "content": "Delegacion coreana rechaza la \"declaracion presidencial\" de CS de ONU\r\nPyongyang, 2 de septiembre (ACNC) -- En el pleno de la tercera sesion de la Conferencia de Ginebra sobre el Desarme convocado el 30 del mes expirado, la delegacion de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea aclaro la posicion de principios rechazando totalmente la \"declaracion presidencial\" del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU, fabricada en relacion con el exitoso lanzamiento del cohete balistico estrategico de mediano y largo alcance de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\tEl entrenamiento del lanzamiento del cohete balistico estrategico de mediano y largo alcance, realizado el dia 29 por las fuerzas estrategicas del Ejercito Popular de Corea, no pasa de ser un preludio de las resueltas contramedidas contra los ejercicios conjuntos militares Ulji Freedom Guardian de las fuerzas hostiles, asi apunto la delegacion y continuo:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa hicimos la advertencia significativa que la RPDC observara la conducta de EE.UU., pero el imperio respondio con el simulacro belicoso y agresivo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la actual situacion tan tirante creada en la Peninsula Coreana, no hay ninguna garantia de que la inmensa cantidad de fuerzas armadas concentradas en el Sur de Corea no pasara a la guerra real.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRecae totalmente a EE.UU. la responsabilidad de haber llevado al borde de guerra la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa \"declaracion presidencial\" inventada nuevamente por el CS de la ONU dando espaldas a la acusacion de la RPDC sobre las maniobras militares, deviene el producto de la campana intrigante anti-RPDC auspiciada por EE.UU. y la expresion de la injusta pauta de doble rasero. De ahi, la RPDC rechaza totalmente el documento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTomaremos las contramedidas mas duras si EE.UU. sigue actuando sin prudencia al ignorar las reiteradas advertencias de la RPDC de meditar las consecuencias catastroficas a ser producidas por las aventuras militares de EE.UU."

            "content": "Japon no debe mas incitar la situacion de la region, aconseja Rodong Sinmun\r\nPyongyang, 2 de septiembre (ACNC) -- El Ministerio de Defensa de Japon determino la aplicacion del ultramoderno sistema de misiles interceptores norteamericanos, Aegis Usher, bajo el pretexto de hacer frente al desarrollo de la tecnologia del cohete balistico de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\tPor otra parte, Japon toma parte activa en las acciones militares con EE.UU. y los medios de prensa ultraderechistas lo abogan por la manifestacion de solidaridad con EE.UU. e intencion de mantener a rayas a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo tales circunstancias, el premier japones, Abe, se reunio con el canciller y el ministro de Defensa y les ordeno estrechar el vinculo con EE.UU. frente a la \"amenaza\" de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto es una locura absurda inadecuada a su propia capacidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi senala el diario Rodong Sinmun en un comentario individual difundido este sabado y revela la intencion del pais isleno que habla tanto de la \"amenaza de misiles\" de la RPDC como sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLograr a toda costa el viejo sueno de la \"esfera de coprosperidad de la gran Asia Oriental\" aprovechando la tirante situacion de la region de Asia-Pacifico, es la ambicion invariable de los reaccionarios japoneses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa actual capa gobernante japonesa concedio el derecho al ejercicio del \"derecho a la autodefensa colectiva\" a las \"Fuerzas de Autodefensa\", poniendo en vigencia en 2016 la ley de seguridad, y amplio mas la escena de actividades de las \"Fuerzas de Autodefensa\" en ultramar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, da acicate a la fascitizacion y la militarizacion del pais inventando una tras otra las leyes infames incluyendo la de proteccion de secreto especial y la de castigo del crimen organizado y trata de enmendar a fuerzas la constitucion para legalizar la agresion al ultramar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, la enmienda constitucional fue censurada fuertemente dentro y fuera del pais y la capa gobernante sufre sucesivas derrotas en las elecciones locales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe ahi, los reaccionarios japoneses buscan la salida en la militarizacion de toda la sociedad al agrandar la hostilidad a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, Japon debe tener presente que su imprudencia traera la autodestruccion."
