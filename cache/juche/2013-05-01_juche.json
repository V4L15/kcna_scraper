            "content": "Kim Jong Un Visits Ministry of People's Security\r\n Pyongyang, May 1 (KCNA) -- Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and first chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK, visited the Ministry of People's Security to congratulate the people's security persons and service personnel of the Korean People's Internal Security Forces (KPISF) on May Day.\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Choe Ryong Hae and Jang Song Thaek.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Jong Un had a photo session with people's security persons and service personnel of KPISF.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He paid tribute to Generalissimos Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il before their statues, together with the commanding officers accompanying him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that the erection of their statues at the ministry strikingly demonstrates the unshakable will of all people's security persons and service personnel of KPISF to eternally hold the peerlessly great men in high esteem and devotedly defend the socialist system, a precious legacy bequeathed by the Generalissimos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underscored the need for them to eternally hold the Generalissimos in high esteem as the sun of Juche, firmly defend and glorify their undying revolutionary exploits with pure revolutionary conscience and strong sense of obligation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He gave important instructions to tighten people's security and bolster up the combat capabilities of KPISF in every way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Ministry of People's Security and KPISF play a very important role for defending the socialist system, he said, adding that the people's security persons and service personnel of KPISF should be deeply aware of their heavy yet honorable combat missions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underlined the need to strengthen the people's security organ and the internal security forces as units defending the policies of the party, strong guardians of socialism, merciless striking forces and reliable protectors of the lives and properties of the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The enemies are now afraid of our single-minded unity around the party more than anything else and running the whole gamut of desperate and base moves to destabilize and bring down our society, he noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that the enemies are working hard to bar our people from trusting and following the party with pure conscience and fixed will and alienate the masses from it, it is important to intensify the struggle to frustrate their moves, he stressed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He called for devotedly defending the party, social system and people, decisively foiling the ideological and cultural poisoning and psychological warfare of the enemies and mercilessly wiping out the undesirable and hostile elements who have foolish day dreams.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underlined the need for the ministry and the internal security forces to make full combat preparations to annihilate the U.S. imperialists and south Korean puppet group keen to stifle the DPRK and to creditably fulfill their missions and duties in the sacred struggle to provide a firm guarantee by dint of arms and law for the implementation of the party's line on simultaneously pushing forward the economic construction and the building of nuclear force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our Juche-oriented socialist country is invincible as the Korean People's Army and KPISF, the two revolutionary armed forces of the WPK, are firmly defending the security of the country and people, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He inspected Unit 2219 of KPISF that day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He gave the unit a pair of binoculars and an automatic rifle as gifts before having a photo session with its service personnel, expressing belief that they would safeguard the socialist system as firm as an iron wall.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round the lecture room of the O Jung Hup political university, a messroom, soldiers' bed room, education room and wash-cum-bath room.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was satisfied to see good conditions in the bed room, praising the unit for keeping the wash-cum-bath room with a sauna attached neat and clean.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the education room he underscored the need to train the soldiers to be strong in idea and faith by intensifying politico-ideological education among them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then he guided a drill of soldiers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After watching it, he highly appreciated their success in the drill and indicated tasks for bolstering up the combat capabilities of the unit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed belief that just as the service personnel of KPISF have always did, the soldiers of the unit would display a do-or-die will and matchless courage and thus become iron shields and fierce tigers devotedly defending the party, social system and people in their struggle to decisively foil the enemies' moves to stifle the DPRK."
