            "content": "Rodong Sinmun insiste en que EE.UU. debe abandonar su modo de pensar\r\nPyongyang, 1 de febrero (ATCC) -- Recientemente, el asistente del Secretario de Estado norteamericano para asuntos de Asia Oriental y el Pacifico, dijo que durante medio siglo pasado Estados Unidos \"vino manteniendo la seguridad y la estabilidad\" de la region de Asia Oriental y el Pacifico y \"tiene que mantener de continuo las fuerzas militares\" ubicadas en la region de Asia y el Pacifico para \"defender alli la paz y la estabilidad\". Y hablo de que EE.UU. cooperara activamente con el Sur de Corea para \"modernizar la alianza militar\" y anadio que \"no podra haber el error en la firme decision de cumplir la promesa de defensa\".\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto muestra su malsano intento de perpetuar el estacionamiento de las tropas yanquis en susodicha region incluyendo el Sur de Corea y su contorno y de agredir a Corea, y es una manifestacion del modo de pensar al estilo de guerra fria que da las espaldas a los asuntos de desnuclearizacion y el aseguramiento de la paz de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi senala el diario Rodong Sinmun en un comentario individual difundido este lunes y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la Peninsula Coreana, donde la situacion llega al borde de la guerra, la paz se ha mantenido evitando la guerra, lo que se debe enteramente a los esfuerzos pacientes y pacifistas de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. habla de la \"necesidad\" de la permanencia de sus tropas en la region de Asia y el Pacifico y de la \"modernizacion de la alianza militar\" con el Sur de Corea. Eso no pasa de ser un intento de aplastar militarmente a la RPDC y fortalecer la heguemonia militar en la citada region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Las fuerzas belicas norteamericanas pretenden desatar la nueva guerra coreana con el ataque preventivo movilizando sus modernas fuerzas armadas de golpe movil.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl \"cumplimiento de promesa de defensa\" y el \"mantenimiento de las fuerzas armadas norteamericanas\" de que habla EE.UU. vuelven a probar patentemente que este imperio intenta mostrar la supremacia de la fuerza y realizar a toda costa su estrategia de ataque preventivo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe reflexionar sobre la realidad, eliminar cuanto antes las estructuras de guerra fria en la region del Nordeste Asiatico, creadas por si mismo, y poner fin a sus imprudentes alborotos militares."
