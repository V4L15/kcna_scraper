            "content": "True colors of S. Korean \"ANSP\" revealed\r\n Pyongyang, April 1 (KCNA) -- The Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the National Democratic Front of South Korea released a white paper on March 26 disclosing the true colors of the South Korean \"Agency for National Security Planning\" (ANSP), Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation reported.\r\n   The white paper said in part:\r\n   Though power changed hands in South Korea, \"ANSP\" still remains the general headquarters of fascism and anti-reunification plots, an all-powerful tool and wrecker of democracy, contrary to the advertisement about its \"limited function.\"\r\n   \"ANSP\" has the \"anti-communist investigation department,\" \"anti-north operation department,\" \"psychological warfare   department\" and other main departments and branches which embrace hundreds of thousands of agents. It has also its own intelligence school.\r\n   After coming to power under the \"civilian\" veil, Kim Young Sam, bowing to public pressure, reformed \"ANSP\" in December 1993. In actuality, however, it was reinforced with such anti-communist departments as \"anti-north strategy planning department.\"\r\n   \"ANSP\" thrusts its claws to all the social spheres including politics, administration, judicature, diplomacy, press and inter-Korean relations and to every person.\r\n   It has put dissidents under surveillance round the clock and planted its agents among dissident, labor and student organizations to keep a close watch on their activities.\r\n   For \"power security\" it faked up more than 50 \"spyring cases\" in the 1979-1984 period and invented many cases including the \"brother Kim Sam Sok-sister Kim Un Ju case\" in the 1990s, too.\r\n   Those who were imprisoned by \"ANSP\" on various charges including those of being \"spy\" totalled 103 iaen eio in 1994 and 455 in 1996.\r\n   \"Policies of unification\" pursued by the successive rulers were what \"ANSP\" shaped and systematized.\r\n   When north-south high-level talks were underway in 1992, Ri Dong Bok, special advisor to the then \"ANSP Minister,\" broke off the inter-Korean contact, acting advisor to the \"Prime Minister\" who was the chief delegate of South Korea, and the spokesman. At that time, he overrode the \"Prime Minister's opinion\" and fabricated even \"instructions of the President.\"\r\n   \"ANSP\" allocates 336 hours to anti-north propaganda every day through three \"social and educational TV\" channels and eleven radio programs. In 1996, it began the anti-north \"religionist broadcasting\" and used such right-wing conservative papers as Chosun Ilbo in the propaganda against the north.\r\n   It has also resorted to such despicable acts as forcing renegades to speak ill of the north's political system with lies.\r\n   The existence of \"ANSP\" itself is the nation's shame. \r\n   To talk about democracy and reunification with it left alone is a mockery of the people. The present rulers of South Korea, who were victimized by \"ANSP\" in the past, should immediately take a step to dissolve it, true to their words as politicians.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
