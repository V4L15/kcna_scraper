They mocked at the victims by staging such deceptive farces as setting up \"civilian fund\" and \"paying relief money\", turned down law suits brought by victims and distorted the history textbooks dealing with Japan's past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In view of the stand and attitude of Germany and other members of the international community toward the issue of redressing past wrongs, Japan's approach towards the issue glaringly reveals its moral vulgarity before the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is a war criminal state as it brought untold disasters to the Koreans and other Asian people. It is, therefore, an unavoidable state obligation and political commitment for Japan to make apology and compensation to the victims in view of international law and from ethical and moral points of view. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Human conscience will keep watching Japan's attitude.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The WPK now regards science and technology as one of the three pillars of building the great prosperous powerful nation along with ideology and the army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the unshakable will of leader Kim Jong Il to bring science and technology up to the world's advanced level in the near future by developing them at a leaping pace and build a great prosperous powerful nation with their potential. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rarely high are confidence and zeal of scientists and technicians and all the people eager to fully display the dignity and might of Songun Korea with the leaping development of the science and technology of the country. The recent national meeting of scientists and technicians was an occasion of a dramatic turn in definitely lifting the nation's science and technology to the world's advanced level in a brief time to suit the requirements of the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The editorial appeals to the scientists and technicians to glorify the great Songun era endlessly by bringing a leaping progress of the century in science and technology in the spirit with which they opened the road of advance in building a great prosperous powerful nation by breaking through the grim ordeals of the \"Arduous March\" and forced march in bold offensive spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It stresses that primary efforts should be oriented to the development of IT, nano technology and bioengineering, the main target of the development of science and technology in the present times, technical engineering of important fields including mechanical engineering, metal engineering and heat engineering based on up-to-date science and technology be lifted to a new height and researches into basic science be developed in depth and thereby our country should be turned into a world-famous powerful country of science and technology. \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"

It went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has not yet made any honest apology and compensation for its indelible human rights abuses though half a century has passed since the end of the Second World War. It is still persisting in its evil doings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is getting frantic in its anti-DPRK rackets, misusing the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. to meet their selfish interests in wanton violation of the spirit and agreed points of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration adopted thanks to the goodwill of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Not a few countries in Western Europe, which were war criminal states like Japan, apologized for the aggression committed in the past and made adequate compensation to all victims in different countries. This generous gesture is going on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is only Japan that entered the new century with its crimes committed in the past century unredressed and is working hard to evade the liquidation of its past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The soul of the millions of Koreans who met tragic deaths at the point of bayonets of the Japanese imperialists and under their jackboots remains alive indicting them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the firm will and determination of the five million young Koreans to force Japan to pay for the Japanese imperialists' brutal aggression a thousand times generation after generation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAnd there will be no slightest concession in this issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities should properly understand the spirit of the Korean youth and unconditionally and immediately apologize and compensate the victims and their bereaved families for their violation of the rights of the Korean people in the past.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
