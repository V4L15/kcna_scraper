Korean Minister of Unification\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, September 30 (KCNA) -- At a meet with foreign press on September 24 Ryu U Ik, south Korean puppet minister of Unification, made remarks groundlessly finding fault with the social system in the DPRK, talking about \"essential limitation\" and the like. He went the lengths of asserting \"the north was to blame for the freeze of the inter-Korean relations.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson Sunday observes in a bylined commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat Ryu uttered is nothing but a shriek made by him, taken aback by the might of the single-minded unity of the whole party and army and all people around their supreme leader.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is reason why Ryu is making such desperate efforts to shore up the Lee group's \"policy toward the north\", defaming the social system in the DPRK this or that way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe issue of the inter-Korean relations and the issue of implementing the north-south joint declarations, in particular, have become focal points in the south Korean political circles with the \"presidential\" election close at hand.  Broad strata of people are now urging the \"presidential\" candidates from the ruling and opposition parties and an independent candidate not to follow in the footsteps of traitor Lee Myung Bak who brought the inter-Korean relations to a collapse but make a switchover in the present \"policy toward the north\", a policy of confrontation with compatriots in the north. It is against this backdrop that the puppet Ministry of Unification and its Chief Ryu U Ik, in particular, are hard hit by the public. Ryu is busy making outcries in a bid to get rid of this tight corner. But his rigmaroles only brought his true colors as a confrontation maniac into bolder relief. The recent reckless remarks made by Ryu as a yes man of Lee only added to the unpardonable c\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t rimes he has committed against the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will also force Ryu to pay dearly for what he has done when punishing the Lee group of traitors by force of arms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ryu would be well advised to behave himself, bearing in mind that out of the mouth comes evil."
