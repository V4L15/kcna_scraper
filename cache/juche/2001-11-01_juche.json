            "content": "Pen is mighty ideological instrument of WPK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 1 (KCNA) -- The pen is a mighty ideological instrument of the Workers' Party of Korea.\r\n Rodong Sinmun , organ of the central committee of the WPK, today says this in a signed article dedicated to its foundation anniversary (November 1).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n President Kim Il Sung, who established \"Saenal,\" \"Monthly Samil\" and many other revolutionary media during the anti-Japanese revolution, founded the newspaper Rodong Sinmun and other publications of the party on the basis of the glorious traditions of the revolutionary media after the liberation of the country. He had since paid deep concern to enhancing their militant function and role. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The sacred footmarks of the great communist revolutionary fighter Kim Jong Suk are vividly left in the history of Rodong Sinmun and other publications of the party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Leader Kim Jong Il has paid deep attention to the press from the first period of his revolutionary activities. He has intensified his guidance to the newspaper and other publications of the party in particular, from the early 1970s when our revolution was entering a great turning and developed the media of our party into a mighty ideological instrument conducive to modeling the whole society on the Juche idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said: \"I attach great importance to the pen as well as arms.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The basic mission of the pen held by our journalists and other pressmen is to defend him politically and ideologically at the risk of their lives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under his deep concern and wise leadership they have grown up as staunch fighters who have the spirit of devotedly defending the leader. It is their proud trait that they are devotedly defending his ideas and theories, line, authority and exploits, regarding the pen as an ideological weapon for defending him politically and ideologically at the risk of their lives. They are guided by his idea and theory on the press media. The traditions and exploits of the revolution in the press media established by him are carried forward by them in the new century. It is thanks to the large contingent of such faithful journalists and pressmen armed with the spirit of devotedly defending the leader that the revolutionary character of our party's media as his media is being firmly defended, our ideological position of socialism is invulnerable and the single-hearted unity of our party and revolutionary ranks with the people's army as the core is being cemented as firm as an iron wall. \r\n\r\n"

In order to fulfil this mission Jaju Minbo has made efforts to create public atmosphere for the implementation of the joint declaration and ensure solidarity and unity among youth and student organizations in particular.
