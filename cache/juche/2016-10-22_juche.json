It is pity that Americans have national security left to such guy to look after it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After choosing East Asia-Pacific region as the main theater for holding supremacy in the 21st century the Obama administration let him take charge of the region and speak for it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When referring to the DPRK's line of simultaneously developing the two fronts in the past, Rassel malignantly decried it, blustering that \"north Korea would never achieve prosperity as long as it pushes forward its nuclear development.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t While talking about \"nuclear and missile threat\" from the  DPRK, he talked volumes about the issue of military cooperation among the U.S., Japan and south Korea with Washington as a main player, the building of information network and investment in deploying THAAD. Moreover, he never opened his mouth without letting out a slew of rubbish about \"human rights situation in the north,\" regardless of time and place.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What Rassel uttered this time is nothing but a scream made by the guy, much upset by the total failure of the north Korea policy of the present U.S. administration which has refused to understand the generally accepted principle of the sovereignty of other countries and the essence of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was none other than the U.S. that compelled the DPRK to have access to nukes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has staged nuclear war drills against the DPRK, non-nuclear weapon state, every year after designating it as the target of preemptive nuclear attack, thus posing grave threat to its supreme interests and pushing it to having access to nukes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has bolstered up its nuclear force both in quality and quantity as it has been exposed to constant and direct nuclear threat from the U.S., the world's biggest nuclear weapons state and nuclear war criminal state. It was, therefore, the best option to protect the sovereignty and vital rights of the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tragedy is that the U.S., still seized with megalomania, is insisting on its contradictory view of the situation and failing to realize that the DPRK is not the country which it can control as it pleases.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK regards the mud-slinging at the dignity of its supreme leadership as the most blatant challenge to it and the worst hostile act of putting into practice the declaration of a war that the U.S. made before the former.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Rassel's flurry of invective is sheer rhetoric.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The White House will disappear the moment the U.S. launches aggression against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The American land has come within the range of powerful nuclear strike means of Juche Korea.
