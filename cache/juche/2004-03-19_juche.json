            "content": "KCNA Blasts S. Korean Authorities' Anti-North Confrontation Strategy \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 18 (KCNA) -- The \"National Security Council\" of south Korea set out \"a four-point basic security policy strategy\" in its book on the security policy conception \"peace, prosperity and national security\" published recently.\r\n The book defined the army and people of the DPRK as a \"direct threat\", underscoring the need to \"maintain military muscle strong enough to lead the anti-DPRK deterrent force\" to cope with it and build up self-reliant elite military forces in the future so that they may \"play a major role in deterring the north.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is an unpardonable anti-national, anti-reunification crime and an intolerable insult to the army and people of the DPRK desirous of national cooperation. This is, at the same time, a total negation of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration reflecting the desire and will of the fellow countrymen for national reconciliation and cooperation and peaceful reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such reckless remarks calling for a major role in opposing fellow countrymen in place of the U.S. forces under the pretext of the north's non-existent \"direct threat\" is, to all intents and purposes, a version of the \"theory of the principal enemy.\" They are quite contrary to the desire for \"co-prosperity of the nation\" and have nothing to do with the \"self-reliant national defense.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the south Korean authorities are letting loose sheer sophism that the \"four-point basic security policy strategy\" is intended for the reconciliation and unity between the south and the north and national prosperity and cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is nothing but a smokescreen to cover up the danger of their Cold War-oriented confrontation strategy targeted against the north, their dialogue partner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation on the Korean peninsula is so dangerous due to the U.S. anti-DPRK nuclear racket that a new war may break out there any moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is reinforcing its armed forces in south Korea to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK and working hard to lay an international siege to the country in a bid to force it to \"scrap its nuclear program first\" at any cost. The south Korean authorities' call for cooperation with the U.S, not with the compatriots, against this backdrop is a very dangerous act of bringing a holocaust of a war to the Korean peninsula and pushing the inter-Korean relations to confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dialogue can not go with standoff. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their talking about \"dialogue and cooperation\" with the north and \"national prosperity,\" while crying out for \"deterrence against the north\" and \"major role,\" is a challenge to the desire and will of all the Koreans for national unity and the independent and peaceful reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts go to clearly prove that the \"four-point basic security policy strategy\" set out by the south Korean authorities is not for \"self-reliant national defense\" and \"peace and prosperity\" but a confrontation strategy aimed to strengthen the cooperation with the U.S. in political, economic, military, diplomatic and all other fields, block inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation and ignite a war against the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north will closely watch the future stand and attitude of the south Korean authorities and take necessary counteractions.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA on Lesson Drawn from Situation in Iraq \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 18 (KCNA) -- One year has passed since the United States provoked a war of aggression against Iraq.\r\n On March 20 last year the U.S. started invasion against Iraq, a member state of the United Nations and a sovereign state, under the pretext of \"eliminating weapons of mass destruction (WMD)\" and committed mass destruction and genocide, toppling its legitimate government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is that before the start of the U.S. aggression against Iraq an inspection of Iraq was made for its complete disarmament through the UN Security Council but the U.S. launched the war defying the UNSC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is well known that the UNSC had been deeply involved in the operation to disarm the country for more than a decade, after drawing a conclusion on the basis of the U.S.-provided information that WMD in Iraq was a threat to global peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The UNSC adopted a resolution No. 687 on April 3, 1991 and passed several other resolutions through it, sending a big UN weapons inspection group to Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For seven years of its inspection of Iraq the group destroyed all elements suspected to be used for the development of WMD and scoured even presidential palace but failed to confirm the U.S.-provided information. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The inspection resulted in the dismantlement of 90 percent of its weapons and the country lost the capability to wage a war. When the world public became skeptical about the U.S. cooked-up information, it spread new misinformation about Iraq's \"purchase of uranium\" and \"possession of chemical weapons\" and made much ado about \"the imminent threat from Iraq,\" providing even \"information gathered by spy satellites\" to the UNSC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After receiving again the information as it was, the UNSC adopted resolution No. 1441 on November 8, 2002, allowing the group to resume the inspection of Iraq after the lapse of four years but it failed to discover any traces of WMD. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though the group confirmed the fact that Iraq did not have access to such weapons, the U.S. absurdly asserted that the efforts to disarm Iraq according to UNSC resolution No. 1441 failed. It submitted a draft resolution calling for taking a military action to the UNSC, thus barring the international community from conducting any activities to seek a political and diplomatic solution to the Iraqi issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the draft resolution calling for undisguised aggression of a sovereign state sparked a hot controversy among international community and it was consequently turned down by the UNSC, U.S. President Bush finally gave an order to invade Iraq, blustering that carriage or non-carriage of the draft resolution at the UNSC was not important and the U.S. would launch attack even defying the UNSC. This completely paralyzed its function. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The UNSC whose basic mission is to preserve international peace and security not only failed to check the U.S. aggression but allowed itself to be used in justifying the U.S.-pursued aim to completely disarm Iraq through inspection. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The UNSC is thus known to be incapable of doing anything against the arbitrary practice of the world's only superpower. \r\n The U.S. goal has become clear now when one year has passed since its start of the war of aggression against Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It seeks to seize with ease Iraq completely disarmed by the UNSC under the pretext of \"eliminating WMD\" and, furthermore, put under complete control the Mideast region which holds 65 percent of the world oil deposit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What happened in Iraq teaches a serious lesson that if the UN and the international community allow the U.S. high-handed and arbitrary practices, the UN Charter, the foundation of international law, will become invalid and global peace and security are bound to be seriously disturbed and accepting unreasonable inspection aimed at disarmament will not help avert a war but lead to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary for the UN member states to seriously look back from an objective viewpoint on how the UNSC handled the Iraqi issue over the last 10-odd years.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
