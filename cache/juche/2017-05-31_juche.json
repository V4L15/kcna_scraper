It seemed so appealing in tone. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their words have now formally made the third item of the \"4-point keynote\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. administration's talk about \"ruling out regime change\" is spewing out the venom of outrageous threat and blackmail. It actually means that it would make no scruple of bringing down the social system of the DPRK, not ruling out invasion if the DPRK fails to abandon its nukes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK knows well about the way of protecting its social system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the way of producing more perfect and powerful Juche weapons and nuclear attack means of the Korean style for striking terror into and annihilating the aggressors zealously watching the chance to violate the sovereignty of the DPRK and bring down its social system, and thus building a high fortress of self-defence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The last item of the \"keynote\" is just the self-contradiction finally reached by the Trump administration while finding itself in dilemma and seeking a stop-gap measure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If it was based on a reasonable logic, the last item should have been the first on the list. But the \"dialogue\" item occupied the last with a brand of \"finally,\" only to reveal the ulterior purpose sought by the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This means that the U.S. seeks to subdue someone through maximum pressure and sanctions on the principle of pressure first and negotiation next and then make him come out to the negotiating table and wrest a surrender document from him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Would a proper communication between human being and beast be possible though dialogue opens as long as the U.S. regards dialogue as a lever for extending pressure, nuclear weapons of the DPRK more valuable than its life as a bargaining chip to be bartered with something, and fails to drop black-hearted intent?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"4-point keynote\" adopted by the U.S. as detailed \"maximum pressure and engagement\" brought to light the poor IQ and narrow-minded vision of the White House policy-makers team.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how desperately the U.S. and its vassal forces may try not to recognize the DPRK as a nuclear weapon state, the DPRK will remain unchanged in its position as a nuclear power and will speed up the diversification and modernization of nuclear force before the aggressors and provocateurs come to their senses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No one can block the way of the DPRK bolstering its nuclear force according to the great line of simultaneously developing the two fronts."
