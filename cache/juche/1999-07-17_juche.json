What has mainly caused insecurity in Asia and international community in actuality is not the DPRK's satellite launch but the ongoing moves to establish the criminal and aggressive \"Theatre Missile Defense\" system, that can never be justified.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   \"TMD\" system is meant for reinvading the DPRK through preemptive attacks and containing big powers in the Asia-Pacific region.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries are stepping up the moves to turn Japan into a major military power and launch overseas aggression, while accelerating the establishment of \"TMD\" system allegedly to cope with the DPRK's satellite launch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This year they passed through the diet a set of bills to implement \"Japan-U.S. defense cooperation guidelines\" to restore the right of belligerency and put up such war slogan as \"TMD\" system for overseas aggression. Their reckless war action has reached the extremes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   They are well advised to stop acting rashly, clearly mindful that their  aggressive war hysteric will only lead them to destruction.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Folk game: Korean chess\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 17 (KCNA) -- Janggi (Korean chess) is a traditional game of Korea still popular with the people. Two people sit face to face with a chessboard in between.   The person who captures his opponent's  kung (king) is the winner.\r\n   The origin of the game is still unknown, but it has a long history.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The chessboard measures 60 cm by 70 cm. It has nine vertical and ten horizontal lines.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Each player has a total of  16 chessmen, with one kung (king), two cha (carts), two mal (horses), two sang (elephants), two sa (bodyguards), two pho (guns) and five jol (pawns).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Chessmen come in different colours, including red and blue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is a principle to place the chessmen alike but the positions of sang and mal can be changed. Each player must move every chess piece according to its designated route. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kung and sa can move one block after another in their designated quarter.  A cha moves forward, backward, horizontally and vertically while pho goes straight, skipping over a chess piece (a pho cannot skip over another pho). A mal can go one step stright and then diagonally, while sang can take the first step straight and the second and third ones diagonally. However, if another chessman blocks their way they cannot move.\r\n   Jol moves right, left or forward, one block each time, but cannot go backward.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A player can remove his opponent's chessmen by replacing them with his own pieces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If he captures his opponent's kung he says \"Janggun\". In case the opponent manages to block or evade the attack he says \"Monggung\". In the opposite case, the latter loses the game. But if the opponent can evade \"Janggun\" continuously, the game ends in a draw.    \r\n   \r\n"
