And from 1985 it buckled down in real earnest to the development of technical processes for using space for the military purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In recent years it has worked round the clock to establish an independent missile defense system for forestalling strikes at other countries, while hastening the joint development of MD, a rehashed version of the \"Star Wars,\" with the United States under the pretext of \"missile threat\" from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Toward the end of last year, Japan carried out a test launching of \"SM-3\", a missile deployed on the sea for intercepting a missile in outer space, thereby rounding off its own missile defense system composed of \"SM-3\" and \"PAC-3\", a \"patriot\" interceptor missile deployed on land. The deployment of the \"PAC-3\" of the Air \"SDF\" had been completed in the metropolitan sphere by the end of March this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is planning to deploy 124 \"PAC-3\" missiles and 16 \"PAC-3\" units at 11 bases across the country in three years to come to bring into shape a missile defense system topping the world in density. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Last year Japan completed its satellite system for information collection covering the whole world by launching rocket \"H-2A\" loaded with a spy satellite. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What it seeks in this is obviously to gratify its aggressive design overseas at any cost by gaining military supremacy in space. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That's why Japan openly prescribed in the \"Main Law on Space\", under the cloak of \"national security\", that the domestic satellite networks and its associated facilities can be used for the MD. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Facts show that the Japan's moves for reinvasion through space militarization have gone beyond the danger line and are being stepped up posthaste at the practical stage.\r\n The Japanese reactionaries should not act rashly, deeply mindful that their reckless drive for space militarization aimed at reinvasion will lead them to self-destruction and death. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
