We courteously propose having wide-ranging dialogue and negotiations with the political parties and organizations of south Korea including its authorities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the review of the past three years that the issue of inter-Korean relations can never be solved by confrontation but it only sparks off an armed clash and war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to mend the north-south relations now at the lowest ebb we will conduct positive dialogue and negotiations with the political parties and organizations of south Korea including its authorities, be they authorities or civilians, ruling parties or opposition parties, progressives or conservatives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We call for an unconditional and early opening of talks between the authorities having real power and responsibility, in particular.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 2. We are ready to meet anyone anytime and anywhere, letting bygones be bygones, if he or she is willing to go hands in hands with us.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For the great cause of the nation present is more important than yesterday and tomorrow is dearer than present. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The danger of war will be defused and the day of peace, reunification and prosperity be brought earlier when all Koreans assert in concert and pool their wisdom and efforts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 3. We will discuss and solve all the issues related to the important matters of the nation including detente, peace, reconciliation, unity and cooperation at dialogue, negotiations and contacts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe north and the south are called upon to sincerely approach the discussion on the issues related to the important issues of the nation irrespective of partisan interests and strategy and isms and make positive efforts to seek agreed points to the maximum.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 4. As an immediate offer, we propose discontinuing to heap slanders and calumnies on each other and refraining from any act of provoking each other in order to create an atmosphere of improving the inter-Korean relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Dialogue and negotiations cannot be properly conducted nor can they make smooth progress even if the north and south sit at the negotiating table when mud-slinging and provocative acts against each other are allowed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We call on the north and the south to refrain from now from the smear campaign and provocative act of deepening misunderstanding and distrust and inciting confrontation and hostility.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Consistent is our stand to improve the inter-Korean relations, promote national reconciliation and unity and open a landmark phase of peace and reunification on the Korean Peninsula through dialogue and negotiations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The government, political parties and organizations of the DPRK express expectation that the authorities, political parties and organizations of south Korea will positively respond to their sincere proposal and appeal for weathering the crisis on the peninsula and between the north and the south. They also call on all the Koreans at home and abroad, all governments, political parties and organizations in the world, international organizations and progressive people that love justice, truth and peace to extend warm support and solidarity to them."

Para colmo, anunciaron que promoverian la \"fundacion de un aparato de DDHH y la independencia del poder judicial\" en el Norte de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En su comentario individual difundido este miercoles, el diario Rodong Sinmun califica la publicacion de esa \"hoja de ruta\" de grave provocacion politica contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Es muy absurdo que los que hablan tanto de \"DDHH\" son los que convirtieron la sociedad surcoreana en uno de los peores lugares del mundo para la democracia y los DDHH, revela el comentarista y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La siniestra intencion de la banda de conservadores surcoreanos es derrumbar el sagrado regimen y sistema de la RPDC ventilando en la opinion publica el inexistente problema de \"DDHH\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La campana anti-RPDC en el tema de \"DDHH\" se torna cada vez mas brutal luego del incidente de hundimiento de la corbeta \"Cheonan\" y el de canonazos en la isla Yonphyong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Los titeres surcoreanos, contagiados con la extremada conciencia conflictiva, endurecen al mismo tiempo la amenaza militar sobre la RPDC con la meta de realizar su absurda ambicion de \"reunificar bajo el sistema democratico liberal\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Realmente, en la RPDC no existe ningun problema de DDHH.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Estarian muy equivocados los conservadores surcoreanos si piensan conseguir algo lanzando la campana de DDHH anti-RPDC con datos inventados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esta campana no dara otro resultado que profundizar aun mas la desconfianza y la confrontacion entre ambas partes de Corea."

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun critica la actitud servil a EE.UU. de Japon\r\nPyongyang, 5 de enero (ATCC) -- Recientemente, el director del secretariado del gabinete de Japon dijo que \"es muy importante la existencia de la base de infantes de marina de Estados Unidos en Okinawa\" y \"no hay otro remedio que pedir al departamento de Okinawa que cubra los gastos por el mantenimiento de ella\". \n\t\t\t\t\tEste hecho evidencia que las autoridades japonesas piensan seguir manteniendo a sus expensas la base militar norteamericana en Okinawa. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSenala asi el diario Rodong Sinmun en un comentario individual divulgado este miercoles y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn este mundo es muy dificil encontrar a un pais como Japon que bajo el pretexto de la \"seguridad\", mantiene en su territorio a muchas tropas agresoras extranjeras y paga enormes sumas para mantener las bases de ellas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto significa que la politica de Japon carece de principios y doctrina propia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRealmente, las tropas norteamericanas presentes en Okinawa no sirven para la \"seguridad\" de Japon, sino funcionan como aparato de agresion y guerra para cumplir la estrategia de despotismo y hegemonia militares de EE.UU. sobre la region del Nordeste Asiatico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, las autoridades japonesas pretenden mantener la base militar norteamericana en Okinawa, pese a la fuerte oposicion de los habitantes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras obedezca a ciegas a EE.UU., Japon no tendra su futuro."
