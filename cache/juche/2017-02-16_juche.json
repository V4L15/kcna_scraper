When taking note of these facts, there would be no legal ground whatsoever to fault the DPRK's test-fire as it is part of the normal process it has to go through in implementing its state line, and a step for self-defence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The unbiased international community does not forget the double-standards applied by the U.S. and the UNSC as they turned blind eyes to the test-fire of some countries while cooking up brigandish \"sanctions resolutions\" against the DPRK over its every measure taken to bolster its defence capabilities, terming it \"provocation\" and \"threat.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the past the U.S., obsessed by frenzy for putting sanctions on the DPRK to strangle it, abused the UN to cook up harsh \"sanctions resolutions\" while faulting the DPRK's space development for peaceful purposes and measures for bolstering nuclear deterrence for self-defence, its legitimate right.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On Jan. 6, 2016 the DPRK conducted its first H-bomb test, thereby showing the U.S. keen on inflicting even nuclear holocaust, not content with sanctions, blockade and military pressure on the DPRK, its tremendous might to firmly defend the country's sovereignty and the nation's right to existence and reliably guarantee the peace and security of the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In its wake the DPRK opened to public its miniaturized nuclear warhead and succeeded in the underwater test-fire of strategic submarine ballistic missile and the test-fire of surface-to-surface medium to long-range strategic ballistic rocket Hwasong-10, thus displaying the firm will of the country to retaliate against the U.S. resorting to reckless military provocation while talking about heinous \"beheading operation\" and \"high-density strike\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It also succeeded in nuclear war head explosion test as substantial and stepped-up counteraction to foil the U.S. and other hostile forces' nuclear blackmail and sanctions racket aimed at blatantly challenging the DPRK's exercise of sovereign right while categorically denying its strategic position.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is as clear as noonday how the U.S. sanctions and pressure upon the DPRK will end up as they are crimes against humanity designed to totally deny the DPRK's sovereignty and its rights to existence and development, check modern civilization and bring the society of the DPRK back to medieval dark world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nothing can undermine the strategic position of the DPRK which ranked itself with pride among the nuclear powers with a firm hold on the nuclear sword of justice for defending the nation's sovereignty and regional peace and stability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Any anti-DPRK steps, the U.S. and its vassal forces are going to take again by abusing the UNSC, would mean a wanton violation of the legitimate right of a sovereign state and universally recognized international law and they will end up in smoke as in the past. This is our warning.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The escalating moves against the DPRK will compel it to drastically increase its nuclear attack capabilities."
