This proves that the U.S. scheme of preemptive nuclear attack is systematically going over from violent words to operational plan and from the plan to the stage of military action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north, the south and overseas are aboil with reunification fervor with the 5th anniversary of the joint declaration in the offing and they are planning to gather in Pyongyang for a grand festival for national reunification. And they are now hastening its preparations in the last stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At this very moment, the United States and the south Korean military authorities saw eye to eye with each other in massively hurling into south Korea Stealth fighter bombers targeted against the north in a bid to spoil the atmosphere of the festival overnight and frustrate the grand reunification festival itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We, in the name of the whole nation, bitterly denounce the deployment of Stealth fighter bombers in south Korea by the United States as a treasure shell of the provocation of a war against the north and the worst malicious challenge to the Korean nation and June 15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States would be well advised to promptly take out of south Korea the F-117 Stealth fighter bombers and other military hardware, stop its war moves against the north and withdraw its aggression forces at an early date, pondering over the grave consequences to be entailed by its reckless war provocation scheme against the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean military authorities should bear responsibility for cooperating with the U.S. in bringing the Stealth planes into south Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And it has since closely followed up the subsequent development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those remarks made by Cheney at a time when the DPRK-U.S. New York contact has kicked off in the direction of resuming the six-party talks clearly indicate his inveterate rejection of the political system in the DPRK and his intention to put the brake on the process of the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The remarks of Cheney, boss of the hawkish hard-liners, revealed the true colors of this group steering the implementation of the policy of the Bush administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We feel once again what good job we have done when we have stood in the stand-off with such hawkish hard-liners over the nuclear issue and the issue of the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What Cheney uttered at a time when the issue of the six-party talks is high on the agenda is little short of telling the DPRK not to come out for the talks.\r\n The United States should clearly know that the DPRK, a dignified independent and sovereign state, has never moved under any pressure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We are strong enough to defy the pressure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was none other than the U.S. that compelled the DPRK to have access to nukes. It is, therefore, quite preposterous for the U.S. to take issue with this.\r\n Consistent is our stand to maintain the goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and seek a negotiated peaceful solution to the issue. But if the U.S. persists in its wrong behavior, misjudging our magnanimity and patience as a sign of weakness, this will entail more serious consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. has a real intention to peacefully settle the nuclear issue through dialogue, it should retract its remarks such as \"outpost of tyranny\" and provide a justification and conditions necessary for the resumption of the talks. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
