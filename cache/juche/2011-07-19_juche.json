The conservative group had already begun going on the decline due to its defeat in the \"election to the local self-governing bodies\" last year and the recent by-election. It has been thrown into such difficult position that it is hard to save its destiny. This group is now seized with such fear that it may fail in the \"National Assembly\" and \"presidential\" elections due next year and can hardly realize its dream of staying in power. It is, therefore, seeking a way out of this in cracking down upon people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The fascists use \"pro-communist acts\" and \"acts of benefiting the enemy\" as pretexts for suppressing the people. What the group of traitors seeks is to crack down upon all the forces opposed to their treacherous rule by labeling them \"pro-north leftists\" and put down the anti-\"government\" struggle by resorting to violence. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The frantic suppression proves that the conservative group is the heinous group of traitors who do not hesitate to turn south Korea into a scene of bloodshed for its staying in power, utterly indifferent to national unity and the reunification of the country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean conservative group is seriously mistaken if it thinks it can tide over the crisis through dictatorship and crackdown. It will only lay bare the fascist nature and ugly sight of the Lee group."
