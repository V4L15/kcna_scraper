This is the present picture of south Korean diplomacy driven into a tight corner. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Precisely for this reason experts in the fields of unification, diplomacy and security of south Korea issued a declaration on the situation demanding the ministry give up at once \"shameful diplomacy.\" They claimed that if the \"president,\" who brought about chaos of unification, diplomacy and security, persistently works to control diplomacy, she will not be able to escape catastrophe. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Yun Pyong Se and other confidants of Park Geun Hye are now making desperate efforts to quell the demand of the people for her resignation talking about \"nuclear threat from the north\" swimming against the trend of the times, but this will only touch off stronger popular resistance. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is not long before Yun Pyong Se and others of the ministry, traitors and accomplices in the \"Park Geun Hye, Choe Sun Sil scandal\" will go to the political scaffold together with the worst wicked woman Park Geun Hye."

Esto es la conclusion sacada esta vez por la sociedad internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La avalancha de criticas y burlas a las elecciones presidenciales de EE.UU. de este ano son la senal de quiebra de la democracia de ese tipo."
