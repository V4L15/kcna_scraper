This century, too, they are winning one victory after another in the confrontation with U.S. imperialism styling itself the world's only superpower, thus emerging the greatest nation, he added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The secretary general of the Nepal World Peace Committee noted that President Kim Il Sung inflicted upon the U.S. imperialists the first defeat in their history in the 20th century. Leader Kim Jong Il will force them to sustain a final ruin in the 21st century, he added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Jean Marie Lambret, chief of the French Group for the Study of the Juche Idea, said that the U.S. is constantly threatening socialist Korea after working out a scenario for a war of aggression against it under the pretext of the nuclear issue. He urged the U.S. imperialists to know well that they can never subjugate socialist Korea steadfastly pursuing an independent policy and that the DPRK is invincible as its army and people are united as one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Otete Gaston Mboyo, chairman of the National Committee of the Genuine Lumumbist Patriotic Party of Democratic Congo, in a lecture referred to the historical significance of the Korean people's Fatherland Liberation War. He emphasized that Kim Jong Il has achieved great successes in increasing the national defence capability and building a great prosperous powerful socialist nation despite the U.S. imperialists' persistent moves for a new war and their nuclear racket. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A congratulatory message to Kim Jong Il was adopted at the meeting in Nepal.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Of them at least 50,000 were killed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many people and their descendants are still undergoing sufferings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Successive presidents of the United States have stressed the validity and necessity of the use of nuclear weapons, taking Truman's \"theory of almighty nuclear weapons\" as the basis of the state politics for world domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since the Bush administration came into being, the U.S. military strategy has turned into a strategy for preemptive nuclear attack from the nuclear containing strategy, heralding a nuclear holocaust to humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In particular, the U.S. warhawks have regarded the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as the main target of forestalling nuclear attack, thus creating a dangerous situation in which a nuclear war may break out on the Korean peninsula any moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has pushed with the development of small nuclear weapons to strike the DPRK's strategic and underground targets and neutralize its combat capacity. It, which has succeeded in developing ultrahigh-speed underground penetrating missiles, is going to deploy them in south Korea before any other regions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also planning to deploy the nuclear powered carrier Stenis loaded with fighter-bombers and fighters which are tantamount to the U.S. air force in south Korea, nuclear submarines, Aegis and other battleships equipped with means of forestalling nuclear attack in the waters around south Korea in around mid-August. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its preparations to start a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula have reached a very dangerous stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If a nuclear war breaks out in Korea, its holocaust will never be confined only to the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present situation requires all the peace-loving people across the world to heighten vigilance against the U.S. reckless nuclear war moves which will bring a nuclear damage to humankind.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Demanded\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 6 (KCNA) -- The U.S. \"cutback\" and relocation of its forces in south Korea are aimed to equip them with up-to-date means of war behind this curtain and maximize their capability for a preemptive attack on the DPRK. Rodong Sinmun Friday says this in a signed article.\r\n U.S. brasshats openly claimed that the reduction of U.S. forces in south Korea would help bolster the combat capability as south Korea would be provided with modern war deterrent, the article notes, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is, in actuality, stepping up its arms buildup in south Korea in real earnest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under its plan to bolster its forces in south Korea announced last year the U.S. will massively introduce the latest unmanned reconnaissance planes, armed helicopters, missiles, precision guided bombs, infantry battle vehicles, electronic commanding systems and other war equipment worth more than ten billion dollars into south Korea. As soon as the plan was announced more than 20 sophisticated helicopters Longbow AH-64D were additionally deployed in units of the U.S. forces in south Korea and some of PAC-2 were replaced with PAC-3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year, too, the U.S. keeps shipping into south Korea the modern combat equipment it had tested in the Iraqi war under the pretext of beefing up its war deterrent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. preparations for a war against the DPRK are not confined to its frantic arms buildup. The U.S. imperialists are staging all forms of war maneuvers one after another to effectively use their up-to-date war equipment for a surprise preemptive strike at the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. relocation of its forces in south Korea in the area south of the River Han is aimed at helping them get rid of the range of the retaliatory strike of the Korean People's Army in case they ignite a war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these facts go to clearly prove that the real purpose of the U.S. \"cutback\" and relocation of the U.S. troops in south Korea is to unleash the second Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should totally withdraw its forces from south Korea, instead of reducing or relocating them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
