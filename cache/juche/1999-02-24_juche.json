At \"talks\" with the \"Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade\", the acting chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's Political Affairs Research Council ,Niwa, who was heading the delegation, said, on the issue of cooperation in offering funds to KEDO (Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization), \"it would be difficult for the diet to approve of the fund contribution if North Korea launches another missile.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind his remark is Japan's crafty aim to put a brake on the construction of the LWR.   Whether Japan contributes fund to LWR construction or not is an internal matter of KEDO.   So the DPRK has nothing to do with it.   But, it can never remain onlooker to the ill-intentioned behavior of Japan talking about the freeze of the fund contribution on the pretext of the DPRK's missile launch.  The LWR construction has not made any progress since its start.   This is, to a considerable extent, because of the Japanese authorities' irresponsible attitude of dodging an international obligation.     Displeased with the LWR construction from its very start,  the Japanese reactionaries evaded the fund contribution on various pretexts.   They have been utterly indifferent to fund contribution to KEDO since they cried over \"missile threat\" on the pretext of the DPRK's launch of a satellite last August.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This being the reality, the fiction of \"missile threat\" loudmouthed by the Japanese reactionaries is no more than a pretext to speed up Japan's militarization and to lower a check-bar on the LWR construction.     Underlying the ulterior intention of the Japanese reactionaries, who regard the DPRK as a thorn in the flesh, is, in a nutshell, to delay the LWR construction and make the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework abortive so as to pave the way for reinvasion on the pretence of the \"March crisis\" on the Korean peninsula.     It is well illustrated by the fact that officials of the liberal democratic and liberal parties strongly called for the passage of the bill on the \"U.S.-Japan defense cooperation guidelines\" at the recent talks in Seoul.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They also said the bill related to guidelines lays down such \"counter-measures as logistic support to the U.S. forces in the event of emergency as the situation on the Korean peninsula remains obscure.\"    This reveals the criminal attempt of the Japanese reactionaries to reinvade Korea backed by the U.S. forces in case of contingency  on the peninsula.    The Japanese reactionaries should be well advised not to run amok, clearly aware that reinvasion leads to self-destruction. \r\n\r\n   \r\n"

This is a flagrant violation of the sovereignty of the DPRK and just like a declaration of war.    So his statement is  sparking bitterest indignation among the Korean nation.     Development, test and launch of missile is  in actuality, a legitimate issue at which nobody can sling mud as it belongs to the sovereignty of the DPRK.     Nevertheless, Ozawa groundlessly labeled the missile launch as a \"missile attack\" and openly declared a \"counter-attack\".    This shows how bellicose and wicked Ozawa is. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries have spun out a string of slanders against the DPRK.   But no one has made such offensive and aggressive remarks in public as Ozawa did.      The fact proves that Ozawa is the worst man among the Japanese reactionaries and the most bellicose element among war hawks.      Ozawa is now running amuck like a puppy knowing no fear of a tiger.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is certain that Ozawa does not know the DPRK today is not what it was under Japan's colonial rule.  Indeed, his misbehavior is the height of shamelessness.   To answer the \"counter-attack\" with counter-attack is the unshakable will and faith of the people and the People's Army of Korea.

            "content": "Record of crimes of S. Korean \"government\"\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 24 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today carries a commentator's article on 1-year-long record of  crimes of the South Korean self-styled \"people's government.\"    The article says that in the past one year after their coming into power the South Korean \"government\" authorities have committed crimes of pro-American, pro-Japanese flunkeyism and treachery, dependence on outsiders, fascist suppression of the people and confrontation moves against the north and reunification.   It further says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people's national dignity and sovereignty were sold out and South Korea has turned into a dual colony of the U.S. And Japan owing to the pro-American, pro-Japanese flunkeyist and treacherous acts of the present rulers. This is the crime of the blackest dye.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   No sooner had the present chief executive of South Korea, who once advocated \"nationalism,\" come into power than he begged for the U.S. troops' permanent occupation of South Korea, saying the U.S. troops should remain in South Korea even after the reunification of Korea as the occupation does not hurt independence.   Political, economic, cultural and all other sectors of South Korea fell into subjugation, disgrace and bankruptcy owing to the present rulers' heinous pro-American, pro-Japanese flunkeyist and treacherous acts and dependence on outsiders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Politics of South Korea is totally dead due to the U.S. colonial rule and international trusteeship. A policy can be  worked out, a bullet fired and even a single penny spent only with the permission of the U.S. master. This is the reality of South Korea.   Not content with offering South Korea to the United States as its state, the present rulers are leaving it to the mercy of the Japanese reactionaries. They declared the past crimes of Japan null and void, sold out the Tok Islet to Japan and are going to invite Akihito,  to South Korea, calling him \"Emperor\",  and flung the door open to corrupt Japanese culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Over the past one year they ruthlessly suppressed the righteous advance of the people for independence, democracy, reunification and the right to existence at the point of bayonet.   With their coming into power the sagging South Korean economy has been driven into a total bankruptcy in a real sense of the word. In fact, it has nothing but foreign debts amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars, ruins and debris of enterprises that fell victim to indiscriminative \"hunting\" by foreign monopoly capital.   The South Korean people have been subjected to worst sufferings, misfortune, destitution and death under the present authorities' treacherous misrule.   The past one year is also characterized by their confrontation and war moves against the north and reunification--obstruction of national reconciliation, unity and reunification, aggravated tension and increased danger of war.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The present chief executive of South Korea, who had said he would be a \"president\" who achieved reunification, recently did not hesitate to say that there \"would be no reunification\" during his term of office. Such anti-reunification remarks represent his intention not to work for reunification.   The South Korean hawks have brought the situation in the country to the brink of war by going ahead with frantic arms buildup and military maneuvers of various types with the U.S. and Japanese aggressors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the last one year after their coming to power the authorities of the self-described \"government for the people\" in South Korea has done nothing but plunging South Korea into politico-economic confusion and crisis, the worst in history, through dependence on outsiders and sycophantic treacheries, blocking the reunification of the country and increasing the risks of war, through fascist suppression of the people and never-ceasing war preparations for a showdown with the north. This puts their preceding dictators in the shade in crime index. The authorities of the \"government for the people\" will have to pay dearly for their crimes.   They should get rid of a foolish idea to prolong their remaining days in reliance upon outsiders and turn to national independence, great unity and reunification.   Only then can they save South Korea from a catastrophic crisis, as well as their fate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As proposed at the joint meeting, they should discontinue \"cooperation\" and joint military maneuvers with outsiders and take a step for repeal of the \"National Security Law\", basing themselves on reaffirmation of the strict implementation of the three principles of national reunification--independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity. Only then will inter-Korean high-level political talks be convened in the second half of the year to open an epochal phase of national reunification.   There is not always a chance.   The South Korean authorities should not miss the chance given to them after a long interval, but show an affirmative response to the sincere proposal of the north. \r\n\r\n"

Many parts of interiors and exteriors of thousands of buildings in Pyongyang including the Kumsusan Memorial Palace, Kim Il Sung Square, the Tower of the Juche Idea, the Arch of Triumph, the Revolutionary Martyrs Cemetery on Mt. Taesong and  the Korean Revolution Museum were decorated with granite. In particular, granite was also used for the decoration of their surroundings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   \r\n   Monuments and edifices built with granite of different sizes from scores of square centimetres to tens of square metres are the culmination of modern architecture. Besides, there are a number of granite-decorated monumental edifices in local areas of Korea. Among them are the Grand Samjiyon Monument, the Monument to the Victorious Pochonbo Battle, the Monument to the Victorious Musan Area Battle and the Wangjaesan Revolutionary Site.   The granite has become one of important building materials thanks to the clairvoyant wisdom of the President Kim Il Sung and his devoted services for the people.   He put forth tasks to work out a plan for the reconstruction of Pyongyang and develop the building stone industry already at the time of the Fatherland Liberation War, foreseeing the victory in the war.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Therefore, the first granite processing factory of Korea was built at the foot of Mt. Kyemyong in Onchon county, South Phyongan Province, in October, Juche 41 (1952) when the war was at its height.   In May, Juche 47 (1958), he took another step to expand the factory and lay a railway line branching into the factory.   He sent over 600,000 pounds worth of stone extracting and processing facilities to the factory early in the 1970s and saw to it that its employees were given the best treatment in the mining field. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It has developed into a factory with an annual capacity of extracting and processing tens of thousands of square metres of granite under his deep loving care.\r\n   The area of Onchon abounds in high-quality granite.   Korea has tens of granite processing factories.   Granite produced there is also being used in pavement of road and embankment work.   The total length of the roads paved with granite is over 400 km.   Korean granite is in high demand in other countries. \r\n\r\n"

The rural theses which was published on Feb. 25, Juche 53 (1964) gives a scientific exposition of the core of the socialist rural question, basic principles of its solution and basic tasks for rural construction and ways of their implementation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Premier of the cabinet of the DPRK Hong Song Nam in a report at the meeting said the rural theses was a great program for socialist rural construction that was clarified on the basis of the Juche idea.   He said:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past 35 years was a period of ordeals when the situation at home and abroad was not favourable for the Korean revolution. In recent years the Korean people and agricultural workers, however, have vigorously advanced along the road indicated by the rural theses without the slightest vacillation and achieved great successes, breaking through manifold difficulties and trials.   Thanks to the great vitality of the rural theses, the socialist rural economic system has been consolidated politically and ideologically, materially and technologically and an epochal turn effected in the historic advance of the Korean people for the complete victory of socialism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The President Kim Il Sung and General Secretary Kim Jong Il clearly explained theoretical and practical problems in implementing the rural theses in each period of the developing revolution and have wisely led the efforts for their solution.\r\n   Kim Jong Il, with a deep insight into the actual condition of our agriculture in recent years, lucidly clarified the essence of the Juche method of farming, saying it is a scientific farming method that accords with the will of peasants and specific conditions of the country.   Noting that the socialist rural theses will remain as ever a steadfast guideline for socialist rural construction, he called for further developing in depth the three revolutions, ideological, technical and cultural, in keeping with the requirement of socialist rural construction at a new stage along the path indicated by the theses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The reporter went on to say:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should thoroughly implement all agricultural  policies set forth by Kim Jong Il and thus effect an epochal turn in agricultural production to solve the food problem. For this it is necessary to have a clear understanding of the Juche method of farming and do all farm work as required by the method from A to Z, effect innovations in potato cultivation, widely introduce double cropping and step up innovative seed cultivation.   We should, at the same time, steadily improve the rural economic guidance and management, enhance the level of management and operation of cooperative farms, strengthen material and technical assistance of industry to rural economy, further consolidate and develop the socialist rural economic system and successfully carry out the historic tasks of bringing cooperative ownership under public ownership in future. \r\n\r\n"
