            "content": "Fair and aboveboard, realistic measure\r\n   Pyongyang, February 22 (KCNQA -- The proposal and initiative of the recently-held joint meeting of the political parties and organisations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for achieving unity of the north and south of Korea and paving the path of the nation independently are a very opportune, fair and aboveboard measure of weighty importance, which reflects the unanimous desire of all the fellow countrymen for national reconciliation, unity and reunification and the requirements of the situation of the Korean Peninsula which is at an important epochal point over the national reunification question.\r\n   Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary.\r\n   The daily goes on:\r\n   The realities urgently make it incumbent upon the north and south of Korea to respect the three principles of national reunification--independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity--reject domination by outsiders and dependence on them and shape the destiny of the nation independently in the idea of the three principles.\r\n   Independence is basic to the three principles of national reunification the two sides of korea agreed upon. Adherence to the principle of independence is vital to improving inter-Korean relations.\r\n   It is high time for South Korea to believe in the strength of the nation, not begging for the help of others, maintain independent stand and defend the common interests of the nation.\r\n   Only when South Korea preserves the Juche character and national character and takes the road of independence, is it possible to turn the worst inter-Korean relations into the relations of reconciliation and unity. Turning their gun on each other, the fellow countrymen in the north and south of Korea cannot achieve reconciliation and unity any time.\r\n   An end should be put to the anti-north policy with the end of the Kim Young Sam \"regime\" and the anti-north policy should be replaced by the pro-north policy in South Korea.  \r\n   To this end, the \"National Security Law\" and the \"Agency for National Security Planning\" and other institutional machines, which hamper reconciliation with the north, should be removed immediately.\r\n   Come what may, we should no longer keep the relations of distrust and confrontation, which may bring irrevocable disasters to the nation in favor of outsiders, but take the road of collaboration, unity, dialogue and negotiations. \r\n   Herein lies a way of opening a phase favourable for reunification under the present serious situation, a way of achieving unity of the north and south of Korea and paving the path of the nation independently.\r\n   We express the hope that the South Korean political parties and organisations and prominent figures of various social strata will be aware of their present mission for the nation and show affirmative response to the reasonable proposal and initiative of the joint meeting of the DPRK political parties and organisations on improving the inter-Korean relations and opening a new phase of national reunification at any cost.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
