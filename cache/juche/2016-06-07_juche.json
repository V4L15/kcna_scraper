            "content": "Belicistas surcoreanos vuelven a perpetrar  violacion de frontera en zona candente\r\nPyongyang, 7 de junio (ACNC) -- A eso de las 4 y 30 minutos por la madrugada del dia 5, los belicistas militares titeres del Sur de Corea volvieron a infiltrar los barcos en aguas de la parte Norte del Mar Oeste de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\tLos titeres infiltraron profundamente 19 barcos de pesca, que estaban anclados en el islote Yonphyong, en la parte nuestra pasando la linea de demarcacion maritima.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido a lo cual, volvio a agravarse la situacion de la candente zona maritima del Mar Oeste.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas prensas surcoreanas transmiten que debido a esta invasion de esos barcos ejecutada bajo el \"permiso de las autoridades militares\" se creo una \"situacion tirante\" de realizarse la \"captura\" o el \"ataque de la artilleria de costa\" de las fuerzas armadas del Ejercito Popular de Corea (EPC). \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl presente caso es la continuacion de la provocacion del barbaro canonazo artillero contra el barco de enlace del EPC cometido el dia 27 de mayo por los militares surcoreanos, y es el producto de malsana intencion de los titeres surcoreanos encaminado a inventar un incidente sensacional en esa zona maritima para causar la justa reaccion del EPC y, luego, imputarle a esta la \"amenaza\" y \"provocacion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo diferente del caso es que los gangsteres de la capa militar surcoreana orquestaron directamente la anterior provocacion artillera, pero esta vez movilizaron los pescadores inocentes como carnada de la confrontacion fratricida temiendo el castigo despiadado de las fuerzas armadas del EPC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor otra parte, otro intento verdadero del caso reside en agravar la situacion de esta zona maritima para obstaculizar el ambiente de dialogo de las relaciones intercoreanas y mantener a toda costa la ilegal y bandidesca \"linea de limite al Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara encubrir sus crimenes, los titeres difunden las absurdas tonterias de que sus barcos invadieron la zona maritima de la parte Norte para capturar los 2 barcos de pesca chinos que estaban en la pesca ilegal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa insistencia en que los barcos de pesca capturen otros de pesca deviene una payasada que puede ejecutar solo los titeres surcoreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTales tentativas encaminadas a la confrontacion fratricida pagaran sin falta el precio merecido."
