Words fail to express the sufferings of the victims from the aftermath of damage by atomic bombing and those of their descendants from genetic effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   From the humanitarian point of view, the Japanese government should make apologies and state compensations to them at an early date, but it has not taken any step for the reason that diplomatic relations have not been established between the DPRK and Japan. \r\n   This is a mockery of and insult to all the Korean people including A-bomb victims and an impudent deed of evading the responsibility for liquidating the past.\r\n   We urge the Japanese government to renounce its hostile policy toward the DPRK, take an immediate humanitarian step for the A-bomb victims who have returned to the DPRK and their descendants and make an apology and compensation to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
