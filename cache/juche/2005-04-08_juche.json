A weak action of the Japanese people for defending the pacifist constitution is one of the reasons why Japan opted for launching overseas aggression in collusion with the U.S. as evidenced by its present moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The popular masses should become an independent driving force to struggle for putting the state power and history education on a right track. Japan should face up to the trend of the situation where the DPRK is bolstering its nuclear deterrent force to cope with the U.S. strategy for preemptive nuclear attack and the U.S. attempts have gone amiss at the six-party talks, too. It should, at the same time, halt its anti-DPRK hostile racket including much ado about \"false remains of a Japanese abductee,\" implement the Japan-DPRK Pyongyang Declaration and make efforts to normalize the\r\nrelations with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The paper reported in detail about the functions for solidarity with the DPRK held in different parts of Japan.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Intensified Anti-U.S. Actions Called for\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland issued a lengthy memorandum Wednesday on the occasions of the 57th anniversary of the massive April 3 Popular Uprising, the 45th anniversary of the heroic April 19 Popular Uprising, the 25th anniversary of the Kwangju Popular Uprising and the 18th anniversary of the June Popular Resistance. The events recorded brilliant pages in the history of the south Korean people's sacred struggle for democracy against the U.S. and fascism.\r\n The memorandum disclosed and denounced the U.S. imperialists' brutal crackdown upon south Koreans' uprisings and resistances and their ghastly massacre of south Korean civilians. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When Jeju islanders staged a \"demonstration in commemoration of the March 1 Popular Uprising\" on Mar.1, 1947 U.S. soldiers fired at the demonstrators, leaving dozens of them dead. This caused the islanders to turn out in a courageous struggle with towering grudge against the U.S. imperialists. They launched the anti-U.S. resistance on the Yon Peak of Mt. Halla at 2 a.m. on April 3, 1948. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists and the Syngman Rhee puppet regime responded to their unflinching struggle with bloody crackdown. They perpetrated horrible genocide under the signboard of \"earlier suppression of it.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This cruel massacre drenched the island with blood and reduced it to a \"no man island.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This undoubtedly proved that the U.S. imperialists are occupation forces, murderers and beasts in human skin, not liberators and protectors of south Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year marks the 45th anniversary of the heroic April 19 popular uprising. It ushered in a new spring of resistance for independence, democracy and reunification against the U.S. and fascism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The all-people resistance raged throughout south Korea on April 19 45 years ago. Students of Seoul National University took the lead in the resistance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThey released the \"April 19 Declaration\" urging people from all walks of life to rise up in the struggle against the traitorous Syngman Rhee clique. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists, much upset by this, promptly issued \"special order No. 1\" instructing the clique to mobilize all police force available to suppress protesters. They set up the \"Martial Law Command\" and hurled heavily armed troops of south Korea, even tanks and armored vehicles into Seoul to massacre civilians. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Uprisers burnt down the headquarters of the Liberal Party and the Anti-Communism Hall and occupied the U.S. Economic Cooperation Agency, the Capital Building and the National Assembly Building. They stormed the \"Presidential Residence,\" wringing Syngman Rhee's neck. His dictatorship collapsed at last. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under this situation the U.S. installed Ho Jong's interim government and then the Jang Myon Cabinet in a bid to save the colonial rule. It egged them on to advocate \"freedom and democracy.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The awakened south Koreans, however, began directing the spearhead of their struggle to America, well aware of the truth that the cause of all their misfortune and sufferings rests with the U.S. and they can survive only through struggle for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Feeling extremely uneasy in face of this development, the U.S. instigated the hooligans it had trained for years to stage the May 16 military coup, defiling the soul of the April 19 popular uprising. This heralded the emergence of the military fascist dictatorship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The coup again reduced south Korea to a land without air and sap and a dark society. The U.S. imperialists worked hard to train the military fascist regime in order to serve their strategic purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These facts irrefutably prove that the U.S. was chiefly accountable for directly engineering the military coup in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historical lesson taught by this heroic April Popular Uprising brought about the massive Kwangju Popular Uprising. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The grudge and indignation of the south Korean people at the U.S. reached their height as they had suffered due to the Yushin (revitalization) fascist politics for nearly two decades. On May 18, 1980 students of Jeonnam National University kindled the torch of Kwangju armed uprising. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the uprising developed into all-people armed resistance, the U.S. instigated Chun Doo Hwan-led military hooligans to mercilessly suppress and massacre resistance forces and civilians. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At least 5,000 people were killed and over 14,000 others wounded in Kwangju in a few days. The city turned into a huge bath tube of blood, a city of death haunted by specter and a dumping ground of dead bodies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This massacre stunned the world and it was again the U.S. imperialists that commanded and manipulated it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Koreans again waged a mass struggle against the U.S. and dictatorship in June 1987 in protest against the moves to prolong the \"fifth republic\" and cook up the \"sixth republic,\" military fascist dictatorial regimes, products of the U.S. backing and crafty plot. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The June Popular Resistance brought to a collapse the \"fifth republic\" that had dreamed of staying in power. But there emerged in south Korea the \"sixth republic's\" military dictatorial regime under the civilian veil under the backstage manipulation of the U.S. keen to maintain military dictatorial regimes there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The blood south Koreans shed in their relentless heroic uprisings and resistances was by no means in vain. It is powerfully arousing the Koreans living in the era after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration to death-defying resistance against the U.S. imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Central Committee of the front expresses conviction that progressive governments and peoples of the world would voice stronger support and solidarity for the south Koreans in their just struggle to make this year a year to witness an end to the U.S. occupation of south Korea and a year of the independent reunification of the nation.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seeks to hide its \"anti-terrorism war\" with the veils of \"freedom\" and \"democracy.\" This is aimed at covering up its reactionary and aggressive nature and escalating it in a bid to build the above-said order. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It regarded the \"September 11 incident\" as the golden opportunity of spreading the American-style \"democracy\" worldwide by force of arms, taking advantage of the changed international environment and the altered balance of forces in the new century.\r\n The U.S. launched the Afghan war under the pretext of mopping up the headquarters of al-Qaeda, raising the curtain of the \"anti-terrorism war.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through the Afghan and Iraqi wars the United States put under control the regions it had long eyed, thus escalating its political and military infiltration and sphere of influence in the Central Asian countries and the Middle East. The U.S. \"anti-terrorism war\" and its moves to build an American-style order for world domination did not bring peace and stability to the world but escalated the war of aggression, destruction and socio-economic chaos. In consequence, the sovereignty and rights of countries and nations were seriously threatened and violated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. operation to escalate the \"anti-terrorism war\" was targeted against the DPRK, among other things. The U.S. war-like forces became more undisguised in their anti-DPRK operation aimed at \"bringing down its system\" under pretexts of its \"nuclear and missile issues,\" \"human rights issue\" and \"the issue of terrorism.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The military aggression and intervention perpetrated by the U.S. against other countries under the pretext of \"anti-terrorism war\" are nothing but the most blatant and shameless infringement upon their sovereignty, acts of disturbing peace and human rights abuses.  This war is, in a nutshell, hideous international terrorism perpetrated under the signboard of \"anti-terrorism\" and anti-peace and anti-democracy operations veiled with \"peace,\" \"freedom\" and \"democracy.\" The U.S. moves to escalate the war will\r\nonly lead to its international isolation and self-destruction, the article warns.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"
