He has led the army and people of the DPRK to surmount difficulties and ordeals relying upon their own strength in the strong spirit of national independence in order to defend socialism and build a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the Korean revolution urgently requires holding aloft the banner of self-reliance. Only when the spirit of self-reliance is fully displayed is it possible to defend Korean-style socialism to the last despite any desperate moves of the U.S. imperialists to stifle it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Self-reliance alone can help the DPRK increase its political and ideological might, to say nothing of military and economic potentials. When the DPRK remains politically and ideologically, militarily and economically strong, neither pressure nor military threat and economic sanctions on the part of the U.S. imperialists will work on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A full play to this spirit would make it possible for the DPRK to bolster its economy its own way and build a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the consistent principle the WPK can never abandon in any adversity to maintain independence in politics, self-support in the economy and self-reliance in national defence, and self-reliance only provides the way of adhering to this revolutionary principle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that Kim Jong Il has led the army and people of the DPRK in their struggle to build a great prosperous powerful socialist nation, the article stresses that the WPK and people of the DPRK will invariably maintain self-reliance as their revolutionary mode and a banner of their struggle and its army and people are sure to attain the goal of building a great prosperous powerful nation despite their temporary difficulties as long as they are led by him.    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea's Nuclear Issue Demanded\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 7 (KCNA) -- The south Korean authorities should stop serving the U.S. like puppets, raising a hue and cry over the north's nuclear issue, but probe the truth behind the secret nuclear weapons development program they have pursued for scores of years, urges Minju Joson Thursday in a signed commentary.\r\n In the wake of the recent disclosure of the fact that south Korea has pursued its nuclear weapons program in top secrecy for scores of years the nuclear issue of south Korea turned out to be a stark fact, going beyond suspicion, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under such situation the south Korean authorities are obliged to clarify the truth about the issue. However, they keep making an uproar over the nuclear issue of the north. It is nothing but a mean and despicable political chicanery intended to divert the public criticism to the DPRK from them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This indicates that the authorities are trying to find a way of evading their blame for the nuclear development in slandering their fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Moreover, the nukes south Korea is developing are not aimed at driving out of south Korea the U.S. imperialists, the arch criminal that split the Korean nation, a stumbling block in the way of its reunification, a permanent source of a war and the sworn enemy common to the Koreans, but are targeted on their fellow countrymen who have lived in one and the same territory for 5,000 years and will live together with the south Korean brethren in a reunified country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the criminal purpose of south Korea's nuclear development to exterminate the nation and convert the Korean peninsula into debris as it is aimed to join the U.S. in massacring Koreans. A thorough probe into the truth behind the nuclear issue of south Korea is urgently required for ensuring the nation's security and improving the inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities will not be able to escape the nation's curse and denunciation if they keep slandering their fellow countrymen in a bid to hush up the case.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
