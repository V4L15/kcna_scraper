It is quite clear that the U.S. can hardly provide lwrs to the DPRK in time. \r\n The U.S. is wantonly violating the principles agreed upon at the DPRK-U.S. joint statement made public in June 1993.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has sincerely implemented all the points agreed upon between the DPRK and the U.S. despite great difficulties, prompted by its will not to break a promise once made to others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the DPRK had pushed ahead with its plan for nuclear energy development for a peaceful purpose, its acute shortage of power would have already been solved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Yet, it has remained true to the promises it made to the U.S. although even one kw of electricity is badly needed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While insisting on far-fetched assertions, the U.S. seems to work hard to shift responsibility for the non-compliance with the AF and the extremely aggravated bilateral relations onto the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If it has no willingness to implement the AF and drop its hard line and hawkish attitude to stifle the DPRK, the latter will be left with no option but to go its own way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The DPRK, in fact ,does not expect anything from the u.s.    \r\n"

We will return artillery fire for the u.s. imperialists' rifle fire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they fire an artillery piece, we will retaliate against this with a more powerful weapon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The spirit of the Korean people and people's army is based on the most revolutionary and strongest anti-imperialist class-consciousness and self-confidence in the tremendous military means.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
