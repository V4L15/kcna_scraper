Korea's Launch of Spy Satellite under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, August 1 (KCNA) -- South Korea launched a satellite aimed at spying on the north at a time when the situation is getting extremely tense on the Korean Peninsula due to the U.S. reckless sanctions and moves for a nuclear war against the north.  This is a grave provocative act of straining the regional situation.\r\n A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland said this in an answer given to a question put by KCNA on Tuesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The satellite Arirang-2 launched by south Korea on July 28 is equipped with high resolution image cameras capable of discerning anything up to one meter size on the ground. The satellite with resolution less than one meter is subject to international control as it can be used for a military purpose, the spokesman noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is conniving at and defending the launches of missiles and spy satellites by its allies and forces toeing its line, while unreasonably taking issue with the right thing done by the DPRK, posing no problem in the light of international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. standards are not based on justice or international law but on a brigandish view on value aimed at meeting its aggressive purpose and holding world supremacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Korea's recent launch of the satellite brought to light the aggressive nature, dual character and shamelessness of the U.S. racket against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world should clearly see through the U.S. true colors and should not be mocked by it, we think. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We sound an alarm-bell to south Korea straining the situation on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The prevailing situation compels the north to step up its moves to bolster the invincible war deterrent for self-defence in every way under the banner of Songun.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The committee, however, blamed the behaviors of Korean players. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Had the referee and the lineswoman correctly refereed, the results of the match would have been different and the Korean players would not have lodged such protest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Referees Committee should impartially look into what happened during the match and find a right solution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Asian Football Confederation should severely punish the Italian referee and the Australian lineswoman for their base and shameless refereeing of the match and forbid them from refereeing international games any more. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only then can the Asian Football Confederation preserve its status and win confidence from its member nations.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This indicates that their scenario to ignite a war of aggression on the Korean Peninsula at any cost has entered a very reckless and serious phase. Papers Tuesday observe this in signed commentaries.\r\n Rodong Sinmun says that it is the invariable strategy of the U.S. to launch a preemptive attack on the DPRK and dominate the whole of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Ulji Focus Lens projected by the U.S. warlike forces in south Korea at a time when they are amassing task forces in south Korea and its vicinity, vociferating about \"preemptive attack,\" clearly prove they have become evermore undisguised in their moves to start a new war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Ulji Focus Lens is an extremely dangerous war game of the U.S. imperialists aimed at rounding off the command and operation system of their aggressor armed forces for launching the second Korean war and achieving the goal of war without difficulty. Just as frequent clouds bring rain, the U.S. imperialists' escalating dangerous military actions in south Korea clearly suggest that the second Korean war stares one in the face every moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson says that the Ulji Focus Lens is an extremely dangerous one for igniting a war against the DPRK as the projected saber rattling is little short of a de facto declaration of a war against it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It, at the same time, improves the appetite of patients and increases their body weight. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The limited clinical test conducted at the state hospital of the Czech Republic under the superintendence of its public health institution shows that its treatment efficacy is over 90 percent in case of the early and middle lung, liver, brain, bone, skin and internal organ tumor patients and 45 percent in case of terminal cancer patients. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It won a gold prize and diploma at the 2005 Northeast Asia Hi-tech Fair in Shenyang.
