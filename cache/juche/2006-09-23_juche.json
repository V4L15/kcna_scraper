It is, therefore, no more than a third-rate drama. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. only seeks to perpetuate the military presence in south Korea and launch a war of aggression against the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the south Korean military authorities are hell bent on the moves for a war against the north under the signboard of the \"self-reliant defence.\" This is an extremely hideous crime against the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that there can be neither self-reliance nor improved inter-Korean relations as long as the south Korean military authorities beg for the U.S. forces' permanent presence in south Korea and zealously join foreign forces in the war moves to stifle fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people should resolutely reject the war moves stepped up by the U.S. and south Korean military warlike forces behind the curtain of the \"transfer of the right to command wartime operations\" and vigorously turn out in the struggle to get the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops withdrawn from south Korea at an early date.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
