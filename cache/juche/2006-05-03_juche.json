And it is keen to arrest the trend of the June 15 era toward national reconciliation, unity and reunification, while stepping up the reckless preparations for a war against the north to impose nuclear disasters upon the nation.\r\n The reality shows that the people can neither realize the dream of progressive reform nor expect triumphant advance of the June 15 era unless the U.S. domination is terminated and pro-U.S. traitorous forces removed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The working masses in this land should put an end to the disgraceful history of the U.S. occupation of south Korea, the root cause of all misfortune and sufferings of the nation.    \r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is the ideological view deeply rooted in their minds to ride on the back of Korea and other Asian countries and rule them again. \r\n The Japanese reactionaries are totally striking out materials about the \"comfort women\" for the Imperial Japanese Army from the history textbooks, driving for the revision of the \"Pacifist Constitution\" and massive bolstering of armed forces for aggression and coming out with the claim to Tok Islet. All these reveal their wild ambition for reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those who refuse to admit their crimes and feel no responsibility for them are bound to repeat them or commit bigger crimes. Now Japan is behaving like this. The Japanese reactionaries are resorting to crafty tricks to play down and gloss away their past crimes and escape from the responsibility for them, peddling the ware of \"abduction issue\" which has already been settled. On the other hand, they are persisting in the anti-DPRK smear campaign and driving the DPRK-Japan hostile relations to the extremes under preposterous pretexts. Their negation of their past crimes and malicious hostile acts against the DPRK maximize the resentment of the Korean people against Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No illusion should be harbored about Japan. It is the unshakable will of the Korean people to count up the past crimes of Japan. The Korean people will regard as moves for the second invasion of Korea the Japanese reactionaries' distortion and total denial of the crimes of the Japanese imperialists in committing aggression on Korea including the \"comfort women\" issue and settle account with them up to the bitter end.    \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Peace in the Korean Peninsula should be defended by our nation itself in any case. It is too clear that in case a war is ignited by the U.S. imperialists in this land, it would turn into a nuclear war sweeping over the north and the south. Accordingly, the north and the south cannot be different and overseas Koreans cannot be excepted in the struggle to defend peace against war in the Korean Peninsula.\r\n Any Korean who worries about the destiny of the nation should do his best irrespective of his residence to condemn and foil the U.S. moves for a war of aggression on Korea. When all the Koreans in the north and the south and overseas fulfill their responsibility and role as the master in the struggle to smash the U.S. warmongers' moves for a war of aggression, the peace of the Korean Peninsula and the security of the nation will be defended and the movement for national reunification will make a successful advance.\r\n The whole Korean nation should surely materialize national cooperation in the struggle for peace against war. All the fellow countrymen should save the nation from the obtaining grave situation and defend the peace of the country with the concerted efforts of the nation, transcending the difference of ideology, idea, political view and religious belief, class and strata, in the idea of \"By our nation itself\", the main spirit of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our Songun politics is the most creditable guarantee for defending the dignity and sovereignty of the nation, preventing war and keeping peace. All the fellow countrymen should have national pride and firm pluck here and make positively support and defend the great patriotic Songun politics benefiting any member of the Korean nation.    \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This comes under fire by a signed commentary of Minju Joson today.\r\n  It says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Some days ago, Chief Cabinet Secretary Abe asserted that \"Japan is standing for the settlement of the abduction issue on the basis of the fundamental way of thinking supported by dialogue and pressure\" and \"it is necessary to increase the pressure upon north Korea\". Japanese Foreign Minister Aso also solicited this or that country for cooperation in the efforts to settle the \"abduction issue\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Presumably, the \"abduction issue\" is regarded as a yardstick estimating the ability, qualification and popularity of politicians in the political camp of Japan. The reason can be explained by the fact that the tricksters seized by the greed for power going under the masks of politicians consider the \"abduction issue\" as something useful for achieving their sinister political purpose and have deliberately hyped up it to this end.\r\n As already known, the \"abduction issue\" had already found its settlement thanks to the sincere approach and efforts of the DPRK government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the calculation of the Japanese reactionaries that should they deem the \"abduction issue\" as settled, this will mean losing a justification for having used it as an important lever for wresting power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By stepping up their policy of pressure upon the DPRK over the \"abduction issue\" they seek to gain popularity among Japanese and garner their support and come to power come what may. \r\n The DPRK does not care whether they are locked in a factional or sectarian strife for the assumption of power. However, the DPRK will never allow them to persistently use the \"abduction issue\" for their smear campaign against it while engaging themselves in a scramble for power over. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is still abducting citizens of the DPRK in the area bordering on China in broad daylight, not yet away from its bad habit of abducting people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will certainly force the Japanese reactionaries to pay dearly for all the crimes Japan committed against it including the \"abduction issue\". \r\n The DPRK urges Japan once again to behave itself with reason.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
