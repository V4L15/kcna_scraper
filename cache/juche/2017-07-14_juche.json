Korea Can Never Escape Strikes by KPA's Long-range Artillery: Panmunjom Mission\r\n Pyongyang, July 14 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Panmunjom Mission of the Korean People's Army (KPA) released a statement on Friday over the recent desperate and undisguised moves of the U.S. to provoke a nuclear war against the DPRK and perpetuate its forces' presence in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On Tuesday the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces, which moved the Command of their 8th Army present in south Korea to Humphrey Base in Phyongthaek of Kyonggi Province, invited bosses of the south Korean puppet government and military and even human scum including ultra-right conservatives to an \"opening ceremony of the new building\" of the Command.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The commander of the 8th Army in his \"welcoming speech\" praised the south Korean lackeys, terming the move an \"event demonstrating the solid south Korea-U.S. alliance\" and allowing journalists to look round the interior of the base.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As far as the transfer of the U.S. 8th Army Command to Phyongthaek is concerned, the U.S. has pushed ahead with it in collusion with the puppet regime since 2003 in order to move its aggressor forces bases in south Korea to the areas south of the River Han to get rid of the striking range of the KPA's long-range artillery strike.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lurking behind it is the ulterior design of the U.S. to save its troops only, indifferent to the plight of the south Korean puppet army at stake.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists are busy hyping the transfer of their 8th Army Command, the shock brigade that will play a flagship role in igniting a war against the DPRK. This fully revealed the U.S. scenario to perpetuate its military presence in south Korea and stand in confrontation with the DPRK to the end in league with the south Korean puppet warmongers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. regards the Korean peninsula as a vantage point of strategic importance where the strength of maritime forces and the strength of land forces are interchanging. It is the century-old Asia policy of the U.S. to occupy the whole peninsula with south Korea as its springboard and thus realize its wild ambition for dominating the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a tragedy of the U.S. that it is unaware of the tremendous might of the army of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The bases of the U.S. imperialist aggressors in south Korea, the primary targets of the KPA, can never escape the mercilessly annihilating strikes by its long-range artillery, no matter whether they are located in Phyongthaek or in Pusan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialist warmongers will never escape the miserable destruction if they persist in foolhardy military confrontation moves in south Korea despite the warnings of the KPA."

He aqui la meta de la politica norteamericana sobre Asia que sigue vigente siglo tras siglo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa tragedia del imperio americano reside en que el no conoce bien el inagotable poderio del EPC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDondequiera que se encuentren, sea Phyongthaek o Pusan, las bases militares norteamericanas, primer blanco de ataque de nuestro ejercito, no podran esquivar jamas el implacable golpe demoledor de nuestros artilleros de largo alcance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSufriran el destino de destruccion tragica si los belicistas yanquis se mantienen estacionados en suelo surcoreano y cometen imprudentes acciones de enfrentamiento militar desoyendo nuestra advertencia."
