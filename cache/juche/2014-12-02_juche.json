at the UN, pursuant to Washington's scenario.\n\t\t\t\t\t This is being ridiculed by the international community as a bat-blind act of impairing the image of EU which claimed the establishment of a pole in the world and enforcement of independent policy when it came into being.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In today's international relations the issue of strictly observing the principle of respect for others' sovereignty and the principle of impartiality presents itself as a fundamental requirement for ensuring the independent development of countries and global peace and security.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present situation where sovereignty of various countries is encroached upon and world peace and security are seriously threatened by the high-handed and arbitrary practices of the imperialists strongly urges all countries to remain true to the principle of impartiality in international relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, some countries of EU joined in the U.S.-led fabrication of \"human rights resolution\", an impudent politically-motivated farce peppered with intrigues and fabrications aimed to encroach on the sovereignty of the DPRK and topple its inviolable social system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As known, the UN history does not know such precedent as the fabrication of the half-baked \"report of the Commission of Inquiry\" on the human rights situation in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t EU must have known that the \"report\" should at least undergo verification for lots of its drawbacks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should be noted that the DPRK published the report of its Association for Human Rights Studies, reflecting its human rights policy and system for ensuring human rights and the human rights enjoyed by its people, providing an opportunity for EU to verify the former's human rights performance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK, therefore, accepted the visit of the UN \"special rapporteur\" on the human rights situation in the DPRK and the special representative for human rights of EU to the DPRK and proposed on its own initiative the resumption of dialogue with EU on the human rights issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, EU suggested having dialogue after the adoption of the \"resolution\", raising various unreasonable excuses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This leaves the international community skeptical about the \"independence\" of EU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Does EU have no self-esteem?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is not a secret at present that a U.S. intelligence organ has perpetrated systematic wiretapping espionage against VIPs including heads of state of dozens of countries including Germany called the leader of EU, France and Italy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The intelligence organ even planted in secrecy an eavesdropping device at the headquarters of EU in Brussels, a venue of EU summits, regularly snooped on data in computers and telephone networks there and traced out confidential information related to its stand toward international issues and matters of contention among its member states and studied measures for countering them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As seen above, EU was stripped by the U.S., its ally, to its skin, but maintained no principle in its approach to the human rights issue, contrary to the common interests of the international community, only to disgrace itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If EU countries are to keep impartiality in dealing with the human rights issue, they should take issue with the crimes of the U.S., the worst human rights tundra in the world, to begin with.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK never looks for anyone's \"recognition\" and, moreover, feels no need to read others' face.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Anything meeting its people's demand and interests is precisely its standard of human rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is self-evident that a country can preserve the international justice and the principle of impartiality and develop its relations based on equality with other countries only when it deals with and settle all the issues arising in the international relations with correct criterion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has applied biased criteria in dealing with international issues, according to its interests, attitude of relevant countries toward it and their political systems.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Styling itself a \"human rights judge\", the U.S. has been keen on interference in other countries' internal affairs, pulling them up over their human rights situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The principle of equality and impartially should be thoroughly abided by in the international relations and such acts as interfering in others' internal affairs and forcing a country to accept one's own demand should never be allowed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If EU wants to be placed on higher stage as a world's independent pole in the 21st century, it should not blindly follow others in carrying out its foreign policy."
