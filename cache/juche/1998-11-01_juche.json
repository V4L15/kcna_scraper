He also recalled that during his visit to the Nyongbyon and Unsan areas he saw at first hand the site of \"underground nuclear facility\" detected by a U.S. intelligence satellite, adding that nearly all military installations and non-military factories in the DPRK are underground to cope with raids by U.S. air force planes in \"emergency.\"\r\n   Judging from this, the \"underground nuclear facility\" may be one of underground structures throughout the DPRK, he said.\r\n   His statement represents his own view. He was an official in charge of Korean issues during the DPRK-U.S. high-level talks in New York in 1993 and the Geneva talks in 1994. He visited the DPRK several times from 1995 to 1997 during which he was a researcher in charge of issues of the DPRK at the northeast Asia section of the intelligence research bureau of the U.S. Department of State. Judging from this, no one can deny his viewpoint regarding the \"underground nuclear facility\" fiction.   We will firmly defend and exercise our right to independence, come what may. \r\n\r\n"
