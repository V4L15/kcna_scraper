Pero es tan negativa la reaccion de la sociedad internacional que ha provocado tal proceder.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn un comentario intitulado \"El mundo afronta la guerra nuclear\" publicado el dia 10, el periodico turco Daily Sabah llamo la atencion al hecho de que \"son potencias nucleares los paises que cuestionan el arma nuclear norcoreana\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEspecifico que \"estan de nuevo bajo la lupa las potencias nucleares que se preparan para agredir y bombardear a otros paises y destruir a los del tercer mundo arrinconandolos bajo el pretexto de que son 'elementos peligrosos'\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste comentario es un reflejo de la vision de la sociedad internacional sobre las potencias arrogantes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa anticuada estructura del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU o el viejo orden internacional no puede responsabilizarse mas por el futuro de la humanidad."
