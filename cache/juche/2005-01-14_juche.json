This is the lesson taught by the 60-year-long history of the fierce struggle waged against the outside forces that have been hell-bent on all sorts of vicious separatist moves to fish in troubled waters in the confrontation between the north and the south, displeased with any movement for Korea's reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the June 15 joint declaration the north and the south of Korea recognized common points in the north-proposed low-level federation and the south-proposed confederation and agreed to work for reunification in that direction. This indicates the way of settling the issue of the country's reunification peacefully and most smoothly by the concerted efforts of the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint declaration also paves a wide avenue for accomplishing the cause of reunification as it comprehensively deals with all matters of achieving national reconciliation and unity and the country's reunification including the need to implement multi-faceted cooperation and exchange between the north and the south, ensure a balanced development of national economy and build mutual confidence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the fellow countrymen in the north, the south and overseas should give further spurs to the work to implement the declaration this year as they are called upon to do so in the editorial and thus glorify the era of independence and reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Aggressive Nature of U.S. \"War on Terrorism\" Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 13 (KCNA) -- The United States tries to justify its \"war on terrorism\" as an \"international contribution\" to \"freedom, democracy and peace\", but its aggressive and reactionary nature can never be concealed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRodong Sinmun Thursday says this in an article dealing with the aggressive nature of the \"war\" and its catastrophic consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After occupying Iraq in 2003, the U.S. directed the spearhead of its \"anti-terrorist strategy\" to those countries designated as an \"axis of evil\" and established an American-style order of military rule in Iraq last year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAfter working out a scenario to launch operations against the DPRK and Iran it staged full-scale operations for its implementation from the beginning of that year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The vicious offensive staged by the U.S. against the DPRK and Iran last year was a wanton violation of their sovereignty, a state-sponsored terrorism perpetrated as part of its \"war on terrorism\". The rumors about \"Limit to the north Korean nuclear development\" and \"October crisis in Iran\" spread by the U.S. last year were a premeditated move intended to attack one of the two countries depending on an international environment to be created and military preparations to be rounded off. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Reorganization and redeployment of the U.S. forces and moves to lay a nmilitary siege to the world last year were one of the two major factors of the U.S. \"anti-terrorist military operation\". The reorganization and redeployment of the overseas-based U.S. forces were nothing but moves to lay a military siege around Eurasia and put military pressure on big powers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush war-like forces ran amuck to put waters and skies under their control and contain other countries under the plea of \"non-proliferation\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nMeanwhile, they pressurized other countries not to have any economic and trade dealing with those countries the U.S. listed as \"enemy states\" and took disciplinary actions against countries and private business groups refusing to meet their demand, thus bringing huge economic losses to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThey undisguisedly intervened in other countries' internal affairs in a bid to realize regime change, destabilize and split society in those countries and force them to change their systems. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aggressive foreign policy pursued by the U.S. under the pretext of \"combating terrorism\" last year was an outrageous violation of freedom, democracy and human rights. Such being hard facts, the U.S. bellicose forces justified the escalation of the \"war on terrorism\" as \"spread of democracy\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Last year the U.S. escalated \"war of terrorism\" triggered off tragedies in different parts of the world while increasing the danger of a new Cold War and driving the world to an unprecedented unrest. These facts more clearly proved the injustice and criminal nature of the U.S. \"war on terrorism\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This \"war\" was an illegal action contrary to the UN Charter and international law. It was a revelation of the U.S. attempt to retain its supremacy and American-style super-powerism aimed at building a unipolar world dominated by it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
