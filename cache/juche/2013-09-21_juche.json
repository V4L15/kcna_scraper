But there are forces throwing obstacles in this way.\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently the chief executive of south Korea and other high-ranking politicians vied with each other to bluster that the atmosphere of reconciliation created thanks to the DPRK's sincere proposal for dialogue and positive efforts is ascribable to \"their pulling\" and it is the fruition of their \"principled policy toward the north.\" They termed the tour of Mt. Kumgang a source of \"money-making\" by the north and went the lengths of describing the international games hosted by it according to practice and rules as a \"change,\" a silly story. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is nothing but an unbearable mockery and provocation to the DPRK which has shown magnanimity and sincerity to realize the desire of the fellow countrymen despite all sorts of difficulties.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is worth recalling how the situation on the Korean Peninsula has been put on the orbit of detente though it had been driven into an extreme phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Who has made sincere efforts to settle in a broad-minded manner such issues as putting the shuttered Kaesong Industrial Zone on the orbit of regular operation and realizing the reunion of separated families and their relatives, a tragedy resulting from the nation's division, and resuming the tour of Mt. Kumgang which had been suspended.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a matter of fact, the DPRK has so far overlooked even the confrontation racket kicked up by the south Korean conservative group for the sake of national reconciliation and development of inter-Korean relations, though it is something unpardonable in the light of common sense. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This being a hard reality, the south Korean puppet regime is rattling the nerves of the DPRK, dialogue partner, by kicking up such extreme rackets for confrontation as totally denying its social system, misinterpreting its good faith and magnanimity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is busy with north-targeted war maneuvers and arms buildup, vociferating about \"unification under liberal democracy\" behind the scene of dialogue and \"striking the north by crossing the Military Demarcation Line\" in league with its American master. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is staging such \"witch-hunt campaign\" as cracking down on all pro-democracy figures who call for inter-Korean reconciliation, unity and reunification, branding them as \"pro-communist elements\" and \"those following the north\" after deliberately linking the \"case of attempted rebellion\" with the north. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Dialogue and negotiations have taken place between the north and the south under such situation, a fruition of the DPRK's patient efforts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the south Korean puppet regime is trumpeting that progress made in the inter-Korean relations is ascribable to its \"theory of principle\" and rattling the nerves of the DPRK, its dialogue partner.

And this cannot be construed otherwise than behaviors of hooligans bereft of even elementary human ethics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative group's trumpeting about reconciliation and confidence-building is no more than an empty talk to deceive the world public and the compatriots.

In reference to the international games hosted by the north according to practice and rules, it is foolishly trumpeting about \"change\" and the like. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is the height of the practice of a guilty party filing the suit first. It is an unpardonable mockery and insult to the good faith, magnanimity and sincere efforts of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDialogue and negotiations are taking place between the north and the south despite the extreme confrontation racket of totally negating the social system in the DPRK now under way in south Korea. This is entirely ascribable to the invariable efforts of the DPRK to implement the north-south joint declaration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNevertheless, the group describes the progress made in the inter-Korean ties thanks to the sincere efforts of the DPRK as the fruition of their \"theory of principle\".

The DPRK will never remain a passive onlooker to the conspiratorial moves against the DPRK and all sorts of suppression of the pro-reunification patriots being perpetrated under the pretext of linkage to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSuch vicious anti-DPRK conspiratorial moves and the harsh suppression of those pro-reunification patriots in south Korea only bring to light the true colors of the conservative group as confrontation maniacs as they are a revelation of extreme hostility towards compatriots. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe fascist action of the group to eliminate all those who call for reconciliation and unity with compatriots is nothing but an ulterior intention to pursue confrontation with the DPRK to the last.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean conservative regime is wholly to blame for the prevailing situation as it abuses dialogue for pursuing confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK will do its best for the development of the inter-Korean ties and peace and prosperity but it has no idea of showing good faith and magnanimity even for those keen to pursue confrontation with it to the last.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK will closely watch the future developments in south Korea."

Especificamente, dicen que son \"resultados del proceso de confianza de la Peninsula Coreana\" y esta \"atrayendo\" a alguien \"su politica de principios sobre el Norte\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn cuanto al turismo al monte Kumgang, proyecto comun de la nacion, lo califican de \"fuente de ingreso\" de alguien. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, hablan de algun \"cambio\" de la RPDC aduciendo una competencia deportiva internacional que auspicio ella segun las costumbres y reglas internacionales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsa conducta de bandido es una burla e insulto intolerables a la buena fe, la magnanimidad y los sinceros esfuerzos de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAunque en la sociedad surcoreana se arma diariamente la extremada campana conflictiva que niega totalmente el sistema social y regimen de la RPDC, se abrieron el dialogo y negociaciones entre ambas partes coreanas, gracias a los invariables esfuerzos de la parte Norte por ejecutar la Declaracion Conjunta N-S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, los titeres surcoreanos anuncian cinicamente tal avance de relaciones intercoreanas como resultado de su \"doctrina de mantenimiento de principios\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora, detras de la cortina de dialogo, se entregan con frenesi en confabulacion con su amo norteamericano a los ejercicios belicos y al aumento armamentista contra la parte connacional insistiendo en la \"unificacion bajo el sistema democratico y liberal\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, vinculando injustamente con la RPDC el \"caso de conspiracion para rebelion\", libran la \"caza de brujas\" contra todas las personalidades progresistas y democraticas, que demandan la reconciliacion y unidad Norte-Sur y la reunificacion de la patria, calificandolas de \"fuerzas pro-Norte y procomunistas\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo tales circunstancias espeluznantes en que se malemplea en la confrontacion fratricida hasta el dialogo Norte-Sur y se lanza la campana de guerra y de represion contra la RPDC, no se puede esperar el dialogo normal ni el desarrollo de relaciones intercoreanas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDada la grave situacion, el Comite por la Reunificacion de la Patria expone la siguiente posicion: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1.
