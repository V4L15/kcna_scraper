It is an unpardonable challenge to the desire of all the Koreans and the world people for peace and stability in the peninsula and a dangerous provocation intended to drive the situation into that of military confrontation and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already known to everyone, the process of denuclearization is being accelerated in the Korean Peninsula under the agreement of the six-party talks and a new era is opening up for the development of inter-Korean relations and peace and prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. is building up in and around south Korea its air forces aimed at the DPRK and ceaselessly staging anti-DPRK war drills. Such reckless moves for military confrontation clearly show who is scuttling the peaceful solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula and sparking off the tension and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality proves that \"peace\" and \"dialogue\" on the lip-service of the U.S. are a deceptive trick to mislead the public opinion at home and abroad and there is no change in its nature of aggression to stifle the DPRK by force.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is concerned over the fact that the above-said action may weaken its military domination and influence on south Korea. This \"promise\" was prompted by the U.S. intention to bind the south Korean forces more tightly to the \"security alliance\" under the pretext of \"offering the nuclear umbrella and military assistance\" while going ahead with its moves for the \"strategic flexibility\" of the U.S. forces in south Korea as planned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is another point that merits attention. The adoption of the historical October 4 declaration created an environment favorable for the development of the inter-Korean relations, peace and prosperity. In case the relations of military confidence are established between the north and the south thanks to the successful implementation of the above-said declaration calling for an end to the relations of military confrontation and ensuring detente and peace, there will be no justification for the U.S. forces to remain in south Korea any longer. Therefore, the U.S. is becoming evermore vociferous about the \"offer of a nuclear umbrella and military assistance\", etc. in a bid to bar the implementation of the declaration and keep the south Korean military under its control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ridiculing the U.S. for asserting that it made the above-said promise to south Korea at the request of its military, the article cites facts to prove that this is nothing but a revelation of the reckless scenario of the U.S. warlike forces to invade the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said promise cannot be construed otherwise than an intention to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK any time and use the south Korean troops as a shock force in that criminal war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These facts go to clearly indicate that though the U.S. is paying lip-service to \"dialogue\" and \"peace\" it is, in actuality, watching for a chance to attack the DPRK while pursuing hostile policy toward it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. war hawks are chiefly to blame for escalating the military tension and increasing the danger of war on the Korean Peninsula, concludes the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

EE.UU. se preocupa del posible debilitamiento de su dominio militar e influencia sobre el Sur de Corea por la devolucion de tal derecho de control. Por eso lanzo tal ofensiva de \"caridad\" para mantener como lo planeado la \"flexibilidad estrategica\" de las tropas norteamericanas ocupantes del Sur de Corea y atar mas rigidamente en el marco de la \"alianza de seguridad\" al ejercito surcoreano tomando por cebo el \"ofrecimiento de paraguas nuclear\" y el \"apoyo militar\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Tambien hay otro problema. En estos momentos, por la aprobacion de la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre se crea un ambiente favorable para el desarrollo de las relaciones Norte-Sur, la paz y la prosperidad. En el caso de que por la ejecucion exitosa de la citada Declaracion que garantiza el fin de las relaciones de hostilidad militar, el relajamiento de la tension y la preservacion de la paz, se establezcan las relaciones de confianza militar entre el Norte y el Sur, las tropas norteamericanas perderan el pretexto de permanecer por mas tiempo en el Sur de Corea. Por eso EE.UU. habla mas ruidosamente que nunca del problema del \"ofrecimiento del paraguas nuclear\" y el \"apoyo militar\" para obstaculizar la ejecucion de la Declaracion y hacer que la capa militar surcoreana no se desvie de su intencion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En estos momentos EE.UU. predica que tal promesa suya se debe a la peticion de la capa militar surcoreana, pero no puede disimular la imprudente intencion de agresion al Norte de la capa belicista norteamericana. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Tal promesa de EE.UU. es para asestar en cualquier momento un ataque preventivo nuclear a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea y lanzar al ejercito surcoreano como brigada de choque de la guerra de  agresion al Norte de Corea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Los hechos demuestran evidentemente que aunque EE.UU. habla mucho de \"dialogo\" y \"paz\", de hecho, hostiliza a la RPDC y asecha codiciosamente la oportunidad de emprender la agresion a esta. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El fautor, que crea la tension militar y aumenta el peligro de la guerra en la Peninsula Coreana, es la capa belicista de EE.UU.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
