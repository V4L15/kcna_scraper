How miserable their plight is. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's planned launch of working satellite so malignantly decried by the group is an exercise of an independent and legitimate right in line with the universally accepted international laws on the peaceful use of space including the Outer Space Treaty. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group is now joining the U.S. in accusing the DPRK of its \"violation of the UN resolutions\" but the DPRK has never recognized such illegal resolutions disregarding its sovereignty and dignity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The persistent smear campaign being kicked up by Lee over the DPRK's nuclear deterrence and projected satellite launch cannot be construed otherwise than the last-ditch effort to get rid of the tight corner in which he is finding himself, isolated at home and abroad, justify his policy of confrontation with fellow countrymen, bridge over his ruling crisis and use it for the general election. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Lee tried hard to raise sinking \"status of south Korea\" and turn people's mindset favorable to him through the summit. But it only brought to light his true colors as a colonial stooge and nuclear war servant of the U.S. and maniac keen on confrontation with compatriots. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said racket clearly proved that Park Geun Hye of the \"Saenuri Party\" calling for \"change and revamp\" and puppet Minister of Unification Ryu U Ik crying out for \"flexibility\" are heinous confrontation-minded elements as bad as Lee Myung Bak.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world will watch with admiration Kwangmyongsong-3 flying in the space. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then all hues of faultfinders will realize they were wrong."

He also advanced the policy of agricultural cooperativization on reorganizing the rural economic form in a socialist way before the technical transformation to meet the people's demand and wishes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this way all the lines and policies of the Workers' Party of Korea adopted under the guidance of the President reflected the people's will and requirements. They include the basic line of socialist economic construction, the keynote of which was to give priority to building heavy industry while developing light industry and agriculture simultaneously, the line of simultaneously building up the economy and defenses and the line of the three revolutions, ideological, technological and cultural.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The President led the building of a socialist state to victory, always sharing sweets and bitters with the people and enlisting their unfailing energy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He always placed faith in the people and inspired them with confidence in sure victory. Under his wise guidance, the DPRK turned into a socialist power, independent in politics, self-supporting in the economy and self-reliant in national defence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Regarding it as his greatest pleasure to be with the people, he made ceaseless journey of field guidance, in disregard of bad weather conditions and holidays, to provide them with a happy life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He devoted his whole life to the prosperity of the country and happiness of the people and brought about tremendous changes in the country, turning adversity into prosperity and misfortune into blessing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean people will always glorify the great feats of President Kim Il Sung, who made a new history of single-minded unity and built the people-centered socialist country."
