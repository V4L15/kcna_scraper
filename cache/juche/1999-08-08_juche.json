Typical of this is that after the armed conflict in the West Sea of Korea, a product of the backstage maneuvers of the U.S. hawks, the U.S. task force whose theatre is the peninsula is worming its way into northeast Asia on the plea of \"swift reaction\" and \"deterrent.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The frantic U.S. maneuvers going on in the far east go to prove that the next war may break out in the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    The remarks of the U.S. Defense Secretary, Cohen, during his recent trip to Japan and South Korea, must not go unnoticed. He threatened to call all military means of the U.S., Japan and South Korea out to \"punish\" the DPRK in case it launches another satellite, a declaration that the U.S. will provoke a war against the DPRK on the pretext of the launch. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All this shows that no doubt, the next war will break out in the peninsula.

Nevertheless, they do not cease to cry over the  DPRK's \"missile threat\". They have gone the length of giving further spurs to the development and deployment of the \"Theatre Missile Defense\" system on the pretext of coping with the \"north's missile threat\" and, at the same time, inveigling their junior allies including Japan and South Korea into their moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It was against this backdrop that U.S. Defense Secretary Cohen during his recent visit to South Korea repeated the assertion that the DPRK's satellite launch was a \"missile launch\" and said in order to \"deter it\", it was necessary to \"react to it with the mobilization of all military means\". This clearly shows that the U.S. is about to ignite a war against the DPRK by faulting it in a far-fetched manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We bitterly denounce the U.S.'s much ado about \"missile threat\" intended to create a war-like situation on the Korean peninsula as a second racket over \"nuclear suspicion.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. attempt to unleash a war against the DPRK compels us to further increase the self-reliant defence capabilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We will go ahead with satellite and missile launch whoever may say this or that. If the United States ignites a war on that pretext, we will mete out a thousand-fold punishment to the U.S. this is our steadfast determination and will. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
