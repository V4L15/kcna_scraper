The undying revolutionary exploits of the president will shine forever. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Then, he went to its production processes including the youth workshop and the engine-assembling workshop to encourage its workers in their efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He acquainted himself in detail with the production at the complex. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He said that the workers of Pukjung have greatly contributed to developing the shipbuilding industry of the country and consolidating the independent national economy by manufacturing various types of engines, compressors, refrigerators and other machines and producing ordered equipment for different domains of the national economy and highly praised their exploits. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   More highly efficient engines needed for the building of modern fishing and cargo ships should be supplied to further develop fishing industry and marine transport in our country surrounded by seas on three sides, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In order to produce more modern machinery commensurate with the 2000s, he added, it is imperative to push ahead with the technical transformation aimed to update all production processes and work with redoubled energy to introduce new technology as required by the party's idea of giving great importance to science. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He stressed that it was important to thoroughly ensure profitability in production, raise the quality of goods and increase the endeavors to observe the technical rules and standard regulations of operation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He urged the Pukjung workers to turn out more high-quality machines and ordered equipment conducive to the building of a powerful nation as they have unconditionally carried out any difficult tasks assigned to them by the party in an indomitable spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He was accompanied by chief secretary of the north Phyongan provincial committee of the Worker's Party of Korea Kim Phyong Hae, secretaries of the WPK Central Committee Kim Kuk Thae and Kim Yong Sun and first vice department directors of the party central committee. \r\n\r\n"

At least 5,000 uprisers were killed and over 14,000 wounded in a little over 10 days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Through the uprising the South Korean people clearly realized that the U.S. is, indeed, ferocious ogres who do not hesitate to savagely massacre South Korean people in order to achieve their aggressive design and maintain their colonial ruling system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Today the U.S. is not only persistently pursuing the policy to stifle the DPRK but are imposing immeasurable misfortune and sacrifices upon the South Korean people, still lording it over South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean people cannot get rid of miserable colonial slavery as long as the U.S. is allowed to stay in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The people from all walks of life including youths and students of South Korea should put up a more vigorous struggle to probe into the truth behind the crimes committed by the U.S. in different parts of Korea such as Rogun-ri, Yongdong county, and Kwangju and force the U.S. to pay deserved compensation for them and turn the whole of South Korea into a theatre of a fierce struggle for independence against the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They should carry on a strenuous struggle to liquidate flunkeyist and traitorous forces who impose misfortune and sufferings upon the nation and deliberately throw obstacles in the way of the independent development of the nation and national reunification in a bid to prolong their remaining days in reliance on outside forces and put an end to their corrupt politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He was followed by other speakers. \r\n\r\n"

This is the most unique political mode unprecedented in the world history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is the best political mode in the era of independence and the leadership mode replete with the warmest love for the people and unbounded loyalty and dedication to the cause of independence and the cause of socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The validity and vitality of the politics have been proven in practice under the present complicated situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The imperialists carried out barbarous bombing in wanton violation of sovereignty of independent states after sparking the Persian Gulf War and the Kosovo crisis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nHowever, they could not perpetrate this against the DPRK but suffered only disgrace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such vicious economic blockade and  sanctions of the imperialists and severe natural disasters would bring down others hundreds of times. Thanks to the army-first politics the DPRK has hewed this thorny path victoriously and steadily consolidated its economic foundation for building a powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The world came to realize through the political and diplomatic confrontation between the DPRK and the imperialists that the army-first politics guarantees independent diplomacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This politics serves as an all-powerful treasured sword for building socialism and an example of independent politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The army-first politics precisely means a political mode to be adopted by the countries aspiring after independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis politics provides a sure guarantee for carving out the destiny of the country and the nation and bringing a bright future to them. \r\n\r\n"

AP also reported that Edward Daily, an ex-soldier of U.S. troops, has shown an AP reporter documents, including a worn old army driver's license, in support of his contention he was in the 7th cavalry's h company to refute the assertion of reptile media. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
