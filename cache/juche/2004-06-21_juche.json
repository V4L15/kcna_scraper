There have been wide-range dialogues and contacts between personages from all walks of life and organizations in the north and the south and overseas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All those dialogues and contacts were aimed at solving the reunification issue by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation, free from outside domination and interference, and have been true to the principle of placing the common interests of the nation above all and subordinating everything to national reunification, not allowing anyone to seek a sinister political purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The era of independence and reunification calling for the realization of national sovereignty has advanced amid a fierce struggle against the U.S. keen to infringe upon it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation's movement for national reunification has definitely turned into a nation-wide movement as all Koreans, be they authorities or common people, have made joint efforts irrespective of idea, political view and religious belief. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Brisk are cooperation and exchange between the north and the south in different fields in the main spirit of the June 15 joint declaration  The era of independence and reunification ushered in by the June 15 joint declaration clearly taught the Koreans the truth of independence and unity and powerfully aroused them to the patriotic struggle for reunification, thus recording the history of the reunification movement with events and miracles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these shining successes made in the period of implementing the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration are the precious fruition of the great patriotic Songun politics of leader  Kim Jong Il, a peerless patriot and illustrious commander born of Heaven, and the tireless patriotic guidance provided by him to the reunification movement.       \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He has thus successfully achieved the single-hearted unity of the leader, the Party and the popular masses and led the WPK to strictly abide by the basic principles governing the revolutionary party construction in its activities to develop the Party into an invincible socialist ruling party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Attaching great importance to realizing the integration of the Party and the army, he has firmly established the unitary leadership system of the Party in the KPA under the banner of modeling the whole army on the Juche idea and thus turned the KPA into the leader's army and the Party's army, making the Party and the army an integral whole. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He set out the Songun policy to cope with the grave situation the Korean revolution faced in the 1990s of the last century and has developed the WPK to be a revolutionary party in the Songun era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to Kim Jong Il's wise leadership over the WPK the DPRK has won one victory after another in the fierce struggle against the imperialists and the U.S. and has reached a high watermark of prosperity through a grand onward movement to build a great prosperous powerful socialist nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They called on all the Party members, servicepersons and people to strengthen the WPK under the banner of the great Songun policy in order to pave a wide avenue for fresh success in the building of a great prosperous powerful socialist nation, bring earlier the independent reunification of the country and accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche.       \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is ill-famed for being a barren land of human rights in the 21st century as it is committing genocide of contemporary form in different parts of the world including Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is behaving as if it were a world human rights judge, oblivious of its miserable situation where it is under world curse and fire for being a kingpin of mass killings and human rights abuses.
