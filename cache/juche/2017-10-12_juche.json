This is the very core of the purposes and principles of the UN.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To this end, it is of crucial importance for the UN Security Council to fully abide by the UN purposes and principled defined by its Charter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the actual conducts of the UNSC are far from what is being required by the UN Charter and, in fact, the UNSC is wantonly violating the UN Charter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The issue of the Korean peninsula is one of the most typical examples.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The UNSC had never taken issue with the U.S. which has posed a nuclear threat to the DPRK for more than half a century, but on the contrary, it termed the DPRK's measures to bolster its self-defensive nuclear force as \"a threat to world peace and security\" and cooked up illegal and unreasonable \"resolutions\" one after another.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The issue of the \"UN Command\" present in south Korea is another vivid example of the U.N. being misused against the UN Charter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"UN Command\" rigged up by the U.S. with its provocation of the Korean War is a totally illegal entity which has nothing to do with UN except for its name stolen, neither is it involved in the UN's programs and activities nor its control and maintenance is related to the UN in any way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In other words, the U.S. troops in south Korea do wear the UN berets, but they never report or answer to the UN or take orders from it. The so-called \"UN Forces\" in south Korea revealed its unlawfulness from the very moment of its foundation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the UNSC were to fulfill its primary mission and responsibility for international peace and security as required by the UN Charter, it should quit being a plaything of arbitrary and high-handed practices and the unilateralism of the U.S. and it should take due measures to peacefully resolve the issue of the Korean peninsula strictly in line with the purposes and principles of the UN."
