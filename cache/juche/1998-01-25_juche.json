Korea\r\nPyongyang, January 25 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today says the United States must refrain from using \"security\" as a reason for its military presence in South Korea.\r\n   On Jan. 19 the U.S. Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, said that the United States will keep military alliance with South Korea even after the threat to security disappears on the Korean Peninsula. His utterances reflect the U.S. stand and strategy to keep the U.S. troops on the Korean Peninsula and exercise military upperhand there even after affirmative changes take place and stability is achieved in this region, the paper notes, and goes on:\r\n   The United States is trying to keep its 100,000-strong troops in Asia. It intends to contain the DPRK with the mobilization of its forces in and around South Korea and take hold on the whole of the Korean Peninsula, a military strategic spot. And it is going to realize its wild ambition to dominate Asia with the peninsula as a foothold. \r\n   \"Security\" and \"stability\" can never be a reason for the U.S. military presence in South Korea.\r\n   If stability and peace is to be achieved on the Korean Peninsula and secuirty to be realized in Asia, it is imperative to put an end to the presence of the U.S. Forces in South Korea, the main cause of tension and danger of war. \r\n   It is desirable to focus the multinational debate about security on this.    \r\n \r\n"
