            "content": "Rodong Sinmun califica a EE.UU. de productor de tension militar y crisis de guerra\r\nPyongyang, 26 de enero (ACNC) -- En un articulo individual de este martes, el diario Rodong Sinmun califica a Estados Unidos de autor que vino aumentando la tension militar y la crisis de guerra en la Peninsula Coreana nadando a contrapelo de la aspiracion de la nacion coreana a la paz y la reunificacion en virtud de \"tratados\" y \"convenios\" de toda indole concertados con el Sur de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\tDurante mas de 60 anos pasados posbelicos EE.UU. desarrollo cada ano en el suelo surcoreano los fanaticos ejercicios de guerra nuclear que son fuentes de la agravacion de la tension y la crisis de guerra de la Peninsula Coreana, revela el articulo y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. trazo el \"OPLAN 5027\", \"OPLAN 5029\", \"OPLAN 5030\" y otros guiones de guerra de agresion a la RPDC y desarrollo incesantes alborotos belicos amenazando gravemente a la RPDC y acarreando el nubarron de guerra nuclear a la Peninsula Coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn agosto del ano pasado el imperio norteamericano introdujo en el suelo surcoreano enormes medios de guerra y la division combinada Sur de Corea-EE.UU. asumida la \"eliminacion de la Direccion Suprema de la RPDC\" y \"la ocupacion de Pyongyang\". Tambien, desplego todos los puestos de mando operacional y libro el simulacro conjunto Ulji Freedom Guardian.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInsatisfecho con esto, instigo a los belicistas surcoreanos a la grave provocacion armada pretextando el incidente de la \"explosion de mina\" y el de \"disparo de proyectil del Norte\", llevando asi al borde de la guerra la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa historia y la realidad demuestran claramente que EE.UU. es el agresor mas descarado, la causa raigal de los sufrimientos y desgracias de la poblacion surcoreana y la horda de belicistas que impide la reconciliacion y unidad de la nacion coreana y la reunificacion de Corea y aumenta la crisis de guerra nuclear."

            "content": "EE.UU. es sociedad mas reaccionaria y antipopular, revela Minju Joson\r\nPyongyang, 26 de enero (ACNC) -- Recientemente, una TV de Rumania transmitio que el numero de los norteamericanos muertos en la guerra Sur-Norte, la guerra Estados Unidos-Espana, la Primera y la Segunda Guerra Mundial, la guerra coreana, la vietnamita y las otras registradas en la historia de Estados Unidos, llego en total a un millon 200 mil personas, pero el numero de los muertos por el crimen de fusil en el interior estadounidense en el periodo pacifico, a un millon 400 mil personas.\n\t\t\t\t\t Este dato comprueba evidentemente que EE.UU. es el infierno de la humanidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Adelanta el periodico Minju Joson en un comentario individual difundido este martes y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora en EE.UU. se permite legalmente la posesion de armas de los individuos, y el uso de armas se ha convertido en una \"cultura\", razon por la cual el crimen de fusil sirve del tumor maligno nunca extirpable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En la sociedad estadounidense el uso excesivo de fusiles de los individuos se presenta como grave problema.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Los productores de armas se oponen tenazmente a la medida de restriccion de armas bajo el amparo del Congreso.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Bajo tales circunstancias acabar con el crimen de fusiles en EE.UU. deviene una vana ilusion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El caracter progresista y el reaccionario de la sociedad se deciden por como se respetan y se aseguran la independencia y el derecho a vivir del hombre, ser social.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En tal sentido, la sociedad norteamericana es la mas reaccionaria y antipopular en el mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El mundo condena la postura descarada de EE.UU. que prefiere a descubrir y censurar las \"faltas de derechos humanos\" de otros paises a pesar de que no defiende la seguridad de la vida de sus habitantes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t EE.UU. debe cuidar primero los asuntos de su pais antes de cuestionar los DDHH de otros paises."
