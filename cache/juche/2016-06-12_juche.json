Todo esto demuestra hasta donde ha llegado la ambicion de confrontacion fratricida de los titeres surcoreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestras fuerzas armadas revolucionarias nunca estaran con los brazos cruzados ante el intento de los titeres surcoreanos de fortalecer la confabulacion sucia con los amos estadounidense y japones preconizando la \"diplomacia militar\" y traer el nubarron de fuego de la guerra nuclear en esta tierra patria."

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun demanda a Sur de Corea abandonar ilusion de \"renuncia nuclear de Norte\"\r\nPyongyang, 12 de junio (ACNC) -- Hace poco, los compinches del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores titere del Sur de Corea visitaron la sede de la Union Europea para solicitar el \"mantenimiento de la fuerte sancion y presion anti-Norte de Corea\" para inducir el \"cambio de estrategia nuclear\" de alguien. Y en Japon mendigaron la \"aplicacion de las rigurosas medidas de sancion anti-Norte\". El canciller Yun Pyong Se dijo que su proxima gira al extranjero sera un motivo para consolidar la \"diplomacia de presion anti-Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\tEl diario Rodong Sinmun, en un comentario individual del dia 12, senala que el ejercito y pueblo coreanos no abandonaran su conviccion ni cambiaran su opcion arrodillados ante la \"sancion y presion\" de las fuerzas hostiles, y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs un proceder ridiculo que las autoridades surcoreanas abrigan todavia la ilusion vana de lograr la \"renuncia nuclear del Norte\" persiguiendo el \"cambio\" de la RPDC sin darse clara cuenta de la ferrea voluntad y posicion de la parte connacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos conservadores surcoreanos deben salvar primero la crisis de su gobernacion, antes de perseguir el \"cambio\" de alguien. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas deben tener presente que la campana intrigante anti-RPDC en confabulacion con las fuerzas extranjeras producira solo el repudio y rechazo de la nacion y la verguenza internacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi los titeres surcoreanos siguen recurriendo a la anacronica campana de enfrentamiento anti-RPDC, recibiran el castigo severo de todos los coreanos indignados, al igual que sus antecesores. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa ilusion vana de las autoridades surcoreanas les llevara al abismo sin salida y acelerara su autodestruccion."
