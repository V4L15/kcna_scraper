Another factory has sprung up to contribute to improving the standard of the people's living, he added. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round various places of the factory to learn in detail about the production processes, technical specifications of equipment and varieties and quality of products.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Appreciating the successful construction of the factory, he said he was pleased with everything there as the building area and production space have been built and equipment are rationally distributed on the basis of the scientific design of technological processes and the inside and outside of the factory have been arranged in an impeccable style.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He noted that all production processes have been put on an automated and unmanned basis at a high level and an excellent integrated production system established in line with the features of the factory producing all kinds of liquid soap and detergent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was pleased that the factory has not only modern injection moulding machines capable of easily producing various containers for liquid soap which look nice and convenient but sufficient cutting-edge equipment capable of analyzing and examining the quality and hygienic safety of products.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that it is gratifying to see varieties of products including shampoo, rinse, detergent for vessels and soap powder on high pile, though the factory started production not long before.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He set forth the tasks facing the factory including the issues of increasing varieties of liquid soap and detergent and their output year by year and thoroughly guaranteeing their quality and further improving their trademarks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the factory was successfully built in such a manner as to match the natural scenery of Mt. Ryongak, he recalled that leader Kim Jong Il gave instructions to build a factory specializing in the production of liquid soap on several occasions in his lifetime and said with pleasure that one of his behests was fulfilled.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said with a broad smile on his face that he was pleased to picture the people liking varieties of liquid soap and detergent produced by the factory, adding he was relieved of the pent-up fatigue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Ryongaksan Soap Factory is a factory to which the Party pays great attention and a factory directly related to improving the people's standard of living, he said, expressing expectation and conviction that its officials and employees would creditably fulfill their honorable duty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Hwang Pyong So, O Su Yong, An Jong Su, Kim Yong Su, So Hong Chan, Jo Yong Won and Ma Won Chun."

Resolutions on ensuring human rights were adopted on the international arena including the UN and the Inter-Parliamentary Union, but human rights abuses and disasters have been reported nonstop in all parts of the world, and confrontation and disputes between nations and civilizations escalated, posing serious threat to global peace and security and the right to existence of mankind. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This taught us the lesson that there could be no human rights apart from sovereignty under the serious human rights situation in different counties whose sovereignty were infringed upon owing to the aggression, interference in internal affairs and unilateral sanctions by the U.S. and other big powers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The unprecedented political and economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. on the DPRK are human rights crimes tantamount to mass destruction as they deny and obliterate the right to existence of the whole nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is the socialist state centered on the popular masses and it is guided by the Juche idea which puts forward human being as the most precious existence. The DPRK is the people-first society where all the people enjoy the genuine political, economic and cultural rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At a time when the U.S. deployed huge armed forces on the Korean peninsula with the sinister aim to stifle the DPRK by force of arms, the heroic service personnel of the Korean People's Army are conducting a campaign for harnessing the nature to defend the people's happiness in the northern part of the country which suffered from huge natural disaster, true to the call of the Workers' Party of Korea which regards it as the most important revolutionary work to relieve the people of their misfortune.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and other hostile forces regarding the hostility toward the DPRK as their state policy are resorting to the vicious economic sanctions and smear \"human rights\" campaign, finding it impossible to bring down the DPRK by force. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. checked the introduction of sports apparatuses which have nothing to do with military purposes and refused the remittance to bank for the settlement of accounts of the DPRK's membership fee to the Secretariat of the IPU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But no sanctions, blockade and fabrication can ever work on the Korean people nor can they tarnish the image of the DPRK invariably advancing along the road for the improvement of genuine human rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will as ever make contribution to the struggle of progressive mankind for defending global peace, security and human rights, and fulfill its mission and responsibility before the international community."
