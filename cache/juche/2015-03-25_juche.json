            "content": "KPA Panmunjom Mission Discloses U.S. Criminal Abuse of Cheonan Warship Sinking for Hostile Policy toward DPRK\r\nPyongyang, March 25 (KCNA) -- The Panmunjom mission of the Korean People's Army released an indictment Tuesday exposing the U.S. criminal act of cooking up the Cheonan warship sinking case and abusing it for stepping up its hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is the arch criminal that engineered the case by instigating the south Korean puppet forces, the indictment said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., which had repeated plots to save its policy for invading the DPRK and its pivot to Asia-Pacific strategy from crises and give a shot in the arm of its colonial stooges, concluded that it needed a shocking case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accordingly, the U.S. imperialist aggression forces command in Pacific held a confab with stooges of the \"Institute for National Defense Studies\" and the \"Pacific Strategy Institute\" of south Korea and suddenly launched the joint naval drills in waters off the five islands in the West Sea where tensions between the north and the south constantly ran high.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to the scenario worked out by the U.S. in top secret, the Cheonan warship sank at night on March 26, 2010, leaving 46 puppet army soldiers dead.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was orchestrated by the U.S. out of its sinister intention to hold control of south Korea and Japan, use them as a shock brigade in realizing its ambition for world domination and intensify the moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK after securing justifications for arms buildup in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A typical example was the scientific clarification made by competent naval military experts of the Russian Pacific Fleet of the fact that the warship sank by a special torpedo from a smaller diving apparatus launched by the nuclear-powered submarine of the U.S. forces, not by a \"torpedo of the north.\"  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The indictment also exposed that the U.S. has persistently stood in the way of a fair probe into the truth about the case. It continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. brought to rupture the colonel-level working contacts between the militaries of the DPRK and the U.S. in Panmunjom that were held on seven occasions from July 15 to October 27, 2010 for the probe into the truth behind the case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The indictment termed the U.S. a backstage wire-puller that instigated the south Korean puppet forces to cook up a story about \"the north's attack.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. didn't hesitate to run the whole gamut of base acts to put under carpet the fabrication of the warship sinking case, it noted, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A particular mention should be made of the fact that the U.S. egged the south Korean puppet forces on to spread the story of \"north's attack\" and asserted it was an established fact that the north was a suspect, claiming that \"there were almost no other suspects except for north Korea\" and \"the warship sank by a torpedo attack of north Korea.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t While egging the puppet forces on to stage a farce \"proving\" the story about \"the north's torpedo attack,\" the U.S. got zealous in building up public opinion to justify it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The indictment branded the U.S. as hordes of warmongers who abused the warship sinking case for its moves for invading the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No sooner had the case occurred than the U.S. pushed the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of a war, getting frantic with its war racket targeting the DPRK, it said and continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Right after the \"results of investigation\" peppered with sheer lies were published on May 20, 2010, Obama instructed the U.S. Department of Defense and Joint Chiefs of Staff to make thorough military preparations to \"cope with future invasion by north Korea.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pursuant to it, U.S. warships sailed into the West Sea of Korea and largest-ever joint submarine, naval mobile, air mobile and naval landing drills and other joint maneuvers of various forms were staged almost every day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Arms buildup and deployment of forces were stepped up according to the conversion of the command of the U.S. Eighth Army into the \"one for executing a war.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t War servants of the U.S. were busy visiting south Korea and Japan, where they were loudmouthed about \"very dangerous situation on the Korean peninsula\" and held confabs for tightening the military alliance for aggression among the U.S., Japan and south Korea to cope with contingency on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. zealously hurled war maniacs of the south Korean puppet military into reckless military provocations to escalate confrontation with compatriots in the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. scenario to abuse the warship sinking case for laying a siege for international \"sanctions\" against the DPRK was executed at an ever more serious phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should admit before the Korean nation and the world public its criminal fabrication of the case and abuse of it for carrying out its hostile policy toward the DPRK and escalating confrontation between Koreans and make an apology for them, though belatedly."

Phanmunjom hizo publica el dia 24 un acta de acusacion para revelar y denunciar los crimenes abominables de Estados Unidos que fabrico y abuso del incidente de hundimiento de la corbeta \"Cheonan\" en su campana hostil a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. es el autor principal que fabrico el incidente instigando a los titeres surcoreanos, comienza el acta y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl cabo de sus reiterados debates para eludir el fracaso de su politica agresiva contra la RPDC y estrategia de dar importancia a Asia-Pacifico y para alentar a su lacayo colonial caido en aprieto, EE.UU. saco la conclusion de que se debe fabricar algun incidente sensacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun esa decision, la comandancia de las fuerzas norteamericanas en el Pacifico sostuvo una conspiracion con los lacayos del \"instituto de defensa nacional\" del Sur de Corea y otros organos y desarrollo de repente los ejercicios combinados maritimos en las aguas de 5 islas del Mar Oeste de Corea en que ambas partes coreanas estan en agudo enfrentamiento\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun el guion trazado en supersecreto por EE.UU., ocurrio por la noche del dia 26 de marzo de 2010 el hundimiento de la corbeta \"Cheonan\" de que fueron victimas 46 soldados del ejercito surcoreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste accidente fue un invento de EE.UU. que pretendio usar el Sur de Corea y Japon como brigadas de choque en la realizacion de su ambicion de tomar la heguemonia mundial y recrudecer la campana de aislamiento y aplastamiento contra la RPDC al procurar el pretexto y justificacion del aumento armamentista en esta region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHasta los competentes especialistas de la Flota del Pacifico de Rusia opinaron con argumentos cientificos que \"Cheonan\" sumergio no por el \"ataque del torpedo del Norte (RPDC)\" sino por el torpedo especial lanzado por un submarino nuclear de EE.UU. usando un pequeno aparato sumergible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. impidio obstinadamente el esclarecimiento imparcial del incidente de \"Cheonan\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl papel obstructor de EE.UU. se ha conocido en todo el proceso del contacto de trabajo del circulo militar RPDC-EE.UU., sostenido 7 veces a nivel de coronel en Phanmunjom desde el 15 de julio hasta el 27 de octubre de 2010 para el esclarecimiento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. fue el que instigo por detras a los titeres surcoreanos a inventar el rumor de la \"obra del Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRecurrio a las sucias artimanas de toda indole para ocultar su acto criminal de haber fraguado el accidente de \"Cheonan\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras los titeres surcoreanos circulaban en la opinion publica el rumor de la \"obra del Norte\" segun la indicacion de EE.UU., este pais trato de tildar a la RPDC de sospechosa diciendo que \"no hay casi el otro sospechoso sino el Norte de Corea\" y el \"hundimiento fue causado por el ataque de torpedo norcoreano\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl paralelo de la farsa para \"comprobar\" ese rumor, EE.UU. se dedico a la creacion de opiniones que pudieran justificarlo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. es el colectivo de belicistas que abuso del incidente en sus maniobras agresivas contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTan pronto como ocurriera el hundimiento, recrudecio la campana de guerra y agresion contra la RPDC llevando al borde de guerra la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn cuanto se publicara el 20 de mayo de 2010 el \"resultado de investigacion\" penetrado de fraudes, Obama instruyo al Pentagono y la Junta de Jefes de Estado Mayor que hagan todos los preparativos militares para \"disuadir la futura agresion proveniente del Norte de Corea\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun sus instrucciones, los buques de guerra del imperialismo norteamericano irrumpieron en el Mar Oeste de Corea y se libraron casi todos los dias los ejercicios militares conjuntos de diferentes misiones como los de submarinos de mayor dimension en la historia, las maniobras de traslado en el mar y el cielo y de desembarco.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe han desplegado en el terreno mucho mas fuerzas armadas debido a que la comandancia del 8o ejercito de las tropas agresoras norteamericanas se convirtio en la \"de cumplimiento de guerra\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos sirvientes de guerra de EE.UU. frecuentaron al Sur de Corea y Japon para pregonar \"la muy peligrosa situacion de la Peninsula Coreana\" y debatir el fortalecimiento de la alianza militar tripartita frente al tiempo de emergencia de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. empujo a los belicistas del circulo militar surcoreano a las provocaciones militares contra la parte connacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe torno grave la campana de EE.UU. para abusar del incidente de \"Cheonan\" en el establecimiento de la red de \"sancion\" internacional contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAunque ya es tarde, EE.UU. debe confesar y pedir disculpas a la nacion coreana y al mundo por su crimen de haber fraguado el incidente de \"Cheonan\" y abusado del mismo en el cumplimiento de su politica hostil anti-RPDC."

Precisamente con esta idea, el poder del Norte sobrevivio durante 70 anos a pesar de la hostilidad de EE.UU.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTanto los coreanos en EE.UU. como el mundo entero reconocen ahora la realidad de la RPDC que con el poderio de la idea Juche, la del Songun, logro la unidad monolitica nunca vista en otros paises y marcha con vigor atravesando todas las dificultades. Pero, ?Por que solo Obama no quiere verla ni saberla?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDar espalda a la realidad es un acto suicida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. se niega persistentemente a reconocer oficialmente el hecho de que la RPDC es el pais poseedor de armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC declaro ya a todo el mundo que centuplicara su disuasivo nuclear, espada autodefensiva, para hacer frente a las maniobras  hostiles de los enemigos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo tenemos prisa sino la tiene EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa carta expone claramente  que \"el Norte minimiza poco a poco las armas nucleares y mejora la tecnologia de misil. En este momento, si sigue provocando contra el Norte, este llegara a poseer las armas de exterminio masivo capaces de atacar hasta el territorio estadounidense\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl comandante de la Comandancia Estrategica de EE.UU., quien controla las fuerzas armadas nucleares, dijo el dia 20 en la audiencia del Congreso Norteamericano que \"parece que el Norte de Corea ya haya alcanzado exito en minimizar las armas nucleares\". Sus palabras significan perfecto reconocimiento del fortalecimiento de las fuerzas disuasivas de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tQuien es acosado por el tiempo es precisamente la administracion Obama.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe tomar por si mismo una alternativa: la paz o la guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl tiempo y la victoria eterna estan al lado de nosotros.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRecomendamos a la administracion Obama poner inmediato fin a las maniobras militares de agresion a la RPDC y abandonar todos los actos hostiles anti-RPDC."
