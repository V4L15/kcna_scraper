This is sheer sophism which cannot convince anyone and does not stand to reason.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Economic support\" to the DPRK touted by Park makes it not hard to guess that she is a megalomaniac totally unable to face up to the reality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ridiculous, indeed, is her ballyhooing about support to someone as south Korea is torn with people's grievances owing to political confusion, economic crisis and deterioration of people's living.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park made reckless remarks hurting the dignity and the social system of the DPRK over its \"human rights\" issue. This is an open declaration that she would strongly oppose any process for improving the north-south relations and escalate confrontation with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is that she uttered that \"unification of Germany is a cornerstone of new Europe\" and the unification sought by her \"would serve as a cornerstone of new Northeast Asia.\" Herein lie her ulterior, cunning and crafty intention and ambition for achieving the unification of social systems.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean puppet forces persist in the moves for escalating the confrontation with the DPRK with the backing of foreign forces, it will only entail the miserable consequences precipitating their self-destruction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson says: It is the first time that the south Korean puppet president let loose a flurry of invectives against the DPRK over its nuclear issue and \"human rights\" issue at the UN General Assembly session.
