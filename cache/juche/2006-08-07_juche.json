It cites concrete facts to prove that after emerging boss of world imperialism in the post-World War II period, the U.S. imperialists defined it as the keynote of its foreign strategy to dominate the world by force and has since perpetrated military intervention and aggression wherever they went.\r\n The crimes committed by them against civilians in Iraq after launching a war of aggression against it go to clearly prove that they are the most barbaric and shameless aggressors and disturbers of peace in the modern times, the article notes, and goes on: \r\n The U.S. imperialists are becoming evermore undisguised in their moves to disturb peace. Their \"anti-terrorism war\" is a pronoun of aggression and war aimed at conquering the world by force. They are brazen-faced enough to perpetrate aggression against mankind under the pretexts of \"anti-terrorism\" and \"defence of peace.\" Any country they consider to be a hurdle in establishing a world order has become a target of their invasion. What is more serious is that they are desperately working to bring a nuclear holocaust to mankind after singling out a preemptive nuclear attack as a basis of their aggressive military strategy. It is prompted by such criminal design that they have stepped up the moves to manufacture ultra-modern and smaller nukes and simplified the procedures for their use. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are encouraging and patronizing their allies in the acts of aggression in order to meet their strategic interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are creating the danger of war and seriously threatening peace on the Korean Peninsula, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation on the peninsula remains so tense due to the reckless moves of the U.S. imperialists that a war may break out there any moment.      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is an undisguised act of treachery as it is meant to hurt compatriots by means of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are talking about \"security\" in a bid to cover up the above-said criminal act, but it is nothing but sophism. The U.S. troops present in south Korea are the harasser of peace on the Korean Peninsula. Therefore, their pullback from south Korea would automatically lead to the solution of the issue of \"security.\" Unpardonable are the reckless moves of the south Korean authorities to sacrifice the whole Korean nation, not content with having forced the south Koreans to fall victim to the U.S. troops.\r\n The Korean nation will never recognize any document of aggression and treachery to be published by the U.S. and south Korea nor will it allow any foreign forces to trifle its destiny. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities would be well advised to come to themselves and give up their treacherous act to leave the destiny of the nation to the aggressors, though belatedly.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The commentary blasts the U.S. wrong stance of openly supporting and patronizing Israel and the UNSC's incompetent behavior.\r\n Israel does not hesitate to invade other countries and commit mass killings, blatantly challenging the demands of the Middle East countries and the international community because the U.S. is unilaterally supporting and patronizing it from a biased stand, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When Israel began its invasion of Palestine and Lebanon, the U.S. described it as an \"exercise of the right to self-defence.\" This was evidenced by the fact that the U.S. shielded Israel at the UNSC emergency meeting on the above-said aggression.\r\n The incompetent behavior of the UNSC also aroused disappointment from the international community. The UNSC, influenced by the U.S., uttered no words critical of Israel's cruel mass killings, thereby betraying its incompetence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Israel should immediately halt its reckless military aggression and mass killings and withdraw its troops from Palestine and Lebanon as soon as possible. And if the U.S. truly wants peace in the Middle East, it should discontinue patronizing Israel.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They are the kingpin of state-sponsored terrorism of the 21st century, the principal criminal of aggression and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When all the progressive people of the world who are interested in peace turn out in the struggle for peace against war under the banner of unity, the U.S.-led imperialist aggression forces dare not run amuck at random and a favorable environment for peace can be created in the international arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The progressive people of the world should not overlook but resolutely reject even a slight infringement upon sovereignty by the imperialists.
