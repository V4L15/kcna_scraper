They assert that they \"investigated the incident as possible as they could,\" but they could not prove it, and that \"such information document had not been found in the history archives\" of the U.S. Defense Department. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Meanwhile, the South Korean authorities are appeasing the angry people at home and abroad arguing that \"legal examination of the incident, including the prescription issue,\" is necessary and they hope this incident will not exert a bad influence on the relations with the U.S., the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. aggressors in the Korean War brutally killed a lot of people not only in Yongdong but also in Suwon, Chungju, Thongyong,  Kochang and all other different parts of South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The truth of the history cannot be distorted and covered. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   With all appeasement and deception the U.S. can never cover up the truth behind mass killings of the people committed in South Korea for over 50 years, including the massacre in Yongdong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. should clearly see the situation and make an official apology for their murderous crimes against the South Korean people and withdraw their aggression forces and nuclear weapons from South Korea without delay. \r\n\r\n"

In particular, they carried out the first joint excursion to historical sites in the north, he pointed out, calling upon them to take the lead of the struggle for opening a turning phase of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Ryang Jong Ryung, representative of the Pomchonghakryon overseas headquarters, in his speech called for conducting the second joint excursion to historical sites in the north and achieving the great unity of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He said the joint excursion is righteous work intended to confirm the spirit of the nation and retake independence and it is a historic task of achieving the great national unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Through the first joint excursion the youth and students in the north, south and overseas realized that the traditions of the resourceful Korean nation remain in their life and when they are united into one a reunified powerful nation will surely be built further throwing its rays all over the world, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He stressed they would carry out the second joint excursion without fail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Ri Myong Won, vice-chairman of the north headquarters of Pomchonghakryon and director of its secretariat, stressed in his speech the need to smash the war moves of the United States, Japan and the South Korean authorities and accelerate national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Denouncing the United States, Japan and the South Korean authorities for getting overheated with anti-DPRK war moves, he said: For the country to be reunified, it is urgent to crush the war moves of outsiders and the flunkeyist and traitorous forces and launch a vigorous struggle for removal of such obstacles to reunification as South Korea's \"security law.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A message of solidarity from the fourth-term joint secretariat of Pomchonghakryon was read out at the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A joint resolution was also adopted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The resolution declared that the youth and students in the north, south and abroad would devote their all to the struggle for great national unity and the independent and peaceful reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Pomchonghakryon will valiantly struggle for the repeal of the \"operation plan 5027-98\", discontinuation of U.S.-Japan-South Korea joint military exercises, withdrawal of the U.S. forces from South Korea and conclusion of a peace accord between the DPRK and the U.S. and thus greatly contribute to laying foundations for peace in the Korean peninsula. \r\n\r\n"
