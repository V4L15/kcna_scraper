Korea Projected Ulji Freedom Guardian\r\n Pyongyang, August 21 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Country (CPRC) of the DPRK issued a statement on Sunday as regards the large-scale Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military drill to be staged by the U.S. and south Korean puppet warmongers from August 22.\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes without saying that this drill, too, is an outrageous provocation for a nuclear war against the north aimed to encroach upon the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK and infringe on the vital rights of its people, the statement said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is that the joint military drill is to be staged under the simulated conditions of a sudden attack on the DPRK. It is, therefore, the most undisguised physical measure and provocative action to chill the desire of all Koreans for reunification growing stronger thanks to the DPRK's step to hold a grand national meeting for improving the inter-Korean relations and bringing earlier reunification. This saber-rattling is also aimed at stemming the trend for independence against the U.S. getting ever more dynamic along with the actions against THAAD deployment in south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK remains unchanged in its stand on the prevailing situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the resolute stand of the DPRK to decisively foil all hostile acts and threat of aggression and provocation with the Korean-style nuclear deterrence which has been bolstered by the service personnel and people of the DPRK with the might of single-minded unity and through the drive for breaking through the cutting edge true to the line of simultaneously pushing ahead the two fronts, something hard to find in any part of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The only choice for the U.S. to save its face and preserve its existence is to stop such dangerous muscle flexing against the north such as Ulji Freedom Guardian and roll back its foolish and brigandish anti-DPRK hostile policy aimed to get something through sanctions and pressure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Availing itself of this opportunity, the DPRK solemnly warns the Park Geun Hye group of traitors once again that it had better stop going reckless, properly understanding the daily growing politico-military might of the fellow countrymen in the north, its dramatically changed position and subsequently altered strategic structure on the Korean peninsula."
