With the distinguished leadership ability and ever-victorious army-based policy, he safeguarded the peace of the Korean peninsula and security of the nation without the slightest wavering despite the imperialist allied forces' desperate moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK and opened up the road for turning the north into a powerful state and achieving a great national prosperity in the new century, it recalled. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under his guidance, national reunification and the human cause of independence are sure to be realized and the new century will shine as a glorious Kim Jong Il century, it held. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Similar meetings were also held by provincial and city committees of the NDFSK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The meetings adopted congratulatory messages, letters and letters of pledge to Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the organizations under the NDFSK and patriotic movement organizations held colorful political and cultural events in conformity with their specific conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The NDFSK mission in Pyongyang called a press conference in Pyongyang on Feb. 14. at the conference it introduced in detail the mind-set of South Korean people deeply revering and following Kim Jong Il as the sun of the 21st century and the lodestar of national reunification and clarified their firm will to bring earlier the dawn of national reunification.     \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA on Bush's mud-slinging at DPRK's political system \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 4 (KCNA) -- U.S. President Bush malignantly slandered the dignified political system in the DPRK terming it a \"closed system\" in a \"speech\" made at the head office of the \"Voice of America\" in Washington on Feb. 25.\r\n His string of remarks against the DPRK's political system came in the wake of his malignant mud-slinging at the supreme headquarters of the DPRK and his call for a \"change\" in its system during his recent South Korea visit. This cannot but be interpreted as a very serious issue as it is not a mere provocation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He is foolish enough to seek to divorce the supreme headquarters from the people and infuse the U.S. view on value and the consciousness of \"liberty\" into its society while putting military pressure upon the DPRK in a bid to force it to \"change\" its system as what happened in those countries where capitalism revived. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. brought the weak political force Taliban to a collapse by hurling huge armed forces into the afghan war. It has become so arrogant as to officially declare as its state policy its projected foreign policy of aggression intended to put all the countries advocating independence under the U.S.-led neo-colonialist system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration's bellicose plan to bring about a \"change\" in the DPRK's political system is to implement this policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By setting out such \"policy\" bush and u.s. foreign policy-makers only revealed that they are politically half witted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's political system is a man-centred system where the leader, the party and the masses form a harmonious whole. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To try to force the DPRK to \"change\" it is just like sweeping the sea with a broom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should know this at least if they have a normal way of thinking and elementary reason. It is the Bush administration's tragedy that it is running amuck, not aware of who is its opponent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK regard it as their top priority to devotedly defend the supreme headquarters, their destiny and future, and will never pardon those who dare slander it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK army's strike is limitless and merciless and there is no place on this planet to escape it.     \r\n\r\n"
