The U.S. imperialists, displeased with the joint declaration itself, have tried by hood or by crook to throw high hurdles in the way of its implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their policy of dominating south Korea by force of arms is denounced by all the Koreans as it is an anachronistic criminal policy against history and the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States should make a bold decision to dismantle its military bases and withdraw its aggression forces at an early date, dropping its outdated policy of dominating south Korea and keeping it as a military base.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Its noisy talk about \"dialogue for a solution to the nuclear issue\" is intended to create a favorable condition for the realization of its invariable design to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This malicious design of the U.S. is not confined to the nuclear issue. All the U.S. campaigns against the DPRK over the \"missile issue,\" \"human rights issue\" and so on are an open manifestation of its premeditated and intentional acts to isolate and stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is nothing to be afraid of for the Korean people under the great Songun politics. This is the unshakable faith and will of the Korean People's Army and people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the United States runs about like a headless chicken, forgetful of the lesson of the past Korean war, it will drink a bitterer cup of defeat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Unite States should look straight into the realities and abandon its foolish scheme to stifle the DPRK at once.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
