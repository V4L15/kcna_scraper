Korea-Japan Military Nexus \r\n Pyongyang, August 13 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of Korea (DFRK) released a white paper on Monday dealing with the present situation and danger of the south Korea-Japan military nexus and the south Korean puppet regime's sycophancy towards Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t According to the white paper, no sooner had traitor Lee Myung Bak took office than he drastically expanded the scope of military exchange and cooperation with the Japanese reactionaries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  It said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He set up the \"working council for defense exchange and cooperation\", a permanent working military consultative organization, in January 2008 and concluded a \"protocol on defense exchange\" and decided to boost military exchange in all aspects at the talks between the defense ministers in April 2009.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He rolled up his sleeves to fake up the south Korea-Japan \"joint declaration on security\" which means a military alliance, in particular.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In January 2011 when the Japanese defense minister visited south Korea, he promised to conclude the General Security of Military Information Agreement the keynote of which is to establish military strategies and exchange information about nukes and missiles in \"contingency in the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After coming to power, Lee opted for intensifying joint military drills with the Japan \"Self-Defense Forces\", claiming that south Korea could not cope with military muscle of the nuclear capable north and China only through joint sea search and rescue trainings with Japan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In his New Year diplomatic speech and his policy speech at the ceremony for opening the plenary session of the Diet in January last year former Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan set it as Japan's main orientation of diplomatic policy to build \"future-oriented relations\" by further strengthening bilateral cooperative relations including cooperation in the security field with south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Considering Lee Myung Bak's seizure of power and his action taken to boost the military nexus with Japan as the golden opportunity, the Japanese reactionaries buckled down in real earnest to rewriting or revising the laws obstructive to the moves to militarize Japan including the \"Pacifist Constitution\" which they could not push forward. For instance, they fabricated a \"new bill for revising the Law on SDF\" and the \"bill for revising the law on the situation in the surrounding areas\" which call for expanding the radius of SDF's operation which was confined to Japan's territorial waters to the whole Asia-Pacific region. In late December last year they convened a security meeting at which they drastically eased the \"three principles of arms export,\" making it possible to jointly develop latest weapons with other countries and export weapons to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In June this year they provided a legal foundation for going nuclear by inserting words \"security guarantee\" in the \"basic law on atomic energy.\" They paved the way for pushing forward space militarization by deleting the provision that space research should be conducted for peaceful purposes from the \"basic law on space\". They are now stepping up the laying of the legal foundation for turning Japan into a \"state capable of waging a war\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  They are speeding up the restructuring of the SDF and its arms buildup in the direction of letting it carry out the duty for overseas aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The intensified military nexus between the south Korean puppet regime and the Japanese reactionaries is leading to the formation of the U.S.-Japan-south Korea triangular military alliance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Openly uttering \"he would not urge Japan to apologize for its past crimes\", Lee has held more than 20 rounds of talks with the Japanese reactionaries so far. But he has never put on the table such sensitive political and military issues as the issue of liquidating Japan's past history and the issue of militarist revival. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On the contrary, Lee vociferated about \"the diplomacy through exchange of heads of state between south Korea and Japan\" and visits of lawmakers and politicians of the two sides, bringing into bolder relief his pro-Japanese stance in all fields including politics, economy, military affairs and culture.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When Japanese Prime Minister Fukuda at a meeting with Lee in July 2008 proposed to include the description of Tok Islets as part of the territory of Japan in \"new guidelines for teaching\" social subjects for senior middle schoolers of Japan, Lee asked Fukuda to \"wait for some time.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the Japanese reactionaries formally issued a \"diplomatic blue book\" in April 2010, claiming that \"Tok Islets are part of the territory of Japan,\" Lee shut his eyes to this issue, calling for \"quiet diplomacy.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He zealously opted for tightening the tie-up with the Japanese reactionaries against the DPRK. He requested Japan to support his position urging the north to dismantle \"its nukes\" first and his policy of \"no nukes, opening and 3 000 dollars\" on several occasions including a meeting held in Japan in April 2008. He pledged to make positive cooperation with the Japanese reactionaries to see the realization of their stand that the DPRK-Japan relations can be normalized only after the DPRK's comprehensive settlement of \"nuclear and missile issues and the issue of Japanese abductees.\" He connived, shielded and backed Japan's moves to stage a comeback to Korea in return for its cooperation and support over the \"issue of north's nukes\" and the \"sanctions against it.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At talks held with China and Japan in May 2010 he implored them for \"cooperation in slapping sanctions against the north\", crying over the \"Cheonan\" warship incident.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When Japanese Prime Minister Noda paid a visit to south Korea in October 2011, Lee begged him for cooperation over the \"issue of north's nukes.\" In return for it he shut his eyes to the sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army and its moves to grab part of the territory of Korea and agreed to start the second south Korea-Japan \"joint research in the new era\" to establish \"future-oriented relations\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is only the clan of the \"Saenuri Party\" that shields, patronizes and praises Lee's pro-Japanese acts. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are the same despicable pro-U.S. and pro-Japanese lackeys as Lee and accomplices in political and military nexus with the Japanese reactionaries. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The military nexus now being tightened between the south Korean puppet forces and the Japanese reactionaries according to the U.S. strategic need is now posing the danger of a new war to the Korean Peninsula and gravely threatening the peace and security in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean nation can never allow the Korean Peninsula to turn into a theatre of competition among outsiders again and the Koreans to become their miserable victims due to the crimes of Lee Myung Bak and the clan of the \"Saenuri Party\", concluded the white paper."

The DPRK overcomes the ordeals and disasters by dint of the great unity of army and people under the banner of Songun. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Songun politics of the DPRK represents the ever-victorious treasured sword for protecting the sovereignty and dignity of the country and welfare of the people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK owes a lot to the Songun politics in the present drive for building an economic power for realizing people's wishes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It remains unchanged in its stand on the Songun politics. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., however, is kicking up mean propaganda with its face turned away from the situation of the DPRK, which is heading for the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The aim is to undercut the prestige of the DPRK dignified with Songun and build up discontent in its society and bring down Korean-style socialist system at any cost. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Forcing the DPRK to change the Songun politics is little short of forcing it to lay down arms and surrender to the U.S. It is just another version of the theory of \"regime change\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This only reveals the absurdity of the U.S. assertion that it has no hostility toward the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If there should be any policy switchover, they are the U.S. foreign and domestic policies. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hurricane \"Katrina\" that hit America in 2005 brought to light the political and moral vulnerabilities of the U.S. At that time the VOA admitted it, saying that the natural disaster highlighted the need to tackle the poverty and racism as a policy issue inside the U.S. This report is still fresh in the memory of the world people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At present the U.S. brigandish policy disregarding the sovereignty of other countries and right to existence of their people is the main cause of violation of innocent people and their deaths. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As proven by the fact, the U.S. policy is the most reactionary and unethical one that imposes all sorts of disasters upon mankind. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should feel ashamed of its own sordid policy."

            "content": "FDRP publica carta blanca sobre la alianza militar Sur de Corea-Japon\r\n Pyongyang, 13 de agosto (ACNC) -- El Comite Central del Frente Democratico para la Reunificacion de la Patria hizo publica el dia 13 la carta blanca que delata la situacion actual y peligrosidad de la confabulacion militar Sur de Corea-Japon y los crimenes vendepatrias projaponeses de la banda titere surcoreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t Segun el documento, tan pronto como tomo el poder, el traidor Lee Myung Bak amplio y fortalecio la esfera de intercambio y cooperacion militares con los reaccionarios islenos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Se fundo en enero de 2008 el \"Consejo de Trabajo para el Intercambio y la Cooperacion de Defensa Nacional\", organizacion permanente para la consulta de asuntos militares, y en el dialogo de ministros de Defensa sostenido en abril de 2009, fue firmado oficialmente el \"documento de la intencion sobre el intercambio de defensa\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Sobre todo, la banda titere surcoreana se puso activa en la invencion de la \"Declaracion Conjunta sobre la Garantia de Seguridad\" Sur de Corea-Japon que significa la alianza militar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Durante la visita al Sur de Corea del ministro japones de Defensa en enero de 2011, le prometio firmar el convenio de proteccion de informaciones militares con Japon (GSOMIA en ingles), basado en el establecimiento de la estrategia militar frente a la \"situacion de emergencia en el Norte (de Corea)\" y en el intercambio de informaciones sobre las armas nucleares y misiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ademas, dio mas acicate a los entrenamientos militares conjuntos con las \"Fuerzas de Autodefensa\" de Japon, insistiendo en que el ejercicio conjunto de busqueda y rescate en el mar con Japon no es suficiente para hacer frente al poderio militar del Norte de Corea y China que poseen armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El ex premier japones Naoto Kan, en su discurso diplomatico del Ano Nuevo hecho en enero del ano pasado, y en el otro de la politica pronunciado en la ceremonia de apertura de la sesion ordinaria de la Dieta, presento como importante direccion de la politica diplomatica de Japon ampliar mas las relaciones de cooperacion con el Sur de Corea, en particular, en la rama de seguridad, para establecer las \"relaciones con vistas al futuro\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Considerando como oportunidad de oro la toma del poder del traidor Lee apuesto por fortalecer la alianza militar con Japon, los reaccionarios japoneses enmendaron la \"constitucion pacifista\" y otros proyectos de ley que significaban escollos para la militarizacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Para el respecto, fabricaron los \"proyectos de enmienda de la nueva ley de las fuerzas de autodefensa\" y el otro \"de la ley de la situacion del contorno\", que amplian el teatro de operaciones de las \"Fuerzas de Autodefensa\", limitado al mar jurisdiccional de Japon, hasta toda la region de Asia-Pacifico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A finales de diciembre del ano pasado, convocaron la conferencia de seguridad, en que restaron el rigor de los \"3 principios de la exportacion de armas\" permitiendo asi el desarrollo conjunto de armas ultramodernas junto con los paises extranjeros y la exportacion de armas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En junio de este ano, introdujeron la frase de \"preservacion de seguridad\" en la \"ley principal de energia atomica\" para preparar la base legal de armamento nuclear y eliminaron de la \"ley principal del cosmos\" el parrafo que exigia fines pacificos de la investigacion espacial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En los ultimos dias, se promueve el establecimiento de la base legal para convertir a Japon en el \"Estado que puede hacer la guerra\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Los reaccionarios japoneses dan mas acicate a la reestructuracion y al incremento de las \"Fuerzas de Autodefensa\" para que puedan cumplir la mision de agresion a ultramar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La confabulacion entre los titeres surcoreanos y los reaccionarios japoneses se dirige a la fabricacion de la alianza militar tripartita con Estados Unidos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hablando abiertamente que \"no diria a Japon que se disculpe por sus crimenes del pasado\", el traidor Lee Myung Bak sostuvo mas de 20 veces hasta la fecha los dialogos con los reaccionarios japoneses, pero nunca se refirio a la liquidacion de la historia del pasado de Japon, el renacimiento del militarismo y otros delicados asuntos politicos y militares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Al contrario, expuso su postura servil a Japon en todos los dominios como la politica, la economia, los asuntos militares y la cultura hablando de la \"diplomacia mediante la cumbre de ida y vuelta\" y el viaje reciproco de los asambleistas y politicos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En las conversaciones con Japon en julio de 2008, cuando el entonces premier Fukuda dijo que incluiria en la \"nueva guia de estudio\" para los alumnos de escuelas secundarias el parrafo de que el islote Tok es territorio japones, Lee le respondio que \"espere\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Cuando los reaccionarios japoneses publicaron oficialmente en abril de 2010 la \"carta azul\" insistiendo lo mismo sobre el Tok, se hizo el desentendido abogando por la \"diplomacia silenciosa\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tambien el traidor Lee recurrio activamente a la confabulacion anti-RPDC con los reaccionarios japoneses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En un dialogo hecho en Japon en abril de 2008 y en otras ocasiones, mendigo el apoyo de Japon a sus demandas a la RPDC, tales como la \"renuncia nuclear primero\" y de \"la desnuclearizacion, la apertura y tres mil USD\". Y se comprometio a cooperar activamente para que se ponga en practica la posicion de los reaccionarios japoneses de normalizar las relaciones con la RPDC despues de que sean resueltos globalmente el \"problema nuclear\", el \"de misiles\" y el \"de secuestro\" de los japoneses. Tolero en silencio, amparo y hasta fomento los pasos de Japon para la reagresion a cambio de la cooperacion y respaldo en el \"problema nuclear del Norte de Corea\" y el de \"sancion anti-Norte de Corea\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En las conversaciones con China y Japon sostenidas en mayo de 2010, pidio la \"cooperacion en la sancion anti-RPDC\" cuestionando el caso de hundimiento de la corbeta surcoreana \"Cheonan\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Cuando el premier japones Noda visito al Sur de Corea en octubre de 2011, Lee le solicito la cooperacion en el \"problema nuclear del Norte\" y a su vez, hizo vista gorda de la actitud japonesa en cuanto al problema de indemnizacion por el caso de esclavitud sexual y de su intento de usurpar el islote Tok. Y acordo iniciar al segundo periodo de la \"investigacion conjunta de nueva epoca\" Sudcorea-Japon para establecer las \"relaciones con vistas al futuro\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Es solo la familia del \"Partido Saenuri\" que esta amparando y alabando el acto traidor pro-japones del Lee Myung Bak.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Los integrantes del citado partido son traidores servil proyanqui y pro-japones iguales a Lee y complices de la confabulacion politico-militar con los reaccionarios japones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La connivencia militar Sudcorea-Japon, que se acelera segun la demanda estrategica del imperio norteamericano, acarrea el peligro de nueva guerra en la Peninsula Coreana y amenaza seriamente la paz y seguridad del Noreste Asiatico y el resto del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No se debe tolerar jamas que el traidor Lee y los compinches del \"Partido Saenuri\" conviertan la Peninsula Coreana en el campo de pugna de las potencias y hagan de la nacion coreana su victima."
