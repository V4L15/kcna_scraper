            "content": "Kim Jong Un Gives Field Guidance to Construction Site of Paektusan Hero Youth Power Station Near Completion\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, September 14 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), first chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, gave field guidance to the construction site of the Paektusan Hero Youth Power Station near completion.\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Choe Ryong Hae, secretary of the WPK Central Committee, and Jo Yong Won, vice department director of the WPK Central Committee.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un shook hands with commanding officers of the shock-brigade one by one, saying that the dam project of Power Station No. 1 was completed on the occasion of August 28, the Youth Day, a fresh miracle in the worksites of Mt. Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The young people of the DPRK are very admirable as they have waged a high-pitched drive day and night for the past more than 120 days since he visited the construction site in April to create world-startling heroic myth of youth, he noted, adding that it could be created only by the young people of the DPRK educated and trained under the care of the WPK and all of them are heroes. He reposed the deepest trust in them by naming the power station the Paektusan Hero Youth Power Station.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching the monuments to the revolutionary activities of President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il before looking round the education room under construction, he stressed that the feats performed by the young people in the construction of the power station are the precious treasure to be specially recorded in the WPK's history and handed down to posterity. He named the room the Exhibition of Feats of Paektusan Heroic Young People.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round dams of stations No. 1 and 2, waterway tunnel, generator room, control room and transformer substation of station No. 2 and other places to learn about the construction in detail.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He watched the high dam of station No. 1 from various places and walked along it, saying that the dam looks majestic and splendid. When looking up to the dam, one feels as if watching the sky-high spirit of the young people in the DPRK and when feasting one's eyes on it from distance, one feels as if watching a huge unit of young people forming a human fortress and shield protecting the Party Central Committee, he stressed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whoever stands on the dam of the power station would feel poetic sentiment flash upon one's mind, he said, noting with pleasure that this represents the heroic spirit and feats of the young people of Paektu who dash ahead like the wind along the course of the Korean revolution set by the WPK in the spirit of the blizzards of Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t One cannot watch the dam and waterway tunnel of station No. 2 casually, he said, adding that one has to pay tribute to the patriotism displayed by young people in conquering nature despite biting cold.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that its generator room and control room and the transformer substation were built well, he gave an instruction to have their trial operation at an early date as equipment have been assembled and establish an integrated control system put on a high automation and IT basis so as to keep the operation of stations No. 1 and 2 on normal footing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed that the workers of various industrial establishments including the Taean Heavy Machine Complex made a lot of efforts for the construction of the power station. He extended thanks to them for performing labor feats in producing and ensuring custom-built equipment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He watched with satisfaction the transmission towers and lines stretching to Samjiyong County from the power station before looking round the dwelling houses built by soldier-builders for the people who were evacuated from the inundated area.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that there are so many monumental edifices going by the name of youth on this land, adding with pride that this proves the 70-year long history of the WPK is characterized by the history of attaching importance to youth and bringing up the young people to be heroes of the times and masters of creation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The construction of the power station eloquently proved once again that the decision of the party precisely means reality and practice and the young people of the DPRK are performing the role of vanguard in implementing the party's decisions, he noted, emphasizing their might is tremendous, indeed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the consistent strategic line of the WPK to train the young people as masters of the times and encourage them to enter the gate of the thriving nation before anyone else, he said, underscoring the need for all young people to build on this land more structures of eternal value to be handed down to posterity by carrying forward the proud tradition of young Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He called on them to wind up the project perfectly as not many days are left before the 70th birthday of the WPK and stage a grand young soldier-people chorus, a declaration of victors, there. He promised to watch it without fail and have pictures taken with them against the background of the dam of station No. 1 that day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He watched the performance \"Song of faith sung by young people in Paektu\" given by the itinerant art squad of the power station and had a photo session with its members."

PTC, Choe Ryong Hae, y el subjefe de departamento del CC del PTC, Jo Yong Won.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Mariscal apreto las manos a los miembros de mando de la brigada de construccion diciendo que en la zona del monte Paektu se ha creado un nuevo milagro por la finalizacion de la obra del dique de la Central no. 1 con motivo del 28 de agosto, Dia de la Juventud.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSon bravos nuestros jovenes que crearon un mito heroico y asombroso de la juventud mediante la incansable campana de dia y noche durante mas de 120 dias desde cuando yo recorri el campo de construccion en abril pasado, dijo y agrego que este mito lo pueden crear solo los jovenes coreanos crecidos en el regazo del Partido del Trabajo de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAfirmo que los jovenes coreanos son todos heroes y denomino la planta como la Central Hidroelectrica Juventud Heroina Paektusan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl recorrer el monumento a la historia revolucionaria de los grandes hombres del monte Paektu y la sala de educacion en construccion, subrayo que los meritos de los jovenes realizados en la construccion de esta planta constituyen patrimonios preciosos a ser transmitidos orgullosamente en la historia de nuestro partido y denomino la sala de educacion como Exposicion de Meritos de Juventud Heroina Paektusan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLuego, el Mariscal dio vueltas por los diques de las centrales no. 1 y no.2, y el tunel para el paso de agua, la sala de generadores, la de control, la subestacion de transformacion fuera del edificio, de la central no.2 y otros lugares, donde se entero en detalles de la construccion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tContemplando en varios puntos el dique de la planta no. 1 y andando sobre el dique, dijo que es tan maravilloso, majestuoso y guapo y se parece ver el impetu de los jovenes coreanos y el aspecto del contingente juvenil que forma el baluarte de defensa al Comite Central del Partido. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA uno que se encuentra sobre el dique se le iluminara espontaneamente una inspiracion poetica, destaco y dijo con alegria, como si recitara una poesia, que los jovenes del Paektu con el impetu y meritos heroicos marchan a galopes por la orbita de la revolucion coreana fijada por el PTC poniendo de pleno manifiesto el espiritu del viento cortante del Paektu. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo se puede ver con indiferencia el dique y el tunel para el paso de agua de la central no. 2, dijo y rindio gracias al patriotismo de los jovenes que desarrollaron la guerra con la naturaleza en medio del frio intenso.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAprecio que se hayan construido bien la sala de generadores, la de control y la subestacion de transformacion fuera del edificio de la planta no. 2 y subrayo la necesidad de realizar cuanto antes el manejo de prueba de acuerdo con la terminacion de ajuste de equipos y establecer el sistema de control combinado que asegure el alto nivel automatico e informatico para poder gestionar normalmente las centrales no.1 y no.2. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDio agradecimiento a los obreros del Complejo de Maquinaria Pesada de Taean y otras fabricas y empresas que realizaron meritos en la produccion de equipos pendientes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTras ver con satisfaccion las torres y lineas de transmision electrica extendidas desde la central hasta el distrito de Samjiyon, recorrio las nuevas viviendas construidas por los militares para los moradores de la zona anegada. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDijo con orgullo que muchas creaciones monumentales erguidas en esta tierra se llaman con el nombre de la juventud, lo cual significa que en la historia de 70 anos del PTC esta impregnada la trayectoria del PTC que da importancia a la juventud y forma a los jovenes como heroes de la historia y maestros de creacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa construccion de la Central Hidroelectrica Juventud Heroina Paektusan evidencio de nuevo que la decision del Partido es precisamente la realidad y la practica y que los jovenes coreanos desempenan el papel de vanguardias en materializar la decision del Partido, senalo y enfatizo que es muy potente el poderio de nuestros jovenes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSubrayo que formar a los jovenes como duenos de la epoca para que ellos pongan primero la placa en la puerta de la potencia prospera es la linea y orientacion estrategicas del Partido y exhorto a todos los jovenes a levantar mucho mas patrimonios de la patria a ser legados de generacion en generacion continuando la tradicion orgullosa de la juventud coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDijo que ya estamos en visperas del 70o aniversario de la fundacion del PTC y deben terminar perfectamente la obra y declarar la victoria en este lugar ejecutando magnificamente el gran coro juvenil del ejercito y el pueblo. Y comprometio que el mismo lo presenciara sin falta y tomara una foto de recuerdo con los constructores tomando como fondo el dique de la planta no.1.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Mariscal presencio la funcion del grupo de agitacion artistica movil de la Central Hidroelectrica Juventud Heroina Paektusan \"Cancion de conviccion de la juventud del Paektu\" y se fotografio junto con los miembros de este grupo artistico."
