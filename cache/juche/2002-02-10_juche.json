All this shows what an extent the U.S. anti-DPRK hostility has reached. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No country entertains what the U.S. says as it is. The U.S. has lost the popularity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should immediately stop telling lies to do harm to others. This behaviour is not suitable for the U.S.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is peddling the DPRK's \"threat of biological weapons\" in a bid to hide this fact. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is futile for the Japanese reactionaries to float false rumors about the DPRK and resort to tricks to conceal their true intention. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For Japan to try to launch overseas aggression is as foolish an act as jumping into the fire with fagot on its back.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
