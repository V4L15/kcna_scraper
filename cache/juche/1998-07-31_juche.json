Korean Defence Minister\r\n Pyongyang, July 31 (KCNA) -- Chon Yong Thaek, Minister of National Defence of South Korea, blared that the \"North is the sworn enemy\" till the north and the south of Korea are reunified.   Branding his utterances as an unprecedentedly serious incident, Rodong Sinmun today warns that the warmaniacs will pay dearly for this.\r\n   An analyst of the paper says:\r\n   Chon's balderdash represents the stand of the present South Korean authorities who do not regard the people in the north as fellow countrymen and proves that the puppets seek only confrontation and war against the north.\r\n   Successive South Korean rulers let loose strings of provocative remarks. But none of them officially branded the north as the \"sworn enemy\" as Chon openly did. \r\n   The South Korean  warmongers must take responsibilities for bringing the north-south relations to the worst phase by spelling out utterances seriously getting on the nerve of the north and pay dearly for this.\r\n   They must immediately apologize for uttering rash words, withdraw the utterances in question and remove warmaniac Chon Yong Thaek from his post. \r\n   By doing so, they must clearly show that they will not repeat rash acts again.    \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n"

This is an open challenge to the north, which can never be tolerated. Minju Joson says this in a commentary today.\r\n   The news analyst says:\r\n   The South Korean authorities staged a chemical-biological-radioactive field mobile training of units of the puppet army and a \"tactical communication network drill\" in downtown Seoul on July 28. This shows that they are spurring on war preparations against the north.\r\n   We demanded the South Korean authorities apologize to the nation for the remarks of the puppet \"Minister of Defence\" that the north  will remain the \"sworn enemy\" until the north and south are reunified. But they answered our demand with military exercises. \r\n   The nation will not pardon warmaniacs overheated with the desire for invasion of the north. They should stop the war racket against the north at once.    \r\n\r\n"

This is the greatest feat performed by him for the prosperity and development of the country and the victory of the socialist cause.\r\n   He has made sure above all that the ideas and guidance of the leader were thoroughly applied to the building of the government. He put forward it as the basic way to establish the monolithic ideological system and strengthen the party's leadership in applying the leader's ideas and guidance, and has consistently directed big efforts to its realisation.\r\n   Our socialist government led by him never allows any alienable idea, factional element and any attempt to emasculate and obliterate the leader's ideas and guidance. \r\n   It always maintains its tradition as the leader's revolutionary government no matter how the world may change.\r\n   General Secretary Kim Jong Il has strengthened and developed our government into an invincible one serving the people.\r\n   He has made it represent the working masses' right to independence, bring their creative ingenuity into full play, look after their life and protect their independent and creative life. He has guided the power body officials to refrain from abusing authority and indulging in bureaucracy, under the revolutionary slogan \"We served the people \".\r\n   It is thanks to his wise guidance that the DPRK government is displaying its dignity and might as a true revolutionary government which has struck roots deep among the popular masses and formed a harmonious whole with them, and  a powerful instrument of the revolution and construction carrying through the party's policies by dint of the masses' strength and wisdom.\r\n    As long as led by him, the DPRK government will  steadily strengthen and develop as the revolutionary government of President Kim Il Sung.    \r\n\r\n"
