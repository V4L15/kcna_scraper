Such assertions as denying  his existence in spite of all facts can be made only by pro-Japanese elements and traitors to the nation like \"five traitors of 1905.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean rulers are conniving  at and encouraging the campaign launched by some dishonest religious organizations against  the erection of Tangun's statue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is clear that the South Korean authorities are conspiring with such criminals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   It is the worst crime to deny the history of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe South Korean rulers are the group of worst traitors, ignorant of the nation, ethics and morality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Koreans in the north, south and overseas will surely make them pay for their treacheries generation after generation. \r\n\r\n"
