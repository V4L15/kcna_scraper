            "content": "Minju Joson Brands US as Mastermind of Nuclear Proliferation\r\nPyongyang, December 19 (KCNA) -- Germany's proposal calling for the withdrawal of the U.S. nukes from NATO member countries was supported by Netherlands, Norway, Belgium and Luxemburg in October.\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on the fact, a news analyst of Minju Joson, a leading newspaper of the DPRK, says on Sunday:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This demand growing in Europe reflects the unanimous desire of humankind for prevention of a nuclear war and shows that it is ripe in political and diplomatic aspect for Europe to raise this matter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. moves to keep nukes in European countries are a challenge to the trend of the present times toward disarmament against nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the ambition and nuclear strategy of the U.S. to put the world under its domination by holding monopoly over nukes and supremacy in strategic striking weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To attain this criminal purpose, the U.S. deployed huge nuclear armed forces in strategic vantages of the world. And it spends a large amount of money for the modernization of nuclear weapons every year and steadily poses a nuclear threat to its rivals and \"potential enemies\" while proliferating nuclear technology to its followers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This year alone, the U.S. openly designated the DPRK and other anti-imperialist and independent countries as the targets of its preemptive nuclear attack in its \"nuclear posture review.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality goes to clearly prove that the U.S. is chiefly to blame for nuclear threat and proliferation in the world. Serious nuclear arms race and increased danger of nuclear war worldwide are entirely attributable to the U.S. nuclear policy."

The 'enemy' mentioned by them means the DPRK. The Japanese warmongers' call for 'attack' is just a slogan for staging a comeback to Korea and a prelude to a war.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"This is well evidenced by the fact that they have been getting hell-bent on the anti-DPRK campaign as soon as an unexpected incident occurred on the Korean Peninsula.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"The Japanese militarist forces go reckless in a bid to realize their ambition for reinvasion on a war chariot of their American master under the pretext of 'military cooperation.' The involvement of the mobile strike forces of the 'Self-Defense Forces' in the naval joint exercises of the U.S. and south Korea shows how hard they have worked to round off the preparations for reinvasion of Korea this year.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"The Japanese militarist forces' scheme for reinvasion is put into practice, going beyond the danger line. The existence of a dangerous war state in the vicinity of Korea itself is a serious threat to the DPRK.\""
