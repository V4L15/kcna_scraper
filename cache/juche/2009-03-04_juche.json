He appreciated the efforts made by the members of the shock brigade, noting that they designed the house well to the convenience of visitors' living and ensured the best quality of the construction in the spirit of devoted service to the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is necessary to ensure the highest level in construction as required by the new century when building even a single house, he said, stressing that all the structures should be built to meet the need of the era of the WPK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then, he commanded a bird's-eye view of the bank of Lake Samji. The area of the lake has not only turned into a huge outdoor museum but its appearance has changed into an excellent and beautiful cultural recreation ground, he noted, adding that today witnessed the realization of the desire expressed by the President to see a modern rest house for people built there after the liberation of the country when he reached the bank of the lake during the anti-Japanese armed struggle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After going round the newly built structures, he advanced the important tasks to be fulfilled to carry out the construction in the revolutionary battle sites.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He highly appreciated the shining successes made by all the members of the shock brigade, noting that they have successfully spruced up the area of Lake Samji, a holy land of revolution, and performed astonishing miracles and exploits in the construction projects for the prosperity and development of the country including the construction of the power station and roads by displaying intense loyalty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed that the exceptionally strong enthusiasm displayed by the members of the shock brigade in the construction in the revolutionary battle sites is a manifestation of the Korean people's unshakable will to eternally add shine to the glorious revolutionary traditions, a permanent cornerstone of the Korean revolution, and accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche that started in Mt. Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that the area of Lake Samji is a holy land of revolution where sites of the President's revolutionary activities during the anti-Japanese armed struggle are concentrated and an important center for the education in the revolutionary traditions, he stressed that to spruce up the battle sites well is a sacred work for firmly defending the revolutionary traditions, an eternal treasure of the revolution, and carrying forward and developing them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the unshakable will and determination of our Party to always defend, carry forward and develop the revolutionary traditions established by the President during the protracted anti-Japanese armed struggle and accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche on the basis of these great traditions, he said, emphasizing that these shining revolutionary traditions serve as the basic source of the great mental power of the indomitable Korean people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underlined the need to provide better lodging houses and cultural and welfare facilities to the visitors as a large number of them are coming to the lake every year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed that it is necessary to design well structures and construct all of them to suit the topographical features of the revolutionary battle sites in order to build them in a peculiar style.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed great expectation and conviction that the members of the 618 Shock Brigade would creditably perform their honorable duty in the future, too, and thus perform shining feats in the construction in the revolutionary battle sites.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Kim Ki Nam, secretary of the C.C., the WPK, Kim Kyong Ho, chief secretary of the Ryanggang Provincial Committee of the WPK, Ri Je Gang and Ri Jae Il, first vice department directors of the C.C., the WPK, and Generals of the Korean People's Army Hyon Chol Hae and Ri Myong Su."

They are very provocative saber-rattling simulating attacks on all parts of the DPRK through coordinated operations with the puppet army after rapidly hurling U.S. reinforcements to the Korean front from overseas in case of \"contingency.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The warmongers seek to mislead public opinion at home and abroad, raving that the exercises assume no provocative nature and they are aimed at defense. But with nothing can they cover up their aggressive nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Looking back on history, all the joint military exercises staged by warmongers at home and abroad under various codenames were without exception aimed at launching a nuclear war. They escalated military confrontation and tension on the Korean Peninsula to the extreme pitch and gravely threatened the peace and stability of the country. The projected war maneuvers assume more provocative and dangerous nature as the north-south relations were brought to the phase of total collapse and the situation on the peninsula has become so acute that a war may break out any moment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sinister plan for the reckless war exercises targeted against the DPRK announced by the warmongers at home and abroad defying the serious concern and strong opposition of the public at home and abroad proved that they are not interested in the detente and peace on the Korean Peninsula and the normalization of the inter-Korean relations at all but only seek to realize their wild ambition for a war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak group of traitors should never forget that the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK are keeping themselves fully ready for all-out confrontation with the highest degree of vigilance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Should the group finally perpetrate military provocations defying the repeated warnings of the DPRK, it will never be able to escape the fate of a forlorn wandering spirit in face of its merciless counterstrike."

It also has the single-minded unity of the leader, the party and the masses more powerful than a nuclear weapon. And it has powerful military deterrent, capacity for self-defence strong enough to shatter any attempt of the imperialist reactionaries for aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  A trait of attaching importance to the military affairs has been firmly established throughout the society and all the people are under arms and the whole country has turned into a fortress.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has neither guessed the inexhaustible mental power and strength of the army and people of the DPRK nor can it do so.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They value peace and do not want a war.
