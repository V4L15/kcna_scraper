It is quite natural, therefore, that they cannot accept them. The U.S. sacrifices those countries for its \"war on terrorism\", taking issue with their exercises of sovereign rights. This is unlawful high-handed practices and brigandish state-sponsored terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. \"war on terrorism\" is a major stumbling block lying in the way of the peaceful progress in the new century. The U.S. imperialists' aggressive escalation of \"war on terrorism\" prompts the formation of new structure of forces, fierce competition of strength among big powers and many countries are embroiled in it directly or indirectly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Anyone can fall victim to the U.S. \"war on terrorism\" unless one heightens vigilance against it, the article warns, stressing that this is a lesson the world has drawn from the U.S. \"war on terrorism.\"    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
