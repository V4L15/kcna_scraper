The IS is the chief architect which fabricated such heinous case as \"bringing down statues\", hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDuring the period when Won Se Hun took the post of the director of the IS, the subversive activities and sabotage against the DPRK such as spying case have reached an extreme phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe above-said case of political intervention brought into bolder relief the true colors of the IS as a den of political intrigues and politically-motivated terrorism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe IS ill-famed for all evils should be disbanded at once and Won Se Hun, mastermind of intrigues, be tried together with traitor Lee Myung Bak.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean people should wipe out the IS, a tool of the fascist rule and citadel of confrontation with fellow countrymen, and wage a more dynamic struggle to realize democratization of south Korean society."

Korean Authorities' Confrontation Racket\r\nPyongyang, March 24 (KCNA) -- The south Korean puppet navy set March 26 as \"day of punishment\", three years after the Cheonan warship sinking case. It hung such provocative slogans as \"Let's hold off enemy's provocation! Let us defend our sea!\", instilling consciousness of confrontation with fellow countrymen into its soldiers. It now speaks loudly of holding \"a meeting to pledge maritime defence\" at each unit and staging a naval mobile drill by its 2nd Fleet in the West Sea on March 26, in particular.\n\t\t\t\t\tMinju Joson Sunday in a bylined commentary says that the puppet forces' confrontation racket against the DPRK is the product of their crafty ploy to cover up the truth behind the Cheonan case and shift the blame onto the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs already disclosed, the case is the hideous anti-DPRK smear campaign fabricated by the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors in league with its American master, the commentary notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee regime met stern punishment of the public for its crimes of confrontation with compatriots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNevertheless, the puppet authorities are reviving the hideous farce engineered by the Lee regime. After the emergence of the new regime, large-scale nuclear war exercises against the DPRK are being staged in south Korea. The situation reached such phase where U.S. nuclear submarines and B-52 are involved in nuclear bombing drills in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe puppet forces will be held fully accountable for the extreme situation on the Korean Peninsula to be entailed by their \"punishment\" racket over the warship case."

utilizar bien los libros para que ellos lean muchos libros.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl preguntar uno tras otro sobre el contenido de la leccion y la capacidad de los profesores, instruyo hacer bien la labor docente conforme a la psicologia y la propiedad de los combatientes y dispenso gran benevolencia a las Universidades Politicas O Jung Hup de la gran unidad combinada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Mariscal recorrio la sala de educacion, dormitorio, cocina y otras instalaciones de cultura, educacion e intendencia de la compania heroina Kim Sun Son adscrita al batallon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la sala de educacion, el dijo que hay que oirse siempre las voces del partido en la compania, celula y unidad principal de combate del EPC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSenalando que el dejo a los soldados a los oficiales, subrayo que esta muy contento cuando se encuentra con los oficiales que cuidan bien a los soldados a quienes cuida y ama el partido y se siente digno de la inspeccion a la unidad cuando los uniformados viven bien.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Mariscal dirigio los ejercicios de los militares del batallon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tViendo los ejercicios de los militares, se mostro muy satisfecho de que ellos se hayan preparado bien tanto en lo tecnico-militar como en lo fisico, evaluo altamente el exito de su entrenamiento y presento las tareas programaticas que sirven de guia para fortalecer por todos los medios la combatividad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl mismo dia, el Mariscal organizo de modo inesperado y dirigio los ejercicios de tiro de pistola y fusil automatico de los comandantes del batallon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos combatientes deben preparar en lo politico y ideologico, en lo militar y tecnico y en lo fisico y tener el arte de tiro infalible, dijo y enseno la maestria de tiro.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInstruyo a los Estudios de Filmes Cientificos y Documentales Militares del EPC a fabricar videos de diversos metodos de tiro y enviarlos a todo el ejercito para que se unifique el propio metodo de tiro de combate.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLe acompanaron Choe Ryong Hae, Hyon Yong Chol, Kim Kyok Sik, Hwang Pyong So y Son Chol Ju."
