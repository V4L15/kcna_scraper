            "content": "Letter to UN Secretary General \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 27 (KCNA) -- Colonel General Ri Chan Bok, representative of the Panmunjom Mission of the Korean People's Army, on July 26 sent a letter to Kofi Annan, secretary general of the United Nations, as regards the touch-and-go situation prevailing on the Korean peninsula due to the U.S. massive arms build-up in south Korea.\r\n Recalling that the KPA side on July 1 last year declared that if the U.S. bolster of the combat power of its forces in south Korea starts as planned, the letter dated July 22 will regard it as the U.S. total denial of the Armistice Agreement (AA) and take a resolute step to defend the security and sovereignty of the DPRK, the letter said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S., challenging this, is going to drastically increase 11 billion U.S. dollars originally envisaged to spend for the implementation of its \"plan for bolstering combat power\" to 13 billion U.S. dollars. And it massively introduced into south Korea Striker armored cars, Shadow 200 unmanned tactical reconnaissance planes, F-117 Stealth fighter bombers, M1-Abrams tanks, Patriot PAC-3 system and other latest weapons and operation equipment in less one year after the announcement of the plan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On June 29 the U.S. Defense Department announced that three squadrons of F-117 Stealth fighter bombers of the U.S. Air Force would be deployed in the Kunsan Air Force Base of south Korea within three months and it has already begun their deployment. Earlier, the U.S. officially announced that it would keep two Aegis destroyers equipped with an ultra-modern missile system in the East Sea of Korea on a permanent basis and deploy two battalions of uptodate Patriot missiles in south Korea within this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is more serious is that the U.S. has already completed the development of new type missiles capable of destroying underground facilities of the DPRK and these missiles to be massproduced will be immediately supplied to the U.S. forces in south Korea before any others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such massive arms buildup of the U.S. prompted the KPA side to judge that the U.S. preparations for a preemptive attack on the DPRK have reached their height. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seams to have forgotten that the AA is nothing but a temporary step to guarantee the provisional ceasefire between the warring parties and both the DPRK and the U.S. are still at war technically. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A preemptive attack in such relations of belligerency as those between the two countries cannot be a monopoly of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the common military knowledge that a resolute and decisive, preemptive attack on the enemy at the crucial moment the enemy's attempt at attack has been judged is a form of effective defence to smash the enemy's attempt to attack and protect the security of the country from the enemy's aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA side informs Your Excellency that it solemnly declares once again that it cannot remain a passive onlooker to the frantic arms buildup made by the U.S. behind the scene of the six-party talks whiling away the time with empty words on the plea of settling the nuclear issue and it will never remain with folded arms till the U.S. side has completed its preparations for attack, occupied the starting position and launched a preemptive attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the unshakable stand of the army of the DPRK toward a war and enemy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is our view that a war in Korea is almost unavoidable as long as the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK goes on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In case another Korean war breaks out the army and people of the DPRK will fight with deep-rooted rancor and resentment against the U.S. which has pursued the extremely hostile policy toward the DPRK. It will be a fierce decisive war unprecedented in the world which may cause horrible destruction and terrible sacrifices beyond human imagination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK have long been ready for this and have never stopped even a moment the preparations to cope with this despite indescribable ordeals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We are well aware that we cannot protect our faith and future without such readiness and preparations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a stark fact recognized by the world that the constant danger of war prevailing on the Korean peninsula is attributable to the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK and the presence of the U.S. forces in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The danger of war can neither be removed from Korea nor can peace and security in this region be expected unless the more than half a century-long presence of those forces in south Korea is terminated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United Nations is also responsible for the misfortune and sufferings the Korean people have undergone, we think. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the last three-year Korean war the U.S. committed shuddering atrocities against the Koreans under the UN flag and it is again under the same flag that the U.S. has pursued a hostile policy toward the DPRK and kept south Korea under its occupation for the last more than half a century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was impossible to implement paragraph 60 of the AA which envisages a peaceful solution to the Korean issue and the withdrawal of all foreign forces from the country because the UN adopted a resolution on blocking the implementation of the paragraph at the instigation of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is painful to think that the UN has not yet implemented the resolution on dismantling the \"UN command\" and withdrawing the U.S. troops from south Korea although it had adopted it 29 years ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these facts left the world people skeptical about the raison d'etre of the UN and its biased act of meeting the interests of a big country at the sacrifice of small countries hurt its own dignity, I think. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the UN admits itself that it was a signatory to the AA it is obliged to implement paragraph 60 of the AA true to its commitment under the document it signed and thus give a peaceful solution to the Korean issue and settle the issue of withdrawing all foreign forces from Korea as early as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The UN, however, asserts that its name was only abused by the U.S. and a de facto signatory to the AA was the U.S. The UN is, therefore, urged to take a practical measure to disband the \"UN command\" organized by the U.S. Only then is it possible to prevent the U.S. from abusing the sacred name of the UN any longer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This would fall in full accord with UN resolution 3390B dated November 18, 1975. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is my hope that the UN with a noble peace-keeping mission will stop the arrogant U.S. high-handed and arbitrary practices and implement paragraph 60 of the AA and the resolution adopted at the 30th UN General Assembly on withdrawing the U.S. troops from south Korea and thus make a positive contribution to putting the earliest possible end to the U.S. troops' occupation of south Korea and promoting peace and security in Korea and the rest of the world.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The United States is talking about \"improvement of human rights\", \"freedom\", \"democracy\" and \"promotion of development of market economy\" and \"investment\" to do so. This is aimed to politicize and internationalize the non-existent \"human rights issue\" in the DPRK and thus tarnish the dignified international authority and image of the DPRK at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. regards the nuclear issue and the \"human rights issue\" as two levers in executing its policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK. It is working hard to \"change the system\" in the DPRK under the pretext of \"human rights issue.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the bill the U.S. raised the \"offer of information about abduction issue\", \"transparency of humanitarian aid\", \"freedom of religion\", etc. as preconditions for \"humanitarian aid\" to the DPRK. This is also part of the pre-arranged preparations to destroy the DPRK's system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts suffice to prove that the U.S. has neither intention to renounce its hostile policy toward the DPRK nor slightest willingness to co-exist with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the U.S. makes ceaseless political provocations against the DPRK with such bitter antipathy and hostility toward its political system, the DPRK is compelled to ponder over whether there is any need to continue dialogue with the U.S. for the settlement of the nuclear issue at the moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality reinforces our conviction that it is the only way of protecting the sovereignty of the country and defending socialism which guarantees our life to increase its physical deterrent force for self-defence to cope with the U.S. evermore undisguised hostile policy toward it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK can never overlook the U.S. act of seriously hurting the dignity of the DPRK, a sovereignty state, and interfering in its internal affairs under the pretext of the fictitious \"human rights issue\" in the wake of its foolish talk about applying the same method to the solution of the nuclear issue as done in Libya. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean-style man-centered socialist system will remain undeterred by any U.S. groundless accusations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to stop its rash acts, pondering over the grave consequences to be entailed by its extremely hostile moves to isolate the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It should be repealed without delay as it has lost the justification to remain in force any longer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The SL is a leverage faked up by the conservative forces in the Cold War era to justify the power's violence in the past and it should be totally abolished as it diametrically challenges the present era when inter-Korean exchange and cooperation are going on. This is the main reason why the calls for repealing the SL are being made by the political camp of south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n More than 70 percent of the national assemblymen from the GNP are calling for the revision and cancellation of the SL. It is only a handful of die-hard anti-reunification elements standing for confrontation, a group of traitors of the GNP such as Kim Yong Gap who absolutize the SL. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP talked about making a \"switchover in its policy toward the north\" after its defeat in the last \"National Assembly election\" but is still desperate in its moves to incite the inter-Korean confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The south Korean people should foil the last-ditch efforts of the remnants of history and wage a more dynamic struggle to bury the anti-national Security Law for good in the same unity as they displayed in the \"National Assembly election.\"    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
