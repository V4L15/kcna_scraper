He was pleased to learn that the graduates from computer genius classes of various schools have grown to be young technicians performing an important role in the field of information industry and said that this proud reality eloquently proves the validity and vitality of the measure taken by the WPK to strengthen the work for training computer geniuses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe stressed the need to work out a correct plan for developing IT and continue to retain a firm grip on it as the most important affair of the state in order to put all fields of the national economy on an IT basis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that what is essential for developing programs is to develop programs of Korean style, he indicated the orientation and ways to do so.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn order to accelerate the IT development, it is important to give precedence to the scientific researches, he said, adding that to this end it is necessary to expand the ranks of scientists and technicians in the field of information industry and rapidly raise their level and strengthen the training of persons of talent in the field of IT, in particular.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Jagang Provincial E-Business Institute having a solid material foundation and technical forces has a very bright prospect of development, he noted, calling on all the employees to make strenuous efforts to turn the institute into a steadily prospering enterprise.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The next leg of his guidance was the Jagang Provincial Library.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter going round the room devoted to the history of the library, he dropped in at the newly built Menu Search Room, the Computer-Aided Lecture Hall, the e-reading room and other places to acquaint himself with the equipment and operation there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLibraries have very important duties and role to play in carrying out the technical and cultural revolutions, he noted, setting forth tasks to be fulfilled to use them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDynamic progress made in the cultural revolution has resulted in rapidly raising the cultural standard of the working people to a higher level and increasing their cultural need as the days go by, he said, underscoring the need for the library to have enough books and information of various kinds to provide working people and school youth and children with the information required by them in good time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Reading information through a computer network is not only economical but an effective method of enabling a lot of people to read anything in any place, he noted, underscoring the need to expand the computer network even to counties and ris under a long-term plan in the future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe then moved on to the Kanggye Koryo Medicine Factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe went round the interior of the modernized factory to learn in detail about the production there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe highly appreciated the work style with which the officials and workers and technicians of the factory have made devoted efforts to implement the Party policy, noting that they have successfully realized the process of producing extracted, germ-and dust-free Koryo medicine on a scientific basis and significantly improved the quality of medicine.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNoting that medicine, one of basic means for treatment and preventive work, provides an important material basis for giving full play to the true advantages of the socialist public health system in the country, he called for exerting great efforts for the production of medicine so that the people may fully benefit from it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe said that it is very important for promoting the health of the people to develop Koryo medicine as it is good drug which has been widely used in Korea since long ago.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe expressed conviction that they would perform uninterrupted miracles and feats in the production of medicine, aware that they are the health workers standing at the honorable post for protecting the people's lives and promoting their health.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe was accompanied by Pak To Chun, chief secretary of the Jagang Provincial Committee of the WPK, Jang Song Thaek, department director of the C.C., WPK, Ju Kyu Chang, first vice department director of the same, and KPA Generals Hyon Chol Hae and Ri Myong Su."

            "content": "Dynamic Drive for Building Economic Power Called for\r\n Pyongyang, December 16 (KCNA) -- Dynamic progress in the economic construction would help ensure political independence of the country, lay a solid material foundation for increasing national defence capacity and provide people with better conditions for a highly civilized material and cultural life, says Rodong Sinmun Tuesday in a signed article.\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has demonstrated before the world its might as a political and ideological power as well as a military power despite the complicated situation and trials. This would have been unthinkable without the wise guidance of the Workers' Party of Korea which has always directed big efforts to the economic construction, the article notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To dynamically push forward the drive to build an economic power is an important work to reinforce the faith of all the people that the Korean-style socialist system is best, and it provides a material guarantee for increasing the defence capacity of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Political independence is the life and soul of the independent and sovereign country and this is firmly guaranteed by self-supporting economy. Political independence not backed by self-supporting economy would be no more than an empty talk.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Only when the people dynamically step up the drive to build an economic power in the general advance for the Songun revolution, is it possible to consolidate the material and economic foundation of Korean-style socialism. Only then the DPRK would demonstrate more strikingly its dignity as a socialist state strong in Juche character.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The WPK advanced policies for drastically improving the standard of the people's living and has wisely led the struggle to implement them, invariably enforcing socialist policies despite difficulties just as it did for the past more than decade.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The people's support and trust in the DPRK government have become undisputed as it has looked after their destiny in a responsible manner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the DPRK consolidates its economic foundation through a dynamic drive for building an economic power, it will turn into an invulnerable fortress in the true sense of the word, concludes the article."
