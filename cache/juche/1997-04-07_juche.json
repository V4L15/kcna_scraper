On top of it, some Japanese government officials and dietmen insulted \"Comfort Women for the Japanese Army\", alleging that they voluntarily engaged themselves in prostitution for the sake of money.\r\n   Commenting on this fact, a news analyst of Rodong Sinmun today says:\r\n   Foolishly enough, the Japanese authorities are trying to justify the past crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists.\r\n   This is because they seek to create an ideological and spiritual atmosphere needed for realising their wild design for overseas expansion by instilling militarism into the minds of the people and evade atoning for the past.\r\n   In the final analysis, the danger of the Japanese authorities' attempt to justify their past is that they intend to repeat the criminal past.\r\n   Japan must not follow militarism. The way for it to follow is to win confidence from the world by sincerely admitting, repenting of and making an adequate compensation for its past crimes instead of endeavouring to justify them.\r\n   The Japanese authorities must clearly know that to liquidate their past is an urgent task which must be carried through without delay today when the 21st century is in sight. \r\n\r\n"
