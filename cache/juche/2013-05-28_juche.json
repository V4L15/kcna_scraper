            "content": "Rodong Sinmun condena la negativa de politicos japoneses al expediente criminal\r\nPyongyang, 28 de mayo (ACNC) -- Hace poco, el jefe del Consejo de Investigacion Politica del Partido Democratico Liberal de Japon, Takaichi, manifesto publicamente su posicion de negar la historia criminal del imperialismo japones, diciendo que no puede dar consentimiento a la \"Declaracion de Murayama\" que pide perdon por el colonialismo y las agresiones del siglo pasado. \n\t\t\t\t\tEl co-representante del Partido de Restauracion y alcalde de Osaka, Hashimoto, tambien nego el crimen de esclavitud sexual impuesta para el viejo ejercito japones. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl otro co-representante Ishihara y el secretario general del mismo partido, Matsui, y otros trataron de dar razon al disparate de Hashimoto insistiendo en la necesidad de esclavitud sexual en aquel entonces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl diario Rodong Sinmun, en un comentario individual de este martes, senala que en estos dias, se escucha mas que nunca el paquete de disparates de las fuerzas gobernantes japonesas que niegan la historia, y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora el circulo politico de Japon va por la senda ultraderechista y militarista. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos politiqueros japoneses tanto del partido en el poder como de los partidos de oposicion no pierden ninguna oportunidad para negar el expediente criminal del pasado y abogan por enmendar la constitucion y convertir a Japon en potencia militar. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa negacion de la historia criminal de agresiones es una expresion del intento de repetirla al resucitar el fantasma del militarismo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, eso es una tonteria igual a meterse en el fuego con gasolina.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapon no tiene otro remedio que reconocer su historia criminal, pedir disculpas e indemnizar por el respecto."
