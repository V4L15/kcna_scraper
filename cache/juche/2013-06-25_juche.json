It shows that the U.S. set a Korean war as its national policy and started it by occupying south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn fact, the U.S. occupied the southern half of Korea militarily in September 1945, a prelude to the Korean war, and since then it had stepped up war preparations for occupying its northern half. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt proclaimed military rule in south Korea, cobbled together puppet armed forces and expanded them stage by stage with a view to a 10 to 1 superiority over the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt dispatched a Military Advisory Group to give south Korean troops American-style military education and training, provided military aid to the tune of one billion U.S. dollars, huge weaponry and munitions and, further, seized the command over the south Korean puppet army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOn October 17, 1949, Syngman Rhee said the south Korean army was registering success in military training and, therefore, it was able to occupy Pyongyang in three days.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAlongside this, the U.S. set up the Far East Command that would play the leading role in the Korean war and stepped up the plan for igniting the war. It also instigated the south Korean puppet army to commit armed provocations against the DPRK in the areas along the 38th parallel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJust before the start of the war the U.S. presidential envoy Dulles inspected the area south of the 38th parallel and told south Korean puppets: Attack north Korea along with the counter-propaganda that north Korea invaded south Korea first. If you hold out only for two weeks, the United States will complain that north Korea attacked south Korea, and see to it that the United Nations can mobilize ground, naval and air forces under its name.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs planned and according to the gangster-like aggression policy of the U.S., the war against the DPRK was started on June 25, 1950."
