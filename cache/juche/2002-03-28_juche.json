            "content": "U.S. \"anti-terrorism war\" denounced \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 28 (KCNA) -- The U.S. is keen to massively escalate the \"anti-terrorism war\" to bring dark clouds of a new cold war to hang over the world.\r\n \"We have entered the second phase of the anti-terrorism war\", said U.S. President Bush on March 11. In his \"state of the union address\" he singled out North Korea, Iran and Iraq as members of \"the axis of evil\" and declared a self-righteous, unilateral and all-out \"anti-terrorism war\" by asserting that \"The United States regards the world as a battlefield.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is little short of the United States' open declaration of a war against the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. \"anti-terrorism war\" is, in essence, aimed to carry out its strategy for world domination as it is designed to dominate by force those sovereign countries advancing independently defying high-handed practices of the U.S., contain and bring under its control other big powers, its rivals, and make the whole world move under its baton. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. undisguised attempt to invade the DPRK is not related to the issue of any weapons or \"terrorism\" but a revelation of its wild design to seize the whole Korean peninsula, a strategic vantage in the Asia-Pacific region, in a bid to put it under its political and military domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That was why Bush listed the DPRK as its \"principal enemy\" right after his assumption of office and undisguisedly disclosed his attempt to attack the DPRK, escalating the \"anti-terrorism war\" worldwide with the \"September 11 incident\" as a good opportunity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"Afghan War\" which the U.S. describes as \"victorious\" is, in fact, a \"test war\", a \"preliminary war\" to strike the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has already decided to mobilize at least 690,000 aggression troops, over 160 warships of various types including aircraft carriers and at least 1,600 fighters including F-18 fighter bombers in case of emergency on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was against this backdrop that the bush administration recently drew up an emergency plan for the use of nuclear weapons against at least seven countries including the DPRK, Russia and china and issued an order to manufacture smaller nuclear weapons necessary to implement the plan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. listing of Russia and China as targets of its nuclear war scenario suggests that its \"anti-terrorism war\" is also targeted against other big powers and it is a product of the U.S. aggressive foreign policy to dominate the whole world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Precisely for this reason the bush administration is putting spurs to the arms build-up after submitting to the congress its defense budget for the fiscal 2003 envisaging military spending to the tune of 379 billion U.S. dollars, the largest in 20 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is working hard to escalate the \"anti-terrorism war\" worldwide under the pretext of \"destroying\" the \"Al-Qaida\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. \"anti-terrorism war\" is a war of injustice as it grossly violates the principles of respect for state sovereignty and non-interference in other's internal affairs, the supreme principle governing the international relations, and an inhuman criminal act of seriously breaching the principle of territorial integrity and the principle of banning the threat by force of arms and the use of armed forces, a cornerstone for ensuring international peace and stability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. \"anti-terrorism war\" is bound to go bankrupt and leave an indelible blot in the world history of war in face of the strong anti-war, anti-U.S. trend of the times.    \r\n\r\n"
