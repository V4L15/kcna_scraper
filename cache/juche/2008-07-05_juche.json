The fulfillment of the commitments by all participating parties including the U.S. should be verified without exception. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when all the participating countries accurately wind up the fulfillment of their commitments, is it possible to see the full implementation of the October 3 agreement and only then can the discussion of the issues at the next phase make smooth progress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the basic requirement of the principle of \"action for action\" and the consistent stand of the DPRK. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

And he saw to it that the three principles were announced at home and abroad as the reunification programme on July 4 that year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principles reflect his noble idea, policy and leadership feats for national reunification.

This was a fruition of the great leadership of the President who gave first consideration to the sovereignty and dignity of the country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe army and people of the DPRK defeated the U.S. imperialists and won a shining victory in the three-year-long Fatherland Liberation War (June 25, 1950 - July 27, 1953) under the leadership of the President, thus demonstrating the heroic spirit and might of the nation all over the world. After the war they have displayed the national power to the full by winning one victory after another in the confrontation without a gun report with the enemies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nUnder the leadership of the President, the nation's sovereignty and dignity were elevated further still through the socialist revolution and socialist construction after the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe Korean nation, which had found itself in an unfortunate lot of a weak nation, is now proudly exercising its sovereignty in the international arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBy acclaiming the peerlessly great man produced by the 20th century as the sun of the nation, the Korean nation has grown to be a mighty one capable of defending the freedom and independence of the country from any formidable enemy and achieving the prosperity of Juche-based socialist Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe high dignity and pride of the Korean nation provided by President Kim Il Sung are shining ever brighter in the new century following the last century under the leadership of Kim Jong Il, another greatly peerless man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Trabajo de Corea y Presidente del Comite de Defensa Nacional de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea, dirigio sobre el terreno varias unidades de la ciudad de Kanggye. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El Dirigente recorrio la Oficina de Correos de Kanggye convertida en Lugar Historico de la Revolucion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El 20 de marzo de 1923, cuando emprendia a su tierna edad de 11 anos el camino de mil ri (400 kilometros) para el estudio desde Badaogou de China hasta Mangyongdae de Corea, en ese lugar muy significativo, el Presidente Kim Il Sung mando a sus padres en Badaogou el telegrama de \"Llegue sin novedad a Kanggye\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Escuchando explicaciones de la guia, recorrio los edificios y objetos historicos conservados en su aspecto original. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Acto seguido, estuvo en el Instituto de Silvicultura y el vivero experimental de la Empresa del Bosque Industrial, de la provincia de Jagang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Al recorrer el exterior y el interior del instituto y el vivero, incluyendo la arboleda, la sala del cultivo de tejidos y el vivero experimental, se entero en detalles de la investigacion cientifica y el cultivo de las posturas de arboles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Evaluo altamente los meritos de los cientificos, tecnicos y obreros del instituto y el vivero, quienes hicieron un gran aporte a la prosperidad y al desarrollo del pais, diciendo que ellos solucionaron por cuenta propia los problemas cientificos y tecnicos dedicando toda su inteligencia y pasion, de modo que fueran cultivados muchos arboles de rapido crecimiento convenientes al clima y condiciones naturales de la provincia de Jagang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Subrayo que la repoblacion forestal tiene mucha importancia para ampliar los recursos forestales del pais y hacer hermoso el territorio nacional y presento las tareas que se presentan ante el instituto y el vivero experimental. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El desarrollo de la silvicultura deviene un trabajo importantisimo para la provincia de Jagang donde abundan montanas, dijo y continuo que deben utilizarlas de manera universal y eficiente para solucionar el problema de los productos forestales necesarios a la produccion y la construccion apoyandose en los recursos forestales locales. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En la Fabrica de Alimentos de Kanggye, el Dirigente escucho la historia del desarrollo de esta planta en la sala de presentacion del historial. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Luego, recorrio los procesos productivos cerciorandose detalladamente de las condiciones de equipos tecnicos y del estado de produccion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Viendo diversos alimentos sabrosos de alto valor nutritivo que se producen en cadena, evaluo altamente los meritos de los funcionarios y obreros de la ciudad de Kanggye destacando que estos modernizaron la Fabrica de Alimentos Basicos y construyeron esta excelente Fabrica de Alimentos digna de enorgullecerse, cuyos procesos productivos fueron preparados satisfaciendo los requisitos cientifico-tecnicos. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Enfatizo que si realizan con coherencia la renovacion tecnica, establecen estrictas medidas de abastecimiento de materias primas y administran la planta de modo rentable como esta fabrica, podran mejorar con rapidez la vida alimentaria del pueblo.\r\n  Senalo que la Fabrica de Alimentos de Kanggye debe acondicionarse mejor como planta ejemplar y normalizar en alto nivel la produccion para contribuir en gran medida a la vida de los ciudadanos e indico las tareas de la fabrica. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En la Fabrica de Confeccion de Ropas Unha de Kanggye, el Dirigente subrayo que el problema del vestido es una de las importantes labores para solucionar los problemas del vestido, la comida y la vivienda y expreso la esperanza y conviccion de que los obreros de la fabrica avivaran mas las llamas de revolucion en la industria ligera para lograr un gran viraje en la produccion de los articulos de consumo popular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Acto seguido, dirigio sobre el terreno el Restaurante de la Sopa de Visceras de Gallina de Kanggye. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Gracias a la produccion de mucha carne, huevos y productos lacteos en las bases ganaderas como granjas avicolas, de patos y cabras construidas en la ciudad de Kanggye, se logro un cambio trascendental en la vida alimentaria de los ciudadanos, dijo y bendijo la feliz vida de los habitantes de la provincia de Jagang que se hace cada dia mas acomodada. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Diviso el panorama de la ciudad de Kanggye desde el mirador del restaurante recordando los inolvidables dias de la \"marcha penosa\" y la forzada. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Subrayo que en aquel periodo tan severo cuando la patria atravesaba las pruebas mas arduas debido a las maniobras de aislamiento y aplastamiento de los imperialistas, los habitantes de esta provincia desarrollaron una lucha de vida o muerte levantandose como furiosos oleajes con la bandera roja de la revolucion en alto y convirtieron con sus propias fuerzas todas las ciudades y aldeas en el paraiso de la felicidad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Apunto que la provincia de Jagang, donde se probo en la practica la justeza de nuestra idea, nuestro regimen y nuestra causa, sirve de faro de esperanza que llama energicamente a nuestro pueblo al futuro mas maravilloso. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Los habitantes de esta provincia, creadores del espiritu de Kanggye y forjadores valientes de la nueva epoca, crean hoy tambien de dia en dia con aquel espiritu e impetu los prodigios y las proezas que sorprenden a todo el mundo, menciono y subrayo que esto deviene la orgullosa demostracion de la inagotable fuerza espiritual del pueblo coreano unido monoliticamente en torno al partido. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El Dirigente expreso la esperanza y conviccion de que los funcionarios, los militantes del partido y los trabajadores de la ciudad de Kanggye y otras partes de la provincia de Jagang seguiran cumpliendo excelentemente el rol de vanguardias en la ofensiva general por la construccion de una gran potencia prospera desplegando mas altamente el espiritu de Kanggye.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nLe acompanaron Pak To Chun, secretario responsable del Comite del PTC en la Provincia de Jagang, Kim Ki Nam y Pak Nam Gi, secretario y jefe de departamento del CC del PTC, respectivamente.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
