This is little short of infringing upon their sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Countries, though small, should become increasingly assertive in their views and determination and put them into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is important to apply whatever good and advanced to one's country in conformity with its specific conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is by no means contrary to the independent stand to introduce something new and advanced in keeping with its actual conditions and make the best use of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The realities today call for holding fast to the independent stand and coping with the constantly changing situation on one's own initiative. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are taking high national pride in the independent politics pursued by the Workers' Party of Korea and confidently pushing forward the revolution and construction, holding aloft the great banner of Juche, the banner of independence.    \r\n\r\n"

It is an unpardonable crime of adding to its crimes already committed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The NDFSK will join all the Korean people in the intensified anti-Japanese struggle to put an end to the Japanese reactionaries' hostile policy toward the Korean nation and their political suppression of Chongryon and certainly force them to apologize and compensate for their crime-woven past.    \r\n\r\n"
