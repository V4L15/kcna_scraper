Moreover, it is staging a wholesale purge of the progressive and pro-reunification forces in south Korea to quell the people's desire for alliance with the north and reunification and incite the anti-DPRK sentiment among them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such frantic moves of the south Korean conservative ruling forces have frozen the north-south relations, causing a dangerous situation in which the peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula might be wrecked to bring an irrevocable catastrophic crisis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their criminal moves can never be allowed as they follow the foreign forces and pursue the confrontation, swimming against the desire of the nation and the trend of times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By nature, there can be no future for those challenging the development of history and they would make desperate efforts when their days are numbered. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Anyhow, futile are such desperate efforts of the reactionaries to reverse the history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any attempt of the foreign forces and the south Korean conservative ruling forces to spoil the Korean nation's cause of independent reunification is bound to meet a shameful defeat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation will more dynamically wage the struggle to ensure the cause of the independent reunification and advance it despite the harsher offensive of the reactionaries against the history and the manifold trials and difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Military Confab Blasted\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, April 28 (KCNA) -- The recent  14th south Korea-U.S. \"seminar on defence analysis\" was an extremely disturbing and dangerous war confab at which the U.S. reconfirmed the military domination over south Korea and the permanent presence of its forces in south Korea and hatched a plot to invade the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday observes this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the \"seminar\" the commander of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces present in south Korea vociferated about the \"issue of boosting the capability of the south Korean forces,\" \"the permanent presence of U.S. forces\", \"additional assistance\" and the like. This was nothing but a revelation of the U.S. criminal attempt to perpetuate their military presence in south Korea, make the puppet army totally dependent upon them and use it as a war servant in the war of aggression against the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that the Lee Myung Bak group, hell bent on sycophancy towards the U.S. and confrontation with the north, broke into shouts of joy, blustering that the \"importance\" of the south Korea-U.S. \"alliance\" was \"proved\" at the \"seminar,\" the commentary terms the action taken by the south Korean puppets to tighten their \"alliance\" with the U.S., pursuant to its scenario for a war of aggression against the north, a horrendous treacherous move to bring a nuclear war disaster to the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans cannot repress the surging hatred and resentment at the U.S. and south Korean war-thirsty elements swimming against the trend of the times towards peace and reunification by working hard to tighten the \"alliance\" aimed at launching a war of aggression against the north, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had better behave itself, mindful of the consequences to be entailed by its arms buildup in south Korea and maneuvers to invade the north, and immediately withdraw its aggressor forces from south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Lee Myung Bak group persists in the confrontation with compatriots and the moves for a war of aggression against the north, turning their backs on the nation and colluding with foreign forces under the pretext of tightening the \"alliance\" with the U.S., they will not be able to escape a miserable end\r\n\r\n\r\n"
