            "content": "U.S. high-handed practices and pressure blasted \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 17 (KCNA) -- The hardline conservatives of the new U.S. administration are clinging to the policy of strong pressure towards the DPRK.\r\n Underscoring the \"need to cope with the threat of North Korean missiles\" they seek to draw even its allies into a joint counter-action against it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite ridiculous for the U.S. to assert that the DPRK threatens it with missiles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is none other than the U.S. which develops new missile technology and accelerates the missile export. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is no more than a far-fetched theory that what the U.S. is doing does not pose any threat to anyone, except what others are doing. This is a brigandish logic of the U.S. styling itself the \"only superpower.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is neither reason nor pretext for the U.S. to pull up the DPRK over its missile development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's development and production of missiles is an issue belonging to its sovereignty. The DPRK does not hide that it has developed and produced missiles to increase its self-defence capability and is proud of having done so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. loud-mouthed \"threat of North Korean missiles\" is nothing but a smokescreen to conceal its policy of military pressure and adventurous war moves against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should bear deep in mind that such trick can never go down with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter what others may say, the DPRK will increase its defence capability in every way to protect the dignity of the nation and the security of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to stop at once such foolish moves, keenly aware that such high-handed practices and pressure will not work on the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. urged to drop its criminal design \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 17 (KCNA) -- Recently the U.S. ruling circles are talking about a \"hardline policy\" while taking issue with the DPRK for no reason. They do not bother to call for escalating their criminal moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK by force of arms.\r\n In this regard rodong sinmun today in a signed commentary denounces these moves as a revelation of their sinister attempt to aggravate the situation on the Korean peninsula, block the way of the independent reunification of the Korean nation opened with much effort and, furthermore, achieve their wild design to invade the whole of Korea at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will never remain a passive onlooker to the U.S. undisguised military threat to the DPRK and frantic moves to undermine even the socialist system, its life and soul. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By indefinitely escalating the moves against the DPRK, the U.S. warmongers seek to stop the situation in Korea from turning favourable to its peace and independent reunification. in other words, the U.S. imperialists are working hard to keep the Korean nation divided forever in a bid to perpetuate their military occupation of South Korea at any cost and, moreover, swallow up the whole of Korea, using it as a springboard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With no moves to isolate and suffocate the DPRK the successive U.S. imperialist warmongers could hurt the dignity and might of the DPRK. The world came to clearly realize how anachronistic the U.S. hostile policy is. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  However, the U.S. ruling circles, instead of drawing a lesson, are resorting to foolish moves to bring the situation on the Korean peninsula back to that before the adoption of the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework while resuming anti-DPRK racket of confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are mistaken. The DPRK is entitled to take an option. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is its revolutionary determination to counter the use of force with force and return war for war and surely win with a thousand-fold retaliation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are well advised to stop acting rashly, properly judging our will and spirit. The United States should drop its daydream of isolating and stifling the DPRK by force of arms and opt to sincerely implement the agreed framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is also beneficial to the U.S.    \r\n\r\n"

There came such outbursts as \"Pyongyang should do something\" and \"Pyongyang should discharge its duty.\" This has compelled the DPRK to make a strong reaction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Regrettably, it is impossible to expect substantial dialogue under the present situation. The United States' current moves to complicate the inter-Korean relations are sharpening the DPRK's vigilance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such position of the U.S. will only upset the peace process on the Korean peninsula.    \r\n\r\n"

They boasted of its technical advantage during the gulf war. But in Korea it failed to demonstrate its  advantage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those who invade Korea from sky, land and sea will not get off scotfree.     \r\n\r\n"

This is a brilliant fruition of leader Kim Jong Il's great army-first policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This policy of the Workers' Party of Korea also reliably guarantees the smooth implementation of the politics for the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Attaching importance to military affairs in socialist society is the most just measure to defend the people's destiny and ensure their happy life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n So, there will be no more powerful political method than the army-first policy for the wpk and the socialist government that serve the people and provide independent and creative life to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK's army-first policy, a perfect and systematized political method, is not a tactical policy adopted only to deal with the present situation but a strategic political method that should be maintained constantly as long as the imperialists remain in this planet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should remain true to Kim Jong Il's army-first policy and thoroughly embody it in the revolution and construction under any circumstances and situation. this is the only way of defending the socialist cause of Juche to the last and demonstrating the dignity of the nation.    \r\n\r\n"

Once it states, it demonstrates its matchless might and spirit.\r\n This is clearly evidenced by only a few official orders and statements which the Korean armed forces released under the serious and complicated military situation in the 1990s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The first vice-minister of the people's armed forces in a statement on March 29, 1996 declared: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"The mission of our people's army to defend the security of the motherland and the gains of the revolution is not limited to defending the country from any aggression only. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the spirit of our army to return fire for fire and counter strong-arm policy with a strong-arm policy\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The spokesman for the Ministry of the People's Armed Forces in a statement on June 18, 1997 warned: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"If the enemy eventually challenges our will and military might, our people's army will mobilize to the maximum all the potentials built up for scores of years and give vent to our people's pent-up wrath and grudge against him.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The spokesman for the general staff of the Korean People's Army in a statement on December 2, 1998 said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"We have our own operational plan. 'surgical operation-type assault' and 'forestalling strike' can never be an exclusive option of the united states and such method of attack is not a monopoly of the U.S. It should clearly know that there is no limit to our people's army's strike and there is no place on our planet where the enemy can dodge this strike. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n ...
