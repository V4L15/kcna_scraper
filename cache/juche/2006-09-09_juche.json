            "content": "National Meeting Marks Anniversary of DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 8 (KCNA) -- A national meeting was held at the April 25 House of Culture here on Friday to celebrate the 58th birthday of the DPRK.\r\n Present at the meeting were senior party, army and state officials.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Also attending it were overseas compatriots, including a congratulatory group of Korean residents in Japan, and the chief of the Pyongyang mission of the Anti-imperialist National Democratic Front. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present on invitation were diplomatic envoys of different countries, members of the military attaches corps and representatives of international organizations here. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A report was made at the meeting by Kim Yong Nam, Politburo member of the C.C., Workers' Party of Korea and president of the Presidium of the DPRK Supreme People's Assembly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The birth of the DPRK on September 9, Juche 37 (1948) was a brilliant victory of President Kim Il Sung's idea of nation-building and leadership over it, and it was a major event of weighty significance in the Korean people's revolutionary struggle to achieve independence, the reporter said, and went on to say: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since its foundation the DPRK has developed into the most solid and viable socialist power whose mission is to accomplish the popular masses' cause of independence, while successfully hewing the path of a rigorous and complicated struggle under the guidance of the Party and the leader, and creditably discharged its mission as a weapon of revolution and construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His idea of building the Juche-oriented state and the exploits performed for it have been firmly preserved and successfully carried forward and developed on a new higher stage by Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il clarified that though President Kim Il Sung passed away, the state leadership system of the DPRK should be one whereby the revolutionary cause of Juche pioneered and led by the President is firmly defended and steadily carried forward. And Kim Jong Il took a historic measure of constitutionally stipulating that Kim Il Sung shall be held in high esteem as the eternal President of the DPRK, reflecting the unanimous will of the whole Party and entire army and all the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This constitutes a distinguished feat as it made it possible to eternally glorify the character and honor of the DPRK as the state of the President and let the DPRK's history last forever as a dignified revolutionary history of the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the 1990s when the imperialists got evermore undisguised in their moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK, Kim Jong Il defined the traditional Songun policy of the WPK as the main political mode under socialism and developed in depth it in all fields to significantly increase the national power. This was an immortal exploit of historic significance performed by him in carrying out the cause of building a socialist state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Underscoring the need to hold Kim Il Sung in high esteem as the eternal President of the DPRK for all ages and do all work the way he did so as to glorify the country as his glorious state, the reporter continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to cement as firm as a rock the single-minded unity of the entire Party and army and all the people around Kim Jong Il on the basis of the Juche idea, the Songun idea of the WPK to push ahead with the revolutionary cause of Songun with its might. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is essential to continue directing big efforts to the development of the national defence industry to increase the war deterrent for self-defence in every way, establish the traits of attaching importance to military affairs throughout the society and give full play to the traditional traits of the army-people unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An important task facing the DPRK government at present is to effect a fresh revolutionary surge in the building of an economic power in the 21st century and thus bring about a radical turn in the economic construction and the improvement of the standard of people's living and give full play to the advantages of Korean-style socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will surely achieve the cause of national reunification and build a dignified, prosperous and independent, reunified powerful nation on this land by conducting a dynamic patriotic movement for independent reunification, peace against war and great national unity under the banner of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our army and people will smash any political and military offensive, economic blockade and destabilizing moves of the U.S. imperialists and their followers and eternally glorify Korean socialism under the banner of the DPRK as they cast in their lot with their system and cause and have tremendous war deterrent for self-defence and the independent national economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK government will as always remain true to the idea of independence, peace and friendship and boost solidarity with the peoples of all countries that advocate independence, stand up against aggression and war and work hard to build an independent and peaceful new world.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Demanded\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 8 (KCNA) -- The United States' occupation of south Korea itself was brigandish and illegal aggression quite contrary to the will of the Korean nation and the requirements of international law and terrorism against sovereignty. The U.S. should roll back at once its anachronistic policy of keeping south Korea under its occupation and withdraw its forces from south Korea as early as possible. Rodong Sinmun Friday urges this in a signed article carried 61 years since the U.S. imperialists' military occupation of south Korea (September 8, 1945).\r\n Recalling that the history of their occupation of south Korea is recorded with all sorts of crimes such as aggression, war, murder and plunder, the article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans should not allow the U.S. presence in south Korea to last any longer as it has brought nothing but the violation of the dignity and sovereignty of the Korean nation and disasters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The pullout of the U.S. forces from south Korea is a task before all Koreans the fulfillment of which brooks no further delay. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation can neither escape from misfortune and pain nor live in peace even a moment unless the U.S. troops are withdrawn from south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world is going in for independence and the Koreans live in the era of independence and reunification. This strong trend of the times requires the south Koreans from all walks of life to be more conscious of independence against the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is neither a friendly country nor an ally of the south Korean people. They should see through the gangster-like nature of the U.S. imperialists as aggressors, plunderers and murderers and resolutely oppose the U.S. domination and interference. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Koreans should frustrate the U.S. racket against the DPRK and moves for invading it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is the harasser of peace and chiefly to blame for the escalating tension on the Korean Peninsula and chieftain of aggression and war. Both the north and south of Korea are committed to standing against aggression and war. They should jointly counter the U.S. moves for a war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should build the structure of confrontation between the entire Korean nation and the U.S. to decisively shatter the U.S. imperialists' moves to ignite a new war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the fellow countrymen will demonstrate the mettle of the Korean nation in the standoff with the U.S. for independence, peace and reunification.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But the wild ambition of the hostile forces is nothing but a day dream.\r\n Kim Yong Nam, president of the Presidium of the DPRK Supreme People's Assembly, declared this in his report made at the national meeting held to celebrate the 58th birthday of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our army and people will smash any political and military offensive, economic blockade and destabilizing moves of the U.S. imperialists and their followers and eternally glorify Korean socialism under the banner of the DPRK as they cast in their lot with their system and cause and have tremendous war deterrent for self-defence and the independent national economy.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
