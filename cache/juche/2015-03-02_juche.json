            "content": "KPA Will Never Remain Passive Onlooker to Key Resolve and Foal Eagle: Spokesman for General Staff of KPA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, March 2 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the General Staff of the Korean People's Army issued the following statement on Sunday:\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists and south Korean puppet forces kicked off adventurous Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military exercises on March 2 despite strong protest and denunciation at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The three services of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces have already been deployed in south Korea and its vicinity for these war maneuvers and huge forces of the south Korean puppet army, war servants of their master U.S., are fully ready for them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Involved there are the U.S. satellite forces including the UK, France, Australia and Canada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Key Resolve and Foal Eagle which will last till April 24 are dangerous nuclear war drills for invading the DPRK as they are aimed at swiftly hurling  and forward-deploying the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces in contingency on the Korean peninsula, mounting a surprise preemptive attack on it by \"combined forces\", \"liquidating\"   DPRK's headquarters and \"occupying  Pyongyang\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The gravity of the situation lies in that these war exercises started in the wake of the recent undisguised declaration made by Obama, the chieftain of war of the U.S. imperialists, that it is the policy target of the USA to stamp out the ideology chosen by the DPRK and \"bring down\" its social system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In a word, Key Resolve and Foal Eagle are an undisguised encroachment upon the sovereignty and dignity of the DPRK and an unpardonable war hysteria of dishonest hostile forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the final analysis, the above-said saber-rattling clearly proves that the claim of the U.S. imperialists and their followers that the war maneuvers are of \"defensive nature\" is crafty sophism to conceal their reckless preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK and their rhetoric about \"annual drills\" is nothing but a smokescreen to cover up their surprise invasion of the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation on the Korean peninsula is again inching close to the brink of a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In view of the prevailing situation the General Staff of the Korean People's Army clarifies the following principled stand internally and externally:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Now that the dangerous war drills of the U.S. imperialists and their followers have been kicked off, our revolutionary armed forces will never remain a passive onlooker to this grave situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK had already declared before the world that as the Obama group is becoming all the more desperate in its smear campaign against the DPRK, the group is ratcheting up its harsh sanctions and pressure on the DPRK and its war drills against the DPRK are gaining in scope and strength, pursuant to its outrageous hostile policy towards the DPRK, the DPRK will take toughest measures to cope with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Key Resolve and Foal Eagle go to prove that the U.S. extreme hostile policy towards the DPRK is being implemented through dangerous practical actions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean People's Army will never overlook the saber-rattling as its aggressive and offensive nature has been brought to light.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our revolutionary armed forces never make an empty talk.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists and their allies should bear in mind that all the ground, sea, underwater, air and cyber striking means of our revolutionary armed forces always aim at their designated targets and are fully ready to strike them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. They should clearly know that our revolutionary armed forces will never allow their slightest intrusion into the DPRK's territory, territorial air and waters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK had already declared internally and externally its firm determination that it would bring earlier the final ruin of the U.S. imperialists and their allies by conventional war of Korean style if they unleash a conventional war against it, through powerful nuclear strikes of Korean style if they ignite a nuclear war against it and by preeminent cyber war of Korean style if they attempt to \"bring down\" our country by cyber war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our powerful revolutionary Paektusan army has bolstered up its weaponry to take revenge upon them for the last several decades to put its pledge into practice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those drills are the most undisguised infringement upon the DPRK's sovereignty and dignity and a grave military provocation to it for which they can never excuse.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the consistent stand of our revolutionary armed forces that in case even a single shell drops on any place over which the sovereignty of the DPRK is exercised, it will promptly take counteractions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 3. The U.S. imperialists and their allies should clearly know that their outrageous and vicious aggressive actions being staged under the signboard of peace will never work on the DPRK in this bright world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the U.S. that claims Key Resolve and Foal Eagle are aimed to \"conquer\" the capital city of the sovereign state and \"liquidate\" its headquarters but insists that they are \"defensive and \"annual\" ones. It is a robber-like logic.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. scenario is to make a unipolar world dominated by the USA and where U.S.-style democracy and market economy hold sway. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The evermore undisguised military moves of the U.S. imperialists on the Korean peninsula and in its vicinity such as Key Resolve and Foal Eagle are not targeted on the DPRK only.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the real intention of the U.S. expanded hostile policy toward the DPRK to lay a vast siege to  the continent and let Far East and the Asian continent allow the U.S. high-handed and arbitrary practices.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is seriously mistaken if it thinks such moves will work on the Korean peninsula and the rest of this bright world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK will further bolster up weapons to annihilate the enemies, as the U.S. imperialists become evermore ferocious in their aggressive nature, the south Korean puppet forces escalate confrontation with the fellow countrymen in the north to prolong their remaining days and dishonest hostile forces blindly follow them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The only means to cope with the aggression and war by the U.S. imperialists and their followers is neither dialogue nor peace. They should be dealt with only by merciless strikes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's revolutionary armed forces will watch with a high degree of combat alertness the dangerous saber-rattling of the U.S imperialists and their followers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialist aggressors, the south Korean puppet forces and their followers will have to bitterly regret the irretrievable consequences to be entailed by Key Resolve and Foal Eagle."

Korea Joint Military Exercises\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, March 2 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK released the following statement Monday in connection with the fact that the U.S. started with the south Korean puppet forces Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military exercises, war exercises for invading the DPRK, despite its repeated warnings:\n\t\t\t\t\t The drills to be staged across south Korea from March 2 to April 24 are said to involve huge U.S. forces in south Korea, the U.S. mainland, Japan and other overseas bases, south Korean puppet forces and massive war means including a U.S. coastal warship that was manufactured to suit the seabed features off the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The exercises are intolerable aggression moves pursuant to the U.S. Korea strategy designed to \"bring down\" the socialist system chosen by the Korean people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By putting sustained military pressure on the DPRK the U.S. seeks to prevent it from concentrating efforts on economic construction and the improvement of the people's living standard, and by describing those exercises as \"annual and defensive ones\", it seeks to make the DPRK accustomed and get used to its war exercises and grow lax and then invade the DPRK in the end.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. launch of the joint military exercises on the Korean peninsula in defiance of the unanimous protest and denunciation by people around it is prompted by a sinister trick pursuant to its pivot to Asia-Pacific strategy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through the continued joint military exercises the U.S. intends to keep the south Korean puppet forces, its servants, close to it, stem the north-south relations from advancing and use the puppet forces as cannon fodder for besieging and containing surrounding countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the same time, the U.S. also seeks to keep the situation on the peninsula tense and maintain the pretext for arms buildup in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The joint military exercises this year have more provocative nature than ever before.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK set forth bold and flexible proposals to remove the danger of war, defuse tension and create a peaceful environment on the Korean peninsula this year and has made sincere efforts for their realization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It clarified that in case the U.S. stops for the time being joint military exercises in and around south Korea, we have the willingness to respond to it with a moratorium on a nuclear test which the U.S. is much concerned about, and expressed the stand that we are always ready to sit with the U.S. at a negotiating table.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But from the outset of the year the U.S. president personally declared \"additional sanctions\" against the DPRK and blustered that it will \"bring down\" the socialist system which the Korean people regard dearer than their own lives, and started the aggression war exercises with the south Korean puppet forces against the DPRK, thereby blatantly challenging the sincere proposals and efforts made by the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This has only brought to light the nature of the U.S. as the chief culprit escalating tension and harassing peace and the deceptive nature of its hypocritical talk about dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The exercises have especially high possibility of causing a spark, given the grim situation and atmosphere caused by the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces' provocative anti-DPRK confrontational frenzy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that the U.S. has become all the more pronounced in its hostile policy toward the DPRK, bereft of reason, the army and people of the DPRK will take tougher counteraction of justice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already declared, they are fully ready for any form of war which the U.S. wants and may opt and are full of the firm will to counter the enemies' slightest provocation with the just great war for national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In case a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula at last, the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces can never evade consequences and responsibilities."

It also works hard to distribute to world's biggest cities a video asserting Japan's \"dominium\" over Tok Islets in 11 languages.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japanese Foreign Minister Kishida in a speech at the Diet openly insisted upon Japan's \"claim\" to Tok Islets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese government dispatched a vice minister to an event held in Shimane Prefecture some days ago to mark the \"Takeshima (Tok Islets) day\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this regard, KCNA met Dr. and Associate Prof. Hwang Myong Chol, a section chief of the History Institute of the Academy of Social Sciences of the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to history books, Tok Islets were belonged to Usan Kingdom from 6th century ago and later, Usan Kingdom reverted to Silla Kingdom (early in the 6th century-935). \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In particular, the Feudal Joson Dynasty (1392-1910) promulgated the Ordinance No. 41 in October 1900 with an aim to reconfirm its dominium over the islets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was none other than Korea, which found the islets for the first time, incorporated them into its territory and proclaimed its dominium at home and abroad in keeping with modern international laws.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Historical data proving that Tok Islets are part of inviolable territory of Korea have been discovered one after another. Even old documents of Japan, found at a history archive in Shimane Prefecture a few years ago, say that in the 19th century some Japanese fishermen were executed for landing on Tok Islets in disregard of \"Ordinance Banning Sailing to the Islets\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ordinances of Japan instituted in 1950s stipulated that Tok Islets are not belonged to Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The international community acknowledges that the islets are part of inviolable territory of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lurking behind Japan's persistent claim to the islets is an ulterior intention to reduce the islets into those in dispute by internationalizing and politicizing the issue of the islets and thus make a comeback to Korea under this pretext and, furthermore, realize its old dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\" with the Korean Peninsula as a springboard. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tok Islets are part of the sacred territory of Korea."

Watching the mountain and river of the country damaged during the Japanese imperialist colonial rule, he unrolled a far-reaching plan to turn all the mountains into thickly wooded people's resorts by planting lots of trees. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To turn all mountains into golden and treasure ones is the behests of the President and leader Kim Jong Il and their lifetime desires, says Rodong Sinmun. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Only when lots of trees are planted and cultivated is it possible to protect the land and turn the mountains and fields of the country into a socialist fairyland.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Marshal Kim Jong Un said that we can no longer step back with the issue of bare mountains left unsettled. He instructed the entire party, the whole country and all the people to turn out in the campaign to restore forests, regarding it as a war with nature, just as the whole country turned out to clear debris in the period of the postwar rehabilitation and construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This reflects the noble aspiration of Kim Jong Un to turn our country into a more beautiful one and glorify it for eternity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our generation is faced with a sacred duty to turn the great country into a socialist paradise.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now is the time for the entire party, the whole army and all the people to turn out as one in the forest restoration campaign, regarding the tree planting as an important work related to the destiny of the future of the country and the nation and final victory in the drive for building a thriving nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The forest restoration campaign serve as a yardstick judging patriotism of people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whoever plants and cultivates even a single more tree is a true patriot. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson calls upon all Koreans to conduct a dynamic forest restoration campaign to turn all mountains of the country into the golden and treasure ones and thus make positive contributions to turning our country into the golden tapestry in the era of the Workers' Party and into thickly wooded people's resorts."

Ya que comenzo de hecho el peligroso entrenamiento de guerra anti-RPDC de EE.UU. y sus satelites, nuestras fuerzas armadas revolucionarias no estaran con brazos cruzados ante esta situacion grave.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDado que se pone mas cruel la politica hostil anti-RPDC de EE.UU., ya hemos proclamado que cuanto mas se eleve el grado de calumnias de la banda de Obama, se recrudezcan la sancion y la presion y se amplien la dimension y esfera de los simulacros, tanto mas superduras seran las contramedidas que tomaremos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos presentes ejercicios demuestran que la politica hostil anti-RPDC de EE.UU. se extiende otra vez a las peligrosas acciones de combate real.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestro ejercito no estara con brazos cruzados  una vez que se ha revelado el caracter agresivo y ofensivo de este entrenamiento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestras fuerzas armadas revolucionarias no dicen palabras hueras.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos imperialistas norteamericanos y sus fuerzas seguidores deben tener bien presente que todos los medios de golpe de nuestras fuerzas terrestres, maritimas, submarinas, aereas y ciberneticas estan apuntando siempre los blancos asignados manteniendose en el estado a punto de disparar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Deben conocer bien que nuestras fuerzas armadas revolucionarias no perdonan nunca ni la menor forma de incursion de EE.UU. y sus satelites en nuestro territorio, espacio aereo y aguas jurisdiccionales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa hemos declarado que hemos tomado la decision de adelantar la caida final de EE.UU. con la guerra convencional, el ataque nuclear y la guerra cibernetica por nuestro estilo si el imperio impone la guerra de agresion con las fuerzas convencionales o con las fuerzas nucleares e intenta \"derrumbarnos\" con la guerra cibernetica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara poner en practica esa decision, nuestro poderoso ejercito revolucionario del monte Paektu vino preparando de siglo en siglo los fusiles de venganza.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Key Resolve\" y \"Foal Eagle\" son la violacion mas abierta e injustificable sobre nuestra soberania y dignidad y la grave provocacion militar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPasaremos a la contraofensiva en el acto si los enemigos cometen la provocacion de enviar una sola bala hacia cualquier lugar bajo nuestra soberania, esto es la posicion inconmovible de nuestras fuerzas armadas revolucionarias.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. EE.UU. y sus seguidores deben tener en cuenta que no se aceptaran nunca en este mundo claro sus brutales maniobras de agresion que se perpetran bajo el vistoso cartel de paz.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs precisamente EE.UU. el gangster que describe como \"defensivos\" y \"anuales\" los ejercicios \"Key Resolve\" y \"Foal Eagle\" que se proponen \"conquistar\" la capital del Estado soberano y \"eliminar\" su direccion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSometer el mundo al control de los Estados Unidos de America y convertirlo como el unipolarizado donde reinen la democracia al estilo norteamericano y la economia de mercado, esto es la siniestra intencion del imperio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC no es el unico blanco de \"Key Resolve\" y \"Foal Eagle\" y otras agravantes maniobras militares de EE.UU. en la Peninsula Coreana y sus alrededores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSu ampliada politica hostil anti-RPDC persigue formar el extenso cerco sobre el continente asiatico y convertirlo en una region donde se toleren la arbitrariedad y despotismo de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo habra el acto mas estupido si piensan que sus maniobras resultaran efectivas en la Peninsula Coreana y el mundo claro de hoy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestro ejercito revolucionario tomara con mas firmeza el fusil para aniquilar a los enemigos, mientras se tornen mas brutales la naturaleza agresiva de los imperialistas norteamericanos y la campana de confrontacion fratricida de los titeres surcoreanos y se haga mas grave la obediencia de las fuerzas hostiles malsanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl unico medio para controlar el imperialismo norteamericano y sus satelites que se dedican a la agresion y la guerra no es el dialogo ni la paz sino el ataque implacable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestro ejercito revolucionario observara atentamente en el estado de alerta las peligrosas e imprudentes maniobras de guerra de EE.UU. y sus seguidores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos agresores norteamericanos, los titeres surcoreanos y las fuerzas seguidoras se remorderan y se lamentaran por las consecuencias irrecuperables de \"Key Resolve\" y \"Foal Eagle\"."
