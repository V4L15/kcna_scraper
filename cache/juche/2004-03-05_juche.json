            "content": "KCNA Terms U.S. Kingpin of Human Rights Abuses \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 4 (KCNA) -- The U.S. State Department slandered the DPRK again in \"an annual report on human rights\" on February 25.\r\n The U.S. talked this or that about human rights situations in more than 190 countries as if it were an international human rights judge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is ludicrous for the U.S. to talk about human rights abuses in the DPRK although it is beset with such serious human rights issues as racial discrimination, religious disputes, merciless assaults in prisons, murder, rapes, robbery, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is not entitled to talk about human rights situation on the international arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was the U.S. which brought the worst disaster to the people of Afghanistan in view of humanitarianism by invading it, reducing its cities and villages to ashes to meet Washington's purpose and interests under the signboard of the \"war on terrorism.\" It was again the U.S. which fabricated false information, violated the sovereignty of Iraq by force of arms and unhesitatingly dropped bombs on defenseless innocent peaceable citizens and even on children. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Human rights precisely means state power. Therefore, the invasion of Iraq, a sovereign state, should be called into question as it was the worst human rights abuses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After launching a war in Iraq, the U.S. used approximately 311,000 depleted uranium shells, more than 13,000 cluster bombs and many other bombs and shells, severely devastating land, killing at least 10,000 civilians and wounding about 20,000. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These atrocities suffice to prove that the U.S. is the chieftain of massacre and the worst violator of the right to existence. It also proves that the present U.S. administration is the world's most inhumane regime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Amnesty International issued statements on June 30 and July 20 last year to denounce the U.S. human rights abuses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statements accused the U.S. of confining thousands of innocent Iraqis in prisons and thus inflicting all sorts of humiliation and pain upon them and even killing them without hesitation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In November the secretary general of Amnesty International assailed the U.S. for wantonly violating international law and human rights under the signboard of \"war on terrorism\" and punishing prisoners in POW camps in the naval base on Guantanamo and in Afghanistan as it pleases without going through necessary legal procedures. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts go to clearly prove that the U.S. is the strangler of international democracy and the world's worst violator of human rights as it is hell-bent on mass-killings in different parts of the world, imposing economic sanctions and war on those countries advocating independence by spreading false information and breeding plots. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such being a stark fact, the U.S. is pulling up the DPRK over the non-existent human rights issue. This is nothing but a base trick to tarnish the international image of the DPRK and do harm to its state power by adding human rights issue to the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. much ado about the human rights issue in the DPRK only hardens the will of the Korean people to consolidate as firm as an iron-wall the socialist system, their protector.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It took the lives of at least 25,000 peaceable civilians. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. massively used depleted uranium shells, a target of international criticism, contaminating Iraq with radioactive substance. Though the U.S. claims that the Iraqi war was brought to an end last spring, the U.S. occupation forces' outrageous oppression upon and brutal killings of Iraqis are still going on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the contrary, the U.S. is escalating its crackdown upon and killings of civilians under the pretext of \"a war against terrorism\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. crimes against humanity are not confined to Iraq only. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S.-led \"war against terrorism\" has generated endless killings and maltreatment of civilians in various parts of the world including Afghanistan and Kosovo. This is the most hideous crime against humanity as it diametrically runs counter to the main spirit of the \"world declaration on human rights\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality in Iraq, a graveyard of human rights, teaches the bitter lesson that if a country loses its sovereignty, the human rights of its people are bound to be savagely violated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If these worst human rights abuses committed by the U.S. under the signboard of \"protecting human rights\" are overlooked, the world will be turned into a lawless one, a tundra of human rights where the U.S. lords it over. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Human conscience will never tolerate it and history will certainly mete out a fair judgment to the U.S. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

But in north Korea, alone, landlords who made up only four percent in all the farmhouses were owning 58.2 percent of the arable land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The peasants' long-cherished desire was to have their own land to do farming. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Taking their desire into account, Kim Il Sung set the agrarian reform as a primary task and wisely guided the efforts to carry it out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He visited various local areas including Taedong County, South Phyongan Province, and spent more than a month among peasants to acquaint himself with the situation of the countryside and the earnest demand of the peasants for land. \r\n During the days, he made an accurate analysis of the feudal landownership and decided on those who should be deprived of land, and ways of confiscating and distributing their land and doing away with the tenant system for good. Basing himself on the land programme he laid down in the period of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle and on rich experience he gained in the efforts for its implementation, he completed the law on agrarian reform. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Law on Agrarian Reform in North Korea\" worked out by him was promulgated as a law of the Provisional People's Committee of North Korea on March 5, Juche 35 (1946). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The agricultural working people in the country significantly commemorate March 5 every year to hand down Kim Il Sung's undying feats down through generations.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
