He appreciated the great efforts made by them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He proposed letting children cut tape at the ceremony so that they might always remember this day even after they have grown up, adding how pleasant the President and Kim Jong Il would have been if they had seen those children cutting the tape. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round the baby home and orphanage to learn in detail about the preparations for their operation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was satisfied with the fact that the soldier-builders and officials of relevant fields have perfectly completed the project and made thorough preparations for the operation of the baby home and orphanage. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He gave instructions which would serve as guidelines for successfully operating them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that the Wonsan Baby Home and Orphanage look very nice, adding such splendid palace for children could be hardly found in any other part of the world. He noted with pleasure that this is a proud structure eloquently and strikingly demonstrating the advantages of the socialist system under which the party and the state take care of the orphans in a responsible manner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whenever such edifices as the Wonsan Baby Home and Orphanage appear one after another, this adds brilliance to the whole country and will please all Korean people, he said, stressing that this is a true picture of the Korean-style socialist system which capitalism can neither imitate nor imagine. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t How gratifying we feel after providing the orphans with excellent cradle, true to the intentions of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, he noted, adding the orphans would surely follow the party and country as their real father and mother and happily and cheerfully grow to be reliable pillars of the country. Thinking of this helps harden our determination to work harder for the sake of the younger generation day by day and spare nothing for them, he emphasized.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying the appearance of the baby home and orphanage added to the precious treasures of the country, a happy event in Kangwon Province, he instructed officials to hold the ceremony for their completion with splendor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Hwang Pyong So, Ri Jae Il and Jo Yong Won."

They have massively introduced chemical weapons and poisonous chemical substance including binary chemical weapon and defoliant and regarded the south Korean people as guinea pigs for testing their efficiency. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has staged madcap exercises for a biochemical war aimed to devastate the whole land of Korea and exterminate all Koreans, while conducting horrible tests on south Koreans.
