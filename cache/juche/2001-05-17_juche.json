That is why it is a touchstone that distinguishes Japan's position as to whether it intends to turn away from militarism of the past or launch militarist aggression again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries have made military and legal preparations to commit any war of aggression by accelerating the conversion of Japan into a military power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What remains to be done by Japan now is to get an ideological preparation to mobilize its people in the event of its start of overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are using the visit to the Yasukuni Shrine as the best chance to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese chief executive's planned official visit to the Yasukuni Shrine pursues such a sinister aim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By taking the lead in the official visit he seeks to woo cabinet members and officials and all other people to follow suit in a bid to create social atmosphere and implant militarism and revanchism into the Japanese.    \r\n\r\n"

Kumgang was accepted by the north in November 1998 out of noble patriotism and the desire to contribute to national reunification by meeting the South Koreans' strong wish to see Mt. Kumgang, the famous mountain of the nation, and helping them contribute to national reconciliation, unity and great national unity.\r\n The United States has hampered the tour in every way from the outset as it is displeased with the favourably developing inter-Korean relations and any movement for the reunification of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to scotch the Mt. Kumgang tour which started as an undertaking for non-governmental cooperation when the relations between the north and the south remained frozen, the U.S. directly meddled in this affair, asserting that expenses paid for the tour would be \"exclusively used for a military purpose,\" and hampered it in various ways. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On December 28, 1998, when South Koreans' tour of Mt. Kumgang just started under the contract with Hyundai the Japanese Yomiuri Shimbun reported that the U.S. North Korea policy coordinator, Perry, during his visit to Seoul early December, referring to the South Koreans' tour of Mt. Kumgang, expressed his apprehension as to the possible diversion of a huge amount of money paid to the DPRK for the tour into military spending and, accordingly, the South Korean authorities put the brake on Hyundai's remittance to the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The February 2, 2001, issue of the Japanese Sankei Shimbun reported that \"the concern over North Korea's possible use of Hyundai's fund for a military purpose has been expressed by both sides of the government and the military since the days of the Clinton administration and the U.S. forces command in South Korea met the Hyundai representative in November last year to protest such assistance.\" This proves that the U.S. military authorities pressurized South Korea not to pay for the tour. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commander of the U.S. forces in South Korea Schwats testified at the U.S. senate on March 27, 2001, that \"threat from North Korea has grown more serious than last year and North Korea is conducting intensive military drills and busy buying arms,\" bringing into bolder relief the \"threat from North Korea\" and craftily trying to support through such expression as \"arms purchase\" his assertion that Hyundai's payment for the tour may be exclusively used as military spending. (March 29, 2001, issue of Kyunghyang Daily News) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A researcher specializing in Asian affairs at the investigation bureau of the U.S. congress said on January 4, 2001, that \"Washington government, the people and the military are deeply concerned about the fact that North Korea might have used the money the Hyundai paid to it for the tour for a military purpose. The Bush administration would be critical of such deal.\" (January 4, 2001, Voice of Free Asia)       All these facts go to prove that the U.S., undesirous of reconciliation, cooperation and reunification between the north and south, was not pleased with the Mt. Kumgang tour from the outset and is now meddling in every affair of other country, saying this or that, and keen on obstructive moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the tour is suspended or derailed, the U.S. and its followers who have stood in its way will be held wholly responsible for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to stop meddling in the Mt. Kumgang tour, the business of the Korean nation.    \r\n\r\n"

He noted that the testimonies made by victims are of great importance as they exposed part of the U.S. history of aggression of Korea.\r\n He stressed that materials and testimonies gathered would be widely used to let many people know about the sufferings the GIs brought to the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He also noted that the U.S. government, afraid of the GIs' atrocities beyond human imagination being known to the world, is trying to cover up the truth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the fact that GIs' crimes are still reported on the Korean peninsula, he declared that they are certain to be settled generation after generation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Koreans cannot enjoy genuine freedom as the U.S. troops remain in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He underscored the urgent need to let the world know about the GIs' atrocities not only for the sake of victims but for the prevention of such crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Brian Becker, chairman of the U.S. Get Out of Korea Committee, who is a member of the group, said that he would make every possible effort for the withdrawal of the U.S. troops from South Korea and the realization of a lasting peace on the Korean peninsula.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
