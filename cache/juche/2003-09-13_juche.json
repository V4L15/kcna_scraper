            "content": "U.S. Brigandish Demand Dismissed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 12 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary dismisses the U.S. demand for the DPRK's abandonment of its nuclear weapons program through irreversible verification as a brigandish one.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such demand of the U.S. belligerent forces, in essence, means that the DPRK should completely disarm itself and succumb to the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the U.S. that spawned the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. The U.S. has massively shipped nuclear weapons into south Korea and increased its nuclear pressure on the DPRK, thus carrying the nuclear issue into extremes. It is seeking to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis is a wanton violation of the NPT. Therefore, the U.S. should be called into question. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK does not have any obligation to be subject to the \"irreversible verification\" by law. The DPRK's withdrawal from the NPT was a just self-defensive step that conforms with international law as it is an exercise of its right stipulated in the treaty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has no ground to fulfil any legal obligation to be subject to irreversible verification according to the treaty as it withdrew from the NPT. The irreversible verification is applicable only to criminals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. attempt to apply \"irreversible verification\" to the DPRK is aimed to isolate and stifle the DPRK by treating a victim as an \"assailant\" and \"criminal\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. demand for the DPRK's dismantling of its nuclear weapons program through irreversible verification is unacceptable to the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"
