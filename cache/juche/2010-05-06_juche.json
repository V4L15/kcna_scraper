This is, therefore, an intolerable act of treachery to bring the disaster of a new war, a nuclear war, to all Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such move goes to clearly tell who is wholly to blame for having pushed to an extreme phase the inter-Korean relations which had favorably developed since the publication of the June 15 joint declaration, the commentary notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Having strained the north-south relations and driven them into an unpredictably extreme phase, quite contrary to national reconciliation and unity, the conservative group is now busy working out an official document which contains the conception that \"the north is the principal enemy\" so that it may be known worldwide in a bid to escalate the confrontation with fellow countrymen and provoke a war of aggression against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The warlike nature of the conservative group finds its vivid manifestation in the anti-DPRK \"human rights\" campaign.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This group is leaving no means untried to ignite a war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative group has found itself in a tight corner due to its traitorous, anti-reunification and unpopular rule since it came to power.
