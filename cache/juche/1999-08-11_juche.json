Korean warhawks' planned introduction of latest planes\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 11 (KCNA) -- The South Korean warhawks are reportedly planning to purchase from the united states eight uptodate spy planes equipped with such electronic information-gathering devices as video recording and telecommunications over April 2000-2001.\r\n   They are now asserting that they will be able to gather by themselves  information on the north for which they relied upon the united states so far through the planes capable of video recording areas as far as north of Sinuiju and observing areas up to south of Pyongyang and Wonsan from the sky 40 to 50 kilometers south of the Military Demarcation Line (MDL). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The planned purchase of the planes aimed at further intensifying the aerial espionage on the DPRK, is another grave military provocation to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As is already known, the aerial espionage on the DPRK has been mainly carried on by the united states and, not content with it, the South Korean rulers said they would take it upon themselves. this eloquently shows what a reckless phase their bellicose attempt to carry into practice the north-targeted war scenario has reached.\r\n   Some days ago, the South Korean hawks announced they were going to purchase from the united states 100 \"Popeye\"  missiles capable of destroying \"  missile\"    bases of North Korea and even the long-range artillery in the area along the MDL, in the event of emergency. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The planned introduction of uptodate spy planes which synchronizes with the purchase of the \"Popeye\"  missiles for attack, can never be viewed as an accidental coincidence, as they are under way under a detailed and premeditated operational plan.\r\n   It is a silly operational attempt for the South Korean hawks to seek to militarily suffocate the northern half of Korea by making a preemptive missile attack on military objects in the north, including the \" missile bases\"  on the basis of results of \" minute espionage\"  on them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Therefore, they should not act rashly, clearly mindful that their operational attempt is no more than a daydream and it will bring only destruction to them.    \r\n\r\n"

So, they are symbols of disgraceful aggression and war which should have already been thrown into the dustbin of history along with the defeat of the Japanese imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Nevertheless, the Japanese reactionaries have persistently carried on political and military moves to legalize the revival of militarism and the move for re-invasion, far from liquidating the past though over half a century has passed since Japan's defeat in the Second World War. the diet's endorsement of the bill on the \" Hinomaru\"    and \"Kimigayo\"   is part of the moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As it contravens the purpose of Japan's post-war \" peace constitution\"   , it is no more than superconstitutional coup following the adoption of the legislation on the \"Japan-U.S. defense cooperation guidelines\" . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What can not be overlooked is the fact that the Japanese reactionaries carried out the endorsement in a provocative manner on the eve of August 15, underscoring their denial of the historic defeat and a sort of psychology of retaliation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They thus openly infused the idea of ultranationalism and revanchism into the Japanese people and did not bother to declare that the time has come to materialize their design for reinvasion of Korea and other Asian nations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But, Japan should stop the silly acts of challenging the history, clearly mindful that Korea today is not Korea yesterday and Asia today is not Asia yesterday.    \r\n\r\n"
