In addition, it considerably decreases the consumption of fuel and electricity.\r\n   It can be preserved for a long time without any special treatment.\r\n   Researchers have already introduced this material into local factories in more than 10 counties and are striving to attain still greater success.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
