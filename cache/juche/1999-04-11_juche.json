Ri went on to say:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I worked as a university professor in the north and south Jolla provinces, South Korea, for many years.  I know that the present South Korean chief executive resorted to deceptive tactics whenever he was driven to the corner while he was active as an opposition leader.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"measure for multi-faceted channel\"  is aimed at pacifying the growing desire of the South Korean people for reunification and alliance with communism and the north.   If the authorities of the \"government for the people\" truly want dialogue and improvement of inter-Korean relations they should unconditionally and immediately implement the priorities proposed by the joint meeting of the government, political parties and the organizations in the North Korea.\" \r\n\r\n"

The article says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader Kim Jong Il is the sun of loyalty and filial piety, who advanced the idea of loyalty and filial piety for the first time in history and has built a country pervaded with loyalty and filial piety in the North Korea by carrying  the idea into practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The sun illuminates the world with rays of loyalty and filial piety and these rays represent the idea of loyalty and filial piety.    Kim Jong Il expounded a new conception of loyalty and filial piety, saying that they are a trait inherent in a soldier faithful to the leader and the expression of filial piety is used in a way to underscore the  aspect of the sense of moral obligation in loyalty though it stems from loyalty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His definition of the idea of loyalty and filial piety is an undying exploit performed  by him to be recorded in the human history of thought.    The sun inspires the people with  warmth of loyalty and filial piety and it precisely means practice of loyalty and filial piety.   Kim Jong Il's  loyalty and filial piety towards President Kim Il Sung is a genuine model of loyalty and filial piety that can hardly be found in any society of the world and history book.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Jong Il created the history of loyalty and filial piety in defending the President when he was alive and accomplished the noble cause for the immortality of the President after his demise.    The north is a flower garden of loyalty and filial piety tended by the sun for the sun of loyalty and filial piety enables all people to live always with joy and in warmth free from shade and tundra. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTrue to Kim Jong Il's  wishes, girls in the capital city of Pyongyang and discharged soldiers from across the country voluntarily proceed to any work-sites, including villages on the northern highland,  remote coal and ore mines.  This indicates that the north is the only society pervaded with loyalty and filial piety on our planet, in which all servicemen and people breathe and behave  according to his intention and devote all their wisdom and energy to upholding his leadership.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such a reality in the north is the result of Kim Jong Il's  politics of loyalty and filial piety.   The 21st century will be a century of loyalty and filial piety in which  not only the Korean nation but mankind will follow the great Kim Jong Il. \r\n\r\n"
