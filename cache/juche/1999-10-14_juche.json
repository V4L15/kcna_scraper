He added that the inexhaustible strength of the Korean people who have risen in the noble effort to create a new era of great history makes the Korean revolution ever-victorious and will result in the successful building of a powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He called for converting the saltern with favorable conditions for production and good prospects for development into a model of modern salterns. He solved problems in developing the saltern in a prospective way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He described the saltern as a very important enterprise directly related to the people's life. He gave important tasks to manage the saltern in a scientific and technical way and increase the production constantly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He had a picture taken with people who had performed feats in the construction of the saltern. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He was accompanied by secretaries Kim Kuk Thae, Kim Ki Nam and Kim Yong Sun and first vice department directors Ri Yong Chol, Jang Song Thaek and Choe Chun Hwang of the WPK Central Committee. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He was greeted by chief secretary of the south Hamgyong provincial committee of the WPK Ri Thae Nam, chairman of the south Hamgyong provincial people's committee Kim Phung Gi and other senior officials of the province and the saltern. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n"

This is one of the reasons why the proposal is the best way of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Different ideas and social systems have existed in the north and south of Korea. So, if any of the north and the south absolutizes its own ideology and social system or tries to force them on the other side, the reunification will never be achieved forever and it will lead to fratricidal war. Therefore, the north and the south should not absolutize or give priority to their own idea and system, but seek the common interests of the nation, trust each other and solve the issue of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The reunification through confederacy is more urgent because the separatist forces at home and abroad are now getting frantic in their moves for confrontation, division and war against the nation's cause of reunification. \r\n\r\n"

In a short period they built 32-odd km long embankment with millions of cubic metres of earth to dam off the rough sea and constructed hundreds of hectares of saltern and hundreds of structures. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"Kwangmyongsong saltern\" will help toward more sufficiently providing salt which is keenly necessary for development of the chemical industry of the country and local industry of the province and for the people's living. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The WPK Central Committee sent a congratulatory message to the young builders and helpers who performed exploits in the construction of the saltern. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Meanwhile, the Sonhung Foodstuff Factory was built in time-honored Mangyongdae area and put into operation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This factory with a total floor space of 2,000 square metres is one of comprehensive foodstuff production bases. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAll its production processes including the raw material feeding, processing and packing have been modernized. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The factory produces delicious and highly nutritious foodstuffs with its own raw materials. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Chonnae Salt Refinery in Kangwon Province was commissioned. \r\n\r\n"

Despite a number of difficulties, they finally completed tiered greenhouse 650 square metres wide. Humus-pot seedlings of red radish were grown as the first crop, potato as the second and humus-pot seedlings of white cabbages as the third. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The per-hectare yields of spring radish and potatoes were 20 and 45 tons respectively, and those of autumn vegetables are estimated at 100 tons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The greenhouse is also an efficient vegetable producer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The farm paid close attention to the improvement of soil fertility, the key to successful three-crop farming. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It pushed forward the output of bio-active manure and fermented manure with microbial liquid and got every work-team to produce slaked lime from kilns, so as to spread sufficient manure on the fields.
