            "content": "Kim Jong Il Inspects Industrial Establishments in Kanggye\r\n Pyongyang, December 10 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il provided field guidance to industrial establishments in Kanggye City. \n\t\t\t\t\t The first leg of his guidance was the Jangjagang Machine Tool Factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After being briefed on the modernization of the factory, he went round various shops of the factory and new products to learn in detail about the technical updating and production there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He repeatedly praised the officials, workers and technicians of the factory for having done a lot of work in a matter of one year, noting that the appearance of the factory has radically changed and all the production processes have been successfully placed on a modern and scientific basis and a high level of cultured practices ensured in production and life in a short span of time. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The party members and other working people of the factory have overfulfilled their production quotas on indices by effectively carrying out the technological updating by their own efforts and with their own technology to suit its actual conditions, he said, adding that the scientific and technological progress made by the factory is a striking proof of the validity and vitality of the WPK's idea of attaching importance to science.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed that it is possible to attain any difficult scientific and technological goal at one go when one makes persevering efforts, giving priority to the scientific and technological development just as the workers of the factory did. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He set forth important tasks to be fulfilled by the factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underscored the need to steadily wage a drive for putting the factory on a modern and scientific basis as required by the IT age and, at the same time, pay primary attention to introducing the latest science and technology, rapidly raise the level of technical skills of the producers and strictly abide by the technical rules and the standard regulations of operation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The next leg of his guidance was the Kanggye Knitting Mill.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After going round the room devoted to the history of the mill, he visited the general shop, the dyeing shop, a dining room and a non-staple food store and other places to acquaint himself in detail with the production and supply service at the mill.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching varieties of knit goods of diverse beautiful colors being churned out, he said that the mill is not a big one having small manpower, but it has contributed to improving the standard of people's living by widely introducing new technology and profitably managing itself. He appreciated the assiduous way it has managed its economic life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed the need to steadily boost the production as solving the issue of clothing is as important as settling the food problem. He proposed the tasks to be carried out by the mill. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Only when the party policy on producing knitwear is thoroughly implemented in the field of light industry, is it possible to boost the production of textiles and garment with less materials and make the people's dressing diverse, he noted, underlining the need for the mill to increase the production of varieties of quality knitwear to the likings of people to help improve the standard of people's living. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After being told that Manager Kang Song Hwa and other officials of the mill received orphans who graduated from their school and took deep care of them, helping them emerge proud labor innovators, he said they are, indeed, possessors of good personalities with a noble view on life and morality and sense of obligation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The last leg of his guidance was the Kanggye Wine Factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round the newly-built beer shop, storing room and various other places of the factory to learn in detail about the equipment and production there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was greatly satisfied to learn that the factory has not only steadily boosted the production by updating the production processes and increasing its capacity but successfully set up new production processes including those for the production of beer and raw rice wine.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The factory has steadily lifted the production and strictly abided by the principle of profitability in its management by waging a widespread mass technical innovation movement and establishing a production system relying on its locally available raw materials, he said, adding that the experience gained by the factory goes to prove that the introduction of science and technology precisely means production and vice versa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He put forward important tasks to be carried out by the factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underscored the need for the factory to continue dynamically pushing ahead with the modernization and scientification of the production processes and effectively conduct the work for helping the officials, workers and technicians acquire the latest science and technology in order to steadily increase the production. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that it is necessary to provide the factory with sufficient quantities of raw and other materials in order to keep it going at a high rate, he pointed out that to this end it is essential to improve grape seeds and the manuring and tending of them to boost the production of quality grapes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said it is important for the factory to preserve the taste of its special product wine peculiar to it as it has a long history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Underlining the need to realize specializing in production in order to improve the quality of the product, he called for independently developing beer, raw rice wine and other production processes as its branches.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The people of Jagang Province turned its cities and villages into fairylands by their own efforts in the hard days of \"the Arduous March\", the forced march and are now dashing ahead in sky-high spirit as frontrankers in the drive for building a great prosperous and powerful nation, he noted, extending a warm salute to all the officials, party members and other working people of the province. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Noting that Jagang Province is witnessing miracles and feats marveling the world people day by day, he said that this stirring reality is a brilliant fruition of the great Kanggye spirit and revelation of the inexhaustible mental power of the Korean people who inherited the spirit of Mt. Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed expectation and conviction that the working people of the province including those in Kanggye City would continue creditably playing a vanguard role in the gigantic drive for building a thriving nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Pak To Chun, chief secretary of the Jagang Provincial Committee of the WPK, Kim Ki Nam, secretary of the C.C., the WPK, and Kim Kyong Hui, Pak Nam Gi and Jang Song Thaek, department directors of the C.C., the WPK."
