Therefore, the Korean people could have the genuine revolutionary army led by the outstanding leader for the first time in history and this marked the starting point of the glorious history of the Korean revolution which was pioneered and has advanced victoriously by dint of the arms. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t President Kim Il Sung brought up the KPRA to be a powerful driving force of the anti-Japanese national-liberation struggle and core force of the Songun revolution in the flames of the anti-Japanese revolution and defeated the brigandish Japanese imperialists who made desperate efforts styling themselves the \"leader\" of Asia and thus accomplished the historical cause of the country's liberation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Despite the complicated situation of building a new country after the liberation, he successfully realized the cause of building the regular armed forces in a short span of time and led to victory the great Fatherland Liberation War while holding fast to the arms of Songun in order to shatter the myth of \"mightiness\" of the U.S. imperialists who boasted of a war history of aggression that lasted more than a century and thus created the myth of war victory in the 20th century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He consistently adhered to the idea of attaching importance to the arms and the principle of giving priority to the military affairs during the whole period of the revolutionary leadership, developed the KPA into the army of the party that thoroughly established the party's monolithic ideological system and into the powerful revolutionary armed forces all members of which were trained to be cadres and which were put on a modern basis, and turned the DPRK into an impregnable fortress and bulwark of independence by successfully putting all the people under arms and turning the whole country into a fortress.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The cause of army-building of Juche started on Mt. Paektu was developed in depth onto a new stage thanks to the outstanding Songun revolutionary guidance of leader Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to his outstanding and tested leadership, the KPA has grown stronger in terms of thought and faith guided by the Juche idea and Songun idea and the powerful revolutionary Paektusan army firmly armed with Korean-style strategy and tactics and war methods and equipped with modern offensive and defensive means. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The KPA has greeted the golden age of bolstering up the revolutionary armed forces as they are led by Marshal Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Once the weak colonial nation oppressed by the aggressors with its sovereignty deprived by the aggressors due to the weak arms has developed into the world-level military power and the nuclear power of Juche that no one dares provoke, striking terror into the imperialist reactionaries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists introduced strategic weapons into south Korea in a bid to stage frantic joint military drills against the DPRK and brought the clouds of a nuclear war to hang over Korea, escalating the situation to an extreme phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppet warmongers persistently stage nuclear provocation aimed to hurt the supreme leadership of the revolution despite the repeated warnings of the DPRK, the powerful revolutionary Paektusan army will launch a preemptive strike of severest punishment in the sky, land, seas and underwater without any restriction and without any warning and prior notice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The enemies have to clearly understand that the strike of the Korean People's Army which regards it as the greatest mission to devotedly safeguard the leader knows no mercy and this will be continued nonstop until the historic cause of national reunification is accomplished and the root cause of aggression and evil is totally eliminated."

            "content": "DPRK FM Speaks at Signature Ceremony for Paris Agreement on Issue of Climate Change\r\nPyongyang, April 24 (KCNA) -- DPRK Foreign Minister Ri Su Yong made a speech at the Signature Ceremony for Paris Agreement on the Issue of Climate Change held at the UN Headquarters on April 22.\n\t\t\t\t\t He said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) has signed the Paris Agreement. It stems from its intention to join the international efforts to resolve the issue of climate change as well as from its belief that the Agreement will be successfully implemented.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A touch-and-go dangerous situation prevails on the Korean peninsula due to the reckless nuclear war drills by the U.S. and its followers and their vicious attempts to stifle the DPRK by means of sanctions. Even under such circumstances, the DPRK government is exerting its great efforts to make active contributions to the protection of the global environment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Following the farsighted vision and outstanding leadership of the respected Comrade Kim Jong Un, first Chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK, we have declared the reforestation as a war with nature and are engaged in an all-our campaign a nationwide scale.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has set a plan to afforest and reforest 1.67 million hectares of mountain areas by 2024, which means a yearly capacity of reducing 10 million tons of greenhouse gas will be newly created by means of forest's efficient absorption of the greenhouse gas.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is also under the national attention that the DPRK government is formulating a workable plan to decrease the greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, a target to be voluntarily observed under the Paris Agreement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK government will continue to pay due attention to resolve the issue of global climate change under the principle of giving priority to the sound development of the economy and improvement of people's living standard.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The goals set forth by the Paris Agreement are not easy to achieve nor can they be reached by themselves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Signing of the Agreement is of significance, but what is more important is for all the signatories to work together with political commitment to accomplish the goals. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this regard, the DPRK delegation believes we have to pay the foremost attention to the following issues.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t First, in order to resolve the global environmental problem, it is crucial to pay primary attention to ensuring peace and security of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The current extremely dangerous situation on the Korean Peninsula caused by the U.S. consistent nuclear war drills shows that, without ensuring world peace and stability, we cannot expect successful solution to any other issues.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Second, economic powers that are responsible for most of global greenhouse gas emissions have to make voluntary plans to dramatically reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and faithfully implement their plans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Right now, majority of the global carbon emissions is produced by only a handful of countries. Such being the situation, it is self-evident that, without sincere efforts and contributions from these countries, we cannot achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Third, the developed countries should feel their historical responsibilities of the current climate change and support the developing countries in the efforts to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is important to take practical steps to implement the Paris Agreement including establishment of an institutional mechanism to raise sufficient funds for the global efforts for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a signatory to the United Nations Convention on Climate Change, the DPRK will continue to fulfil its responsibilities and duties in the efforts to protect the global environment and resolve the climate change problem."

\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFueron invitados los representantes diplomaticos de varios paises y los agregados militares, acreditados en la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl informe de la ocasion estuvo a cargo del vicemariscal del Ejercito Popular de Corea Ri Myong Su, jefe del Estado Mayor General del EPC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl dijo que el 25 de abril del 21 (1932) de la Era Juche fue fundado el Ejercito Revolucionario Popular de Corea, primeras fuerzas armadas revolucionarias de tipo jucheano, gracias a lo cual el pueblo coreano pudo contar por primera vez en su historia nacional con el verdadero ejercito revolucionario guiado por el destacado lider y desde entonces se inicio la historia gloriosa de la revolucion coreana allanada y avanzada victoriosamente con las fuerzas armadas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el fragor de la lucha armada antijaponesa el Presidente Kim Il Sung desarrollo el ERPC como fuerte grueso de la lucha antijaponesa por la liberacion nacional y pilar de la revolucion del Songun, y a base de ello, logro la historica causa de la liberacion de la patria tras derrotar al imperialismo japones que se autodenominaba como \"caudillo\" de Asia, recordo y continuo:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDespues de liberacion de la patria, el Presidente realizo con brillantez en un corto tiempo de plazo la causa de construccion de las fuerzas armadas regulares aun en medio de la situacion complicada de la construccion de nueva patria. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY al conducir con las fuerzas armadas del Songun a la victoria la gran Guerra de Liberacion de la Patria, rompio el mito de \"invencibilidad\" del imperialismo norteamericano que se jactaba de su \"supremacia\" en la historia de guerra de agresion de mas de un siglo y creo el mito de victoria del siglo XX. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante todo el periodo de su direccion sobre la revolucion, mantuvo invariablemente la idea de dar importancia a las fuerzas armadas y el principio de priorizar los asuntos militares, fortalecio el EPC como ejercito del partido basado en el sistema de unica ideologia de esta agrupacion politica y como poderosas fuerzas armadas revolucionarias modernizadas y convertidas en el ejercito de cuadros, asi como logro el armamento de todo el pueblo y la fortificacion de todo el pais, de modo que la patria se ha convertido en una fortaleza inexpugnable y baluarte de la independencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa autoctona causa de construccion del ejercito, iniciada en la selva del monte Paektu, se desarrollo y se profundizo en nueva etapa elevada gracias a la destacada orientacion del Dirigente Kim Jong Il sobre la revolucion mediante el Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo la destacada y probada guia del Dirigente, el EPC se desarrollo como poderoso ejercito revolucionario del monte Paektu armado con la idea Juche, la del Songun y con las estrategias, tacticas y metodos de combate al estilo coreano y dotado de modernos medios de ataque y defensa. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy dia, el EPC acoge la era dorada de su fortalecimiento, gracias a tener al Comandante Supremo Kim Jong Un. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestra patria que era pais pequeno colonial debil privado de la soberania nacional por parte de los invasores se ha convertido en la potencia militar de talla mundial, potencia nuclear del Juche que tiembla a los reaccionarios imperialistas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora los imperialistas norteamericanos libran freneticos ejercicios belicos conjuntos anti-RPDC introduciendo sin titubeos los armamentos estrategicos en el suelo surcoreano y acarrean el nubarron de guerra nuclear sobre el territorio  patrio agravando extremadamente la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi los imperialistas yanquis y los belicistas surcoreanos siguen recurriendo al alboroto nuclear contra la Direccion Suprema de la Revolucion Coreana, pese a nuestra reiterada advertencia, el ejercito revolucionario sin rival del monte Paektu asestara el golpe preventivo mas horrible en el cielo, la tierra, el mar y en la profundidad del mar sin restriccion alguna ni la advertencia ni el aviso previo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos enemigos deben tener presente que el ataque del EPC con la mision de defender a riesgo de vida al lider no tiene la piedad y continuara ininterrumpidamente hasta que se cumpla la historica causa de la reunificacion de la patria y se elimine completamente la fuente de agresion y males."
