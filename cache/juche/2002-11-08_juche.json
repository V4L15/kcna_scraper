The United States should understand this and stop threatening the DPRK.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is entitled to have not only nuclear weapon but other things more powerful than that to defend its sovereignty and right to existence from the U.S. ever-growing nuclear threat, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's proposal to conclude a non-aggression treaty with the United States is a just measure to defend its sovereignty and right to existence. If the United States encroaches on the DPRK sovereignty, putting pressure on it to disarm itself, its people's army and people would strongly counter it in a do-or-die spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is their unshakable faith and will to firmly defend their sovereignty and right to existence under the army-based policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They will staunchly fight to remove the threat to their sovereignty and right to existence.

            "content": "KCNA urges Japan to remain true to DPRK-Japan declaration\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 8 (KCNA) -- In the wake of the DPRK-Japan intergovernmental talks held in Kuala Lumpur on Oct. 29 and 30 there is a wide-spread story in Japan that it will redress  its past only after outstanding issues are solved.\r\n Japan raised the already settled issue of abduction and a nuclear issue to be solved between the DPRK and the U.S. as outstanding issues, thus throwing an artificial obstacle in the way of normalizing the bilateral ties. Lurking behind this is a sinister political intention of hard-liners of Japan to hamstring the implementation of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang declaration at the instigation of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This can not be construed otherwise than a deliberate move to shelve the issue of redressing its past, the most outstanding issue, by painting an assailant as a victim in violation of the basic spirit of the declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The core of the outstanding issues to be solved between the DPRK and Japan from the political, moral and legal points of view is for Japan to make an apology and compensation for the huge political, moral, material and human damage done to the Korean people by Japan and the thrice-cursed crimes it committed during its occupation of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is indisputable that there came the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang declaration and the issue of kidnapped Japanese could be smoothly settled as Japan clarified its will to solve this issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unpleasant things happened between the two countries in the 20th century because Japan has not yet redeemed its crime-woven past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unprecedented massacres, forced drafting, state-sponsored horrible sexual slavery, unlimited economic plunder and other crimes the Japanese imperialists committed against the Koreans have touched off the latter's bitter hatred and enmity against Japan and hardened their determination to force it to pay for those crimes. This bitterness has grown stronger after the war in particular, as Japan has pursued a hostile policy toward the DPRK, refusing to redeem its past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan had redeemed its past soon after its defeat as other defeated nations did and established good-neighborly relations with the DPRK, such a regrettable thing as the issue of kidnapping would have not cropped up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has been generous enough to limit Japan's redress for its past to apology and economic cooperation and found a solution to the issue of kidnapped Japanese as wished by the Japanese side, prompted by the desire to normalize the bilateral relations from a broad perspective in order to achieve peace, stability and sustained economic progress in Northeast Asia in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese hard-liners are seriously mistaken if they think they can use the DPRK's generous approach as a political opportunity to meet their unreasonable demand, taking it for a sort of concession. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The prerequisite for normalizing the relations between the DPRK and Japan is Japan's settlement of its past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Repeating the foolish assertion that \"the ball is in someone's court\" or \"someone has a trump card\" without redeeming the past would only raise more serious issues.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
