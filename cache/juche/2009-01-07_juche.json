            "content": "What Is Massacre Aimed at\r\nPyongyang, January 7 (KCNA) -- Israel is steadily escalating its brutal military attacks on Gaza Strip of Palestine, turning a deaf ear to the strong protest and condemnation of the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe operation started on December 27 last year with an air raid involving more than 60 fighters and armed helicopters and it entered a ground operation on January 3.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIsraeli ground force of three-brigade scale including tanks and infantry units broke into various areas of Gaza Strip on the night of January 3 to launch into a bloody operation of genocide and destruction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The indiscriminate artillery and air strikes and other military actions of the Israeli forces had left 514 Palestinians dead and more than 2,600 wounded and reduced many public institutions and buildings to ruins in Gaza Strip by last Sunday.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe spokesman for the Israeli army blared that the operation was aimed at destroying the infrastructure of Hamas, the Palestinian political and military organization controlling Gaza Strip.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe reckless military action of Israel escalating the inhuman massacre of Palestinians from the beginning of the new year under the cloak of \"anti-terrorism\" is calling forth anger and denunciation against Israel and the United States worldwide.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tArab and Islamic countries strongly demand that Israel promptly stop its military operation in Gaza Strip causing humanitarian disaster, saying it is immediately an attack on cities of all Arab countries and a criminal act destroying the Mid-east peace process.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDemonstrations and rallies condemning Israel's acts of aggression and the unjustifiable Mid-east policy of the United States are sweeping Asia, Europe, Latin America and rest of the world, to say nothing of Mid-east.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNoting that the criminal acts of the Israeli army resulted from the policy of the U.S. imperialists for gratifying their aggressive ambition on the Palestinian territory and Mid-east countries by manipulating Israel, the Bolivian President said the U.S. should abandon its despicable scheme to push its aggressive policy through its satellite forces like Israel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEntirely right is this voice of condemnation of the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNow the U.S. is defending Israel's acts of genocide, claiming that Israel has \"the right to self-defense\" and Hamas is \"a terrorist organization\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tVice-president of the U.S. Cheney in his radio interview on January 4 went the lengths of blabbing that the air-raid operation on Gaza Strip was not enough and Israel was right in deciding to launch into a ground operation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. already in September last year allowed Israel to purchase 1,000 GPS-guided missiles, called GBU-39, to be used in bombings on Gaza Strip. These missiles arrived in Israel in early December before the start of air strikes and they were the main means of strike in the air-raid, the first stage of the current military operation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWith this patronage of the U.S., Israel tightened the blockade of Gaza Strip last year and killed armed personnel of Hamas on November 4, which forced Hamas to resume its rocket and mortar attacks on the northern area of Israel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis led to the total destruction of the truce which had been maintained, though perfunctorily, between Hamas and Israel from June 2008. Israel, as if it had been waiting for it, made it a pretext to carry its plan of massive military attacks on Gaza Strip into practice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIsrael and the U.S. are pursuing several political and military purposes through the operation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA general election is slated in Israel on February 10. Yet the ruling Kadima Party appears disturbed over the scandal of the Prime Minister and the support rate to it is woefully low.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Israeli authorities seek to stave off the crisis within the party and boost its \"popularity\" through the military adventures at the expense of the Palestinians.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFrom the military point of view, they regard the operation as an important chance of recovering from its miserable setback in the 2006 Lebanese War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe current operation may be called the second war by proxy to be provoked by the present U.S. administration in the Mid-east through Israel during its eight-year office.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Bush administration has tried by hook or by crook to turn the Mid-east peace process into an \"anti-terrorism war\" for establishing an order of its exclusive sway in the region, but to no avail.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. is trying to cover up its defeat in its Mid-east policy by means of focusing the world's attention on the \"terrorism\" of Hamas and beating the drum of \"anti-terrorism war\" more loudly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is not a mere accident that the U.S. is branding Hamas as a \"terrorist organization\" and justifying the military attacks on it, challenging the international opinion condemning the anti-human crimes of Israel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe aggressive and dominationist Mid-east policy of Israel and the U.S. which regard the Palestinians and the Mid-east peace process as a scapegoat on the altar of their political strategy will result in further isolating them in the international arena."

            "content": "ATCC condena la operacion genocida de Israel contra Palestina\r\nPyongyang, 7 de enero (ATCC) -- Pese a la fuerte protesta y denuncia de la sociedad internacional, Israel sigue ampliando su barbaro ataque armado contra la franja de Gaza de Palestina.\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta operacion iniciada con el ataque aereo del 27 de diciembre del ano pasado, en que fueron movilizados mas de 60 cazas y helicopteros armados, dio paso a la invasion terrestre al cabo de 8 dias de bombardeo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl dia 3 por la noche, las tropas terrestres israelies equivalentes a 3 brigadas incluyendo los tanques y la infanteria invadieron varias zonas de la franja de Gaza y cometieron la ensangrentada operacion de matanza y destruccion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHasta el dia 4, por el indiscriminado bombardeo y canoneo del ejercito israeli, resultaron muertos 514 palestinos y heridos mas de 2 mil 600 y se redujeron a escombros muchos establecimientos publicos y edificios de Gaza.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl portavoz del ejercito israeli argumento que el objetivo de esta operacion es destruir la infraestructura de HAMAS, organizacion politico-militar de Palestina que controla la franja de Gaza.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa aventura belica de Israel, que desde el comienzo del ano nuevo, amplia sus acciones militares de lesa humanidad contra los palestinos bajo el pretexto del \"antiterrorismo\", produce en el ambito mundial la indignacion y condena a este pais sionista y EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos paises arabes e islamicos demandan fuertemente a Israel el cese inmediato de esa operacion militar que causa desastres humanitarios en Gaza, senalando que ella deviene el ataque contra las ciudades de todos los paises arabes, siendo el acto criminal para llevar al fracaso total el proceso de paz del Medio Oriente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas de esta area, se escenifican en estos dias en todas las regiones del mundo incluyendo Asia, Europa y America Latina las manifestaciones y mitines de condena a la agresion israeli y la injusta politica de EE.UU. sobre el Medio Oriente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCondenando el ataque israeli contra Gaza, el presidente boliviano demando al gobierno norteamericano dejar de imponer sus politicas agresivas en el Medio Oriente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tContinuo que lo que hace el imperialismo norteamericano por medio de Israel es esa criminal invasion sobre las ciudades palestinas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsevero que Israel debe cambiar sus politicas y el gobierno estadounidense ha de dejar de usar a los paises como Israel para invadir a los paises que estan buscando su liberacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSenalo que la matanza no es la solucion del nuevo milenio e Israel no debe seguir siendo un aparato del imperialismo norteamericano para humillar al pueblo palestino.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs sumamente justa tal voz de la sociedad internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora, EE.UU. ampara la matanza del pais hebreo diciendo que este tiene el \"derecho a la autodefensa\" y HAMAS es una \"organizacion terrorista\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la entrevista concedida el dia 4 con una cadena radioemisora, el vicepresidente norteamericano Cheney dijo que es insuficiente la operacion de ataque aereo sobre la franja de Gaza y hasta califico de correcta la decision de Israel de lanzar la invasion terrestre.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa en septiembre del ano pasado, EE.UU. aprobo la venta a Israel de mil bombas \"GBU-39\", que fueron arribadas al pais sionista a principios de diciembre en visperas del bombardeo y se usaron como principal medio de golpe en esta operacion aerea que resulto la primera etapa de la presente invasion contra Palestina.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGracias al amparo del imperio, Israel endurecio el ano pasado el bloqueo contra la franja de Gaza y asesino el 4 de noviembre a los militantes de HAMAS obligando a esta reanudar el lanzamiento de proyectiles-cohete y morteros contra la zona septentrional de Israel. Como resultado, fue rota completamente la tregua entre HAMAS e Israel que se mantenia nominalmente desde junio de 2008.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto fue aprovechado por el pais hebreo como pretexto para realizar su plan de ataque militar de gran envergadura contra la franja de Gaza.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA traves de esta operacion, Israel y EE.UU. persiguen varios objetivos politicos y militares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTendran lugar el 10 de febrero las elecciones generales en Israel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido al escandalo de corrupcion del premier, el partido gobernante Kadima se halla en el desorden y sufre la caida del porcentaje de apoyo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor eso, las autoridades israelies se vieron en la necesidad de lanzar esa aventura militar contra palestinos para salir de la crisis en que cayo su partido y ganar mas \"popularidad\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde el punto de vista militar, ellas tratan de aprovecharla como importante chance para reparar su derrota en la guerra con el Libano de 2006.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe puede decir que la operacion militar israeli es la segunda guerra que la actual administracion norteamericana provoco en 8 anos de su mandato en el Medio Oriente a traves de sus titeres sionistas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa administracion Bush fracaso en su intento de convertir el proceso de paz del Medio Oriente en el de \"guerra antiterrorista\" para establecer en esta area el orden de dominio monopolista de EE.UU. aunque recurrio a las intrigas de toda indole.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA fin de disimular el fracaso de su politica sobre el Medio Oriente, el imperio defiende acaloradamente su \"guerra antiterrorista\" llamando la atencion mundial al \"terrorismo\" de HAMAS.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo es casual que EE.UU. justificara el ataque militar a HAMAS calificandola de \"organizacion terrorista\" en desafio a la opinion publica internacional que condena ese acto anti-etico de Israel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa agresiva y dominacionista politica de Israel y EE.UU. sobre el Medio Oriente, que toma como victima de su estrategia politica a los palestinos y el proceso de paz de esta region, no dara otro resultado que el aislamiento de si mismos en la arena mundial."
