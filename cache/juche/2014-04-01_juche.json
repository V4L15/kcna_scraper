            "content": "Japan's Moves for Nuclear Weaponization Can Never Be Tolerated: KCNA Commentary\r\n Pyongyang, April 1 (KCNA) -- Some days ago, the deputy director of the strategic planning bureau at Japan's Ministry of Defense said that the DPRK's mobile nuclear capability may increase the danger. He even went the lengths of asserting that Japan should strengthen its deterrent focusing on \"threat from north Korea\".\n\t\t\t\t\t Whenever an opportunity presents itself, Japan has pulled up the DPRK over the strengthening of its military power, calling for \"Japan's possession of striking ability\" allegedly to cope with it. And it had already stipulated its \"possession of striking ability\" in \"defense programme guidelines\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is needless to say that such moves of Japan are prompted by a dangerous scheme to find an excuse for its independent nuclear weaponization, though the islands are put under the U.S. nuclear umbrella.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the present world, any country should adduce political or military reasons proper for its access to nukes, like infringement upon its security or fundamental interests by others. But Japan has no justification for it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan has long been proud of being put under the protection of nuclear umbrella provided by its master, the U.S. Therefore, Japan's hue and cry over threat from others makes no sense.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Furthermore, there is no country forcing a nuclear war on Japan in the world. In a word, Japan has neither reason nor justification for the possession of nukes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, Japan has regarded its access to nukes as one of its strategic goals since its defeat in the Second World War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The militaristic reactionaries of Japan, who ascribed its defeat in the war to its failure in possessing nuclear weapons, had made desperate efforts to make legal and material preparations for nuclear weaponization. It was clearly evidenced by the fact that former Japanese Prime Minister Sato, at a meeting with the then U.S. president in January 1965, denounced China's nuclear test and clamored for Japan's possession of nukes against China's possession of nukes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now Japan takes the third place in the list of atomic energy giants after acquiring all necessary nuclear facilities and the fifth place in the list of plutonium possessors. It has also many competent nuclear technicians and capabilities to launch inter-continental ballistic rocket.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan has already removed all legal and institutional hurdles standing in the way of possessing nuclear weapons. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Foreign media are commenting that Japan's nuclear ability would surpass the U.S. in the near future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under these circumstances, it is the last step for Japan to get a justification for its possession of nukes to be accepted by the international community. To this end, Japan is making no bones to take issue with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a cunning plot of the Japanese reactionaries to justify Japan's hostile policy toward the DPRK and its nuclear weaponization under the pretext of \"nuclear threat from north Korea\" and thus launch nuclear preemptive attack upon it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is mistaken if it thinks that it can materialize its sinister scheme for access to nukes in the plea of deceptive \"security threat\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The progressive people of the world will never pardon Japan's dangerous moves for nuclear weaponization."

When counting the damage done by them according to the standard to be applied for getting reparation for the sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army, it stood at a total of more than hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars as of early in the 2000s. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The horrible threat posed by the U.S. troops to the life and right to existence of the people in the areas under their occupation amounts to human right abuses which should no longer be overlooked. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The oil which leaked from the U.S. forces base in Ryongsan of Seoul in 2001 has contaminated since then the land covering over 12,200 square meters. A survey of underground water around the areas said carcinogenic substance was over 1,300 times higher than the tolerance limit. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A survey of soil in the U.S. military base in Kunsan in North Jolla Province and areas around it revealed that the soil contaminated by oil was 26 times the tolerance limit. Toxic substance exceeding over 30 times the tolerance limit was discovered in the U.S. base in Waegwan in Chilgok County, North Kyongsang Province. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is preposterous, indeed, for the U.S. to dare find fault with the DPRK, trumpeting about \"defense of human rights\" though it trained anti-human rights gangsters keen on murder, arson, destruction and plunder."
