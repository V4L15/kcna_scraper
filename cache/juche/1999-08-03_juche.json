His remarks, in essence,  openly revealed their attempt to find a pretext to amass aggression forces in the Korean peninsula, round off the U.S.-Japan-South Korea \"cooperation\" system as a \"triangular military alliance\" system for a preemptive attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The touch-and-go situation prevailing on the Korean peninsula  reminds one of a time bomb that may go off any moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. has never gone to such extremes in its military moves as today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The present situation compels us to maintain a higher vigilance and stronger revolutionary stand than ever before. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We wanted to approach the United States with good faith if it showed good faith. Cohen, however, intends to treat the DPRK with the same \"club\" as they wielded in Iraq and Kosovo, interpreting our magnanimity and generosity as an expression of weakness and a lack of will. It is a serious miscalculation and a ridiculous gambling. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nOur armed forces and single-hearted unity which have become invincible thanks to our party's high-priority army politics, our party's army-first revolutionary leadership regard it as their inborn quality and intrinsic mode of counteraction to return fire for fire and artillery fire for pistol fire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nFor the United States to return challenge for our good faith will encourage us to significantly increase our national defence capabilities and continue to push ahead with the missile test-fire, to say nothing of satellite launch. \r\n \r\n"
