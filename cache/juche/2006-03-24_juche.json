And it should close down all secret prisons in different parts of the world including the Baghram Prison in Afghanistan and the prison of the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo as well as the Abu Ghraib Prison. Far from doing so, however, the U.S. is now resorting to a sleight of hand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to an announcement made by the U.S. forces in Iraq, the prisoners in the Abu Ghraib Prison will be transferred to a new facility under construction near the Baghdad International Airport where former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and others are held in custody. In the long run, the U.S. is intending to build a new concentration camp of such type as the Abu Ghraib Prison instead of closing it.\r\n It is not hard to guess what the U.S. pursues in building a new prison near the international airport in view of the fact that the U.S. operates secret prisons via airports in European countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By closing down the controversial prison the U.S. seeks to calm down the anti-Americanism of the international community and cover up its dirty colors as human rights abuser, but such a clumsy gimmick will never go down with the world as bright as today.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed commentary.\r\n The commander of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces present in south Korea said at a hearing of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee that the U.S. would further increase the role of the \"UN Command\" to convert it into a \"multinational coalition command\", the commentary notes, and says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has worked hard to further expand the \"UN Command\", which had been deprived of any justification to stay long ago. Lurking behind the move is a heinous and wicked scheme. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for this \"command\", it is no more than a puppet body of the U.S. as it has neither any legal ground nor justification for its existence. That was why a resolution calling for the disbandment of the \"command\" was adopted at the 30th UN General Assembly. As the former UN secretary general did, a spokesman for the incumbent UN secretary general recently made it clear that the \"UN Command\" in south Korea does not represent the UN forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This notwithstanding, the U.S. has cried for the increased role of the \"UN Command\", instead of dissolving it. It is preposterous, indeed. What should not be overlooked is that the U.S. intends to invite those countries involved in the \"command\" to work out an operational plan to cope with contingency and participate in detailed activities to implement it. By doing so, it seeks to increase the role of the \"command\" and disguise it as a \"multinational coalition command\" in a bid to use it as a tool for its war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world peace-loving people are becoming increasingly supportive of the DPRK's positive step for demanding the dissolution of the \"UN Command\". The U.S. should no longer insist on keeping the \"command\", but disband it at an early date and withdraw its forces from south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will bolster up its military deterrent to counter the daily escalating moves of the U.S. for aggression.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Engraved on the monument are more than 1,400 characters recording the details of the brigandish invasion of Korea by Japan, the formation and expansion of the Hamgyong Provincial volunteers' army by General Jong Mun Bu and its victory in battle.\r\n The foundation stone of the monument was discovered and ascertained the historical evidence while making preparation for its restoration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists looted in 1905 the monument, precious cultural asset associated with wisdom, courage and patriotic spirit of the Korean nation.\r\n The people of north and south Korea, who are advancing along the road of national unity in the idea \"By our nation itself\" under the banner of the June 15 north-south joint declaration, took back the monument last year by their concerted efforts. And the DPRK had made every preparation for restoring the monument to its original state on the principle of historicism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A ceremony for erecting the monument was held on the spot Thursday.\r\n Present at the ceremony were Kim Sok Hwan, director of the Bureau for Direction of Cultural Preservation, who is chairman of the Measure Committee for Retaking the \"Monument to the Victory in the Battle in the Northern Area of Korea\", the Rev. Sim Sang Jin, vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Buddhist Federation, who is standing vice-chairman of the Measure Committee for Retaking the \"Monument to the Victory in the Battle in the Northern Area of Korea\", Ri Pok Il , chairman of the Kim Chaek City People's Committee, officials concerned and working people of the city.\r\n Speeches were made there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After being briefed about the monument, the participants went round it.\r\n The monument was registered as historical relics of national treasure of the DPRK No. 193. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The monument will be preserved forever as a valuable monument to the victory in the patriotic war showing the righteous and strong-willed Korean nation's history of struggle and as an evidence of history indicting the barbarous destruction and predatory acts of historical relics by the Japanese imperialists.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Joint War Exercises\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 23 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued a statement Thursday to denounce the U.S. bellicose group and the south Korean authorities for planning to stage large-scale RSOI and \"Foal Eagle\" joint military exercises across south Korea from Mar. 25 to 31. \r\n The war maneuvers will involve the U.S. troops in its mainland, in south Korea and overseas, more than 20,000 in all, as well as huge south Korean forces.\r\n Dismissing the exercises as aggressive and adventurous saber-rattling for a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK from A to Z, the statement goes on:\r\n Latest war means including Stealth fighter bombers and a nuclear-powered carrier and huge field troops of the U.S. are being hurled into south Korea and waters around it, something unprecedented in recent years, to stage madcap offensive exercises of various forms simulating an actual war such as landing, river-crossing, aerial attack and advance deep into the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. decision to let carrier Abraham Lincoln and its task flotilla participate in the exercises goes to clearly indicate what reckless and dangerous phase the U.S. moves for a preemptive attack have reached as it is a sort of demonstration of its military muscle before the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration pressurized the south Korean authorities to agree on the \"strategic flexibility\" of the U.S. forces present in south Korea. And it readopted the \"theory of a preemptive attack\" as the doctrine of the national security policy in its wake. It is quite obvious that the saber-rattling the Bush administration is going to launch against this backdrop will threaten regional peace and security and adversely affect the favorably developing north-south relations as it envisages wartime operations in the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is gravely mistaken if it calculates that to procrastinate, while tightening sanctions against the DPRK and escalating the tension, would help induce the DPRK to make a sort of switchover in its stand but it is not only the Bush warlike group that will benefit from this delay. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the U.S. intention to stifle the DPRK has become very clear, the DPRK will react to it with a strong measure for self-defence.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
