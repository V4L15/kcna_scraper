            "content": "U.S. urged to reexamine its policy of confrontation with DPRK\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- Though ten years have passed since the publication of the DPRK-U.S. New York joint statement, no article of the statement has been implemented but the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula has got more serious and the DPRK-U.S. hostile relations have been further bedevilled.\r\n Rrodong Ssinmun today says this in a commentator's article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is entirely to blame for this, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation on the Korean Peninsula has reached the extreme pitch of tension contrary to the expectation of the people owing to the perfidious, self-righteous and unilateral act of the U.S. that has scrapped the statement and pursued a hostile policy to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The core of the joint statement calls on both sides to refrain from using force including nuclear weapons against each other or threatening each other with such force and respect each other's sovereignty and not interfere in each other's internal affairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the United States has persisted in its anti-DPRK moves in wanton violation of such article and basic spirit of the statement. The U.S. policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK has reached the climax after the emergence of the bush regime, in particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush belligerent group's listing the DPRK as part of an \"axis of evil\" and the target of its nuclear attack is an undisguised violation of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement and the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework and a blatant threat and nuclear blackmail against the sovereignty of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is known well that in October last year the U.S. regime sent a special envoy of its president to the DPRK to pose an ultimatum-like threat to Pyongyang over \"concerns\" and spark the second nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula. The U.S., in collusion with IAEA, its puppet and henchman, has put international nuclear pressure on the DPRK and made an offensive to disarm it and, at the same time, unilaterally suspended even the supply of heavy oil to the DPRK pursuant to the simultaneous action of the AF. In view of such grave situation the DPRK made a bold decision to withdraw from the NPT in order to protect the sovereignty and dignity of the country and the nation. This was a self-defensive countermeasure to cope with the u.s. hard-line policy to stifle the DPRK and the unreasonable behavior of the IAEA toeing the U.S. line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The right of decision is not a monopoly of the U.S. but it also resides with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. belligerent forces are blustering that North Korea is the next target to eliminate weapons of mass destruction\" after Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. attempts to bring the nuclear issue of the DPRK to the United Nations again in a bid to have a justification for mounting a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK and igniting the second Korean war. It is working with blood-shot eyes to destabilize and destroy the DPRK through a vicious psychological warfare as it did in the Iraqi war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was the U.S. that ditched the north-south joint declaration on denuclearization and derailed its process on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present worst development compels the DPRK to build up a powerful war deterrent force to defend itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has its own operational plan, war method and strike mode. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any \"nuclear umbrella\" and \"missile shield\" will prove ineffective in face of the DPRK's powerful strike. The U.S. vicious psychological warfare, \"shock and terror operation\" will never work on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. aggressors will hear only the American dirge on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. can never flee from the responsibility for the grave situation on the Korean Peninsula. The U.S. is well advised to get cool-headed and ponder over the ensuing catastrophic consequences, if the present situation will lead to a war, and reexamine and rectify its futile policy of nuclear pressure and confrontation towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Everything will depend on how the U.S. will make a switchover in its attitude and policy. The DPRK will closely follow the U.S. attitude and do what it should do.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Kim Jong Il provides field guidance to fish farm\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) - General Secretary Kim Jong Il on June 10 provided field guidance to the fish farm of the fish breeding company managed by Ra Hyo Jin.\r\n The farm has creditably carried out the militant tasks proposed by the leader while visiting it several times. As a result it newly built a pond for fast fish growth, a pond for fish breeding depending on river water and a circular pond for breeding fries and put a room for hatching fish eggs on a modern basis, thus laying a firm material and technological foundation for massively raising freshwater fish. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Going round the fish farm that has undergone a radical change, he acquainted himself in detail with its expansion and fish breeding. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another modern fish breeding center has been built in a short span of time thanks to the devoted efforts of the soldier builders, he said, adding that this is a proud success which can be achieved only by our army, the creator of the people's happiness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The employees of the fish farm have placed fish breeding processes on the latest scientific and technological basis, thus opening a bright prospect of remarkably increasing the production of freshwater fish including rainbow trout and carp, he noted, calling upon all the fish farms across the country to follow their example. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that catfish and other fish farms built in recent years are massproducing many freshwater fishes, thereby greatly helping improve the diet of the army and the people, he said that this stirring reality clearly proves the validity and vitality of the WPK's policy on developing the fish culture on a large-scale. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our country has very favorable conditions for breeding fish in a big way as it has many rivers, lakes, springs and spas, he said, stressing the need to conduct fish culture as a vigorous mass movement and bring about a new turn in this work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He called for intensifying scientific researches into the fish culture and widely introducing the advanced breeding and management methods to steadily increase the fish production. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by Chief of the General Staff of the KPA Kim Yong Chun, KPA generals Ri Myong Su and Hyon Chol Hae, secretaries of the WPK Central Committee Kim Ki Nam and Kim Yong Sun, directors and first vice directors of its departments and other leading officials of the WPK Central Committee.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
