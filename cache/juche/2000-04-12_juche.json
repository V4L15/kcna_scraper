It was a political, economic and cultural hub in the northwestern part of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The position and role of Pyongyang were carried forward by Koguryo, a powerful state that existed for 1000 years after the collapse of Kojoson. Koguryo shifted its capital to Pyongyang in 427 as the nation's ancient history and culture originated from this city. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Koryo, which emerged as the first unified state on the Korean peninsula with an idea of rebuilding great Koguryo, pressed ahead with the building of Pyongyang from the very day of its foundation. The rehabilitation of Pyongyang was the first job done by Wang Kon, the first king of Koryo, right after his foundation of the state in 918. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All these facts are clear evidence that Pyongyang was the cradle of the Korean nation and the capital city of Tangun's Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There are in Pyongyang King Tangun's mausoleum, father of Koguryo King Tongmyong's mausoleum, the Mt. Taesong castle and the walled city of Pyongyang and many other historical relics which bear witness to its 5000-year long history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Today Pyongyang is known as the capital of Juche Korea and a time-honored sacred place. \r\n\r\n"
