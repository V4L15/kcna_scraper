In the work he laid bare with scientific logic the reactionary nature of the imperialists' assertion that socialism is an inhuman society devoid of any freedom and democracy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The work deeply convinced the Korean people that the wind sent by the imperialists and social democrats to allure people is a corrupt way of life, the way of seeking only personal comfort and luxury, the wind of liberalization intended to introduce the capitalist political mode and undermine socialism under the cloak of \"democracy\" and a counter-revolutionary trend designed to force people to give up their anti-imperialist struggle and disarm them ideologically under the watchword of a \"new way of thinking.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people have further consolidated the single-hearted unity of the whole society under the strengthened party leadership when the imperialists talked about \"democracy\", and thoroughly implemented the line of building an independent economy under the uplifted banner of self-reliance, tightening their belts, when others went in for \"reform\" and \"opening\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The validity and vitality of the work also lie in that it visualized a bright future to the revolutionary people of the world aspiring after socialism and encouraged them to turn out in a courageous struggle to revive socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the work a profound analysis was made of deviations manifested in socialist construction and their consequences, and the essence and advantages of true socialism were comprehensively clarified. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Brisk activities are under way among the revolutionary parties, progressive social organizations and people from all walks of life in the world to study and disseminate  famous works of Kim Jong Il, including \"Abuses of Socialism Are Intolerable\" and \"Socialism Is a Science.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   An ever-growing number of the world people are aspiring after socialism, saying socialism is an ideal of humankind and a society representing its future. \r\n\r\n"

Their mass killings committed during their temporary occupation of some areas of it were unprecedented. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They brutally murdered at least 15,000 civilians in Pyongyang and over 35,380 or a quarter of the population of Sinchon county, South Hwanghae Province, in just 50 odd days. The number of those killed by them stood at At least 19,070 in Anak county and 13,000 in Unryul county of South Hwanghae Province, at least 1,560 in Cholwon county, Kangwon Province, over 1,500 in Nampho and at least 1,400 in Sonchon county, North Phyongan Province. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   These genocide are the most blatant breach of the wartime law, the international law on human rights and the international law of humanitarianism. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "DPRK FM spokesman on U.S. \"annual report on human rights\" \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 1 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry today answered a question put by KCNA as regards the U.S. anti-DPRK diatribe made in its \"annual report on human rights\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. State Department in this report issued on Feb. 25 pulled up the DPRK over \"human rights\", commenting on human rights situation in at least 100 countries as it pleases. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What matters is that the United States does not bother to resort to such arrogant practices as arbitrarily commenting on human rights situation in other countries by \"its own standards\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   No one has given such right to the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   To speak honestly, the United States that likes to criticize other countries over their \"human rights issue\", and is, in fact, ill-famed for its poorest human rights performance and its most serious violation of human rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States which is not in a position to settle its serious human rights issue is imprudently finding fault with other countries over this issue while styling itself a world's \"judge of human rights\". This is a height of folly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is true human rights that all the members of society not only freely participate in the state management and socio-political life with equal rights but also lead an independent and creative economic and cultural life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Under our socialist system guided by the Juche idea human rights are deeply respected, all the people fully enjoy true political freedom and rights and are provided with every condition for economic, social and cultural life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It has become clear once again from the \"report on human rights\" that the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK and its ulterior intention to stifle the DPRK system remain unchanged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States is well advised to mind its own business before foolishly meddling in the human rights performance in other countries. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
