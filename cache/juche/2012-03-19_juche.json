            "content": "DPRK's Satellite Launch Not Contradictory to DPRK-U.S. Agreement: KCNA\r\nPyongyang, March 19 (KCNA) -- The south Korean puppet forces are busy with an odd smear campaign over the issue of DPRK's launch of Kwangmyongsong-3.\n\t\t\t\t\tAfloat on Saturday alone were rumors aimed to disturb negotiations between the DPRK and the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDong-A Ilbo said \"the north reduced the north Korea-U.S. agreement to a scrap of paper in 15 days\". Kukmin Ilbo asserted \"this is little short of violating the agreement reached at the DPRK-U.S. high-level talks even before the ink of their signature was dry\" and KBS noted \"this showed the north's will to take initiative, while boosting its negotiating power\", etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThen why are they claiming the satellite to be launched by the DPRK is an inter-continental ballistic missile and it is a violation of the agreement reached at the DPRK-U.S. high-level talks on February 29? \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis can be explained by the political aims sought by the Lee Myung Bak \"government\" nearing its end.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee group cannot but feel afraid of the results of dialogue and negotiations between the DPRK and U.S. more than anything else. It is seized with uneasiness for fear that it may be forsaken by its master, finding itself with no one to relay on, and may be elbowed out even in the discussion of the regional issues.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was against this backdrop that the puppet forces seized the DPRK's announcement of its projected launch of satellite as a golden chance to egg the U.S. neo-conservative forces on to drive the DPRK-U.S. talks into a collapse and cling again to the coattails of their U.S. master.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis can be proved by their unusual propaganda claiming that \"the DPRK's satellite launch is a provocative plan contrary to the points agreed upon between the north and the U.S.\" and \"the possibility of dialogue and negotiations is doubtful.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is no more than a petty trick of the stupid and ignorant guys.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tExplicitly speaking, the DPRK's launch of satellite has nothing to do with the above-said agreement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK has already decided to put moratorium on nuclear test, long-range missile launch and uranium enrichment in Nyongbyon while fruitful talks are under way and allow the IAEA to monitor it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt opened to the public its plan for the launch on the basis of the legitimate rights of all countries to use outer space for peaceful purposes and sent necessary information to international organizations according to the international regulations and procedures.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK's plan for satellite launch poses no problem as it is prompted by its noble desire to put the country's up-to-the-minute science and technology on a higher level and thus reinforce the mainstay for building a socialist power and make a contribution to prosperity of the Korean nation and that common to humankind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe launch of the working satellite is an issue fundamentally different from that of a long-range missile.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMore than 100 space vehicles are put into the orbit around the earth by carrier rockets in a year on an average worldwide. How can the puppet and other hostile forces explain this fact.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHigh vigilance is required against their false propaganda.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the past, the hostile forces floated story about \"suspected uranium enrichment\" in a bid to scuttle the DPRK-U.S. dialogue and render the situation extremely tense and this compelled the DPRK to have access to nukes. This lesson taught by history should not be forgotten.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK's sovereignty and right to existence can be firmly guaranteed by itself."

The key to its victory was its ideological and moral superiority.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn summer of Juche 25 (1936) the commander of a Chinese nationalist anti-Japanese unit asked President Kim Il Sung about how the KPRA was winning victory after victory in battles with the bellicose Japanese army. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe President told him that spirit was more important than tactics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJudging that the victory in the anti-Japanese war depends on the ideological and mental state of the KPRA members, he had attached great importance to training them to be strong in ideology, faith and grip and optimistic about their victory from the early days of the armed struggle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Korean people still recall the historic \"Arduous March\", made by the main unit of the KPRA under the command of Kim Il Sung from December 1938 to March next year to advance into the area bordering Korea from Nanpaizi of China and save the Korean revolution from crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDuring the march, the Japanese imperialists attacked the unit tenaciously from all sides with the mobilization of hundreds of thousands of troops and even flying corps.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOn the other hand, they tried to disintegrate the unit from within by employing every means.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUnder such grim situation the unit had to fight fierce battles with the enemy coming in attack desperately every day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTo make matters worse, food ran out in the severe cold coupled with heavy snowfall.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHowever, the KPRA members, not losing courage, overcame all the difficulties with their fortitude and indomitable revolutionary spirit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the days of the bloody anti-Japanese war, they defended the revolutionary headquarters with their very lives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOne of them silenced the enemy's pillbox with his body to make a breach of the units. Another member kept the revolutionary principles despite all sorts of tortures by the enemy, even biting his own tongue and a woman guerrilla shouted, though she lost her two eyes to the enemy's torture, that the victory of the Korean revolution was in sight.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK owes the spiritual heritage to this anti-Japanese revolutionary tradition.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe President also effectively applied the Juche-based tactics to leading the guerrilla warfare to victory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe regarded the protean guerrilla tactics as an important guarantee for the victory in the anti-Japanese armed struggle, advancing the principles and methods of guerrilla warfare and guiding the KPRA to successfully use them in battles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn those days he created such tactics as allurement and ambush and marching hundreds of miles at one go. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Japanese imperialists admitted that the KPRA's war tactics could never be found in their books on military science and tactics. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe anti-Japanese armed struggle developed the KPRA into an invincible army superior in mental strength and war tactics and defeated the formidable aggressor army warfare with guerrilla warfare."
