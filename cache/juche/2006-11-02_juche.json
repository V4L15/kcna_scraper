            "content": "GNP Campaign for Suspending Tour of Mt. Kumgang under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, November 1 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee issued a statement Wednesday to accuse the Grand National Party of south Korea of kicking up a row demanding a halt to the tour of Mt. Kumgang. \r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP is becoming evermore undisguised in its moves to totally block the tour of Mt. Kumgang, a symbol of inter-Korean economic cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP gentry at a press conference held on October 29 groundlessly asserted that there was a suspicion of the diversion of the payment for the tour of the mountain to the purpose of \"arms race\" and recklessly demanded a halt to the tour. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the DPRK successfully conducted the missile launching exercise for self-defence, this party instigated the right-wing conservatives to cry out for stopping the tour of the mountain. The frantic campaign escalated by them in the wake of the DPRK's successful nuclear test once again saliently reveals their inveterate sycophantic and treacherous tendency and their habit of betraying the nation as it is nothing but a foolish act of backing the U.S. in its pressure and sanctions against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said campaign being staged at the instigation of the United States is intolerable as it is a pro-U.S. sycophantic act of challenging the fellow countrymen desirous of national reconciliation, unity and reunification and bringing back the inter-Korean relations to the era of mistrust and confrontation and a criminal act against the nation and reunification diametrically running counter to the June 15 joint declaration whose basic idea is the idea of \"By our nation itself.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tour of Mt. Kumgang has served as a short-cut to reunification that was opened and has been widened by the concerted efforts of the Koreans as it promotes inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the tour of Mt. Kumgang was blocked by the ultra-right conservatives including the GNP, this would be an indelible crime against the fellow countrymen and history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP will have to pay a dear price for having worked hard to gratify its greed for power, while putting foreign forces above compatriots and infringing upon even the interests of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Taking this opportunity, the DPRK can not but serve a warning to those in south Korea crying out for the provision of goods instead of paying in cash for the tour of the mountain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Is there any country in the world where tourists provide goods instead of paying money? Are there any people who should prepare goods to pay for their tour before their departure? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their assertions might convince people at the time immemorial when currency did not exist at all. Their anachronistic way of thinking, therefore, cannot but be a laughing stock of people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said idea does not deserve even a passing note as it is a gross breach of the agreement reached between the two sides and a serious contravention of universally accepted international practice and norms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tour of Mt. Kumgang is a compatriotic undertaking that started thanks to the magnanimity and good faith of the DPRK as it set store by the earnest wishes and requests of the south Koreans from A to Z. The issue of conducting or stopping tourism does not lie within the rights of the United States and the GNP. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will set store by the wishes and hopes of the south Koreans for the tour of Mt. Kumgang. But it makes it clear that in case there happens any irrevocable thing due to the GNP kowtowing to the U.S. it will be left with no option but to take relevant strong steps. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will closely follow the future development.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

What it seeks is to aggravate the situation on the peninsula at whatever cost to invent an excuse to provoke a new war, a nuclear war, and fish in troubled waters by pitting the Koreans against each other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation in and around the Korean Peninsula is going from bad to worse and heading for the brink of war, contrary to the unanimous desire of the Korean nation and the world peace-loving people, owing to the crafty war provocation moves of the U.S. which is accustomed to feather its own nest at the expense of others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. attempt to provoke the DPRK by force of arms is stimulating its army and people to boost its self-defensive military capabilities more vigorously under the great banner of Songun.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

A solution conceived by the pro-U.S. right-wing conservative Abe Cabinet under this situation is to show extra zeal in internationalizing the issue of the DPRK-Japan relations and knocking into shape an anti-DPRK alliance, subservient to Washington, in a bid to improve Japan's diplomatic image. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This behavior of the Abe Cabinet was promoted by its calculation that it would help win greater favor of its U.S. master, go without redeeming Japan's huge crimes in the past and secure a say when discussing the \"issue on the Korean Peninsula\". This is the diplomacy much publicized by the Abe Cabinet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In essence, Japan's diplomatic policy remains unchanged. What is noteworthy is that it has become more zealous in toeing the U.S. line. This is evidenced by the Abe Cabinet extreme campaign against the DPRK. For this reason, Japan is now swept by a whirlwind of hostility towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Abe Cabinet is talking a lot about a possible switchover in Japan's diplomacy, but this can never hide its true colors as a waiting maid of the U.S. as it considers its subservience and dependence upon the U.S. as a means for its existence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's persistent campaign against the DPRK would do it nothing good but strain the situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to settle its past crimes without delay instead of driving the DPRK-Japan relations to an extreme phase to escalate the tension, the commentary urges.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Urged\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, November 1 (KCNA) -- To put an end to the U.S. domination and interference is an urgent national task for achieving national reconciliation and unity and bringing peace and reunification to the Korean Peninsula by the concerted efforts of the Koreans, says Rodong Sinmun Wednesday in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' military presence and domination over south Korea are aimed at perpetuating the split of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When Korea was liberated from the ferocious Japanese imperialists' colonial rule on Aug. 15, 1945, it was the unanimous dream and aspiration of the Korean nation to build a prosperous independent sovereign state. However, the U.S. imperialists seized by a wild ambition for world domination put south Korea under their military occupation in disregard of the demand of the Korean nation, coveting the Korean Peninsula, a vantage point of strategic importance in Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to keep the Korean nation split and dominate south Korea for an indefinite period the U.S. imperialists have continued the presence of their aggressor troops there, poisoning the atmosphere of peace and reunification and aggravating the situation through ceaseless military exercises and arms buildup. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' domination and interference in south Korea are the main factor of blocking national reconciliation and unity and hamstringing the efforts to develop the inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., regarding south Korea as \"the first class strategic region,\" is seeking the continued split of the Korean nation and the ceaseless confrontation between the north and the south for the purpose of justifying its imperialist aggressor troops' presence in south Korea. The U.S. imperialists intensified interference and obstructions to the efforts to achieve Korea's reunification whenever the enthusiasm to achieve inter-Korean reconciliation and unity mounted high. The north and the south of Korea agreed on the three principles of national reunification and made public the July 4 joint statement in the 1970s. They, however, failed to bring about a turning phase for national unity and independent reunification. It is already widely known that this was attributable to the wicked interference and obstructions of the U.S. imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists have reached an extreme phase in their moves to interfere in the issue of Korea's reunification, going against the trend of the June 15 era for reunification. They are very displeased with the inter-Korean cooperation and exchange going on despite their frantic pursuance of their hostile policy towards the DPRK and their anti-DPRK sanctions and pressure and they are leaving no means untried to put the brake on them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the only way out for the Korean nation to achieve national independence against foreign domination and interference and this is the only way of tiding over the present difficulties and attaining peace and reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They expressed concern, saying the seriousness of the matter lay in that the victims were children who should be protected and girl students wearing chima and jogori (Korean costume). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some time ago, Korean children received a phone call and e-mail threatening \"All of you will be killed. Go back to Korea.\" Ultra-right gangsters even let loose an ugly torrent of abuses such as \"Go back to your country\" through megaphones nearby a school of Koreans in Japan. These are impudent acts which can never be tolerated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans in Japan are leading a very uneasy life under all manner of oppression and watch by the Japanese authorities. We, jointly with human rights defence forces of the international community, will answer this will a tough reaction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The speakers strongly demanded the Japanese authorities an apology for such acts, measures to prevent their recurrence, severe punishment of the perpetrators, reflection on the past, improvement of the status and treatment of the Koreans in Japan, and so on.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
