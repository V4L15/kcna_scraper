If this issue is settled, other matters can be resolved between the north and the south of Korea, not by four parties.\r\n   Today's edition of Rodong Sinmun, newspaper of the Workers' Party of Korea Central Committee, says this in a commentator's article titled \"U.S. troops pullout is key to peace in Korean Peninsula\".\r\n   The article comes after preliminary talks of the DPRK, the United States, China and south Korea for \"four-way talks\" took place in New York on Tuesday.\r\n   At the preliminary talks the DPRK delegation proposed that the conclusion of a peace agreement between the DPRK and the U.S. and the withdrawal of south Korea-based U.S. troops be main items of the agenda at the \"four-way talks\".\r\n   The daily says the proposal fully accords with the purpose of the \"four-way talks\" for peace in the Korean Peninsula and paves the indispensable way for its fulfilment.\r\n   It notes:\r\n   It is due to the unreasonable position of the U.S. that the withdrawal of the U.S. troops has not yet been solved. \r\nThe U.S. has based the reason of its military presence in south Korea and its vicinity on the Cold War. But the Cold War has already been terminated.\r\n   The Soviet Union, the U.S. rival in the Cold War, has collapsed and the DPRK's former and existing allies have normalized bilateral ties with south Korea.\r\n   A non-aggression agreement was signed between the two halves of Korea. And it has been proved clearly that the DPRK has no intention to invade the south.\r\n   Though the Cold War has come to an end, the U.S. has persistently pursued its old world strategy. Not content with the frustration of socialism in some countries, the U.S. is inveigling them into its military alliance.\r\n   From this point of view, increasingly apparent is the aggressive nature of the U.S.-south Korea and U.S.-Japan military alliances, which have been intensified, targeted at the DPRK, and the U.S. military presence in south Korea and its vicinity.\r\n   As long as the U.S. is maintaining its forces in south Korea and its vicinity, targeted at the DPRK, the situation of the Korean Peninsula can never be free from the vicious circle of tension and the DPRK-U.S. relations from the vicious circle of distrust.\r\n   We take an affirmative view of the fact that the U.S. proposed \"four-way talks\" for ensuring peace in the Korean Peninsula and, at a briefing, hinted possible discussion of the U.S. military withdrawal within the framework of the \"four-way talks\".\r\n   But it is unreasonable for the U.S. to link the pullout with the reduction or redeployment of the DPRK's forces. It is really illogical that the U.S., which is keeping continental ballistic missiles targeted at the DPRK in its mainland and having its aggression forces in foreign lands, is calling for reduction or redeployment of troops who are based only in their country.\r\n   To withdraw all its troops unconditionally from south Korea and its vicinity is what the U.S. should do first of all at present for peace in the Korean Peninsula and for inter-Korean reconciliation.\r\n   If the U.S. is interested in peace of the Korean Peninsula, it should sincerely do what it has to do. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is the sacred country- and nation-loving struggle to establish the sovereignty of the nation throughout the country and guarantee the welfare of posterity for all ages.\r\n   The revolutionary cause of Juche is also the revolutionary cause of genuine national independence started and advanced by the Korean people with their own faith and will.\r\n   All the lines and policies of the Korean revolution which have been shaped and pursued historically have never based on the established theories or experience of others.\r\n   It is the Korean people's way of making revolution and their basic stand to push ahead with the revolution and construction with their own viewpoint, will and decision and to hold fast to independence in external relations.\r\n   The revolutionary cause of Juche is the cause of self-reliance which emerges victorious ever by the efforts of the Korean people.\r\n   The WPK and the Korean people have held high the banner of self-reliance, mindful that dependence on outside forces leads to the collapse of the country and self-reliance guarantees the prosperity of the country and nation. As a result, the powerful socialist country, strong in the Juche character and national character and independent in politics, self-supporting in the economy and self-reliant in national defence, has been built in this land.\r\n   The revolutionary cause of Juche has become the cause of genuine national independence because it has been led by President Kim Il Sung and Secretary Kim Jong Il, adds the article. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
