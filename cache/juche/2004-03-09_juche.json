            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on Key to Settlement of Nuclear Issue \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 8 (KCNA) -- If the U.S. continues to persist in its brigandish theory and demand in defiance of the DPRK's sincerity and magnanimity and does not make a switchover in its hostile policy toward it, the six-way talks would give no help to the settlement of the nuclear issue in the future, too and make no contribution to ensuring denuclearization and peace of the Korean peninsula.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling the fact that the second round of the six-way talks ended with no result due to the U.S. stand, the commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the talks the U.S. repeated its assertion of \"scrapping nuclear program before dialogue\", while making no positive change in its stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK cannot but call into question the U.S. insistence on \"complete, verifiable, irreversible dismantlement of nuclear program\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to make an analysis of the essence and danger of the above-said assertion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. demand for \"complete dismantlement of nuclear program\" is an essential ambition to wrest the nuclear deterrent force from the DPRK free of charge to disarm it and overthrow its system. In other words, it is a brigandish logic for \"scrapping nuclear program before overthrowing the DPRK's system\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. insistence on \"verifiable dismantlement of nuclear program\" is also very cunning. It is aimed to round off its preparations for the second Korean war by rummaging through the DPRK under the pretext of \"inspection\". It is the U.S. real intention to ignite a war against the DPRK on the basis of grasping its internal conditions, military potentials and military objects with \"comb tactics\" like reading its palm under the pretext of \"inspection\". This is why the U.S. came out again with the issue of fictitious \"enriched uranium\" at the talks and demanded the DPRK recognize it. . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for \"irreversible dismantlement of nuclear program\", it is a noose to economically suffocate the DPRK by stamping out its peaceful nuclear power industry. The DPRK has no will to halt its peaceful nuclear activities but the will to give up nuclear weaponisation according to the \"word for word\" promise and the way of \"action for action\" based on simultaneous package solution to peacefully settlement the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the long run, the strategic purpose and danger of \"complete, verifiable, irreversible dismantlement of nuclear program\" forced by the U.S. are to disarm the DPRK completely, suffocate it economically, militarily occupy it and exterminate its socialist system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the U.S. is persistently forcing the \"complete, verifiable, irreversible dismantlement of nuclear program\" upon the DPRK,turning aside from the latter's elastic and most magnanimous proposal, the DPRK cannot but demand the U.S. completely withdraw its troops from south Korea in a verifiable way and make the \"complete, verifiable, irreversible security assurance\" guaranteeing the adoption of peace agreement and normalization of relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, the U.S. is the biggest nukes possessor which is disqualified to say about the dismantlement of nuclear weapons, the first user of nuclear weapons in the world and the worst criminal which pursues the most dangerous nuclear policy. Through the six-way talks, it has become obvious that the U.S. change in its stand is prerequisite and the dialogue between the DPRK and the U.S. is a fundamental mean. The DPRK considers the recent talks favourable for the DPRK to confirm the orientation of its next action. As long as the U.S. intentionally delays the settlement of the nuclear issue, the DPRK will continue to take necessary measures as soon as possible. The longer the U.S. delays time, the more unfavorable situation it will face. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK remains unchanged in its stand to solve the nuclear issue through dialogue, in a peaceful way and by the way of simultaneous action. The point at issue is the stand of the U.S. The key to the settlement of the nuclear issue depends on the change of the U.S. stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. gives up its demand for \"scrapping nuclear program first\" and make a switchover in its Korea policy, a dramatic progress will be made in settling the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will follow the U.S. change in its stand. \r\n\r\n"

Korean Foreign Minister's Unreasonable Remarks Flailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 8 (KCNA) -- The south Korean minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade during his recent visit to the United States let loose a string of balderdash that it is difficult to substantially launch on a large scale economic exchange between the north and the south unless the nuclear issue is settled, which is ridiculed at home and abroad.\r\n Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun today says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He linked the nuclear issue to the economic cooperation between the fellow countrymen. This fully revealed that he is an ignoramus who does not know the essence of the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is only too natural that the DPRK should have nuclear deterrent force to prevent nuclear disaster and defend its right to existence and sovereignty now that the United States is working hard to stifle the DPRK over the nuclear issue at any cost and unleash a nuclear war to exterminate the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The behavior of the south Korean minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade cannot be construed otherwise than an anti-national criminal act of joining in the U.S. nuclear racket to exterminate the Korean nation as it seeks cooperation with outside forces, ignoring the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-national and anti-reunification criminal acts of blocking the improvement of inter-Korean relations, reconciliation and cooperation while following the U.S. line of threatening the fellow countrymen, instead of protesting against the U.S. nuclear racket to exterminate the Korean nation and calling for the withdrawal of the U.S. troops from south Korea, the root cause of all disasters, cannot be justified with anything. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those turning their back on the nation and acting marionettes of the U.S. are bound to meet a miserable end.    \r\n\r\n"

During the days of the anti-Japanese struggle Kim Jong Suk, an indomitable revolutionary fighter, awakened women to rise up in the sacred war against the Japanese imperialists true to the intention of the President and made an immortal contribution to the history of the Korean women's movement.\r\n The President personally worked out the \"10-Point Program of the Association for the Restoration of the Fatherland\" during the rigorous anti-Japanese revolution to clarify the issue of respecting the personalities of women. He enacted and proclaimed the Law n Sex Equality after the liberation of the country. Since then the Korean women have grown up as a powerful social force rolling one of the two wheels of revolution and greatly contributed to the development of the era.\r\n The women's movement covered the proud road of victory under the wise leadership of the President and has come to develop on a new high stage in the era of Songun led by Kim Jong Il.\r\n Among the women upholding his Songun leadership with loyalty are many deputies to the DPRK Supreme People's Assembly, party officials, directors of factories and enterprises, managerial chairpersons of farms, renowned scientists and heroines, illustrious sportswomen and artistes. It is really significant that the role of women has remarkably increased in consolidating the single-hearted unity of the ranks of our revolution with the headquarters of revolution as their centre and stepping up the cause of socialism under the banner of great Songun. \r\n\r\n"

It is now conducting positive activities with the approaching of the April general election and the second anniversary of the memorial service for Hyo Sun and Mi Son (June 13). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, civic and public organizations agreed to bring together 10,000 members for promotion before the general election, open to the public the stand on candidates of the Jongro District from all political parties and fix it as the standard of selecting candidates for the general election. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They said that they would form a group for the promotion of rebuilding after the general election to conduct massive activities and build candlelight monuments not only at Kwanghwamun but also at least 10 areas on the occasion of June 13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lawyers Meeting for Democratic Society decided to bring a suit against the Jongro District Office in Seoul which forcibly evacuated the candlelight monument.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA on Japan's Much Talk about \"Abduction Issue\" \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 8 (KCNA) -- Japan is continuing to pull up the DPRK over the \"abduction issue\" despite the unbiased international opinion about the DPRK-Japan relations.\r\n On March 4 Tokyo Metropolitan Governor Ishihara repeatedly stressed the necessity of economic sanctions against north Korea as regards the \"kidnapping issue\". Prior to it, the \"Dietmen's League for Abduction Issue\" consisting of supra-partisan dietmen published a resolution demanding a swift effectuation of the revised law on foreign exchange which makes it possible to apply economic sanctions to north Korea for an early settlement of the \"kidnapping issue\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a hostile act against the DPRK which was done after the chief executive and other high-ranking politicians of Japan told that sanctions and pressure on north Korea are an effective method of the settlement of the nuclear and kidnapping issues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We cannot remain an onlooker to the fact that such a racket of sanctions was kicked off under the pretext of the \"kidnapping issue\" at a time when Japan adopted the \"amendment to the law on foreign exchange\" which legislated the economic sanctions on the DPRK as a state policy some time ago to declare the political and military confrontation with it and is intending to legitimately commit the moves to isolate and stifle it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the last century Japan kidnapped and forcibly walked away at least 8.4 million Koreans and has not yet liquidated its past wrongdoings. Last year it abducted more than 20 DPRK citizens in the DPRK-China border area and kept even five persons who temporarily returned to Japan for a visit to their native places. However, Japan kept mum about such abduction and is talking about \"kidnapping issue\" which had already been settled. This is intolerable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese right-wing reactionaries are working hard to tarnish the image of the DPRK under the pretext of the \"kidnapping issue\", evade the  liquidation of the past and create a favorable atmosphere for carrying out their rightist policy through the hostile moves against the DPRK by using the \"people's sentiment\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is ridiculous for the Japanese reactionaries to resort to the moves against the DPRK in a bid to impose economic sanctions on it under the pretext of the \"kidnapping issue\".\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should not act rashly, clearly mindful of the consequences to be entailed by its hostile moves against the DPRK and pressure on it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a real picture of our society and such single-hearted unity makes our socialism so strong and viable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To thoroughly apply the collective principle is a firm guarantee to defend and advance the socialist system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The socialist system emerges victorious if the collective principle, its fundamental demand, is defended, and collapses if it is abandoned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to win victory of socialism in the life and death struggle, collectivism should be more comprehensively applied.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
