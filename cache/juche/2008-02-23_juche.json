Korean Ultra-Right Conservatives' Anti-North Smear Campaign under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 22 (KCNA) -- Recently the ultra-right conservative forces of south Korea in collusion with conservative media talked nonsense, asserting that 22 inhabitants from the north adrift near Yonphyong Islet in the West Sea are presumed to be \"punished\" after they were rescued and repatriated to it. They became vocal crying out for \"confirming whether it is true\" and letting them know about \"the truth\". They went the lengths of letting loose a string of vituperation against the north, groundlessly accusing it of \"worst human rights performance.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They also asserted that they have \"obtained or eavesdropped information\" about \"suspected diversion\" of the food aid to the north to \"the military purpose.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, answering the question put by KCNA in this regard on Feb. 21, dismissed this anti-north smear campaign of the ultra-right conservative forces in south Korea as a sheer fabrication devoid of any ground. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the above-said shipwrecked inhabitants are concerned, they resolutely brushed aside the sugar-coated words that if they were \"defected\" to the south, they would receive a large amount of money and lead a happy life, after they were taken away by a patrol boat of the south side. They are now leading a normal life in their homes after coming back to the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The story about the \"suspected diversion\" of food aid to the north to \"the military purpose\" is nothing but a politically motivated plot as it has never happened and can never take place. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their talks about \"punishment\" and \"the diversion of food aid to the military purpose\" are nothing but charades which can be orchestrated only by those hell-bent on confrontation with the north and rash acts to antagonize the fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-north smear campaign staged by the pro-U.S. ultra-right conservative forces in south Korea, vilifying even the system in the north, arouses a serious concern about the prospect of the inter-Korean relations as it stripped bare their anti-reunification nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will never overlook the challenge of the anti-north plot-breeding institutions nor tolerate any slightest mud-slinging at the system in the north which represents its highest dignity, in particular.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In the early period of their organization exchange and cooperation among those countries were focused on economic issues in the main. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But they expanded them to the political and military fields as the U.S. has become more undisguised in its high-handed and arbitrary practices and in its moves to turn the world into a uni-polar one since the Sept. 11 incident. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The European Union has striven hard to boost its independent position and role in the field of military security while showing the tendency of rejecting the U.S. military control and demand. Such moves of member nations of the EU as the signing of the \"Lisbon Treaty\" replacing the EU Constitution and the withdrawal and cutback of their forces present in Afghanistan and Iraq indicate their stance to contain the U.S. and distance themselves from it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Activities are now brisk on the African Continent to found the \"United States of Africa\", a political, military and economic community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are noticeable moves in Latin America to counter the U.S. moves for a uni-polar world by concentrated efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The trend of unity, cooperation and integration growing stronger in various parts of the world as the days go by has an impact on the changing strategic structure of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No force on earth can stem the trend of the multi-polarization of the world, the current of the situation.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a magnanimous and patriotic politics as it calls for embracing even those who committed crimes against the nation in the past, not digging up their past wrongs if they have patriotism, and helping them turn over a new leaf. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality in which reconciliation and unity among fellow countrymen are growing stronger day by day under the uplifted banner of \"By our nation itself\" is a proof of the immense attraction and great vitality of the all-embracing politics.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
