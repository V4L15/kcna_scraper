            "content": "NDC Spokesman Slams Reference of \"Cheonan\" Case to UN\r\n Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the National Defence Commission of the DPRK had already officially clarified the principled stand of the army and people of the DPRK on the sinking case of the south Korean puppet navy's warship in waters of the West Sea of Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t He also dismissed the assertion of the south Korean group of traitors that the ship was sunk by a torpedo attack of the DPRK and the \"results of investigation\" faked up to support it as a sheer anti-DPRK \"conspiratorial farce\" and a \"charade\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The political, social, academic and press circles of south Korea, favoring the principled stand of the DPRK, are growing increasingly suspicious about the \"results of investigation\" announced by the \"joint investigation team\" in which it claimed it was done on an objective and scientific basis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is even strong opinion that the ship was sunk by the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not only China closely following the situation around it but also Russia which dispatched an investigation group to the spot of south Korea assert that it is difficult to find out any evidence proving that the ship was sunk by a torpedo of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of traitors, however, went the lengths of bringing the investigation results to the UN, the far-fetched assertion that the ship sinking was linked with the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The spokesman gave the following answer to a question raised by KCNA Friday in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The development proves that the group of traitors has finally gone into action against the DPRK at the instigation of its master, defying our warnings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accordingly, the army and people of the DPRK will take merciless counter-actions as it had already clarified internally and externally because the group dared opt for infringing upon the dignity and security of the army and people of the DPRK and its supreme interests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army of the DPRK is a powerful revolutionary army of Mt. Paektu which does not make any empty talk.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Availing ourselves of this opportunity, we will closely watch once again how the UNSC whose basic mission is to ensure global peace and security will react to the \"conspiratorial farce\" and \"charade\" orchestrated by the group of traitors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t People still remember that the UN, yielding to the U.S. high-handed and arbitrary practices, recognized the \"existence of weapons of mass destruction\", a fiction, and okayed its gangster-like armed invasion of Iraq.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The UN should no longer allow itself to be reduced to a platform for tolerating such unjust anti-DPRK \"conspiratorial farce\" and \"charade\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is no reason whatsoever for the group of traitors to refuse to receive the inspection group of the NDC if the results of the investigation into the case are objective and scientific enough to be referred to the UN forum. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK remains unchanged in its strong demand that the group of traitors receive its inspection group without delay and produce evidence without a shred of doubt in its eyes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of traitors will never be able to escape a miserable end mired in the pitfall of \"conspiratorial farce\" and \"charade\" orchestrated by itself."

And they launched hectic diplomacy to kick off an international campaign for \"sanctions\" against the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This bears a close resemblance to the situation when the U.S. imperialists kicked off invasion of Iraq. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If a war breaks out on the Korean Peninsula, this is bound to spill over to the neighboring countries and then it will soon develop into a world war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group of traitors can never shirk off the responsibility as the criminals who orchestrated the case of warship sinking.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists and the Lee group of traitors keen to achieve the above-said purposes through the case will keenly realize what deadly retaliation the army and the people of the DPRK will take to defend the sovereignty of the country and the dignity of the nation."

If it is true that \"Cheonan\" was sunk by a torpedo attack from a mini-sub of the DPRK, where did that mini-sub flee? Warships of the U.S. and south Korea equipped with modern monitoring system were busy with military exercises in those waters at that time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There are some assertions that the case was a politically motivated provocation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is, therefore, necessary to clarify the cause of the warship sinking and ferret out the chief culprit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is our view that the tension on the Korean Peninsula should not be escalated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Golos Russii also quoted what a reporter of the Ria-Novosti News said after looking round the hull of \"Cheonan\" displayed in a base in Phyongthaek, south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  He expressed strong doubt about the \"results of investigation\" made public by an \"inspection team\".
