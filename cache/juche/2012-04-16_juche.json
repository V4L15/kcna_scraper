Paektu possessed of distinguished stratagem and wisdom and matchless grit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A peerless patriot, Kim Jong Il reliably protected the security and sovereignty of the DPRK and socialism with his unique Songun leadership.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the 1990s the U.S.-led imperialists concentrated attacks on the DPRK, availing themselves of collapse of socialism in some countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUnder the pretext of \"suspected nuclear development\" in early 1993 the U.S. imperialists instigated dishonest elements of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to force \"ad-hoc inspection\" upon the DPRK. When their attempt was rejected they announced the resumption of \"Team Spirit 93\" joint military exercises, calling for sanctions against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To cope with this situation, leader Kim Jong Il aroused the entire party, all the people and the whole army to the showdown with the U.S. imperialists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He issued Order No. 0034 of the supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, \"On proclamation of a semi-war state to the entire party, all the people and the whole army\", on March 8, Juche 82 (1993). On March 12, the DPRK government announced a statement on its withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, spoiling the U.S. imperialists' nuclear strategy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After all, the U.S. imperialists announced that they would stop their joint military exercises ahead of schedule, and the IAEA could not but give up its demand for \"ad-hoc inspection\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Leader Kim Jong Il's superb diplomacy resulted in successful holding of the three rounds of the DPRK-U.S. talks and adoption of an agreement between the two countries. Consequently, on Oct. 20 the then U.S. President Bill Clinton sent to the leader a written guarantee for implementation of the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework, which was adopted next day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the emergence of the Bush administration, the U.S. imperialists directed the spearhead of attacks on the DPRK again, designating the Korean Peninsula as a theatre of showdown.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They drew up \"OPLAN 5027-03\" and put spurs to carrying it into practice, staging large-scale joint military exercises one after another, including RSOI, Foal Eagle and Ulji Focus Lens.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUnder this situation the DPRK conducted an underground nuclear test in October 2006 and declared through its Foreign Ministry statement that it succeeded in manufacturing nuclear bomb by law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In 2009 when the DPRK announced launch of its earth satellite Kwangmyongsong-2 after going through procedures under international law, the U.S. and other hostile forces massed huge armed forces and latest intercept means around the Korean Peninsula, terming it a missile launch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK declared that, if any force dare \"intercept\" its satellite, it would destroy not only the interceptor bases but also the headquarters of its force. Consequently, Kwangmyongsong-2 was successfully launched.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Above seen, the DPRK won one victory after another in the political and military showdown with the U.S., and this was attributable to the wise leadership of leader Kim Jong Il, who showed no mercy for any attempt to violate justice."
