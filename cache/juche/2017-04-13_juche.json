And in 1960 he advanced the proposal of reunifying the country by federal formula between the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Early in the 1970s, he put forth a policy on broad-ranging north-south negotiations, thus making a breakthrough toward the stalled north-south ties and opened up the way of dialogue and negotiations. Early in May 1972, he provided leadership for the holding of the first north-south high-level political talks in Pyongyang and the adoption of the historic July 4 North-South Joint Statement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the south Korean \"yusin\" dictator went wild in cooking up \"two Koreas\" while denying the basic spirit of the July 4 joint statement, the President clarified the five-point policy for the country's reunification, thus dealing a heavy blow at the reckless moves of the separatists at home and abroad and firmly maintaining the line of independent reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In 1980 when a serious hurdle was laid in the way of the country's reunification due to the separatist moves of the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean military fascist junta, he set forth the policy of establishing the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo and opened up a decisive phase for achieving the country's independent and peaceful reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The high-level talks headed by premiers of the north and the south began from September 1990 and the \"agreement on reconciliation, non-aggression, cooperation and exchange between the north and the south\" was adopted in December 1991. This was a fruition brought about by his will and patriotic dedication to independent reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to his great will and outstanding leadership, a historic occasion of opening the north-south summit talks, the first of their kind in the history of the nation's division, was provided at last in July 1994.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The President's great heart stopped beating after he left his last autographic sign on a document related to the national reunification just a few days before the north-south summit talks. This was the bitterest grief in the nation's history spanning 5 000 years, and the greatest loss to the Korean nation desirous of reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Stressing that the President provided a solid foundation for the country's reunification through energetic ideological and theoretical activities and gigantic practices all his life, the memorandum went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Solving from a unique angle all the issues arising in the struggle for the country's reunification, he clarified precious ideology, line and policies that would serve as a cornerstone in accomplishing the cause of reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The three principles of national reunification, the proposal for founding the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo and the 10-point programme for the great unity of the entire nation constituted historic feats that would shine long in the Korean nation's history of reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As he built the DPRK into a socialist power independent in politics, self-supporting in the economy and self-reliant in national defence, we could firmly defend the nation's dignity and security and confidently advance the cause of the country's reunification despite the ceaseless aggression and war moves of the U.S. and other hostile forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The President firmly rallied all Koreans under the banner of reunification and patriotism and ushered in the new history of great unity of the nation with his noble virtue and warm compatriotism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The cause of the country's reunification pioneered and led by the President was successfully carried forward and made victorious advance under the guidance of the great leader Kim Jong Il and it has now greeted the new phase of a decisive turn under the distinguished guidance of respected Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As Kim Jong Un leads us and as there is the patriotic legacy for reunification provided by Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, the cause of the country's reunification is sure to triumph and the future of the Korean nation is immensely bright and rosy."

Park Geun Hye met such tragic end as she emerged \"president\" though she is the dreg having no elementary quality and thinking ability as a human being.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. The removal of Park from her position as \"president\" and her arrest are due results from the heinous crimes committed by her who got hell-bent on the confrontation with the fellow countrymen in the north, playing a puppet of the shaman.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t4. If the south Korean puppet forces persist in the reckless \"campaign\", failing to properly understand the trend of the times, the north-south relations will never be improved and it will make it impossible to reunify the country."

            "content": "Vocero del CRPP condena complot de conservadores ultraderechistas surcoreanos\r\nPyongyang, 13 de abril (ACNC) -- Ultimamente, la banda de conservadores titeres surcoreanos recurre obstinadamente al sucio y absurdo complot contra las supuestas \"fuerzas seguidoras al Norte\" induciendo en error la opinion publica como si la RPDC estuviera vinculada con la lucha de la poblacion surcoreana de diferentes sectores con velas encendidas y con la consiguiente dimision y encarcelamiento de la traidora Park Geun-hye.\n\t\t\t\t\tAl respecto, el vocero del Comite por la Reunificacion Pacifica de la Patria hizo publica el dia 13 una declaracion que sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos ultraderechistas conservadores surcoreanos insisten en que la dimision y encarcelamiento de Park Geun-hye se deben al \"tumulto causado por el trabajo politico de las fuerzas seguidoras al Norte\" y a la \"conspiracion de las fuerzas izquierdistas pro-Norte al mando de este\". Y se portan como locos abogando por \"purgar a esas fuerzas\" y frenar sin falta la toma del poder por ellas en las \"elecciones presidenciales\" que se acercan al lograr la unidad de todas las fuerzas conservadoras.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs un metodo rutinario y vicio de ellos fabricar un incidente intrigante anti-RPDC cada vez que se crea la grave crisis de dominacion y buscar asi la salida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFrente a ello, el vocero del CRPP expone la siguiente posicion:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. El desenlace miserable de Park Geun-hye es el resultado inevitable de la llegada de ella a Chongwadae que promovieron las fuerzas conservadoras ultraderechistas del Sur de Corea sonando con resucitar la dictadura de \"Yusin\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. El fin tragico de ella es el saldo natural de la toma del \"sillon presidencial\" por esta escoria que lejos de ser politica, no tiene ni la elemental apariencia ni facultad pensativa del ser humano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. La dimision y el encarcelamiento de la traidora son el precio de su tremendo crimen de haberse enfrascado en la campana de confrontacion fratricida actuando como marioneta de los tipejos como su bruja mentora.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t4. Si los titeres surcoreanos siguen recurriendo a la imprudente campana de la \"purga de fuerzas seguidoras al Norte\" sin distinguir bien la corriente de la epoca, no se mejoraran nunca las relaciones intercoreanas y sera mas lejana la reunificacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsa campana sucia y absurda no es nada mas que el ultimo coletazo para impedir la mejora de vinculos intercoreanos y la reunificacion manteniendo cueste lo que cueste la politica fratricida de la traidora Park sentenciada ya a la muerte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs totalmente justa la severa sentencia de la historia dictada a los traidores que dieron espaldas al pueblo y la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor muy desesperado que fuera su ultimo pataleo, los conservadores surcoreanos no tendran ninguna salida del abismo de arruinamiento."
