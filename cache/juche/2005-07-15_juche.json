The base distortion of history by the Japanese reactionaries is an intolerable insult to the Korean people, the victim, and deception and mockery of public opinion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With the 60th anniversary of the defeat of Japanese imperialism in the offing, the Japanese reactionaries are bent on instilling the militarist outlook on history and revanchist sentiments deep into the hearts of the Japanese people and creating an ideological and mental climate for reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' mode of thinking today is not different in the least from that of the preceding militarists. To conceal and praise past crimes only reveals the intention to follow their predecessors who committed those crimes. The distortion of the criminal history of the illegal and brigandish occupation of Korea and colonial domination over it in the past days, refusal to settle the past, brazen-faced claim to Tok Islet and bid for permanent membership of the UN Security Council fully reveal the course of preparations of the Japanese militarists to stage a comeback to Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today when the U.S. imperialists are working round the clock to start the second Korean war, the Japanese reactionaries are straining every nerve not to miss the opportunity of staging a comeback to Korea by capitalizing on this.

The consciousness of being the same nation is a mental strength and basis of unity and this makes the Korean nation stronger. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A main cure in resourcefully solving the inter-Korean relations that have got entangled and twisted due to outsiders is to have the consciousness of being the same nation and behave with the stand and mode of thinking of standing by the fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The true consciousness of being the same nation serves as a motive force promoting north-south reconciliation and unity and advancing the cause of reunification by the strength of compatriotism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This consciousness encourages all the members of the nation to contribute to the cause of reunification with patriotic zeal by putting the sentiments of love for the nation above all and thus overcome the differences in views on that basis, being fellow countrymen of one nation despite differing ideas and isms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The true consciousness of being the same nation also calls for attaching importance to the fellow countrymen of same blood, not to outside forces, and cooperate with the compatriots and view and approach the issue of the nation's destiny from national viewpoint and stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the fellow countrymen in the north and the south and abroad should fully display the true consciousness of being the same nation from the national stand, spur the improvement of the inter-Korean relations and dynamically advance the   June 15 era of reunification, no matter how desperately the outsiders may try to block reunification and launch aggression.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
