Korean war hawks hit for war plot\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Pyongyang, July 12 (KCNA) -- In the wake of the incident in the West Sea of Korea the South Korean war hawks said there are likely land and air \"infiltration and provocation\" by someone and called for a \"standby posture.\"\r\n   The recent anti-north diatribe came at a \"meeting of major commanding officers for the first half of '99\" involving army corps commanders and above and unit commanders under direct control.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Rodong Sinmun today describes the diatribe as a revelation of a sinister intention to provoke an all-out war in the sky, ground and at sea on the plea of the non-existent \"military threats\" from the DPRK.   The news analyst says:   The South Korean authorities have escalated armed provocations in the north's territorial waters in the West Sea of Korea since the end of the air raids on Yugoslavia.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean chief executive called for a \"tough counteraction,\" the Defense Minister instructed the units of the three services to be placed on red alert and the \"joint chiefs of staff\" commanded the operation on the spot. All this goes to prove that the armed provocation was a premeditated one.   The South Korean authorities in league with the U.S. war hawks are scheming to provoke a war in Korea according to an adventurous war scenario against the north.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the quality of the Korean People's Army and people to return fire for fire. Trigger-happy elements are bound to be burnt in flames. Provocateurs should not act rashly. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Kim Il Sung's whole life replete with  revolutionary optimism\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 12 (KCNA)-- People are  retrospecting with deep emotion the life of the President Kim Il Sung, looking up to portraits of the President with a sunny smile over his face in streets, villages and work-sites across the country. \r\n   After embarking upon the struggle to liberate the country in his teens, he knew  neither vacillation nor pessimism even in face of rigorous trials and manifold difficulties. He victoriously hewed the path of the Korean revolution full of revolutionary optimism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The activities of \"art troupes\"  personally organized and guided by him in the early period of his revolutionary activities were greatly instrumental in awakening people from all walks of life and uniting narrow-minded nationalists and anti-Japanese Chinese units  around the anti-Japanese joint front. \r\n   In the days of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle he personally wrote \"Song of Korea,\" \"Nostalgia\" and \"Song of anti-Japanese War\" and other songs and widely disseminated them among fighters, instilling revolutionary faith and optimism into them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It happened when a unit of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army commanded by him was marking May Day in Juche 29 (1940). It ran out not only of food but salt. So he told its men and officers to catch frogs in a mountain stream and take roasted frog meat as their meal that day. \r\nLooking around the men who had the meal, he said: Though you had roasted frog today, you will have on your table mullet from the river taedong when the country is free. This imbued them with fervent love of the motherland and optimism about future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Still fresh in the memory of the Korean people is the non-chalet attitude of iron-willed brilliant commander Marshal Kim Il Sung when the U.S. imperialists ignited the Korean War on June 25, 1950. He laughed broadly, saying yankees misjudged our people and wolves should be cudgeled to death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The three year war destroyed everything so severely that people were quite at a loss. At that time he made sure that revolutionary songs reverberated far and wide all over the country and the Korean people made a leaping advance by the speed of the legendary winged horse Chollima. This led to the miracle of completing the industrialization in the country in a matter of 14 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The situation was so tense in Korea that a war might break out any moment when the armed spy ship \"Pueblo\" of the U.S. was seized while illegally intruding into our territorial waters on January 23, 1968. \r\n   At that time he hosted a grand banquet in honor of officers and men of the Korean People's Army on the Army Day, at which he solemnly declared that should the U.S. ignites a war in the end, the aggressors will get nothing but corpses and death. This  instilled conviction of sure victory into them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The revolutionary faith and optimism taught by the President serve as a source of inspiration to the Korean people who are cheerfully breaking through all trials and difficulties, though their path is thorny. \r\n\r\n"
