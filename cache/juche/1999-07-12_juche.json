Korean war hawks hit for war plot\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Pyongyang, July 12 (KCNA) -- In the wake of the incident in the West Sea of Korea the South Korean war hawks said there are likely land and air \"infiltration and provocation\" by someone and called for a \"standby posture.\"\r\n   The recent anti-north diatribe came at a \"meeting of major commanding officers for the first half of '99\" involving army corps commanders and above and unit commanders under direct control.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Rodong Sinmun today describes the diatribe as a revelation of a sinister intention to provoke an all-out war in the sky, ground and at sea on the plea of the non-existent \"military threats\" from the DPRK.   The news analyst says:   The South Korean authorities have escalated armed provocations in the north's territorial waters in the West Sea of Korea since the end of the air raids on Yugoslavia.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean chief executive called for a \"tough counteraction,\" the Defense Minister instructed the units of the three services to be placed on red alert and the \"joint chiefs of staff\" commanded the operation on the spot. All this goes to prove that the armed provocation was a premeditated one.   The South Korean authorities in league with the U.S. war hawks are scheming to provoke a war in Korea according to an adventurous war scenario against the north.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the quality of the Korean People's Army and people to return fire for fire. Trigger-happy elements are bound to be burnt in flames. Provocateurs should not act rashly. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

He victoriously hewed the path of the Korean revolution full of revolutionary optimism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The activities of \"art troupes\"  personally organized and guided by him in the early period of his revolutionary activities were greatly instrumental in awakening people from all walks of life and uniting narrow-minded nationalists and anti-Japanese Chinese units  around the anti-Japanese joint front. \r\n   In the days of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle he personally wrote \"Song of Korea,\" \"Nostalgia\" and \"Song of anti-Japanese War\" and other songs and widely disseminated them among fighters, instilling revolutionary faith and optimism into them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It happened when a unit of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army commanded by him was marking May Day in Juche 29 (1940). It ran out not only of food but salt. So he told its men and officers to catch frogs in a mountain stream and take roasted frog meat as their meal that day. \r\nLooking around the men who had the meal, he said: Though you had roasted frog today, you will have on your table mullet from the river taedong when the country is free. This imbued them with fervent love of the motherland and optimism about future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Still fresh in the memory of the Korean people is the non-chalet attitude of iron-willed brilliant commander Marshal Kim Il Sung when the U.S. imperialists ignited the Korean War on June 25, 1950. He laughed broadly, saying yankees misjudged our people and wolves should be cudgeled to death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The three year war destroyed everything so severely that people were quite at a loss. At that time he made sure that revolutionary songs reverberated far and wide all over the country and the Korean people made a leaping advance by the speed of the legendary winged horse Chollima. This led to the miracle of completing the industrialization in the country in a matter of 14 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The situation was so tense in Korea that a war might break out any moment when the armed spy ship \"Pueblo\" of the U.S. was seized while illegally intruding into our territorial waters on January 23, 1968. \r\n   At that time he hosted a grand banquet in honor of officers and men of the Korean People's Army on the Army Day, at which he solemnly declared that should the U.S. ignites a war in the end, the aggressors will get nothing but corpses and death. This  instilled conviction of sure victory into them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The revolutionary faith and optimism taught by the President serve as a source of inspiration to the Korean people who are cheerfully breaking through all trials and difficulties, though their path is thorny. \r\n\r\n"

Kumgang tour sponsored by the Korean Asia-Pacific Peace Committee and the Hyun Dai Business Group of South Korea is at a standstill due to the separatist acts of the authorities of South Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nFrom the outset, the South Korean authorities took a double-dealing attitude toward the non-governmental inter-Korean project. They have tried overtly and covertly to block South Korean people from touring the mountain. For instance, they manipulated some people to argue that the tour must be suspended unconditionally and that the tour should not be continued without a written guarantee for use of tourism facilities on Mt. Kumgang for definite time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nMoreover, they caused the Min Yong Mi case before letting the headquarters of anti-north operations the \"Unification Ministry\" and \"Intelligence Service\" slander the north over \"usage of protection of tourists\" and \"infringement on the safety of people.\" Even the \"Prime Minister\" said the Mt. Kumgang tour should not resume unless the personal safety of tourists is guaranteed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is a sophism of vicious separatists to go against public opinion and block the nation's desire.   As for the guarantee for personal safety of tourists, we already took measures before the beginning of tourism. In several months, more than 80,000 tourists visited the mountain and went back home safe thanks to our sincere effort.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Meanwhile, we were planning to set up a \"coordination committee for Mt. Kumgang tour\" as a body for consultation with the Hyun Dai Business Group at the end of a successful six-month experimental tourism, paying much more importance to the personal safety of tourists.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nMin Yong Mi should have been severely punished for her crime under the law of the DPRK. But, taking into account the South Korean people's wish to visit Mt. Kumgang as soon as possible and the positive effort of the Hyun Dai Business Group, we did not keep her in prison but treated her well in a deluxe hotel, pardoned her and sent her back.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Our consistent stand is that we will in the future, too, take every conceivable safety measure and warmly welcome them with compatriotic feelings so that South Koreans who come solely for the tour of Mt. Kumgang can see the mountain without any inconvenience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe South Korean authorities' demand that the north ensure personal safety of such a criminal as Min Yong Mi who conducted an anti-north smear campaign is the rigmarole of those bereft of reason.   Although they ostensibly welcomed non-governmental project between the north and the south, they hatched anti-north plots  behind the scene and hurled slanders at the north in a bid to block the Mt. Kumgang tour of South Koreans.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their misbehaviour can never be justified and deserves condemnation from the entire nation.   We warn the South Korean authorities to stop such ill-intentioned acts against the north  as planting anti-north elements among tourists.   Then, everything will go well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean rulers  can never shirk their responsibility for rupturing the tour of Mt. Kumgang against the ardent desire of those people to see Mt. Kumgang. They will have to pay dearly for this.\r\n   They would be well advised to act with discretion, clearly mindful that  the longer they keep the tour of Mt. Kumgang suspended, the more bitterly they will be cursed and condemned by the entire nation. \r\n\r\n"
