From last year the start and end of the rainy season have become obvious again.\r\n It is expected that there would be a heavy fall of rain coupled with strong wind and flood during the current rainy season. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This rainy weather will seriously affect the yield of first crops such as wheat and barley, the growth of which has been delayed owing to unfavorable climate, he added.    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n"

If it attempts to use the talks as leverage for its sinister political purpose, the matter will get more complicated and, accordingly, the prospect of the settlement of the nuclear issue cannot but become gloomier. Japan will be held entirely answerable for this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan honestly wants the settlement of the nuclear issue and denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, it should not peddle such irrelevant ware as the \"abduction issue\" at the six-party talks.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Typical examples are the stand and attitude it took whenever the U.S. was driven to a serious political impasse in such matters as the Iraqi war and the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for the U.S. which Japan worships as God, it is not so kindhearted as to take the lot of its junior ally into consideration, defying its own political loss. Actually the U.S. turned its back on the UN reform proposal of group 4, fearing that its approval would play down its own political status and say among the permanent members of the Security Council. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should draw a lesson from this, though belatedly.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
