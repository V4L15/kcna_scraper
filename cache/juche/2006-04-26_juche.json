These daily mounting anti-U.S., anti-war actions of south Koreans are prompted by the lesson of history \"they can survive only when they are free from the U.S.,\" the article notes, and goes on:\r\n The above-said struggle is a just and patriotic one for protecting the right of the nation to exist and its sovereignty and a sacred patriotic struggle for reunification as it is aimed at preserving and implementing the June 15 joint declaration so as to pave a wide avenue for national unity and independent reunification. \r\n The south Korean people have become confident that they can reject the interference of the foreign forces and independently reunify the country under the uplifted banner of \"By our nation itself\", and they strongly demand the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops withdraw from south Korea as early as possible as required by the developing relations between the north and south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should hold higher the banner of the struggle against the U.S. and conservatives in order to cut off the tentacles of the U.S. domination and interference in south Korea and completely eliminate the pro-U.S. conservative forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The key to the victory in the struggle against the U.S. and war lies in the unity of the people from all walks of life desirous of peace and independent reunification.\r\n The south Korean people will intensify the above-said struggle and thus build an independent and reunified new society, their centuries-old desire, without fail.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a tragedy caused by the U.S. unjustified war of aggression. The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland said this in its Information Bulletin No. 918 on April 24. \r\n It continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a shame on the nation and a tragedy for sons of the Korean nation to meet tragic deaths in an alien land after being hurled into it as part of a shock brigade, bullet shields to execute the U.S. policy of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Moreover, it is painful that young and middle-aged Koreans are forced to fall down in Iraq, shedding blood, under the cursed helmets of the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops at a time when even the U.S. tends to cut down its forces stationed in Iraq in a bid to get out of the bottomless quagmire it is finding itself for starting an unjustifiable war, to say nothing of its allies which dispatched troops to Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Just a few south Korean civilians and Korean-Americans met miserable deaths in Iraq this time but no one can predict how many south Koreans will meet the same tragic deaths as Kim Son Il, Choe Min Su and Kim Kun Hyong did in the days to come. \r\n The south Korean people from all walks of life should clearly see through the gravity and danger of the dispatch of troops to Iraq, resolutely oppose and reject the U.S. policy of aggression and the treacherous acts of toeing the U.S. policy and turn out in a dynamic anti-U.S., anti-war struggle.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The mode varies from the existing formula by which the party was founded before organizing the army and making the revolution. \r\n The internal and international situation was very complex in those years when the President embarked upon the road of revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The might of the USSR was strengthened and the revolutionary struggle of the oppressed people was further mounted with each passing day while the economic panic which started in the United States from 1929 swept the world. The imperialists made desperate efforts in attempt to get rid of the serious politico-economic crisis.\r\n In particular, the Japanese imperialists further intensified colonial repression and plunder of Korea while hastening the preparations for invading the Asian continent in full earnest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people, who were subjected to harsh colonial rule of the Japanese imperialists, vigorously waged anti-Japanese mass struggle in different parts of the country. The bare-handed riot crowds could not escape themselves from fiasco before the brutal armed repression by the Japanese imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality urgently demanded to wage an organized armed struggle to beat back the Japanese imperialists who did not willing to give up of their own accord the colony for their aggressive and predatory nature but were armed to the teeth.\r\n Proceeding from this, the President expounded the idea that the only way for national liberation was to wage an armed struggle at the historic Kalun Meeting (June 3    July 2, 1930), Mingyuegou Meeting (December 1931) and various other occasions. And by embodying the idea, he founded the Anti-Japanese People's Guerrilla Army (AJPGA), the first revolutionary armed forces, on April 25, 1932. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He strengthened the AJPGA politically, ideologically and in military technique at each stage of the anti-Japanese armed struggle. He, basing himself on this, guided the Korean revolution as a whole. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That served as the foundation for building the Party and the state without delay in Korea, which retook the sovereignty of the nation after defeating the Japanese imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President had all along directed primary attention to the military affairs and increased the defence capabilities during guiding the revolution and thus made a triumphant advance of the revolution.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
