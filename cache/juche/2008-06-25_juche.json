Supremacy, profit and \"high rate\" of economic growth sought by others do not have anything common with the Korean people's efforts to achieve the above-said goal. The country pervaded with the spirit of self-reliance is the true picture of the great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will never step back even an inch from the path of self-reliance chosen by themselves but scale the high eminence of the above-said nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Self-reliance is the signpost for their own life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should give the fullest play to the inexhaustible energies, wisdom and enthusiasm and thus glorify this year, the 60th anniversary of the foundation of the DPRK, as a year of self-reliance under the leadership of Kim Jong Il, a great pioneer of self-reliance.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S. loud-mouthed \"peace\" and \"disarmament\" are, in essence, a slogan for beefing up the nuclear forces and stepping up arms race, the commentary notes, citing facts that the U.S. is becoming evermore frantic in its moves to bolster its armed forces including nuclear weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' policy for bolstering their nuclear forces and stepping up the arms race is creating the danger of fresh global arms race and nuclear stand-off and rendering the situation tenser. This fact clearly proves that the U.S. is a disturber of peace, not a \"peace champion,\" and the mastermind of nuclear threat and proliferation and arms race. With nothing can the U.S. justify its policy of arms race and moves for a war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose forces will not be able to escape international isolation and destruction, should they rush headlong into arms race and a war of aggression quite contrary to the trend of the present times towards disarmament and peace and wishes of humankind, warns the commentary.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
