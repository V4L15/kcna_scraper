The DPRK has turned into a strong fortress of socialism under the Songun policy, he added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The scientific secretary of the association addressing the seminar said that the greatest feat performed by Kim Jong Suk was that she dedicated her whole life to devotedly defending the leader and bringing up Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A message of greetings to Kim Jong Il was adopted at the seminar.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
