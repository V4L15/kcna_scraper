It can not be construed otherwise than a sheer sophism which can work on nobody.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has regarded aggression and interference as its mainstay for forming and keeping itself while habituating itself to posing threat and making provocations against other countries. And such old habit is driving the U.S. to considering any hurdles to it as threat and provocations. Therefore, nobody can lodge an objection against the fact that the U.S. political thinking and judgment are confused with an extreme contradiction and delusion of persecution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters is that the U.S. has become evermore vicious in anti-DPRK campaign under the pretext of \"threat\" and \"provocations\", taking issue with it in all aspects including ideology and social system, economy, national defense, culture and human rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All these moves are prompted by an evil plot to justify and materialize its policy of war against the DPRK at any cost, so as to politically stamp out, economically isolate and militarily stifle the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is well evidenced by the \"Quadrennial Defense Review\" released by the U.S. Defense Department some days ago, which calls for gaining \"arms supremacy for winning decisive victory\" over the DPRK after terming it \"a state posing direct threat\" and a \"biggest rival\". The chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, too, in his speech made the outbreak of a war on the Korean Peninsula as a fait accompli to incite a war fever.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t So, the U.S. is hell-bent on escalating tensions in a bid to find an excuse for materializing its policy of aggression on the DPRK while branding its every practice, including its policy and efforts for peace and prosperity, as \"provocation\" and \"threat\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the U.S. twisted way of thinking only drives it into an abyss of self-contradiction, a result of its anachronistic judgment and illogical policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The longer the U.S. engages itself in clinging to the already worn-out doctrine of \"threat from north Korea\", the earlier the DPRK will bring its final victory."

There, he blustered that the DPRK's access to nukes cannot be allowed. He even called for intensifying the cooperation system among the U.S., Japan and south Korea, adding the military cooperation including joint drills and MD system should be incorporated in it.\n\t\t\t\t\t The tripartite summit held by the U.S. under the pretext of \"coping with the DPRK's nukes\" is a revelation of its ulterior motive to hurt and stifle the DPRK and realize its strategy of aggression against Asia by tightening the triangular military alliance of the U.S., Japan and south Korea, says Rodong Sinmun Monday in a commentary.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The commentary goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such move of the U.S. is very risky as it has become a root cause of instability and military tensions on the Korean peninsula and in Northeast Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It also swims against the trend towards dialogue and detente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is evidenced by the fact that the U.S. has deliberately spoiled the atmosphere of the inter-Korean dialogue by intensifying the Foal Eagle joint military drills with south Korea and, at the same time, put pressure upon the south Korean authorities to improve relations with Japan which have been estranged due to the issue of history and supported Japan's move to revive militarism and its exercise of the \"right to collective self-defense\", egging it on to reinvasion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S.-Japan-south Korea summit which was held at the initiative of Obama is being protested by Koreans and other people in the world, arousing due vigilance.

The mission of the DPRK's nuclear force is to let the Korean people live in luxury and comfort under socialism to their heart's content safely in the nuclear power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nuclear deterrence of the DPRK is neither a political bargaining chip nor a means of economic dealing. It is the life and soul of the nation and national treasure of reunified Korea which can never be bartered with anything.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It provides a sure guarantee for defending peace and security not only in the Korean peninsula but in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the U.S. is waiting for a chance to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK while escalating nuclear threat to it as the days go by, the DPRK was compelled to bolster up its nuclear deterrent both in quality and quantity. This is the exercise of the just right of self-defence and the peaceful measure from A to Z.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter what others may say and as long as the U.S. has persistently threatened the DPRK with nukes, it will hold fast to the strategic line of simultaneously pushing forward economic construction and the building of nuclear force."

RPDC de prevenir la nueva guerra y asegurar la paz y la estabilidad en la Peninsula Coreana se enfrentan con el grave desafio de las fuerzas hostiles, inicia la nota y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la llamada reunion consultiva extraoficial sostenida el dia 28 a peticion urgente de EE.UU., el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU perpetro un acto ilegal y provocador de cuestionar injustamente y \"condenar\" los ejercicios arriba citados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl lanzamiento de cohetes constituye el entrenamiento de caracter autodefensivo de nuestro ejercito para hacer frente a la grave situacion en que se intensifican dia a dia la persistente politica hostil anti-RPDC del imperio y sus entrenamientos de guerra nuclear de caracter agresivo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA pesar de que se va creando este ano en la Peninsula Coreana el ambiente de alivio gracias a los iniciativos y pacificos esfuerzos de la RPDC, el imperio norteamericano desplego por fin junto con los titeres surcoreanos los ejercicios militares conjuntos Key Resolve y Foal Eagle movilizando inmensos efectivos agresores y los pertrechos mortiferos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe ampliaron poco a poco su dimension y peligrosidad y en el simulacro Ssangryong, iniciado el 27 del marzo pasado, tomaron parte las tropas de maxima envergadura despues de 1993 con la meta principal de \"ocupar Pyongyang\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs muy natural que el EPC, cuya su mision es defender la seguridad y la paz del pais y pueblo, disponga de los

tomar otra vez una \"medida adecuada\" tras cuestionar ese lanzamiento de cohetes como \"violacion de resolucion\" y \"amenaza a la paz y seguridad internacionales\", lo cual deviene un proceder intolerable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas \"resoluciones\" del CS son el producto de la politica hostil anti-RPDC del imperio y estan penetradas por las demandas bandidescas de arrebatar hasta el derecho a lanzar los satelites con fines pacificos atentando flagrantemente la soberania de la RPDC y la seguridad nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor tal motivo, tan pronto como se adoptaron esas

por eso que se produce el fenomeno irracional de considerar como \"provocacion\" los esfuerzos de la RPDC por preservar la seguridad del pais y la nacion y de describir como \"defensa de paz\" las agresivas maniobras del imperio encaminadas a provocar la guerra nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSolamente causara la agravacion de la tension y el conflicto en vez de hacer aporte a mantener la paz y la seguridad de la Peninsula Coreana y la region, si el Consejo de Seguridad siga portandose sin imparcialidad segun el guion del imperio y negando persistentemente nuestro legitimo ejercicio de derechos con las \"resoluciones\" muy injustas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara imputar a la RPDC la responsabilidad de la agravacion de tension y buscar el pretexto de incremento de fuerzas armadas segun su estrategia de dar prioridad a Asia-Pacifico dando destaque a la \"amenaza\" de la RPDC, EE.UU. sometio al CS el caso de lanzamiento de cohetes de la RPDC para condenarlo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras EE.UU. siga recurriendo a las maquinaciones de aislar y aplastar a la RPDC abusando del CS partiendo de sus intereses estrategicos, tambien tenemos el derecho a autodefendernos y estamos preparados para ello.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDado que EE.UU. desarrolla sin parar los entrenamientos de guerra nuclear describiendolos como \"anuales\" al movilizar diversos medios de ataque nuclear con la meta de \"conquistar Pyongyang\", se incluiran tambien en nuestros ejercicios los adiestramientos de diversas formas para emplear los disuasivos nucleares mas diversificados con diferentes poderios de ataque contra los blancos de mediana y larga distancia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFrente al caso de que el imperio vuelva a tomarlo como \"provocacion\", la RPDC esta dispuesta para tomar las medidas de otras fases inimaginables por los enemigos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas se incluira la prueba nuclear de nuevo tipo para intensificar mas el disuasivo nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe actuar con prudencia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi ocurre un estado catastrofico no deseado por nadie en la Peninsula Coreana, el imperio estadounidense se responsabilizara totalmente de ello."
