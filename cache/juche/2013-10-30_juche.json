They talk rubbish that the tough steps taken by the DPRK are little short of hyping again the strategy for \"engaging the U.S. and blocking south Korea\" as a \"gesture\" to attract the U.S. attention. They also claim that there is little possibility that the situation will develop as desired by the north due to the consistent stand of the U.S. administration that the improvement of the inter-Korean relations is a \"premise for the mending of north Korea-U.S. relations\".\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a mean and base way of thinking of a colonial servant. The traitors are making such tongue-lashing, not feeling ashamed of having vitiated the atmosphere of dialogue while talking about \"theory of principle\" though it had developed favorably. This is nothing but a cynical ploy to divert elsewhere world public criticism of them who derailed inter-Korean dialogue and deteriorated the situation. \"Engaging the U.S. and blocking south Korea\" touted by them only betrays their ulterior intention.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Engaging the U.S.\" may be a serious issue for the puppet regime as it has to read the U.S. face in all matters while kowtowing to it but it is nothing to do with the DPRK. If it is in the interests of the country and the nation, the DPRK will can engage or block the U.S. as it pleases.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whether the DPRK opts for bilateral or multilateral talks is ultimately aimed to put an end to the U.S. threat of a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula and hand a new nuclear-free world to the nation and posterity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is because attaching importance to the nation is the principled stand the DPRK has firmly maintained as regards the common interests of the nation. Proceeding from this, the DPRK advised the Park Geun Hye group to think and act from the stand of giving importance to the nation when it was making a new war drumbeat together with foreign forces after taking office and trumpeted about \"the north's sincere dismantlement of its nukes\" and begged for \"cooperation in pressurize the north\" during its foreign trips. But what Park and her group did was perfidious.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group has cried out for \"bringing down the north's regime\" while talking about \"leading the north to  changes\" but unconditionally served foreign forces while vociferating about \"tightened blood alliance\" with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group has taken the lead in helping its master in its moves to stifle the DPRK, ignoring sincere efforts and magnanimity of fellow countrymen. Does it have any face to grumble about \"engaging the U.S. and blocking south Korea.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The humiliating diplomacy towards foreign forces is a \"state policy\" of the Park group. It is   a product of the master-servant political relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With no rhetoric can the Park group justify its cursed behaviors as it is prolonging its remaining days as political prostitutes while still leaving everything to the tender mercy of its master.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Looking back on history, all puppet forces met miserable ends for being totally submissive to the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park and her group had better bear this deep in mind."

The south Korean authorities okayed this agreement. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This means joining in the rebellion of history which may shake the foundation of postwar system that has been maintained in Northeast Asia since the end of World War II. So it is an act of treachery paving the way for Japan's reinvasion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now the U.S. pins great hope on Japan's growing military potential and its increasing role in carrying out its Asia-Pacific strategy for aggression. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries are now working hard to launch undisguised overseas aggression by pulling down the barrier banning Japan's overseas military actions after the war under the signboard of exercise of the \"right to collective self-defense.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was against this backdrop that the Park Geun Hye group of south Korea unhesitatingly supported the Japanese reactionaries' moves for reinvasion which the successive rulers of south Korea dared not do. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What it is now doing is the thrice-cursed act of treachery being perpetrated by it oblivious of the distress-torn history of the Korean nation caused by the Japanese imperialists. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan has appeared as the most dangerous aggressor force in Asia, backed by such apostates of history as the U.S. and south Korean puppet forces. It has emerged a more dangerous war state than what it used to be in the 20th century. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is the primary target of Japan's overseas aggression. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities supported Japan's exercise of the \"right to collective self-defense\" now that the U.S.-Japan-south Korea triangular military alliance is becoming a reality. This cannot be construed otherwise than an attempt to launch a war against the north, backed by outside forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Koreans suffered bitterer disgrace than what others did, while undergoing distress due to the colonial rule of Japan in the last century. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the Park Geun Hye regime less than one year old is going to repeat this disgraceful history. It seems that the \"yusin\" dictator has already revived. He was praised as \"a final soldier of the Imperial Japanese Army\" after making his oath in blood to \"be loyal to the Emperor unto death.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the bitter lesson taught by the history of the Korean nation that if a man takes in flunkeyism, he is bound to be a fool and if a nation pursues flunkeyism, it is bound to go to ruin. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If they are members of the nation, they should come to their senses and roll back their anachronistic sycophantic and country-selling policies, though belatedly."

She is now busy pleasing big powers the same bad way her father did.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She formally signed the \"tailored deterrence strategy\", a U.S. scenario for a nuclear war against the DPRK, taking the lead in the moves to carry out the U.S. policy toward the DPRK. She is frequently introducing U.S. nuclear carriers, strategic bombers and other nuclear strike means into south Korea and joining the U.S. in its moves to establish the missile defense system aimed to secure strategic edge over big powers in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently she did such stupid things as allowing Japan's exercise of the \"right to collective self-defense\" which it has sought to reinvade Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She is trying hard to improve her image while currying favor with China but it clearly sees through her regime's cunning acts of threatening peace and stability in the continent, backed by the U.S. and Japan.

The Park group is a horde of sycophants and traitors worse than the Lee Myung Bak group which was tried by history for being modern-day \"five traitors of 1905.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Confidence-building politics\", like \"no nukes, opening and 3 000 dollars\", is bound to lead to humiliation and self-destruction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If Park Geun Hye persists in the acts putting the erstwhile traitors into the shade, oblivious of the tragedy of the nation's history, she will not be able to escape the same misfortune as what her father suffered."
