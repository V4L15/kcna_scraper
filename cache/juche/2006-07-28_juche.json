            "content": "Papers Call for Glorifying Feats Performed by Kim Il Sung in Victorious War \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 27 (KCNA) -- Pyongyang-based papers Thursday in editorials dedicated to the 53rd anniversary of the victory in the great Fatherland Liberation War call for glorifying the great feats performed by President Kim Il Sung by winning the war under the uplifted banner of Songun.\r\n Rodong Sinmun says that the great victory in the Fatherland Liberation War was a historic event that demonstrated the pluck and stamina of heroic Korea to defend the destiny of the country and the nation and deal merciless deadly blows at aggressors, adding that the victory in the war made the DPRK shed its rays to the world as an invincible power that defeated formidable U.S. imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that the Fatherland Liberation War was a revolutionary war of great significance in the world history as it shattered to smithereens the myth of the \"mightiness\" of U.S. imperialism and brought the beginning of the downhill turn for them for the first time in the world, the editorial continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The shining victory the army and people of the DPRK won in the war was a noble fruition of the gifted military wisdom and outstanding commanding art of Kim Il Sung. His ever-changing tactics, persevering spirit of attack and matchless courage and pluck were decisive factors that made it possible for the army and people of the DPRK to take initiatives and create an undying heroic epic while dealing deadly blows at the aggressors throughout the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will never forget the above-said feats of the President no matter how much water may flow under the bridge but eternally glorify them along with the ever-victorious history of Songun revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those feats serve as a precious boon of lasting value for the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unshakable is the faith of the army and people of the DPRK to firmly defend their ideology and system along the path chosen by themselves under the uplifted banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Strong is the pluck of the DPRK and bright is the future of the Korean-style cause of socialism as long as it is led by Kim Jong Il, illustrious commander of Mt. Paektu. He is the great defender and peerless patriot and the greatest general as he is firmly defending the destiny of the country and the nation with invincible arms, possessed of extraordinary military quality and commanding art no other great man can ever match. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ever-victorious history of the Korean revolution will last forever as long as there are the seasoned and tested guidance of Kim Jong Il, the nation's powerful capacity for self-defence built for scores of years and the single-minded unity of the whole party and army stronger than a nuclear weapon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson calls for successfully carrying forward the great feats performed by Kim Il Sung in winning the war and thus firmly defend the sovereignty of the nation and dynamically step up the building of a great prosperous powerful socialist nation.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
