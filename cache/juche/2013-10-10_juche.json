Korean Authorities for Kicking Up Racket over Inter-Korean Summit Minutes \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, October 10 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) Thursday released the following statement to denounce the south Korean puppet authorities for kicking up an anti-DPRK racket again over the north-south summit minutes:\n\t\t\t\t\t On Oct. 2, the puppet prosecution of south Korea made public the intermediary investigation results which said that the Roh Moo Hyun's regime did not transfer the 2007 north-south summit minutes to the Archives but saved it in Roh's private database and deleted the draft minutes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The riff-raffs in Chongwadae and the \"Saenuri\" Party, as if they had waited for it, immediately cried they would open to public the recorded remarks to prove whether the minutes were corrected or not, talking about \"the discarded original historic records,\" \"breach of national discipline,\" \"abandonment of northern limit line\" and \"low attitude\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative media joined them in their racket and pressed the opposition forces including those related to the summit talks, as if they had spotted heavy crime. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent racket defying the DPRK's warnings and denunciation at home and abroad is a reckless act disclosing their true colors as group of wicked politicians and gangs who stoop to any infamy to achieve their sinister political ambition. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As we had solemnly declared, the north-south summit minutes are an important matter related not only to the internal affairs of south Korea but also to the dignity of the DPRK's supreme leadership. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There has been no precedent by which minutes of summit between state leaders were made public in the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But not content with slandering the north-south summit which should be regarded as holy and absolute, the south Korean authorities kicked up the racket over the summit minutes and even declared that it would open to public the recorded remarks. This is the indecorum showing that they are political hooligans and rowdies bereft of elementary diplomatic common sense and courtesy and principle to be observed in holding dialogue. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The CPRK bitterly condemns the reckless racket over the summit minutes as a mockery of the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and a serious political provocation against it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now the south Korean regime brings charges against the righteous people, who made contributions to opening of the turning phase for national reunification, over the minutes incident. But the real criminals who should stand trial are the conservative group who totally deny the historic declarations adopted at the north-south summits and try to belittle their great significance and national historic exploits for their party interests and reduce them into the plaything of political strife. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Hye is behind the immoral and reckless acts. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As proven by the Intelligence Service's interference in the presidential election that sparked off a furor in south Korea, it was Park Geun Hye who stooped to infamy to seize \"power\" with the use of the puppet IS. When the public opinion and people's mindset reached the point of explosion for this, Park posted ill-famed Nam Jae Jun to the puppet IS as its head and instigated him to mastermind the case of minutes and stage the unprecedented farce of the \"forces following the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was also Park Geun Hye regime which plunged the north-south ties into a deadlock, while viciously insulting the dignity of the supreme leadership and social system in the DPRK and mocking at its efforts for dialogue and negotiations, being hell-bent on the provocation of a war against the DPRK in league with the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even at this moment Park is making invectives against the DPRK during her trip to southeastern Asian region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park regime abused the minutes of summit talks for meeting its sinister aims, not content with escalating confrontation with the fellow countrymen out of extreme hostility toward the DPRK. What enrages us most is that the group of despicable and senseless guys claimed \"courtesy\" and \"confidence\" whenever an opportunity is presented itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent racket of minutes kicked up by the puppet regime is aimed to get rid of its plight tight-cornered at home and abroad for its acts of disrupting the north-south relations, turn the table in its favor, secure a position favorable for winning in the upcoming off-year election and furthermore, contain and strangle pro-reunification patriotic forces and other democratic reformist forces and lord it over in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But its smear campaign will get it nowhere.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will never remain an on-looker to the present situation in which the minutes of the summit between the top leaders of the north and the south are insulted by confrontational maniacs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The regime should know that the DPRK can also open to public all the flattering remarks made by rulers of south Korea and their special envoys when they came to the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is no doubt that south Korea will be thrown into chaos and the present chief executive will find herself in an embarrassing situation in case those remarks are made public.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is closely following the development of the situation in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet regime should behave with discretion, bearing in mind the repeated warnings of the DPRK that it will be made to own full responsibilities for the serious consequences to be entailed by its persistent act of kicking up the racket of minutes, escalating the north-south confrontation."

Pero, el verdadero criminal que debe ser juzgado es la banda de conservadores que niega totalmente las declaraciones historicas aprobadas en las Cumbres Norte-Sur y malemplea su enorme importancia y proeza historica nacional en las pugnas politicas para satisfacer los intereses y estrategia partidistas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDetras de esa campana sucia esta Park Geun-hye. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo demuestra el caso de intervencion del Servicio Nacional de Inteligencia en las pasadas elecciones presidenciales, Park es la autora que uso al SNI para usurpar el \"poder\".
