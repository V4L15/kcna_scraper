It clarifies the idea that the Juche philosophy serves as a revolutionary philosophy and a political philosophy of the Workers' Party of Korea and principled issues arising in studying and explaining the Juche philosophy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the Juche philosophy serves as a guiding idea for the Korean revolution and the social construction, the pamphlet in the preface stresses that President       Kim Il Sung founded and developed the Juche idea in the course of the struggle for independence, prosperity, peace and reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n General Secretary Kim Jong Il has dedicated himself to carrying forward the revolutionary cause of the President and developing the Juche idea, it notes, adding that he in his work scientifically proved the originality of the Juche philosophy and its main principles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The association expressed expectation that the pamphlet would help its readers understand the DPRK and its unique revolutionary traditions.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
