            "content": "White Paper on GNP's Anti-National Nature \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 5 (KCNA) -- The National Reunification Institute Thursday issued a white paper to inform the public at home and abroad of the anti-national and undemocratic nature of the Grand National Party and denounce it now that south Korea is at the crossroads of democracy or fascism and a stumbling block is lying in the way of improving the inter-Korean relations due to the frantic racket of the GNP and other ultra-right conservatives forces in south Korea.\r\n The paper says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The predecessors of the GNP bore different names such as the Liberal Party, the Democratic Republican Party, the Democratic Justice Party, the Democratic Liberal Party and the New Korea Party. But they were all organized by the U.S. and had been maintained by hand-raised stooges of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the GNP was defeated in the presidential election in 1997, cursed by the people, it lost its power which had been held by pro-U.S. elements for over half a century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP, once remained discouraged, began going on the rampage when the Bush administration emerged in the U.S. in 2001. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the presidential election last year, the GNP joined the U.S. in kicking up a nuclear racket to stifle the DPRK in a bid to misuse its nuclear issue for winning in the election. The GNP behaved so disgracefully as to cling more tightly to its American master's coattails to win in the election with his support. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But it sustained a more shameful defeat in the election than in the 1997 presidential election. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP group, instead of drawing a lesson from it, challenged the democratic forces by escalating its pro-U.S. moves in a bid to prolong its remaining days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In June last it elected its new representative and heavyweights under the U.S. wirepulling and has run frantic to revive fascist dictatorship in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is now focussing on staging a political coup by ultra-right elements with the election of \"National Assemblymen\" to be held next year as a momentum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The belligerent nature of the GNP found its vivid expression when it zealously supported its American master's reckless remarks about north Korea being part of an \"axis of evil\" and his hard-line policy toward the DPRK and declared the compatriots in the north as \"the principal enemy\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP is a group of paid trumpeters faithful to the U.S. as it takes the lead in echoing the U.S. talks about a \"military option\" and \"sanctions\". It was the GNP which did set up \"a special measure committee against the north's nuclear weapons\" in the party in a bid to strengthen the cooperation with the U.S. over the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-reunification nature of the GNP was brought into bolder relief when the historic Pyongyang meeting was held and the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration was published. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It rejected Article One of the declaration, claiming it may lead to the withdrawal of the U.S. troops and break the \"alliance\" with the U.S. and Article Two, asserting that the liberal democratic system gave its way to the federal formula of Koryo set forth by the north. It totally denied the joint declaration in the end and called for nullifying it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was none other than the GNP which opposed the project of reconnecting the rail and road links on the east and the west coasts, an auspicious project that relinks the severed territory and blood ties of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fascist rowdyism of the GNP created such a deplorable situation where those personages involved in the Pyongyang meeting are arrested, tried and subject to punishment. Moreover, a businessman who blazed a trail of north-south cooperation met a tragic death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP dares fault noble north-south cooperation projects for no proper reason. This is a mockery of justice and truth and a challenge to the fellow countrymen desirous of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is impossible to defend the dignity of the nation and think about peace, reunification and prosperity of the nation as long as the GNP remains in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP would be well advised to face up to the trend of the times, stop running amuck and quit the political arena of its own accord as it had already been judged by history and the times.     \r\n\r\n"

As a result it has turned the country into a powerful socialist one unaffected by any political and economic fluctuation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It shaped such popular policies as the universal free medical service in 1953 and universal free education in 1959 and the complete abolition of taxation in 1974. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the DPRK is ushering in an era of greater prosperity under the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since President Kim Il Sung passed away in 1994, Kim Jong Il has pursued a new politics based on the Songun idea to frustrate the imperialists' persistent efforts to isolate and stifle the country, defend it with credit, and fully demonstrate the might of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In 2001 alone, some ten countries opened diplomatic relations with the DPRK. The fact is illustrative of the prestige the DPRK enjoys in external relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since the publication of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, the relations between the north and south of Korea have been turned into those of national reconciliation, unity and cooperation from those of confrontation and distrust and a great advance made in the efforts for the reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The entire Korean people are now working hard to build a great prosperous powerful nation on this land without fail under the leadership of Kim Jong Il.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

As a result, the DPRK becomes a country of heroes and heroines while its army emerges an heroic army and its people a heroic people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Calling for successfully fulfilling the tasks before the revolution, he underscored the need for all the people to unite close around Kim Jong Il, resolutely foil the imperialists' moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK and perform new heroic feats in the efforts to build a great prosperous powerful socialist nation under the uplifted banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He also underlined the need to enshrine Kim Jong Il's unique Songun idea as unshakable faith and ardently follow it and resolutely uphold and implement the Songun politics, always thinking and behaving as required by it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We heroes and heroines should regard the development of the national defence industry as a key link in the efforts to increase the state power and take the lead in building a strong military deterrent force by giving priority to this industry as required by the Songun era, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The heroes and heroines should also take the lead in the drive to further increase the country's economic potential, bring about a surge in production and improve the standard of the people's living by implementing to the last the important economic policies set forth by the Party and steps taken by it in recent years, he added, underscoring the need for all the heroes and heroines to fulfill their revolutionary obligations to foil the obstructive moves of the separatists at home and abroad by the concerted efforts of the nation and accelerate the historic cause of national reunification upholding the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration as the banner of the great march for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. bellicose forces ignite a war of aggression in disregard of our repeated warnings, we heroic fighters, with high anti-imperialist class awareness, will give vent to the pent-up grudge against the U.S. imperialists, their sworn enemy, and deal deadly blows, more powerful than a nuclear strike, at them and become honorable victors in the confrontation with the U.S., he warned.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
