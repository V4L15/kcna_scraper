In a word, this is a revelation of their intention to shield the criminal and become a partner of the IS. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a matter of fact, the south Korean ruling quarters are working hard to increase the fascist function and role of the IS under the signboard of \"IS reform.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is evidenced by the fact that the south Korean puppet group is working with bloodshot eyes over a \"bill\", insisting that \"the mandate to control all forms of cyber terror\" meaning the unlimited watch and the right to handle information about various social circles should be given to the IS.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the IS is allowed to have the above-said mandate while exercising extraterritorial rights as now, this will entail serious consequences. This is the unanimous mindset of south Korean people today.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A clear proof of this is that when people of various circles demanded a ban on IS agents' entry into public organs and the reduction of its intelligence gathering function, the south Korean authorities blustered that \"pro-north forces\" should be handled by the IS and it is hard to completely dismantle departments for gathering intelligence, trumpeting about \"forces following the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The upbeat agents of the IS have gone so shameless as to claim that they have so far \"pushed forward its own reform including readjustment of business rules and personnel reshuffle\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts go to prove that the south Korean ruling quarters are loudmouthed about \"IS reform\" under the pressure of people from all walks of life, but they are working in the direction of strengthening dictatorship, ensuring ruling security and stepping up the policy of confrontation through it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"IS reform\" means reinforcing its fascist dictatorial system and it will only result in the unlimited suppression of the people desirous of independence and democratization of south Korean society and national reunification and political opposition forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The existence of the IS, which earned an ill fame by unhesitatingly killing \"the president of south Korea\", will never bring security to the present ruling quarters. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As demanded by the people of all social standings of south Korea, the IS should not be \"reformed\" but be disbanded totally."
