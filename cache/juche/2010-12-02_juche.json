            "content": "Kim Jong Il Inspects Different Units in Tanchon City\r\nPyongyang, December 2 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il provided field guidance to different units in Tanchon City.\n\t\t\t\t\t The first leg of his guidance was the Tanchon Magnesia Factory. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round different production processes including the Combined Production Control Room, the Anthracite Briquette Shop, the Roofing Tile Shop and the Packing Container Shop to learn in detail about the construction, technical equipment and production there. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recalling that President Kim Il Sung in his lifetime was always thoughtful of putting the magnesia clinker industry on a Juche basis, he was very pleased that the factory built a modern process for producing clinker by use of anthracite abundant in the country, thereby laying solid foundation for successfully carrying out the behests of the President and making a great contribution to the nation's development of industry. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is possible to build a socialist thriving nation when the country builds the economy operating with locally available resources and by its own efforts and regards it as a springboard, he said, stressing that the Juche orientation is an invariable true path to be followed by the economy of the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Looking at the roofing tiles made with light burned magnesia produced by the factory, he said that its quality is very high. He highly praised the factory for making a great contribution to solving the problems of materials for the last stages of projects and roofing tiles. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also praised the factory for increasing the production of packing containers after newly building a modern process for the production of them, adding that it is important to produce lots of quality packing containers for diverse uses. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He set forth the tasks to be implemented by the factory. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The next leg of his guidance was the Tanchon Mining Machine Plant. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round different places of the plant including the large processing workshop, he acquainted himself in detail with the work for putting large machines on a CNC basis. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He gave a high appreciation of the achievements made by the workers and technicians of the plant, noting that it has put such large machines as 4-m and 10-m turning lathes on a CNC basis, thus making it possible to produce in time and quality more various kinds of mining equipment including large-size crusher urgently needed to keep production going at mines in the area of Tanchon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a miracle that the workers of the plant in close cooperation with researchers of Kim Chaek University of Technology have put huge equipment on a CNC basis in a short span of time, boosting the precision rate of products ten times as compared with that in the past, he noted, adding that this is a striking demonstration of the validity and vitality of the WPK's policy of waging a dynamic drive to push back the frontiers of the latest science and technology. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pleased to see products including welding rods made by the plant by its own efforts, he highly appreciated the work style of the officials and employees of the plant conducting business activities on the principle of profitability by actively tapping inner reserves. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the mines are to thoroughly carry out the WPK's policy of massively mining and dressing, it is necessary for the plant to keep production going at a high rate to supply in time equipment needed by them, he stressed. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed expectation and belief that the officials and other working people of the plant would as ever achieve bigger successes in production and technological updating. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The third leg of his guidance was the construction site of Tanchon Port. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After being briefed on it before a large map showing its panoramic view, he went round different places of the construction site to learn in detail about the construction. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Feasting his eyes on the breakwaters stretching far, wharf dredging sites and varieties of prefab parts for breakwaters, he expressed great satisfaction over the fact that the port construction is making very rapid progress. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is an astonishing miracle, indeed, for party members and other working people of the Ministry of Land and Marine Transport to successfully carry on the huge construction of Tanchon Port by the efforts of the ministry after building the Ryongnam Ship Repair Factory a few years ago, startling the world, he said, extending high appreciation and thanks to them who are successfully constructing another structure to shine long along with  the era of Songun by displaying popular heroism and matchless devotion despite difficulties and ordeals. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that this significant year the builders engaged in the reclamation of the tideland on Taegye Island turned a Western coastal area into a vast fertile land to be visited by a bumper harvest, braving rough waves, and the brave sea conquerors of the above-said ministry are now bringing about the greatest change in a Eastern coastal area, he said with pride that this signal success once again eloquently proves before the whole world that Korea can do anything when it is determined. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the party's decision to make Tanchon Port resound with ships' whistle in 2012, the centenary of birth of the President, he said, setting forth the important tasks to be carried out to wind up the construction of the port earlier than scheduled.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Kwak Pom Gi, chief secretary of the South Hamgyong Provincial Committee of the WPK, Kim Ki Nam and Hong Sok Hyong, members of the Political Bureau and secretaries of the C.C., the WPK, Kim Kyong Hui, member of the Political Bureau and department director of the C.C., the WPK, Jang Song Thaek, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the C.C., the WPK and vice-chairman of the NDC, Pak To Chun and Thae Jong Su, alternate members of the Political Bureau and secretaries of the C.C., the WPK, and Hyon Chol Hae and Ri Myong Su, department directors of the NDC."

            "content": "ATCC culpa a EE.UU. de proliferacion nuclear\r\nPyongyang, 2 de diciembre (ATCC) -- En estos tiempos, centra la atencion de la sociedad internacional un articulo del periodico singapurense Straits Times que confirma la posesion de armas nucleares por Israel.\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun el rotativo, durante las conservaciones con la premier israeli Golda Meir sostenidas en 1969, el entonces presidente norteamericano Nixon concerto un convenio secreto, en el cual EE.UU. se comprometio a admitir la capacidad nuclear de Israel y dejar de presionarlo para que firmara el Tratado de No Proliferacion a condicion de que ese ultimo no publique arbitrariamente su capacidad nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos sucesivos mandatarios norteamericanos, inclusive la actual administracion Obama, observan estrictamente ese convenio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por su parte, Israel practica desde entonces la politica NCND (no confirmar ni negar) en el tema de sus armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Este articulo es una prueba que demuestra claramente la situacion de desarrollo de armas nucleares por Israel y lo injusto de la pauta de doble rasero de EE.UU. en el problema nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La teoria de posesion de armas nucleares del pais hebreo deviene desde hace mucho tiempo una de las importantes polemicas de la sociedad internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Israel comenzo a impulsar secretamente su programa nuclear ya a finales de la decada de 1940 e intento obtener la tecnica de fabricacion de armas nucleares. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En el periodo de la tercera Guerra del Medio Oriente, tenia 15 ojivas nucleares y esta cifra se incremento a 200 en la decada de 1980.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, estan en posesion de Israel centenares de toneladas de sustancias para fabricar las armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Asi Israel se ha convertido en el sexto portador mas grande de armas nucleares del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El armamentismo nuclear de Israel conto con el activo apoyo tecnico y material y el amparo tacito de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Segun su decision de \"ayudar\" el desarrollo nuclear de Israel, el imperio envio a sus fisicos nucleares y el uranio altamente enriquecido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ademas, amparo tacitamente a Israel cuando la posesion y la proliferacion de armas nucleares de este pais producian un gran revuelo en todo el mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Sucedio lo mismo cuando el periodico  britanico Guardian revelo este ano que en la decada de 1970 hubo conversaciones secretas entre los gobiernos israeli y sudafricano sobre el trafico de armas nucleares. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara colmo, la jefa de la diplomacia norteamericana elogio a Israel diciendo que este pais \"puede hacer muchas cosas\" para impedir la adquisicion de sustancias nucleares por parte de los terroristas, la cual causa mayor preocupacion del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstimulado por el apoyo de EE.UU., Israel insiste en que la sociedad internacional no tiene derecho a presionarlo en el tema nuclear y se atrevio a acusar a algunos paises diciendo que \"estos amenazan su existencia\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstos datos demuestran claramente que EE.UU. es complice y colaborador en el armamentismo nuclear de Israel. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi bien hace vista gorda, defiende y hasta colabora con los \"paises aliados\" y satelites, el imperio cuestiona las actividades nucleares con fines pacificos de los paises, que no le agradan, describiendolos como \"criminales nucleares\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta actitud de doble cara se manifiesta coherentemente en los casos de la RPDC e Iran.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor otra parte, el imperio norteamericano acelera la modernizacion de sus armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHace poco, EE.UU. realizo la prueba nuclear subcritica bajo el pretexto de \"asegurar la estabilidad de su arsenal nuclear\" y pretende desembolsar 4 mil millones de US $ para la modernizacion de instalaciones nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe esta manera, la administracion Obama, que preconiza el \"mundo sin armas nucleares\", expuso su siniestra intencion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl proyecto del \"mundo desnuclearizado\" de EE.UU. no pasa de ser una cortina de humos para ocultar su ambicion de dominar el mundo con armas nucleares y enganar a la humanidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl perseguir de continuo su ambicion nuclear, ese portador de armas nucleares no. 1 del mundo y criminal de guerra nuclear comete otro peor crimen contra la humanidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNadie tiene derecho a actuar arbitrariamente en el tema nuclear ni aplicar la pauta de doble rasero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRecae enteramente sobre EE.UU la responsabilidad del crecimiento a escala mundial de la amenaza nuclear y peligro de proliferacion nuclear."
