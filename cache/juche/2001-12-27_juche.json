This is an unpardonable smear campaign against the dignified DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is compelled to maintain the highest degree of vigilance against a series of plots hatched by the Japanese authorities to escalate their anti-DPRK campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will take relevant countermeasures depending on the future attitude of Japan toward the incident.    \r\n\r\n"
