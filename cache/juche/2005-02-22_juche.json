The north and the south of Korea solemnly pledged to pool their efforts in defending the dignity and interests of the nation and achieving peace and reunification of the country in the historic June 15 joint declaration. All the Koreans in the north and the south of Korea and abroad should closely unite in one body on the principle of thinking the nation's destiny first and giving priority to national reunification, the common interests of the nation, and thus consolidate the might of the internal force of the nation in every way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Independence is a noble and mighty idea rooted in national pride and self-esteem. The Korean nation is a homogenous nation with a long history spanning 5,000 years and a nation pronounced in national character, which values and carries forward its dignity and soul. The great Songun politics adds to the national pride and self-esteem of every Korean as it reliably defends the dignity and sovereignty of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans should wage a dynamic struggle to achieve peace and reunification of this land with high national pride and self-esteem and pluck no matter how persistently and desperately the outsiders may resort to interference, obstructions and moves to provoke a war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north, the south and overseas should closely unite under the banner of independence and turn out as one man in the patriotic noble struggle to defend peace on the Korean Peninsula and accomplish the historic cause of national reunification as early as possible.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
