This assertion represents the wrong stance of the U.S. conservative hard-liners displeased with the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At a time when international public attention is focused on the resumption of the six-party talks for the settlement of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. the U.S. conservative hard-liners only wish to see the talks collapse and the situation deteriorate.  As far as the delay made in the implementation of the points agreed upon at the talks is concerned, the U.S. is chiefly to blame for this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. conservative hard-liners are talking about \"benefits\" and \"delay\" though they do not know properly what is now under discussion at the talks. This is nothing but a jargon that can be let loose only by those who seek to shift all blames onto the DPRK in a bid to bring back the situation to the period before the start of the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is naive for them to calculate they can settle the issue by way of pressure. And it is a daydream for them to try to get something by browbeating the DPRK through the international cooperation in pressurizing it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. moves to increase the pressure upon the DPRK by pursuing a hard-line policy of pressure instead of seeking a negotiated settlement of the issue will only result in derailing the process for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Should the U.S. conservative hard-liners push the situation on the peninsula and the DPRK-U.S. relations to the worst phase, doggedly opposed to the negotiated solution of the issue, the U.S. will be held wholly responsible for the ensuing catastrophic consequences, warns the commentary.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Since the liberation of Korea on August 15, 1945, Japan has pursued a hostile policy towards the DPRK for over six decades. The Japanese reactionaries are a gang of heinous criminals who are utterly indifferent to elementary human ethics and morality and international law as they have committed endless crimes for over a century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The moves of this criminal group to step up their hostile policy towards the DPRK would only leave Japan further isolated at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans in the north and the south and overseas are now renewing their determination to take a thorough stock of the crimes committed against the Korean nation for more than a century and certainly force Japan to pay a high price for them.\r\n Criminals are bound to be punished.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

In the meantime, it seeks to increase the capability for fighting a war in the field of cyber so as to cope with a modern warfare. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is clearly evidenced by the establishment of a \"cyber command\" projected by the U.S. Air Force. The U.S. asserts that the establishment of the above-said command is aimed to protect its computer network from enemy's cyber attack, develop new mode of combat depending on the progress of technology and thus acquire capabilities to cope with a modern electronic warfare. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This indicates that the U.S. is scheming to step up the modernization of its aggression forces to cope with the cyber warfare in a bid to hold military hegemony based on technological edge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said moves are very dangerous as they may spark off a global arms race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had better drop its wild design to dominate the world by force, pondering over the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by its reckless military build-up.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
