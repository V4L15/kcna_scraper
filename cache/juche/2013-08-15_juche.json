The liberation of Korea on Aug. 15, 1945, an exciting event, was achieved thanks to the anti-Japanese fighters for independence who fought against the Japanese imperialists' brutal suppression with arms at the cost of their lives and the united efforts of all Koreans who turned out under the banner of anti-Japanese struggle. But it was not complete liberation of our nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was because there continued national division due to outside forces' interference. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Korea is still suffering from national division caused by the aggressor outside forces though 68 years have passed since then. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is because of the U.S. and Japan which brought the Korean nation distress and misfortune through the conclusion of the brigandish and secret \"Katsura-Taft Treaty\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is nearly seven decades since then but Japan is openly revealing its attempt to grab Tok Islets, part of the inalienable territory of Korea. It is suppressing Koreans in Japan, the descendants of those who were forcibly drafted to Japan, working hard to close national schools. Japan is busy perpetrating intolerable provocations to the Koreans and pressing ahead with moves for reinvasion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and Japan which imposed misfortunes and sufferings upon our nation should honestly apologize and reflect on them and make due reparation to our nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All Koreans in the north, south and abroad will continue to launch dynamic nationwide struggle to force the U.S. and Japan to make an apology and a thousand-fold reparation for the above-said wrongs done to the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We 70 million Koreans, the descendants of King Tangun, will pool our efforts in the spirit of independence and great national unity to stage a vigorous struggle for implementing the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration and once again demonstrate before the whole world the will to achieve independent national reunification, recollecting the genuine meaning of Aug. 15, the day of Korea's liberation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We are confident that the nation will greet a new future when the Koreans unite under the banner of \"by our nation itself\" irrespective of ideology and ism as one nation that created a proud history spanning 5 000 years. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The north and the south of Korea issued a joint appeal today, making August 15 an occasion of hardening the will for independent reunification, peace and prosperity common to the nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t August 15 will be a day of holding higher the banner of independent national reunification in the days ahead.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Let us make August 15 an occasion of flinging open the gate of national reunification!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Long live national reunification!"

Pero, esta no fue la liberacion total de nuestra nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs que la intervencion de las fuerzas extranjeras trajo la division nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl sufrimiento a causa de division nacional perdura hasta hoy a los 68 anos desde la liberacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. y Japon han sido culpables de eso desde que inventaron el tratado \"Taft-Katsura\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, aunque transcurrieron casi 70 anos, Japon expone abiertamente el intento de usurpar el islote Tok, nuestra sagrada tierra patria, y reprime a los coreanos residentes en ese pais isla, descendientes de los coreanos reclutados por la fuerza para los trabajos de esclavitud, y cierra las escuelas nacionales coreanas y se dedica a las provocaciones intolerables contra la nacion coreana y las maniobras de reagresion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. y Japon deben pedir disculpas y reflexionar bien e indemnizar debidamente a la nacion coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los coreanos en el Norte, el Sur y en Ultramar deben continuar la lucha gigantesca por hacer a EE.UU. y Japon pedir disculpas e indemnizar mil veces mas caro.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos 70 millones de coreanos, descendientes del Rey Tangun, deben unir todas las fuerzas mostrando el espiritu independiente y el de gran unidad nacional y desplegar una energica lucha por ejecutar la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio y la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre. Asi quieren volver a sentir el verdadero significado del 15 de agosto, dia de la liberacion de la patria, y exponer a todo el mundo la voluntad de la independencia y la reunificacion nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstamos convencidos de que se abrira un nuevo horizonte prometedor para nuestra nacion cuando esta se una bajo la bandera \"Entre nosotros, los connacionales\" superando el antagonismo de ideas e ideales, como la nacion homogenea que creo su orgullosa historia de 5 mil anos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy, 15 de agosto, se hizo el dia en que el Norte y el Sur redoblaron la voluntad de la reunificacion independiente, la paz y la prosperidad al publicar el llamamiento conjunto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el futuro, el 15 de agosto sera el dia en que enarbola en mas alto la bandera de la reunificacion independiente de la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el futuro, el 15 de agosto sera el dia en que levantaremos mas alto la bandera de reunificacion independiente de la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t!Hagamos el 15 de agosto que abra las puertas de la reunificacion!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t!Viva la reunificacion de la patria!"
