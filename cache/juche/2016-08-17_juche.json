At the \"2016 Asia security meeting\" in June last and on several other occasions the group agreed in secrecy with Japan to expand to a large extent military \"exchange\" and \"cooperation\" including the conclusion of \"the agreement on protecting military information\", reinforced laying of hotline between defence authorities, visits to military drills and mutual visits of airplanes and warships.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accordingly, the puppet group allows Japan \"Self-Defense Forces\" enter south Korean ports while fluttering the \"flag of rising sun shedding rays,\" denounced as a \"symbol of Japanese imperialism\" and the \"flag of a war criminal state\", and even holds joint military drills with Japan under the pretext of countering the \"north's nuclear and missile threats\". It even resumed the puppet naval drilling flotilla's entry into Japanese port which had been suspended for five years in the face of strong protest at home and abroad and is revealing its attempt to hand over to Japan \"information concerning north's missiles\" with the deployment of THAAD in south Korea as an occasion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Still remaining un-vented in the minds of the Koreans are wrath and grudge against the Japanese imperialist aggressors who drenched 3 000-ri land with blood shed by Koreans through barbarous manslaughter they committed after putting Korea under their control for nearly half a century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, in July the puppet group allowed the Japanese reactionaries to openly hold an event for marking the foundation anniversary of \"Self-Defense Forces\", the descendants of the Japanese imperialist aggressor forces, in downtown Seoul, and senseless guys of the puppet authorities took part in it. This servile act is an intolerable insult and mockery of all the fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group's military nexus with Japan is an intolerable act of sycophancy and treachery and a heinous anti-national crime aimed to pave the way for staging a comeback to the Korean peninsula to the Japanese who imposed the long-pent up grudge on the Korean nation and inflict the disaster of war on this land again.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is clear that the military nexus and conspiracy between the Park group and the Japanese reactionaries being pushed forward at the instigation of the U.S. will lead to triangular military alliance with the U.S. and Japan in the end and thus bring the crisis of war to the Korean peninsula and seriously threaten peace and security in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group's military nexus with the Japanese reactionaries aimed to dare stand against the DPRK is a suicidal act of digging up its own grave.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the Koreans have to turn out in the nationwide struggle to throw overboard the Park group of traitors, trouble-maker of the nation, as soon as possible, foil the Japanese reactionaries' moves for reinvasion and defend the peace and security of the Korean peninsula."

This cannot but upset the regional strategic balance and spark off a new Cold War as it is part of the moves for building the U.S. missile shield and establishing the U.S.-Japan-south Korea triangular military alliance in a bid to contain major big powers in the Asia-Pacific region, they charged, adding China and Russia will never remain a passive onlooker to this for the sake of their security.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Wednesday in a commentary says these comments are based on the objective facts about the U.S. pivot to the Asia-Pacific strategy and the U.S. forces' military moves in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is claiming that THAAD deployment in south Korea will have no impact on the strategic security of China and Russia but it is no more than a clumsy wordplay, the commentary notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t THAAD deployment in south Korea is a product of the U.S. military strategy to disable the strategic nuclear force of China and Russia and hold hegemony in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation in the Asia-Pacific region is reaching an extreme phase and the world peace is seriously threatened.

Paektu and strengthened the revolutionary ranks on the basis of them and led the cause of national liberation to victory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hard-fought anti-Japanese war for Korea's liberation ended with victory thanks to the talented military wisdom of the great general Kim Il Sung and absolute trust of the members of the KPRA and the Korean people in him and their ardent patriotism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Russian website Amur Pres posted an article titled \"Korea's liberation, turning point of history\" on Aug. 11, saying that Korea's liberation did not mean only the national resurrection for the Korean people but the historic event that brought about the crucial turn in their destiny from slave to master."

            "content": "Portavoz del CNCDP critica cooperacion militar Sur de Corea-Japon\r\nPyongyang, 17 de agosto (ACNC) -- El portavoz del Comite Nacional Coreano por la Defensa de la Paz (CNCDP) hizo publica hoy una declaracion en relacion con que se hace cada dia mas abierta la confabulacion militar entre la banda de Park Geun-hye y los reaccionarios japoneses.\n\t\t\t\t\tEl documento sigue abajo:\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo el pretexto de discutir con los reaccionarios japoneses el denominado proyecto de \"promocion de intercambio militar y amistad\", los titeres surcoreanos invitan a menudo desde el ano pasado al Sur de Corea al ministro de Defensa y los cabecillas de las \"Fuerzas de Autodefensa\" de Japon. Y en varias oportunidades como la \"reunion de seguridad de Asia de 2016\", celebrada en junio pasado, acordaron en secreto con el pais isla ampliar el \"intercambio\" y la \"cooperacion\" en el plano militar, tales como la firma del convenio de proteccion de informaciones militares, la instalacion adicional de linea telefonica directa entre autoridades de defensa nacional, la observacion de ejercicios militares, la visita reciproca de los aviones y buques de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor consiguiente, la banda titere surcoreana permite que los buques de guerra de las \"Fuerzas de Autodefensa\" de Japon entren en los puertos surcoreanos flameando la \"bandera del sol saliente esparciendo rayos\", condenada como \"simbolo del imperialismo japones\" y \"bandera criminal de guerra\", y libra sin escrupulos hasta los ejercicios militares conjuntos con Japon bajo el pretexto de hacer frente a la \"amenaza nuclear y de misil del Norte (de Corea)\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, reanudo la entrada en el puerto de Japon de la flotilla de entrenamiento de las fuerzas navales surcoreanas, que habia sido suspendida durante 5 anos pasados por las fuertes criticas internas y externas, y expone la intencion de entregar a Japon las \"informaciones referentes al misil norcoreano\" con motivo de la ubicacion de THAAD en el Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHasta ahora, la nacion coreana guarda el rencor de los agresores japoneses que ocuparon el territorio coreano durante casi medio siglo y lo convirtieron en un bano de sangre con asesinatos salvajes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, las autoridades surcoreanas permitieron a los reaccionarios japoneses celebrar publicamente en julio en la parte centrica de Seul el acto conmemorativo de la fundacion de las \"Fuerzas de Autodefensa\", sucesoras del ejercito agresor japones, en el cual tomaron parte algunas de aquellas. Este comportamiento humillante constituye un insulto y burla intolerables para todos los coreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa conducta de la camarilla de Park Geun-hye, que se apela a la confabulacion militar con Japon, es imperdonable acto vendepatria y antinacional encaminado a abrirle a Japon, que dejo heridas nunca reparables a la nacion coreana, el camino de reagresion a la Peninsula Coreana y buscar otra vez los desastres de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa cooperacion militar Sur de Corea-Japon, que se realiza bajo la instigacion de EE.UU., facilitara formar la alianza militar tripartita EE.UU.-Japon-Surcorea. Resulta evidente que esto traera la crisis de guerra a la Peninsula Coreana y amenazara seriamente la paz y seguridad del Nordeste Asiatico y el resto del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos compinches de Park Geun-hye intentan estrechar la cooperacion militar con los reaccionarios japoneses para enfrentarse atrevidamente con la RPDC, lo cual es un acto suicida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los coreanos deberan levantarse unanimemente en la lucha pannacional por eliminar cuanto antes a la banda traidora de Park Geun-hye, fuente de desastres de la nacion, frustrar las tentativas de reagresion de los reaccionarios japoneses y defender la paz y seguridad de la Peninsula Coreana."
