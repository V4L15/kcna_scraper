            "content": "Prospect of Working Contact and KIZ Entirely Depends on Future Attitude of South Side\r\n Pyongyang, July 10 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the General Bureau for Central Guidance to the Development of the Special Zone issued a statement on Friday in connection with the fact that the working contact on the Kaesong Industrial Zone (KIZ) has been pushed to the phase of breakdown due to the insincere attitude on the part of the south Korean authorities.\n\t\t\t\t\t The south side, displeased with the working contact from its very beginning, reluctantly responded to the contact and brought to light its confrontational nature at the fourth contact, the statement noted, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south side not only totally denied the discussion on the main agenda item, raising a spate of issues irrelevant to the revision of the contracts on the KIZ, the main subject of the contact, but far-fetchedly asserted it could not accept the just request of the north side, oft-repeating extremely wrong assertions and unreasonable sophism.  The south side's rude and insincere attitude is an intolerable mockery and challenge to the sincere efforts of the north side and, at the same time, a deliberate and premeditated provocation intended to drive the working contact to breakdown and torpedo the business in the KIZ. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The inter-Korean relations have been driven into catastrophe and the military tension has reached an extreme phase but the north side made every possible effort to prevent the KIZ from being badly affected by the situation. The north side advanced constructive proposals on reexamining and renegotiating the measures for special treatment taken to suit the changed situation and present reality and arranged a special working contact even under the situation where the relations between the authorities of both sides were totally suspended. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the south side behaved quite contrary to the gesture of the north side, defying its sincere efforts. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This clearly proves that the south Korean authorities do not have even an iota of intention to solve the issue of the KIZ but is only keen to lay the blame for the deplorable situation at the door of the north side and put the zone under collapse. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The north side felt disillusioned with the south side from the very beginning of the contact with the south side and was compelled to seriously reconsider the issue of whether it would continue the contact with such ungrateful and impolite counterpart or not. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Although the south side is touting the so-called \"three principles\", they are nothing but hypocrisy. The south side totally negated the historic June 15 joint declaration, asserting  the \"observance of the existing agreement,\" raised issues irrelevant to the working contact, talking about \"politics-business separation\" and working hard to bring the KIZ under collapse, advocating \"increased competitiveness and future-oriented.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that the south Korean authorities are challenging the DPRK, defiling the latter's magnanimity and sincerity, it cannot but express apprehensions as to whether it is possible to seek a negotiated settlement of the issue through the working contact on the KIZ or not.    In case the south side fails to honestly approach the working contact, the north side will go according to its decision as it has already clarified. The prospect of the working contact on the KIZ and the zone will entirely depend on the future attitude of the south side."

This comes under fire by information bulletin No. 952 issued by the Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea on July 9. \n\t\t\t\t\t In this draft amendment the warmongers of the south Korean puppet military made public a scenario for staging \"civil operation\" by mobilizing the puppet reserve forces independent of the regular troops participating in the combat operation, talking about \"occupation\" of someone's territory in case a war breaks out on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to this, the puppets blustered that they would reorganize 10 divisions into units for \"civil operation\" out of the \"Homeland Defence Reserve Forces\" from 2010 to 2011, conduct regular education every year with main emphasis on an actual war in a bid to hurl them into operation any time and sharply reinforce military equipment in the units including armored cars in an effort to boost the maneuverability in case of \"emergency.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The information bulletin termed this as a serious provocation to the DPRK, a total negation of the dignified Korean-style socialist system centered on the popular masses and an unpardonable challenge to the unanimous aspiration and desire of the Koreans to achieve the peaceful reunification of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  It is the consistent stand of the DPRK to achieve the country's reunification independently and peacefully in conformity with the will and interests of all Koreans, the information bulletin stressed, declaring that it is the mettle of the DPRK not to allow the aggressors and provokers to disturb peace and obstruct reunification even a bit. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said warmongers' moves to work out the \"civil operation\" plan are nothing but foolish, poor and ridiculous ones which only betray their utter ignorance of the DPRK, the information bulletin noted."

This shows in what serious ruling crisis traitor Lee finds itself at present. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The fascist repressive campaign kicked off by Lee to eliminate the progressive pro-reunification forces is expected to last even after the first half of July when the \"100-day plan for investigation\" is set to end. This is based on his calculation that only by doing so can he prolong his dirty remaining days through sycophancy toward the U.S. and confrontation with fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group is the real \"violator of security\" in south Korea because it is keen on suppressing the progressive pro-reunification forces under the pretext of confrontation with fellow countrymen in the north. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group's moves to stifle progressive pro-reunification forces are as foolish an act as strangling its' neck with its' own hands. Lee is following in the footsteps of Syngman Rhee, Park Chung Hee, Chun Doo Hwan, Roh Tae Woo and Kim Young Sam who met miserable ends."
