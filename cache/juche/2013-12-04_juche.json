Korean Military's Provocative Burlesque against DPRK under Fire\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, December 4 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea Wednesday gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA as regards the south Korean military authorities' unpardonable provocative burlesque hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK:\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently, the puppet military group staged such provocative farce as letting the soldiers who completed a recruit training course chant an unspeakable slogan hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK at a graduation ceremony of the recruit training unit of the 17th division of the south Korean army even with their parents attending.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was reported that the puppet soldiers were forced to shout such slogans at ordinary times, to say nothing of the time before their meals or while they were on the move.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is thrice-cursed crime as it is another hideous provocation to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  It is well known that the puppet military group displayed slogans hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK at the barracks, posts and military facilities in the past and fired bullets and shells at the targets symbolic of the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK, kicking up confrontation hysteria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This touched off surging indignation among the service personnel and people of the DPRK and hardened their resolution to wipe out the enemy. Accordingly, this was bitterly censured by the public at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the puppet group has persisted in such provocative farces overtly and covertly, without repenting of its reckless acts even a bit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent hideous crime is part of those provocations, a clear indication that the puppet group is despicable confrontation maniacs. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park Geun Hye group set up even the \"Mental Training School for National Defense\" modeled on the \"Mental Training School of the ROK\" dating back to the period of \"yusin\" dictatorship. It is busy infusing bitterness toward compatriots and war fever into the puppet soldiers. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not content with kicking up a racket for \"eliminating the forces following the north,\" the group is desperately perpetrating such hideous provocation as hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK. This cannot be construed otherwise than a last-ditch effort to calm down the south Korean public infuriated by the fraudulent election, fascist dictatorship and the revival of \"yusin\", prevent the puppet soldiers from vacillating, tide over the crisis and justify its confrontation and war moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is ridiculous, indeed, for the Park Geun Hye group to talk about \"confidence-building\" and \"summit talks\" while daring hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK, the life and soul of its service personnel and people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Does the group have the face to call for \"stop to speaking ill of the head of state\"?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the DPRK has already served warnings, it will never pardon those who hurt the dignity of its supreme leadership but mercilessly punish them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group had better behave itself, clearly understanding what dear price it will have to pay for having hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK."

More than 280 000 U.S. troops are deployed there, the biggest military presence in the world. It is quite clear that they are the main factor of extremely escalating the tension in the region including the Korean Peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's deterrence for self-defense serves as a treasured sword to protect the sovereignty of the country and security of the people from the U.S. moves to militarily stifle the DPRK and its ambition for world domination. It threatens nobody unless its sovereignty and security are infringed upon. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has already declared this several times and it is firmly preserving the principle at present. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the U.S. is desperately floating the fiction about \"threat from north Korea\". This is nothing but a crafty ploy to cover up its true colors as the arch criminal rendering the regional situation unstable and create an environment favorable for carrying out its pivot to Asia-Pacific strategy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. arms buildup is part of its pivot to Asia-Pacific policy to establish its domination and control over the region by dint of its military and nuclear supremacy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is pushing forward the massive deployment of the armed forces, prompted by its scenario to contain the \"dangerous forces\" challenging it in the region and maintain and strengthen its military supremacy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. arms buildup is sparking off strong caution among China, Russia and other regional countries as it is the root cause of a new Cold War. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is the very arch criminal threatening the regional peace and stability. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. would be well advised to stop such arms buildup."
