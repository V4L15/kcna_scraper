            "content": "U.S. Urged to Fulfill Its Commitments before Calling for Resumption of Six-Party Talks \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 3 (KCNA) -- The United States is chiefly to blame for having blocked the resumption of the six-party talks. The U.S. would be well advised to fulfill its commitments before asking someone to come out for the talks. This would be a practical measure for the resumption of the talks.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says this in a signed commentary. It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. only insists that the DPRK should come out for the talks as early as possible. This is, however, nothing but sophism intended to escape the daily increasing criticism and condemnation of the international community and defy its just demand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. sanctions and pressure prevented the DPRK from going to the talks and the former has made dastardly efforts to shift the responsibility for this on to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is escalating its pressure upon the DPRK, floating the misinformation that the September 19 joint statement stipulates only the commitments to be honored by the DPRK. The U.S. wanton violation and distortion of the joint statement have further strained the hostile relations between the DPRK and the U.S., far from opening the bilateral ties of confidence, and rendered the prospect of the talks gloomy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should, first of all, lift its sanctions against the DPRK, the main factor of scuttling the talks, before talking about the resumption of the talks. The prospect of the resumption of the talks entirely depends on the U.S. behavior.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Its hooligans are kicking up a row, blustering that the \"bill\" is aimed at \"anti-U.S., pro-north education\". They have gone the lengths of asserting that it is a \"bill for socialist reds\" to make private schools \"groups for a revolutionary struggle\" by infiltrating \"pro-north leftist forces\" there.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today observes in a signed commentary in this regard: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such rackets are, in essence, an unprecedentedly heinous reactionary offensive, anti-north moves to link any movement for progress and reform in south Korea with the north in a bid to block it and stamp out the pro-reunification patriotic forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"bill\" calls for replacing some directors of foundations of private schools by \"open-hearted directors\" to ensure the transparency of private schools which account for the majority of south Korean schools and combat corruption of their foundations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Public circles of south Korea are unanimously supporting the \"bill\", terming it a reform-oriented \"bill\" to adjust the educational field which has turned its face away from the need of the times, obsessed by irregularities and conservatism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that unless the frantic anti-north racket kicked up by the GNP while challenging the aspiration of the south Korean people for progress and reform is completely stopped, it will spoil the fruits born by the June 15 era and a large number of people will again fall victim to the GNP's \"witch-hunt\" of modern type and meet the same miserable end as those related to the \"case of the People's Revolutionary Party\" and the \"case of the National Democratic Youths and Students League\" did.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But what merits concern is that his remarks vividly reflect the U.S. hostile policy toward the north as the U.S. Department of State claimed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Feeling fearful of the desire to achieve reunification through an alliance with the north growing stronger in the south, the U.S. instructed its ambassador to make desperate efforts to build up public opinion hostile to the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unreasonable financial sanctions, etc. imposed by the U.S. upon the north recently clearly indicate what is the U.S. real intention.\r\n The U.S. should recall its ambassador and withdraw its forces from south Korea at once.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is patriotism for the Korean nation, which has undergone the tragedy of division, to dedicate itself to a worthy struggle for peace and reunification and prosperity of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also an important aspect of patriotism to courageously struggle against foreign aggression and domination and protect the peace of the country and the security of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The patriotic will of the fellow countrymen in essence represents noble thought and sentiment desirous of independence against foreign forces. It is patriotism and reunification for the fellow countrymen to turn out as one to put an end to foreign domination and interference and protect sovereignty and dignity and, at the same time, stage joint actions to frustrate the moves of foreign forces for aggression and war and defend peace and work hard to achieve positive solidarity and alliance irrespective of ideology and ideal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is now making desperate efforts to ignite a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fellow countrymen should, therefore, display their patriotism to the full in frustrating the U.S. imperialists' moves for a war against the DPRK and firmly defending the country, their cradle. They should pool their efforts to deal telling blows at the U.S. bent on the arrogant moves to start a war of aggression against the DPRK and drive its aggressor forces out of south Korea. This is the only way of averting a war on the Korean Peninsula, defending peace and achieving its independent reunification, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
