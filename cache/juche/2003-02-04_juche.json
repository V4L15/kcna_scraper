            "content": "U.S. hit for false information \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 3 (KCNA) -- U.S. Under Secretary of State John Bolton in a press interview during his recent tour of Japan claimed that the DPRK put into operation nuclear facilities to develop nuclear arms and not to generate electricity. He also asked why the DPRK withdrew from the NPT, adding that North Korea has worked in secrecy to become a nuclear weapon state for the last five years.\r\n His remarks are designed to realize international cooperation to isolate and stifle the DPRK under the pretext of \"worldwide threat\" from the DPRK's nuclear weapons development, says Rodong Sinmun today.\r\n The news analyst says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was owing to the efforts of the U.S. and the IAEA to isolate and stifle the DPRK that the DPRK made an important decision to withdraw from the NPT. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The  DPRK's withdrawal from the NPT has nothing to do with the U.S. loudmouthed nuclear weapons development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., the biggest possessor of nuclear weapons in the world, is keen on the development of nuclear weapons of new type. It is the height of impudence for the U.S. to describe the DPRK's nuclear activities for peaceful purposes as the development of nuclear arms and talk about \"worldwide threat.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any international campaign to isolate and stifle the DPRK can not change the just stand of the DPRK at all and the U.S. will never flee from the responsibility for the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. The U.S. should realize this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As long as the U.S. resorts to a cynical ploy, turning back on the DPRK's demand for direct and equal negotiations and conclusion of a non-aggression treaty, the nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula can not be settled any time. It will only deteriorate the crisis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should not work to realize a pie-in-the-sky dream, but have a correct understanding of the essence of the issue and the truth behind the present crisis and accede to the DPRK's demand. \r\n\r\n"
