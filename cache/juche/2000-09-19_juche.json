Japan always says it hopes the relaxation of tension and peace on the Korean peninsula. It is a sheer lie and a camouflage to cover up its attempt to reinvade Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries' move to deploy F-2 support fighters focussing on the Korean peninsula is a danger signal of reinvasion. The Japanese militarists' reinvasion of Korea is a matter of time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But, we are not afraid of it. We are fully ready to counter any attack. \r\n\r\n"
