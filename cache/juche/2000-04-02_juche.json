The invented \"case of mysterious ship\" was intended to remove this obstacle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThrough the \"case\" Japan sought to provide the \"SDF\" with a legal pretext to participate in such attack operation and further increase its capacity of maritime operation and thus round off preparations for overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"chasing\" drill proves that Japan's scenario of reinvasion of Korea has been put into more concrete shape and has entered the phase of practice. If Japan stages comeback to Korea under this pretext, it will lead it to self-destruction. \r\n\r\n"

But the U.S. dares not attack the DPRK, though it has worked hard to conquer the latter by force of arms for over half a century. This is because the DPRK has invariably pursued the policy of attaching great  importance to the military and national defence as the most important affair of the state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The peace, security and sovereignty of the country and the nation are defended with arms. Only when defence capability is increased with consideration always given to the policy as the most important affair of the state, is it possible to defend the sovereignty of the country and the nation and achieve its peace, security, prosperity and progress. This is an important lesson taught by the history of the 20th century full of ups and downs. \r\n\r\n"
