Consequently, it aborted the hard-won north-south dialogue quite contrary to elementary common sense and etiquette, making the joint events abortive. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present puppet rulers are asserting that they cannot allow joint national events and dialogue should be conducted, taking \"level\" into proper consideration according to an international standard, as they cannot trust anyone with a hue and cry over \"trust\" whenever an opportunity presents itself. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts go to clearly prove that the \"confidence-building process\" touted by the puppet authorities is not a policy aimed to sincerely settle the inter-Korean relations but is nothing but rhetoric to mislead public opinion, and they remain unchanged in their  sinister intention to fan up confrontation and  hostility.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All Koreans are now standing at the crucial crossroads of whether they will pave a wide avenue for the nation by bringing back the June 15 era or they will allow the vicious cycle of confrontation with compatriots and tension repeat itself in the coming five years.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All Koreans will certainly force the puppet group to pay for its treacherous act of aborting the June 15 joint national events."

However, it behaved so rudely as replacing him by a vice-minister of Unification just before the start of talks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not content with it, the puppet forces talked such rubbish as the head of the north's delegation is \"a figure hardly recognizable\" and \"it was contrary to common sense and international standard,\" aborting the talks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This was a rude and immoral provocation unprecedented in the history of the north-south dialogue.
