            "content": "Japan's Forcible Drafting of Koreans and Slave Labor Imposed upon Them Blasted\r\nPyongyang, August 20 (KCNA) -- The Committee on Measures for Compensation to Former Korean \"Comfort Women\" for Japanese Army and Victims of Forcible Drafting on August 20 released a survey report in connection with the recent finding of the Koreans who had been forced to do slave labor after being forcibly taken to the Kobe Shipbuilding Yard of the Japanese Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Co., Ltd (at that time).\n\t\t\t\t\tThe report referred to the above-said crimes committed by the government of Imperial Japan and the shipbuilding yard confirmed on the basis of the testimonies made by the victims and the results of the investigation made into the crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAccording to the report, about 1,550 spots have been confirmed so far to be sites where Koreans were forced to do slave labor at that time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The report went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe number of the Koreans who were forcibly drafted to the coal and ore mines under the above-said company is estimated to be about 60,000. That might reach more than 100,000, when those Koreans who were forced to toil and moil in the fields of heavy industry and other fields are added to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt least 4,000 young and middle-aged Koreans were forcibly taken to the Kobe Shipbuilding Yard in two batches from Phyongan and Kyongsang and other provinces. Just hundreds of persons out of more than 2,000 Koreans who had been taken there from Phyongan Province could be able to return home as the rest met deaths due to unbearable forced labor, various kinds of accidents and air raids by the U.S. force, etc. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPhysical and mental coercive methods were employed by the Japanese imperialists to forcibly draft young and middle-aged Koreans to Japan. They included abduction and allurement and coercion by government and military powers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey forced Koreans to do hard labor and mediaeval slavery for unlimited hours under the worst working conditions after detaining them in places similar to concentration camps. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe imperial Japanese government and its accomplice the big Japanese business bodies were the main culprits of forcible drafting and forced labor, the report noted, and continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis can be explained by the following facts:  At that time the big Japanese businesses and management bodies requested the government to work out and implement the policy for forcibly drafting Koreans. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was these big businesses and management bodies that perpetrated watch, suppression and discrimination against those young and middle-aged Koreans who had been taken to Japan and other parts of Asia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter the defeat of Japan, the above-said big businesses have not paid at all to the victims and the bereaved families of the dead what they failed to do. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey burnt up and concealed evidence and other things proving the forcible drafting and took no measure to settle the issue of the remains of the dead Koreans in different parts of Japan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe crimes related to the forcible drafting of Koreans and forced labor imposed upon them committed by the imperial Japanese government and military in collusion with big business bodies and mass killings of them were hideous human rights abuses in violation of not only international law but the domestic law of Japan. That is why the statute of limitations is not applicable to these crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Japanese government and big businesses should thoroughly probe the truth about the forcible drafting of Koreans and forced labor imposed upon them in the past and open it to the public and make full apology and reparation for them to the victims and the bereaved families of the dead, keenly aware that they can never evade the responsibility for those and other crimes against humanity."
