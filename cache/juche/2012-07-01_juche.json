            "content": "Kim Jong Un Provides Field Guidance to Rungna People's Pleasure Ground and Breast Cancer Institute\r\n Pyongyang, July 1 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, first chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, provided field guidance to the Rungna People's Pleasure Ground nearing its completion and the Breast Cancer Institute of the Pyongyang Maternity Hospital now under construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t The first leg of his guidance was the Rungna Dophinarium.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round various places of the dolphinarium including the ground viewing hall, water tank for performance, the room for the dissemination of science and technology to acquaint himself in detail with its construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the ground viewing hall he saw dolphins which moved their habitat to the dolphinarium from a rough sea. He praised soldier-builders for successfully building the dolphinarium.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underscored the need to set up an electronic display so that spectators may know what numbers dolphins present and names of trainers as the dolphinarium is the stage showing skills of dolphins and ensure stage decor in such a way as to depict the floor of the stage like a beach to match well the waves drawn against the background. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He dropped in at the hall on the first floor and said it looks like an underwater world. He was greatly pleased that it has become possible to invite Pyongyangites to see refreshing seawater in sultry summer time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Looking round the cave-style room for the dissemination of science and technology, he stressed the need to build it in such a way as to help spectators acquire a variety of information about common sense regarding ecology and features of aquatic animals including dolphin, shark and whale and other interesting information.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is necessary to successfully make various decorations to suit the feature of the dolphinarium in a bid to create an atmosphere of its interior, he noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The second leg of his guidance was the construction site of the Rungna Wading Pool.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had walked high stairs and reached the top of the water sliding bed to guide the construction of the wading pool on the spot on April 30 and visited this place again on May 5 to give important instructions for splendidly building it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Soldier-builders of KPA Unit 267 radically reshaped the wading pool in a matter of less than two months in hearty response to the intention of the Supreme Commander. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Feasting his eyes on the water sliding bed standing high, he said visitors would like it very much.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After reaching a 5 meters deep water pool for diving now under construction, he said that when it looks refreshing, it is good for weather in summer and visitors may feel refreshing. Watching the wading pool, he was pleased that all amenities have been provided to fit for the wading pool.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After climbing the roof of the shower room for bathing, he was satisfied with a large area on the roof where basketball, volleyball and sandy volleyball courts will appear. He said with a broad smile on his face that the Rungna Wading Pool is a multi-function wading pool as visitors will be able to have sports games before jumping into water.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed great satisfaction over the best construction, repeatedly praising soldier-builders for their feats. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He called for completing the construction project before the day of the war victory by simultaneously pushing forward the land leveling.  He set forth the tasks and ways to do so.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round the completed Rungna Alpamare, he acquainted himself in detail with the operation of equipment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The last leg of his guidance was the Breast Cancer Institute of the Pyongyang Maternity Hospital.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He made the rounds of the roentgen room, operation room, sick-room and other places of the institute to learn about its construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The institute is an object whose construction was personally initiated by leader Kim Jong Il and to which he paid special attention, personally examining its design, Kim Jong Un noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is important to successfully build the institute but what is more important is  to assign able doctors and researchers rich in clinical experience to the institute and fully furnish it with latest equipment needed for curing mastopathy and breast cancer, he stressed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is necessary to establish a proper healthcare system so as to prevent and detect mastopathy and breast cancer in their early stages, in particular, he noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t While reading documents containing teachings given by Kim Jong Il, he came to know better that Kim Jong Il worked heart and soul to build the institute till the last moments of his life, he noted, adding that this hardened his resolution to build the institute on a world level.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is important, first of all, to make the operation room and all other treatment rooms of the institute sterile and dust-free, he stressed, specifying the issues which should be set right in the construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underscored the need not to be content with the building of the institute. He noted it is the WPK's policy on preventive medicine to let women regularly visit the institute for medical check so that they may not suffer from mastopathy and breast cancer, \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed expectation and conviction that soldier-builders would pay primary attention to the quality of the construction and fully preserve the nature of the institute in the construction and thus successfully build the modern breast cancer institute to be proud of in the world till the anniversary of the WPK foundation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Jang Song Thaek, member of the Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee and vice-chairman of the National Defence Commission, and Pak Chun Hong and Ma Won Chun, vice department directors of the WPK Central Committee."

But that was a very naive idea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whenever my half brother met me, he seemed to fear that contacts with me would bring any harm to him. I had no other choice but to go to the house of my elder cousin by a maternal aunt who was aged 80, and nurse his wife. Words can be easily said than done.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I could not live there any longer due to financial burden. Then I worked as a nurse at an old man's house recommended by my elder cousin. Later on, I nursed an old man aged 90 who could neither move nor visit the bathroom. I did anything such as cleaning metro stations, apartment corridors and elevators, repressing all disgraces and insults. Moreover, I was compelled to live in horror, uneasiness and irritation owing to persistent watch and wiretapping.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t One time I got a job at a company producing industrial raw materials with the help of a woman called Ra Won Ju, only to be swindled by its director. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Engrossed on this, I collapsed on the stairs of the metro unable to balance my body and hurt my knee.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I had been to a police hospital one night in October last year as I felt difficult to breathe. A doctor told me to name my patron as my life was critical. When I said I had no patron, the doctor told me to go back home, adding I could not be hospitalized. I entreated the doctor to put me at rest there even on the hospital corridor as it was difficult to breathe and I would be brought back again though I was sent at midnight.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The doctor rejected me and shouted me to go out of the hospital at once or name my patron. The reason that the doctor was asking to name my patron was aimed to get doctor's fee if I die. This is unimaginable in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is south Korean society which overflows with jobless persons and social evils. Money holds sway and the feelings of human beings cannot be found there. That is a rotten and ailing society which renders the people's mentality and cultural life corrupt."

It rubbed salt into the wound of fellow countrymen who grieved over the demise of the father of the nation and committed hideous crimes in succession, daring hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK. The north-south relations plunged into a complete deadlock and the touch-and-go situation is prevailing on the Korean peninsula due to the Lee group's moves for confrontation with fellow countrymen. It is very natural that south Korean people vowed to shatter the Lee group's moves for destroying the joint declaration, and implement it. The June 15 spirit remains alive in the minds of the south Koreans."
