            "content": "Rodong Sinmun Blasts Recently Disclosed U.S. Nuclear Ambition\r\n Pyongyang, May 24 (KCNA) -- A recent issue of the Japanese Asahi Shimbun opened to the public the fact that the United States pressured Japan to permit and connive at the military actions for its nuclear operations. The U.S. was reported to have pressurized the government led by the Democratic Party of Japan last year not to open to the public the U.S.-Japan secret pacts on nuclear arms signed in 1960 and allow the port calls of the U.S. airplanes and warships carrying nukes. \n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Tuesday observes in a bylined commentary in this regard: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This discloses once again the U.S. criminal scenario to realize its Korean and Asian strategy for aggression and its wild ambition to dominate the world by mounting preemptive nuclear attacks, regarding Japan and south Korea as its nuclear outposts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Huge nuclear offensive means of the U.S. troops in Japan are aimed at carrying out its nuclear war strategy against the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The pressure put by the U.S. upon Japan to allow the former's airplanes and warships to enter it anytime regardless of whether they are carrying nukes or not is part of its military adventure to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the ulterior intention of the U.S. to use Japan as a nuclear offensive base and strategic stronghold in its operations against the DPRK and its neighboring countries. The U.S. seeks to ignite a nuclear war against the DPRK, taking advantage of its nuclear edge in a bid to seize the whole of the Korean Peninsula and, furthermore, put Asia and the rest of the world under its domination and control. The U.S. warmongers are making reckless efforts to carry out its dangerous strategy for a nuclear war, overconfident of its nuclear arsenal, pushing the situation on the peninsula to an extreme phase. This cannot be construed otherwise than a very serious development."
