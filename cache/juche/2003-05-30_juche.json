All the people should rise up in a decisive battle against the U.S. to expel the U.S., retake sovereignty and defend the vital right of the nation and peace in the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The appeal called for taking an active part in a grand people's candle-light March marking the first anniversary of the death of the two schoolgirls on June 13 to hold higher the torch of independence against the U.S. in a bid to punish the U.S. killers and let bush make an open apology to the last. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also called for smashing the U.S. \"nuclear racket\" with the anti-U.S. struggle of all the people, defending the destiny of the nation and peace in the Korean Peninsula and decisively frustrating Bush's reckless moves for a nuclear war against the north by the concerted efforts of the 70 million fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It called for shattering the moves of the South Korean Grand National Party and other pro-U.S. traitors for cooperation with foreign forces and cooperation in war and accelerating the reunification movement under the uplifted banner of the June 15 Joint Declaration.    \r\n\r\n"

It is possible for a nation to defend its right to existence and sovereignty only when it has a military deterrent force strong enough to contain the imperialists' aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to firmly maintain independence in politics it is necessary to increase the political and ideological potentials the core of which is military power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when an army remains strong is it possible to build up its politico-ideological might and economic potential and achieve victory and prosperity in reliance on the revolutionary army despite manifold difficulties in the way of the revolution and construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One needs not to read other's face but can meet other's pressure when one has a strong military force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and the people of the DPRK will surely build a great prosperous socialist power which will demonstrate the might of Songun under the leadership of Kim Jong Il, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It also infiltrated two speedboats and another patrol boat into the north's territorial waters southwest of Yonphyong islets at about 11:15 and at about 12:48 respectively. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On May 27 it infiltrated three warships deep into the territorial waters of the north side east of Tungsangot from about 16:00 to about 18:00.
