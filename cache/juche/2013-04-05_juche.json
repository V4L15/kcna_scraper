It even let F-22s fly into south Korea on March 31. It sent SBX-1 and destroyers with missile interceptor capacity to the waters off the Korean Peninsula. It was also reported that super-large aircraft carrier and its group will be sent to the waters off the peninsula from the U.S. mainland.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a revelation of its foolish moves to frighten the DPRK through the display of so-called \"overwhelming\" military might and, at same time, lead the former to a change. The U.S. is irritated at the proud look of the DPRK reacting to its stifling moves with the toughest measures.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's resolute and merciless measure such as the declaration of its decision on nullifying the Armistice Agreement and its practical military action are shaking to the very foundation the hostile policy toward the DPRK by the U.S. styling itself the world's only superpower.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is by no means fortuitous that even U.S. experts in Korean issue said in case the DPRK fights a war against the U.S., the reaction by forces of the U.S. and south Korea will be very poor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is having hard time making judgment whether to fight a war with the DPRK or not with its economy on the verge of bankruptcy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the reason that the U.S. is bringing lethal weapons to south Korea in succession in a desperate effort to dampen the DPRK's will. It is a foolish act reminding one of a drowning man catching at a straw.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. forces in south Korea and puppet forces seized with fear seem to regard lethal equipment including Stealth weapons as ones that can boost their sinking morale. But we are considering them as tiger moths jumping into the nuclear war of justice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In case our powerful nuclear strike means are fired all at once, the destiny of tiger moths will become clear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is seriously mistaken if it thinks that the DPRK, which has smaller, lighter and diversified latest nuclear strike means, will step back in an all-out action with the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will invariably advance straight along the road of Songun, the road of bolstering nuclear armed force unless the U.S. does abandon its ambition for stifling the DPRK."
