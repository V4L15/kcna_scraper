Korea: rally for measures for unemployed\r\n Pyongyang, May 31 (KCNA) -- A \"people's rally for employment and measures for the unemployed\" took place on Seoul railway station plaza on Saturday, a Seoul-based radio reported.\r\n   The rally was attended by some 4,000 unionists under the (south) Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) and students under the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils.\r\n   The ralliers strongly called for a halt to massive unemployment enforced under the reactionary lay-off system and for renegotiation with the international monetary fund, which inflicts sufferings on the workers and other people.\r\n   The fascist regime posted some 6,000 riot police of 60 companies around the venue of the rally and tried to check the participation of workers and students in the rally.\r\n   Angry workers and students physically clashed with police. \r\n   At the end of the rally, the participants marched on Myongdong Cathedral.\r\n   The puppet authorities laid a strict cordon around the cathedral with 10,000 police to check their struggle, and threatened to walk away and prosecute demonstrators.\r\n   The Chairman of the KCTU warned that in case the authorities prosecute the demonstrators, the second general strike slated for next month will be called earlier than scheduled.    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n"
