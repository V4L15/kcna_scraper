But Korea is firmly defending the socialist banner. This is also attributable to the WPK which advanced the Juche-oriented revolutionary lines and aroused all the people to carry them into effect. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   So, the Korean people are vigorously hastening the second grand Chollima march following the \"arduous march\" and the forced march under the leadership of the invincible WPK. \r\n\r\n"

Those unconverted long-term prisoners should have been sent back to the north according to the international law and the Korean Armistice Agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such being the case, the South Korean rulers are raising a hue and cry over \"human rights abuses\" by the north in a bid to conceal human rights violations in South Korea, disparage the DPRK whose dignity and prestige are growing as days go by and to dampen longings of the South Korean people for the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DFRF central committee strongly condemns the South Korean rulers' projected anti-DPRK campaign through the \"meeting\" as a premeditated provocation to impair the dignity and prestige of the DPRK and as a challenge to the desire of the fellow countrymen for the reconciliation and unity of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean rulers are well advised to immediately stop this anti-DPRK campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If they finally conduct the anti-DPRK campaign at the \"meeting of non-governmental organizations\" despite our warnings, they will be held wholly responsible for all the grave consequences arising therefrom. \r\n\r\n"
