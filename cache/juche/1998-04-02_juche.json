It chooses or ousts President, frames the political structure  and shapes and implements policies. It, a watchdog of the regime, has directed all its efforts to interrupting social progress. It has faked up cases to check predominance of the anti-\"government\" forces and save the dictatorial forces from a crisis.\r\n   It clings to every conceivable means and method from watch, shadowing and tapping to torture and killing to obliterate justice.\r\n   It is the \"ANSP\" that has plunged South Korea into a chronic economic crisis and brought the people's livelihood to failure. The \"ANSP\" appropriates a large amount of money collected from the people to its fabulous \"budget. \r\n   It has also blocked national reconciliation, unity and reunification.\r\n   Holding sway over inter-Korean dialogue, it has cracked down on those who visited the north or met with fellow countrymen from the north abroad as well as even those who talked about reunification, branding them as \"spies,\" \"pro-communist elements benefiting the enemy\" and \"security offenders.\"\r\n   It, not content with groundless abuses of the north's system, has always manipulated the successive dictators attempt to overthrow it, issued \"emergency action guidelines\" to hurt the fellow countrymen in the north when they suffered a misfortune, laid hurdles in the way of humanitarian assistance of the international community, far from expressing sympathy with the countrymen who suffered  from devastating natural disasters.\r\n   The attitude toward the dissolution of the \"ANSP\" is a criterion that distinguishes whether the present regime of South Korea is a \"government for the people\" or a \"government of traitors\" and whether it wants to improve the relations with the north and reunify the country or not.\r\n   Anyone who truly wants  the security of the nation and the reunification of the country  should not hesitate to do something for the dissolution the \"ANSP.\"    \r\n\r\n"
