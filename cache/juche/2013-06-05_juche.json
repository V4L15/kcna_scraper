            "content": "S. Korea's Inhumane Allurement and Abduction of Youngsters of DPRK Denounced\r\n Pyongyang, June 5 (KCNA) -- It was disclosed recently that the south Korean puppet group attempted to tempt and abduct many youngsters of the DPRK to take them to south Korea.  A spokesman for the Central Committee of the DPRK Red Cross Society Wednesday made public a statement denouncing the unprecedented actions against humanity.\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities sent flesh traffic dealers under the guise of religionists to the northern border area of the DPRK to lure and abduct dozens of youngsters of the DPRK and detain them in a secret hide and commit all kinds of evil acts against them, the statement said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These gangsters, who are old hands at inciting confrontation with fellow countrymen and hatching plots, forced the young people to recite bible and sing psalm in a bid to make them believe in God for two or three years, moving their lodgings several times to escape the control of a country concerned. They showed them undesirable films every day in a sinister attempt to hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and its social system and persistently resorted to brainwashing in an effort to create illusion about south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When children refuse to properly receive religious education and brainwashing, these hooligans unhesitatingly beat them with iron-clubs and punished them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nine young people of the DPRK in question are just part of the victims of such abduction and brainwashing; the puppet group failed to carry out their sinister plan as they were checked while illegally taking the children to south Korea via foreign countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet group to prodded flesh traffic dealers into luring and abducting young people of the DPRK by spending a huge amount of money in collaboration with a U.S. body to hatch plots against the DPRK over its \"human rights\". It tried hard to take them to south Korea, the U.S., etc., issuing false passports and providing air tickets to them through its mission in a foreign country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The recent case brought to light the puppet group's true nature of heinous flesh traffic and anti-DPRK human rights abuses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The smear campaign of the puppet group is the last-ditch efforts to tarnish the image of the DPRK in a bid to stem the trend of the rapidly-changing international situation and get rid of its difficult position and tight corner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is also nothing but a cynical ploy to drive a wedge between the DPRK and countries concerned and bring into bolder relief the non-existent \"human rights issue\" in a bid to escalate the anti-DPRK campaign.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As far as the human rights issue is concerned, the puppet group should stand trial as it has turned south Korea into a theatre of fascist rowdyism and graveyard of democracy and human rights and put in custody those pro-reunification figures who visited the DPRK with compatriotic feelings after branding them as criminals.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should be called into question, first of all, as it is the worst human rights abuser as evidenced by the facts that it is lording it over south Korea, committing rape, violence and murder and torturing and persecuting innocent prisoners in Guantanamo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group together with riff-raffs of conspiratorial human rights organizations is getting frantic with the anti-DPRK human rights racket, raising a hue and cry over \"guarantee of living of the forcibly deported school youth and children\" whom it claims had defected from the north and institution of a \"law on human rights in the north. But this only brings to light the group's true colors as anti-reunification confrontation elements.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The human rights of the popular masses including school youth and children are fully guaranteed in the DPRK where the socialist system centred on the popular masses has been fully established and there is a large family thanks to the politics of loving the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the puppet group persists in such anti-DPRK human rights abuses as allurement and abduction of DPRK citizens despite its warnings, the group will have to pay a dear price for them."

And Shintaro Ishihara, who co-heads the same party with Hashimoto, defended him, saying that \"any military is commonly associated with prostitution and that is like a principle of history.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This was barbarism as it insulted not only the women who were forced into disgraceful sexual servitude for the Japanese imperialists in the past but also human conscience.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's attitude toward the sexual slavery is an outstanding issue directly linked with its admission, apology and reparation for all the crimes it committed against mankind in the last century. This is because the sexual slavery was the most corrupt and bestial one among all the crimes committed by the Imperial Japanese Army during the war, a hideous inhuman crime which baffled human imagination.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's denial of the sexual slavery means a denial of its crime-woven past and a challenge to justice and human conscience.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That is why the international community is unanimously expressing indignation, rebuff and condemnation of Japan's attitude to evade the blame for the sexual slavery at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the right-wing forces of Japan have gone the lengths of claiming \"necessity\" and \"truth\", not content with letting loose a spate of reckless remarks on the issue of sexual slavery.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  They are now seeking to evade the liquidation of the past by embellishing the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists against humanity and incite militarism among Japanese in a bid to realize the ambition for \"the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Japan is, indeed, a state which suffered a total ruin in the aspect of morality and a dangerous enemy state which can throw our planet again into misfortune by committing all sorts of crimes against humanity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The moves of the right-wing forces to shun the liquidation of the past lead to a self-destruction as they becloud the prospect of Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Voices denouncing the right-wing politicians for praising the above-said bestial acts as \"acts of hurting the state interests\" continue ringing out even in Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  If they persist in such crimes, far from drawing a lesson in the past, Japan will not be able to escape a ruin."
