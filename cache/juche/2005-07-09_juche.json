While preparing itself for the success of the meeting, it has gone through all the necessary procedures for the entry into the U.S. after receiving a formal notice about the approval of visas from the U.S. Department of State in April.\r\n The U.S. Department of State, however, made a sudden about- face for no reason just a few days before the departure of the delegation. It unilaterally cancelled the visas, a mean and wicked action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such outrage committed by the U.S. administration is a brazen-faced action unprecedented in the history of international relationship. This rash act can be perpetrated only by the group of Satans insulting the several religious organizations in the U.S. which jointly promoted the meeting and other religious organizations of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This high-handed fascist action can be committed only by the bellicose Bush gentries who threw the world into uneasiness and horror with war and genocide, pursuant to their strong-arm policy and hegemony, utterly indifferent to religion, justice and peace and international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The action taken by the administration to frustrate the above-said international meeting indicates that the U.S. is the most brutal suppressor of religion and the world's only outpost of tyranny. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean Council of Religionists brands the U.S. administration, which blocked the free visits and contacts of religionists and scuttled the meeting of the world religious community, as a group of devils disregarding the religious faith and morality and a kingpin suppressing religion and strongly demands an apology for this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality goes to prove that the root cause of a nuclear war can never be removed from the Korean Peninsula unless the U.S. gives up its hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Bush administration ignites a nuclear war at any cost, not pondering over the repeated warnings of the DPRK, this will bring the U.S. to its end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean Council of Religionists, availing itself of this opportunity, expresses expectation that all the people of the world and international religious organizations that advocate love, justice and peace would extend full support and solidarity to the Korean people in their struggle to prevent the Korean Peninsula from the nuclear war and defend peace in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The will of Songun runs through his energetic leadership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the officers and men of the People's Army and people should perform brilliant labor feats in the loyal \"100-day campaign\" in hearty response to the joint slogans of the Central Committee and the Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea and thus powerfully demonstrate once again the noble traits of the revolutionary army and people endlessly glorifying the President's idea and cause.
