This is a conspiratorial plot intended to tide over the serious ruling crisis caused by the total failure of the group's domestic and foreign policies, turn the \"elections to local self-governing bodies\" favorable for it and thus maintain its fascist rule and push the inter-Korean relations into catastrophe. Therefore, it is no more than the last-ditch efforts of those driven to death.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group of traitors is now concocting a despicable scenario over the case of the warship sinking to save itself from the crisis, but it is a foolish attempt.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent case, invented by the puppet group of traitors, has been carried out under the patronage and instigation of the U.S. imperialists from the beginning. This is part of their vicious moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK and a grave challenge to its dignity and sovereignty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will react with rapid retaliatory strike, mercilessly strong physical strike if the puppet group of traitors shows any slightest sign of \"punishment\" and \"retaliation\" in collusion with foreign forces while crying out for \"confrontation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the puppet clique of south Korea finally provokes a war despite our repeated warnings, we will decisively wipe out traitor Lee Myung Bak and his group and build a great prosperous and reunified country for the entire nation in Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will never pardon the U.S. and Japanese aggressors and their followers who attempt to provoke the DPRK, daring slander its supreme dignity, but give a merciless and resolute punishment to the die-hard warmongers challenging justice and truth of mankind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Speeches were made at the meeting by representatives from different walks of life."

Korean Authorities' War Moves\r\n Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- The group of conservatives in south Korea are rushing headlong toward the reckless military confrontation and war against the DPRK while persistently linking the case of the puppet navy's warship sinking with it.\n\t\t\t\t\t The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea Sunday released its information bulletin No. 955 in denunciation of such moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to the bulletin, the puppet military gangsters have staged bombardment and depth-bomb dropping exercises in the waters of the West Sea of Korea from May 27 with mobilization of 10 warships of different types, including destroyers and patrol craft, and antisubmarine patrol planes while crying out for \"military demonstration\" and \"military counteraction\" under the scenario of confrontation worked out by traitor Lee Myung Bak. And they are illegally infiltrating groups of warships into the territorial waters of the DPRK every day to get on the nerves of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of traitors is also planning to stage the largest-scale joint anti-submarine exercises in the waters of the West Sea of Korea by inviting the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces' warships, including the nuclear aircraft carrier belonging to the 7th Fleet, a cruiser and nuclear submarine. And it is examining a plan to conduct with the U.S. forces arge-scale field mobile exercises, equivalent to the \"Team Spirit\" joint military exercises which had been suspended since 1994.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Meanwhile, the group is hell-bent on spying on the military objects of the DPRK by mobilizing U-2 and other strategic and tactical reconnaissance planes of various types after raising the anti-DPRK watch posture to the phase on the eve of war. It is also seeking to resume the anti-DPRK smear psychological warfare in the frontline areas through scattering of leaflets and by means of electronic displays and loudspeakers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group has planned to zealously join in the U.S.-led aggressive \"PSI\" and thus stage the extremely provocative \"intercepting drill\" aimed to put sea blockade against the DPRK and search at random its vessels on voyage in open seas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such confrontation and war moves conducted by the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors in conspiracy with the U.S. are a downright military blackmail and an intolerable challenge to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At present the Korean Peninsula has been driven to the touch-and-go situation, in which a war may break out any moment, due to the case of the warship sinking the group of traitors fabricated to defile the DPRK's dignity and do harm to and stifle the fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is not hard to predict what consequences such military provocations and saber-rattling in the West Sea of Korea will entail since there were several skirmishes between the north and the south due to the south Korean puppet military warmongers' provocation and the recent warship sinking case occurred in those waters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those fond of playing with fire are bound to perish in the flames kindled by themselves. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  It is the iron will and spirit of our army and people to react to \"punishment\" with merciless punishment and to \"retaliation\" with a dreadful annihilating strike.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  If the Lee Myung Bak group persists in reckless provocation, the DPRK will give more dreadful punishment to it."

            "content": "CRPP condena la banda de conservadores surcoreanos\r\nPyongyang, 30 de mayo (ATCC) -- En relacion con que la banda de conservadores surcoreanos toma el camino de imprudente enfrentamiento militar y de guerra de agresion contra la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea relacionando de continuo con esta el caso de hundimiento del buque de guerra \"Cheonan\" del ejercito titere, el Secretariado del Comite por la Reunificacion Pacifica de la Patria (CRPP) hizo publica el dia 30 la informacion No. 955.\n\t\t\t\t\t Segun trascendidos, de acuerdo con el guion de enfrentamiento del traidor Lee Myung Bak, los gangsteres del circulo militar surcoreano hablan tanto de la supuesta \"manifestacion del poderio militar\" y \"enfrentamiento militar\", realizan a partir del dia 27 en las aguas del Mar Oeste los ejercicios de bombardeo naval y de lanzamiento de las bombas de profundidad movilizando 10 buques de guerra de distintos generos como el destructor y la corbeta y el avion patrullero anti-submarinos y perpetran abiertamente la provocacion militar contra la RPDC infiltrando cada dia ilegalmente el grupo de buques de guerra en las aguas jurisdiccionales de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tambien, la banda de los traidores planea realizar los ejercicios combinados antisubmarinos de gran envergadura en el mismo Mar Oeste introduciendo los buques de guerra de las tropas agresivas pertenecientes a la septima flota norteamericana incluyendo el portaviones nuclear, el crucero y el submarino nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ademas, examina el proyecto de realizar junto con las tropas yanquis el ejercicio movil al aire libre de gran envergadura equivalente al simulacro militar conjunto \"Team Spirit\" suspendido en el periodo posterior a 1994.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Por otra parte, llevo a la etapa de visperas de la guerra el estado de vigilancia de informaciones sobre la RPDC. Segun esto, desarrolla de manera frenetica las actividades de espionaje sobre los objetos militares de la RPDC movilizando el \"U-2\" y otros aviones de reconocimiento estrategico y tactico de distintos generos y trata de reanudar la guerra psicologica e intrigante contra la RPDC mediante la pulverizacion de volantes, las pantallas electronicas y altavoces en las cercanias de la primera linea del frente. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Y planea desarrollar hasta los \"ejercicios de interceptacion interna y externa\" de caracter muy provocativo para bloquear la RPDC en el mar y registrar arbitrariamente los barcos de esta en alta mar participando activamente en la agresiva \"Iniciativa de No Proliferacion de las Armas de Exterminio Masivo\" auspiciada por EE.UU.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tales alborotos de enfrentamiento y de guerra, que la banda del traidor Lee Myung Bak perpetra en contubernio con EE.UU., devienen la abierta amenaza y chantaje militares e imperdonable desafio contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hoy en dia, la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana esta en el estado tan tenso en que puede estallar en cualquier momento la guerra debido al incidente de hundimiento del buque de guerra del ejercito titere inventado por la banda del traidor Lee para calumniar la dignidad de la RPDC, denigrar y aplastar a los connacionales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Es obvio cual consecuencia traeran la provocacion militar y la campana belica en el Mar Oeste donde debido a las maniobras provocativas de los belicistas del circulo militar titere se desarrollaron en varias ocasiones los conflictos militares entre el Norte y el Sur y se invento el caso de hundimiento del buque de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Es la ley que la mariposa nocturna se muere quemada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El ejercito y el pueblo de Corea tienen la ferrea voluntad y coraje de responder con el implacable castigo al \"castigo\" y con el golpe demoledor a la \"represalia\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Si la banda de Lee Myung Bak sigue tomando la provocacion imprudente, la RPDC le dara el castigo mas terrible."
