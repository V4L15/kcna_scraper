            "content": "Heightened vigilance against U.S. strategy for world supremacy called for\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 11 (KCNA) -- It is necessary to heighten vigilance against the U.S. strategy for world supremacy and \"anti-terrorism war\" and further intensify the anti-U.S. struggle for independence. This is a master key to ensuring world peace, security and stability and achieving the human cause of independence.\r\n This is the conclusion made by Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article analyzing this year characterized as a year in which the U.S. moves to dominate the world by force have reached the extreme level of danger. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' greed for world supremacy has not waned but grown stronger and their moves for aggression, war, interference and pressure to satisfy it have not stopped but become evermore undisguised along the track of a new Cold War.\r\n Herein lies the reactionary and vicious nature of the U.S. imperialists' moves for domination this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Describing all their actions as those for \"peace\" and \"democracy,\" the U.S. has claimed that it is engaged in the \"anti-terrorism war\" for world peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has ceaselessly fought the \"anti-terrorism war\" in Afghanistan. Since the U.S. openly declared that it was the aim of the U.S. to topple the Hussein regime, it has sped up the preparations for anti-Iraq war, increasing the number of its aggressor forces stationed around Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is intended to keep other countries from daring stand against the U.S. by demonstrating its military muscle and creating a horror-ridden atmosphere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In escalating the \"anti-terrorism war\" the U.S. sought to show other countries that they will not be safe but will be contained by force of arms if they displease and stand against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was none other than the U.S. which complicated the situation in different regions of the world including Asia, Africa, Latin-America and the Middle East and the Balkans and threatened peace, security and stability there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. benchmark of all the military measures and moves has been to serve the purpose of \"protecting the U.S. interests\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. real purpose of its forces' presence in Central Asia was to contain Russia and China and have a grip on oil resources in the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists have acted as rogues in utter disregard of the un charter, international law and ethics and morality in order to \"protect the U.S. interests\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Humankind has drawn a serious lesson from the U.S. moves for world supremacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the countries are called upon to build up strong self-reliant military power by their own efforts and counter any aggressor forces' attacks on their own initiative. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another serious lesson is that all the people should clearly see through the real picture and reactionary nature of the U.S. imperialists and wage a staunch anti-U.S. struggle for independence by the concerted efforts.    \r\n\r\n"
