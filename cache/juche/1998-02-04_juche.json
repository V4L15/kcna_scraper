As a result, the daily average coal output in the latter half of 1997 was 20 percent higher than the figure in the similar period of the previous year.\r\n   Soldiers of the Korean People's Army and workers engaged in the power industrial sector built the Anbyon Youth Power Station with the domestic strength, technique and materials.\r\n   Particularly, the construction of minor power stations has been stepped up in recent years, with the result that hundreds of power stations were built throughout the country.\r\n   In the railway transport, the 100-odd-kilometre-long Wonsan-Mt. Kumgang Railway Line was laid and great successes were made in the work of improving the technical condition of tracks.\r\n   Metal-makers opened up a vista for increasing the steel and iron production by introducing new methods.\r\n   The agricultural working people and people's army soldiers laid a solid foundation to increase the agricultural production by making preparations for farming by themselves.\r\n   The people engaged in the light industrial sector increased the production of light industrial goods including primary consumer goods by making an effective use of the already-made production foundation.\r\n   The \"arduous march\" in korea produced a large number of units which manage themselves properly by their own efforts. \r\n   Cities and counties built their own raw material and production bases and managed their economic life with their own resources, not depending upon others.\r\n   Industrial establishments have solved problems of production and life of employees through self-reliance.\r\n   The achievements made in the course of the \"arduous march\" for years under the banner of self-reliance are an eloquent evidence of the invincibility of the cause of Korean-style socialism.    \r\n\r\n"

It makes it possible to reunify the country in a fair way with the north and the south allowed to have their own ideology and system intact.\r\n   Indeed, the three charters are replete with the spirit of national independence, the spirit of regarding the nation's dignity and sovereignty as life and soul. They also reflect ardent, patriotic desire to achieve harmony between the north and the south and the unity of the whole nation and win the independent and peaceful reunification of the country. \r\n   The three charters serve as the banner the Korean nation should always maintain in the efforts for reunification and the most just and realistic reunification programme common to the nation.    \r\n \r\n"

They have repeatedly claimed that as the DPRK is a main object posing danger to the United States, a forestalling attack should be made on it as a measure to remove the root cause in the bud and that it is high time the attack was launched because the DPRK is in the grip of the \"worst ever crisis\".\r\n   In the past they described the DPRK as \"impregnable fortress\" and \"hardline communist bulwark\". But now they are crying for a forestalling attack on it, reiterating what the U.S. conservatives have said.\r\n   Uneasiness and terror are what robbers always feel.\r\n   If they are to extricate themselves from uneasiness and terror, they have no other choice but to go away along with lethal weapons. But they are now describing the owner as \"object posing danger to them\" and threatening a forestalling attack. This is really a brigandish logic proper to the murderers and plunderers.\r\n   The U.S. has never opened its mouth without calling for \"freedom of choice\" and \"democracy\".\r\n   What the media have said, however, reveal again that its call is nothing but a hypocrisy and that the U.S. is a rogue state misguided by brigandish logic and thinking.\r\n   The U.S. conservative hardliners should stop foolish acts.\r\n   The more zealously they abuse and threaten the DPRK, the more clearly their foolishness may be revealed. And such a reckless act will harm themselves.\r\n   The right to choice is not an exclusive thing of the United States.    \r\n\r\n"
