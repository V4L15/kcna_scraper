They have been ridiculed by the international community for their repeated release of \"misinformation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Upset by this, the Japanese reactionaries are persistently calling for applying \"sanctions\" against the DPRK at the UN forum and, at the same time applying \"additional sanctions\" while imposing political persecution on the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) and Koreans in Japan. This is evidenced by the ever-growing suppression, threat and terrorist act against Chongryon institutions and Koreans in Japan. Some days ago, the Japanese authorities revealed their attempt to freeze the properties of Chongryon allegedly to \"cut off the source of funds\" under the pretext of the DPRK's satellite launch. This clearly testifies to the moral vulgarity peculiar to the Japanese reactionaries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their crackdown on Chongryon and Koreans in Japan precisely means a grave political provocation against the DPRK and another vicious move for confrontation with it.
