            "content": "Japan's projected overseas military operation under fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 5 (KCNA) -- Japan's ground, maritime and air \"Self-Defence Forces\" (SDF) are going to stage joint exercises overseas for the first time in the post-war period. In this regard Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary terms it an unpardonable criminal act.\r\n The commentary goes on:\r\n The objective of the SDF's projected military exercises in the Indian Ocean and Pakistan is to set a precedent for the simultaneous overseas advance and comprehensive military exercise of the three services of the \"SDF\" and show that Japan is fully capable of staging any military operation overseas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's moves to stage such joint military exercises, not bound to legal restrictions and departing from precedent, cannot be construed otherwise than a very dangerous development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a clear indication that the Japanese reactionaries have not given up their old dream of \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\" though half a century has passed since their defeat and the world greeted a new century but have become more undisguised in their moves to realize their wild ambition for overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The crimes committed by Japan in the past are still fresh in the memory of the world people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In view of both their nature and temper, the Japanese militarists represent a war force which can launch aggression any time under any brigandish pretext. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The projected joint military exercises of the \"SDF\" overseas can never be justified nor can their criminal and dangerous nature be covered up.    \r\n\r\n"
