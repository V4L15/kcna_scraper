It is an urgent requirement of the times to replace the outdated Armistice Agreement (AA) by a peace treaty. This is attributable to the fact that the AA has now become defunct and the Korean Peninsula turned into a theater of acute military stand-off and a dangerous nidus of a war due to the United States.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Sunday says this in a signed article.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present AA would not make it possible to prevent the eruption of military conflicts by any incidental cause.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An early conclusion of a peace treaty replacing the AA would help turn the relations of acute belligerency into those of peace and confidence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The long ceasefire on the Korean Peninsula unprecedented in the world history of ceasefire is just like a time-bomb in work that poses constant threat to Northeast Asia and furthermore, Asia-Pacific.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Peace treaty only would bring peaceful environment to the peninsula and the rest of Asia-Pacific.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The urgency for replacing the AA with a peace treaty is also related to the main trend of the present times toward reconciliation, cooperation and development, not war and confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The issue of concluding a peace treaty would see a smooth solution if the U.S. comes out with the political will to make a bold switchover in its hostile policy toward the DPRK in conformity with its interests and the desire of the world peace-loving people, facing up to the changed situation and trend of the developing history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. had better make a bold decision at once to fulfill the duty it assumes in replacing the AA with a peace treaty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Steadfast is the stand of the DPRK to establish a durable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula and denuclearize it through dialogue and negotiations, the article concludes."
