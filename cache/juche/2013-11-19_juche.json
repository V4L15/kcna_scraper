            "content": "KCNA Commentary Slams S. Korean Authorities for Pursuing Confrontation Policy\r\n Pyongyang, November 19 (KCNA) -- It is a \"national policy\" of the present south Korean authorities to pursue confrontation between fellow countrymen, not confidence and reconciliation. Its despicable true colors have been brought to light once again. \n\t\t\t\t\t This is clearly evidenced by the fact that the puppet Ministry of Unification of south Korea recently presented the \"second principal plan for the development of south-north relations\" to the \"National Assembly\" after finally confirming it as the orientation of the \"north policy\" to be followed by the regime in the five years to come. The \"plan\" deleted all matters included in the historic October 4 declaration such as the issues of establishing a special zone for peace and cooperation in the West Sea and turning the armistice mechanism into a peace-keeping one, etc. contained in the \"first plan for the development of south-north relations.\" Instead, the \"second plan\" included such undesirable points as \"nuclear issue of the north\" and \"human rights issue of the north\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a total denial of the north-south joint declarations and an unpardonable provocation to the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By doing so, the south Korean puppet authorities formally declared that they would pursue confrontation with the north to the last. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whoever desires the development of the north-south relations to a new phase of peace and co-prosperity can never deny the above-said parts of the October 4 declaration which they deleted from their \"second plan\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By formally repudiating the above-said points the authorities openly revealed their attitude of denying the historic north-south joint declarations and their sinister intention not to work for co-prosperity of the nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The issues they added to the \"plan\" are nothing but vicious confrontation slogans they used to chant in a bid to disarm the DPRK in collusion with outside forces and realize the ambition to \"bring down its social system\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The inter-Korean relations had developed into reconciliation and cooperation since the publication of the June 15 joint declaration.     \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These ties, however, were driven into catastrophe, creating an extremely tense situation, because the puppet forces have desperately sought cooperation in the campaign against the DPRK in a bid to put those confrontation scenarios into practice. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During her recent foreign trips the chief executive of south Korea begged for cooperation in confrontation with fellow countrymen. Not content with this, she is working hard to make the total collapse of the inter-Korean relations an established fact by fixing it legally and institutionally. Herein lies the gravity of the situation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This made it clearer that such rubbish as \"confidence\" and the like  much touted by Park Geun Hye and her group are nothing but hypocrisy intended to cover up their true colors as confrontation maniacs. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is natural that the south Korean people of different social standings express deep concern, saying that the recent development \"brought to light the confrontation attitude towards the north\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The history of the north-south relations shows that no confrontation maniacs met a good end. It was proved by the ends of traitor Syngman Rhee, the \"yusin\" dictator and the disgraceful fate of traitor Lee Myung Bak. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities would be well advised to bear in mind that what they will gain through confrontation will be nothing but a more miserable fate than that of the predecessors."

This deplorable situation in south Korea calls upon the people from all walks of life to turn out in a mass struggle against the revival of the \"yusin\" dictatorship.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Koreans have a shining tradition of the struggle for democracy in which they drove the fascist ruling quarters into ruin through heroic resistance, not yielding to injustice and dictatorship.

This is the height of its shamelessness and craftiness. Rodong Sinmun Tuesday observes this in an article. \n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Clear is the aim sought by the U.S. in talking about its shameless and crafty non-aggression treaty while asserting that it would be friendly towards the DPRK when the latter dismantles its nukes. Its objective is to bring to the DPRK the same distress as what the Balkans, Iraq and Libya suffered in the wake of falling victims to imperialists' aggression after giving up their war deterrence,  yielding to their pressure and taken in by their appeasement. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The same can be said of the U.S. talk about measures for denuclearization of the DPRK which the former put up as a precondition for concluding the non-aggression treaty. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's dismantlement of its nukes first is not same as the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in the conception. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite evident that the peninsula can hardly be denuclearized even after the DPRK dismantles its nuclear weapons under the situation where the U.S. openly makes nuclear blackmail against it after massively deploying nuclear strike means. In case this happens, the danger of war on the peninsula can not be defused but peaceful environment will be destroyed. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This will not be confined to the peninsula only. The peninsula is the strategic vantage where the interests of the world nuclear powers are intertwined and the biggest nuclear arsenal in the world. A spark on the peninsula will, therefore, plunge not only the U.S. but the rest of the world into the scourge of a nuclear war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. truly hopes for the improvement of the relations with the DPRK, it should stop calling for conditional dialogue and the improvement of the relations and making a brigandish  assertion that it will conclude a non-aggression treaty with the DPRK only when the latter dismantles its nukes first."

Y anadieron el \"problema nuclear\", el \"de derechos humanos del Norte de Corea\" y otros parrafos injustos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto significa la negacion total a la Declaracion Conjunta Norte-Sur y una intolerable provocacion a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi ellos declararon oficialmente que se enfrentaran hasta el final con la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos articulos omitidos esta vez son innegables para los que desean desarrollar las relaciones Norte-Sur a la nueva etapa de paz y prosperidad comun de la nacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta vez, las autoridades surcoreanas demostraron su actitud negativa a las historicas declaraciones aprobadas entre ambas partes coreanas y su malsana intencion de no lograr la prosperidad comun de la nacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl \"problema nuclear\" y los \"derechos humanos del Norte de Corea\" son consignas de enfrentamiento que esgrimian los titeres surcoreanos para desarmar a la RPDC y realizar la ambicion de \"derrocar el regimen norcoreano\" en contubernio con las fuerzas extranjeras. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos vinculos intercoreanos, que marchaban hacia la reconciliacion y la cooperacion despues de la cumbre Norte-Sur del 15 de Junio de 2000, se encuentran en la crisis sin salida, debido a los titeres surcoreanos que recurren a la cooperacion anti-RPDC presentando tales proyectos de enfrentamiento. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante sus recientes visitas al extranjero, la misma mandataria surcoreana mendigo la cooperacion en su campana de enfrentamiento fratricida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo si esto fuera poco, los titeres surcoreanos tratan de estipular legal e institucionalmente el enfrentamiento con la RPDC haciendo hecho consumado la ruptura total de relaciones con esta parte connacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe ha evidenciado que la \"confianza\" y otras palabrerias que suelen decir Park Geun-hye y su camarilla no pasan de ser una sofisteria para encubrir su naturaleza conflictiva. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor eso, los habitantes surcoreanos de distintos sectores expresan seria preocupacion por el presente caso diciendo que \"se hizo destaque a la posicion conflictiva anti-RPDC\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos que se dedicaban a la confrontacion fratricida, entre otros, el traidor Syngman Rhee, el dictador de \"Yusin\" y el traidor Lee Myung Bak, tuvieron siempre un fin vergonzoso. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas actuales autoridades surcoreanas deben tener presente que la confrontacion fratricida les causara el arruinamiento mas tragico que el de sus antecesores."
