A spokesman for the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of Korea in a statement Friday branded it as an unpardonable provocation to the system and dignity of the DPRK, an insult to the nation's desire for reunification and a declaration of confrontation between systems.\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee only seeks confrontation with his fellow countrymen and the collapse of the system in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet group's \"north policy\" and confrontation moves are all prompted by its extreme bitterness toward the fellow countrymen and the foolish story of the \"collapse of the north.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All open and closed talks and secret contacts that had been made between the authorities of the north and the south proved futile due to the sinister aim sought by the group of traitors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent hideous incident of setting the leadership of the DPRK as a target clearly proves what phase the Lee group's bitterness toward the fellow countrymen has reached.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There are lots of countries and different social systems in the world but never had there been such hooligans as the Lee Myung Bak group who insulted the system and the dignity of the leadership of the fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Lee's moves for confrontation between systems are a last-ditch effort of a political imbecile ignorant of the source of the vitality and the inexhaustible strength of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK can not but deal merciless blows at the Lee group if it persistently stands for the confrontation of systems.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group will meet the collapse of its unpopular system and the end of the pro-U.S. puppet regime and the nation will gain reunification, its cherished desire."

On June 24, Juche 35 (1946) he promulgated \"The Labor Law for the Workers and Office Employees in North Korea\". It was a great event that declared the new and genuine labor system for the working people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The socialist labor system in the DPRK has been steadily consolidated and developed along with the triumphant advance of the Korean revolution under the wise leadership of the party and the leader, demonstrating its advantages and vitality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During the period of building a new country, the state made sure that responsible measures were taken for labor protection. It introduced social insurance and security systems and reassessed wages of workers despite the shortage of everything. These measures fuelled the enthusiasm and creativity of the working people, who became masters of the country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In 1951, during the Fatherland Liberation war, the state took a measure of rebuilding sanatoria and rest homes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Cabinet made a decision on enforcing the Labor Law in the southern half of the republic in August 1950 and a decision on state social security in August 1951. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A number of policies were put into force in the postwar period of rehabilitation and socialist construction. They included a Cabinet decision on increasing medical service for workers, technicians and office workers in June 1954 and a decision on cutting down working hours for nursing mothers in October 1966.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Socialist Labor Law, original labor charter, was promulgated on April 18, 1978, in particular, indicating the way for the final solution of the labor issue. It marked an important occasion in giving full play to the advantages of the labor system in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Leader Kim Jong Il published the famous work \"On Improving Labor Administration\" on November 27, 1989. It brought about a new turn in thoroughly implementing the Socialist Labor Law and establishing the revolutionary way of working in the whole society. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the country was in difficult condition during the period of the arduous march and the forced march the state granted working people such social benefits as free education and free medical care systems as well as social insurance and security systems so that they might enjoy a worthwhile and cultured labor and emotional life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to the policies of the party and the state for the people's labor safety the working places have been equipped with excellent facilities for labor protection. A high level of cultured practice in production and life has been established with full hygiene conditions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hundreds of sanatoria and rest homes have been built for the people in beauty spots including Mts. Myohyang, Chilbo, Kuwol and Jongbang."
