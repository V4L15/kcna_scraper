            "content": "\"Commemorations\" of half centenary of Korean War assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article warns the U.S. warmongers not to forget their defeat in the last Korean War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They launched armed invasion against the young DPRK all of a sudden on June 25, 1950, to destroy it but suffered the bitterest defeat in their history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They are going to stage various \"commemorations\" of the half centenary of the Korean War and continue similar events in years to come in a bid to justify their Korean War of aggression and hurl young and middle-aged Americans into a new Korean war of aggression, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is true that the U.S. aggression troops are mercenaries but money is not enough to mobilize them to the war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Americans are reluctant to send their sons to the war of aggression on Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. allies, too,  are turning their backs to the U.S., half believing and half suspecting its aggressive policy toward the DPRK. \"Commemorations\" of the half centenary of the Korean War are a brainchild of the U.S. warhawks to cope with this situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"commemorations\" will never change the truth behind their provocation of the Korean War nor help their aggression troops drop war-phobia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All wars fought by the U.S. took place in alien lands and, therefore, not a single shell dropped on the U.S. territory as was the case with the Korean War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. imperialists intend to undertake the second Korean war as before. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But such war method will not work on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If they dare provoke the second Korean war, the DPRK will attack everywhere the U.S. aggression troops are stationed and wipe them out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. warhawks are well advised to abandon their absurd intention to instill war fever into GIs and civilians and undertake the new Korean war supported by them. Their projected \"commemorations\" will only precipitate their doomsday. \r\n\r\n"
