            "content": "KCNA Commentary Accuses Park Group of Its Political Offensive before Elections\r\n Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- The south Korean puppet group is seeking to use a disgusting farce staged by Park Geun Hye while making public \"a talk to the people\" for the elections to local self-governing bodies.\n\t\t\t\t\t It posted on its website on May 20 a video praising Park's \"feats\" as regards the rescue operation after the ferry Sewol disaster, illustrated with a scene showing her shedding tears. This is intended to publicize Park's \"popular nature\" and the \"government's\" measures for handling the accident. It tries to use it as a card for rallying conservative forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In fact, the \"Saenuri Party\" sent an official document to all city and provincial party committees to the effect that \"candidates should use a video dealing with the talk of the president posted on website\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On May 22 when the election campaign started, the chairman of the joint election measure committee of the \"Saenuri Party\" uttered that \"it is time to help the president wipe tears away.\"  The chairman of the North Kyongsang Provincial Committee of the \"Saenuri Party\" called upon \"the committee to wipe away the tears from the president\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is part of a cynical ploy of the conservative forces keen on protecting the \"president\" to quell the resentment of the people and the atmosphere of their anti-\"government\" struggle mounting high due to the Sewol disaster and divert elsewhere the attention of the public in a bid to tide over the present crisis and turn the situation before the elections to the local self-governing bodies in their favor by rallying those forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The tears dropped by Park did not represent the sorrow of the mothers who lost their dear children and other people. They were no tears of her guilty conscience that the disaster was caused by her and \"government's\" incompetence and irresponsibility.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sincere tears had long disappeared from the cold-blooded woman Park.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That's why she visited Jindo Port on April 17, the next day when the disaster occurred, but she did not shed even a drop of tear there though it turned into a mourner's house.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When visiting Phaengmok Port for the second time, she did not show tears while styling herself a \"bereaved family member\". When visiting a joint incense-burning alter, she shed crocodile tears before a sham \"bereaved family\" she had taken with herself from Seoul.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She failed to take a step for rescuing those missing, far from opting for probing the truth about the accident though one month had passed since it occurred only to spark off the resentment of the bereaved families and people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t While making public a \"talk to the people\" on May 19, she dropped unreasonable tears, seemingly grieved over the accident. Lurking behind this was a political purpose sought by her.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She required a farce for seeking a way out of the crisis as she had to calm down the voices of the enraged people \"Punish murderers!\" and \"Park Geun Hye, step down!\" and stop tens of thousands of people's candlelight processions toward Chongwadae.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Prompted by a foolish calculation to get rid of the overall crisis caused by dependence on foreign forces and acts of treachery and escape a heavy defeat at the forthcoming local elections, Park hastily orchestrated the \"talk to the people\" and shed crocodile tears to hype sincerity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Reflecting such political stand of Park, Chongwadae and coteries of the \"Saenuri Party\" are keeping pace with the \"tear-shedding drama\" orchestrated by the \"yusin princess\" while totally turning down the demand of the people that the \"president\" should be included in the list of investigation into the state policy related to the Sewol disaster.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said charade is another insult to the bereaved families and people of south Korea and a height of the act of deceiving the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter what rhetoric Park and her group may let loose, they can never evade the blame for mass killings of people."

It hurled huge riot police force into blocking memorial events, candlelight rallies and demonstrations now under way across south Korea and storming venues of rallies.

It also arrested many students who attempted to make their way to Chongwadae in demand of the resignation of Kim Ki Chun, presidential chief of staff.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet police gangsters committed outrages against protesters regardless of age or sex. They arrested young students at random in a bid to forcibly dissolve rallies and demonstrations. Not content with this, they planted plain-clothed policemen in various places and are barring the families of the victims from coming out in actions in every way while watching their every movement by confirming the identity of those having yellow ribbons and conducting body search for them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t And they are kicking up a whirlwind of suppression such as taking heavy disciplinary measures against the teachers who issued declarations on the situation in demand of the resignation of Park Geun Hye and persecuting the journalists who wrote articles critical of the chief executive.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They even stormed the venue of a funeral for the man who committed suicide in protest against the suppression of the trade union by the authorities and harsh exploitation by plutocrats and took away the dead body and the box for his remains. They committed such monstrous atrocities as spraying tear liquid at the protesting workers and arrested dozens of them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The information bulletin held that this crackdown against humanity and human rights was barbarous atrocities which can be perpetrated only by the brutes in human clothing and the gangsters steeped in the fascist nature dating back to the \"yusin\" dictatorship to the marrow of their bones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet authorities' fascist hysteria is a revelation of extreme uneasiness and fear and the last-ditch effort to turn the situation before the elections in their favour.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park Geun Hye group is wholly to blame for the ferry Sewol disaster, the information bulletin noted, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park Geun Hye group should make an honest apology for these thrice-cursed atrocities and face a severe judgment from the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, Park Geun Hye made a wordplay and fired a few inferiors in a bid to calm down the angry public, persistently paying no heed to the just demands of the bereaved families and people from all walks of life for a thoroughgoing probe behind the truth and the punishment of those involved. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When things are happening contrary to its expectation, the group is putting in custody and committing violence against those who turned out in actions, unable to bear the curse and resentment at the puppet authorities, on charge of violation of the law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ruthless suppression clearly proves that Park's \"talk to the people\" and \"apology\" was nothing but hypocrisy intended to calm down the angry public.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean people of various circles will certainly mete out a stern judgment to the Park Geun Hye group, the worst troublemakers and diehard fascist maniacs, and thus have their pent-up grudge settled."

Then followed speeches. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Secretary-General of the society Masataka Tanaka said that last year, 90 years after the Kanto quake, the society requested the Japanese government to probe the truth behind the massacres of Koreans. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The mass killings of Koreans during the great Kanto quake remain a problem because they still remain unsettled. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese government should properly look into many mass killings committed under the colonial rule of Japan, admit its direct or indirect involvement in them, make an apology to the bereaved families and take necessary measures. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Co-Representative of the society Masao Ishibashi warned against Japan's further lurch to the Right. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is most important is to properly understand history, he noted, deploring that such abnormal situation is going on under the political landscape of Japan where neither investigation nor apology has been made so far at a time when state and people's responsibility is called for."

y la visita a los lugares necesarios para que la parte japonesa pueda confirmar los problemas presentados por si misma y tomara las medidas adecuadas compartiendo los datos con la parte japonesa. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Septimo, la investigacion se realizara pronto y seguira consultando de diversas formas y metodos los problemas que surjan en el curso de investigacion y tomara las medidas
