            "content": "DPRK Will Mercilessly Shatter U.S. and Its Followers' \"Human Rights\" Campaign\r\nPyongyang, October 25 (KCNA) -- The U.S. is going mad in its campaign to hurt the dignity of the DPRK and bring down its socialist system by fabricating the non-existent \"human rights issue\" as its moves for isolating and stifling the DPRK over its nuclear issue prove unsuccessful.\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. \"human rights\" racket against the DPRK has reached a graver phase with the approach of the end of October before the UN General Assembly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As regards the prevailing situation, the DPRK National Defence Commission on Saturday issued a statement clarifying its principled stand internally and externally upon the authorization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t First, Now that the U.S. \"human rights\" offensive against the DPRK has reached an extreme phase, the DPRK formally notifies the U.S. that the DPRK will settle accounts with those related to the offensive without the slightest clemency  and by every possible means and methods generation after generation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's society is the one centered on man as it values human beings as dearest. Accordingly, it regards it as the core of politics and its inviolable state policy to guarantee all rights of human beings at the highest level.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Probably, the successive U.S. presidents and other politicians may not understand there is such ideal society on our planet no matter how fervently one explains them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than the U.S. which is incapable of protecting the human rights of black men though it has black president. It is the worst tundra of human rights in the world where one percent of its population deprives its 99 percent of everything and these poorest people are more dead than alive as modern-day slaves. This being a hard fact, it is pitiful for the U.S. to dare talk about the genuine human rights in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Availing itself of this opportunity, the DPRK courteously requests Obama, Kerry and other politicians of the U.S. to bring even their followers to the DPRK so that they may see for themselves and learn what the genuine human rights are and what the man-centred society is as they are becoming so vocal about its \"human rights issue\" after faking it up. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But this advice does not mean that the DPRK tolerates the \"human rights\" racket kicked up by the U.S. against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not content with making the Korean people bear towering grudge, the U.S. has resorted to an unprecedented \"human rights\" racket. It will have to pay dearly for this generation after generation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Second, Now that the U.S. anti-DPRK \"human rights\" campaign is leading to a vicious plot to bring down the dignified social system in the DPRK, it declares its new tough counter-action of its own style to frustrate the campaign of the U.S. and its allied forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"human rights\" campaign of the U.S. is another version of the most undisguised act of aggression against the DPRK's sovereignty and rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To cope with this, the DPRK, too, decided to launch a new tough counter-action of its own style to blow up the stronghold of the violators of \"human rights.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK had already declared before the world that an operational plan for striking all the bases of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces in the Pacific targeting the DPRK and the main cities of the U.S. mainland where war maniacs are stationed was ratified.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK never hides the fact that the declaration of the most powerful new counter-action of its own style is based on a powerful nuclear force built in every way and various ultramodern striking means deployed in the ground, sea, underwater and air.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world will clearly see how the DPRK's declaration of a powerful counter-action will be put into practice to blow up the citadel of the U.S. now that its \"human rights\" campaign to infringe upon the sovereignty and rights of the DPRK has gone beyond its tolerance limit. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Third, The army and people of the DPRK call upon the world to thoroughly shatter the sinister cooperation for aggression sought by the U.S. and its followers under the pretext of the \"human rights issue\" through anti-U.S. cooperation based on justice and truth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The anti-U.S. cooperation urged by the DPRK is cooperation of justice which all countries regarding sovereignty as life and soul and all peace-loving people should effect to dismember the U.S. imperialists in all parts of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will together all countries aspiring after justice and truth valiantly wage a just struggle against the U.S. imperialists, the sworn enemy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The anti-U.S. cooperation called for by the DPRK will lead to a decisive battle through which human beings will kill beasts and justice will prevail over injustice and truth over lies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nuclear forces of the DPRK and political and military deterrence including them will demonstrate unimaginably tremendous might in effecting worldwide anti-U.S. cooperation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. anti-DPRK \"human rights\" racket is bound to go bankrupt as it is faked up by those fanatics whose days are numbered, without elementary understanding of their rival and it is based on the brigandish and self-opinionated theory of hostility."

The opposition parties are strongly demanding the authorities hold in check the leaflet scattering operation.\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson Saturday in a commentary says the leaflet scattering operation is recognized as a war action in the light of international law. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The commentary goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the leaflet scattering operation is conducted, it is bound to be followed by a combat to foil it.

            "content": "RPDC frustrara campana de \"DDHH\" en su contra, declara CDN\r\nPyongyang, 25 de octubre (ACNC) -- Ya que resulto inefectiva su prolongada campana para aislar y aplastar a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea pretextando el problema nuclear, Estados Unidos esta desesperado ahora para manchar la dignidad de la primera y desestabilizar su regimen socialista inventando el supuesto \"problema de derechos humanos\". \n\t\t\t\t\tA finales de octubre cuando se acerca la Asamblea General de la ONU, se torna mas brutal la campana anti-RPDC en el tema de \"DDHH\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl respecto, el Comite de Defensa Nacional de la RPDC hizo publica el dia 25, bajo la autorizacion, una declaracion para exponer al interior y exterior la siguiente posicion de principios de la RPDC: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Puesto que llega al extremo la ofensiva de \"DDHH\" de EE.UU. contra la RPDC, avisamos oficialmente a EE.UU. que saldaremos las cuentas de generacion en generacion con las fuerzas involucradas utilizando todos los medios y metodos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestra sociedad es la humano-centrica que aprecia al hombre como ente mas valioso. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor lo tanto, considera como fundamento de la politica y como inviolable politica estatal asegurar en el maximo nivel todos los derechos humanos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTal vez los politicos estadounidenses, incluso los presidentes sucesivos, no podran entender jamas que en este planeta existe una sociedad ideal como la RPDC, aunque se lo explique repetidamente. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. es la sociedad incapaz donde su presidente negro no puede proteger los derechos humanos de la poblacion de la misma raza y el peor infierno para los DDHH en que el 99% de la poblacion viven como esclavos de cuno moderno del 1% aduenado de lo todo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs miserable que tal pais cuestione atrevidamente los verdaderos derechos humanos de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn esta oportunidad, aconsejamos con cortesia a Obama, Kerry y otros politicos norteamericanos, inventores del \"problema de DDHH\" de la RPDC, visiten con sus seguidores a nuestro pais para ver con sus propios ojos y aprender cuales son los verdaderos derechos humanos y cual es la sociedad humano-centrica. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, este consejo no significa perdonar la campana de \"DDHH\" anti-RPDC lanzada por EE.UU. hasta la fecha. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInsatisfecho con sus tremendos crimenes cometidos contra el pueblo coreano durante mas de medio siglo, EE.UU. vuelve a recurrir a la campana de \"DDHH\" sin precedentes. Esta fechoria sera balanceada severamente generacion tras generacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Dado que la campana de \"DDHH\" anti-RPDC de EE.UU. se expande como un complot para derrocar el digno sistema y el regimen de la RPDC, declaramos a EE.UU. y sus satelites las nuevas e intransigentes contramedidas por el estilo coreano para frustrarla. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa campana de \"DDHH\" es otra forma del acto agresivo mas abierto contra la soberania y el poder estatal de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFrente a ello, decidimos tomar las nuevas y fuertes contramedidas por el estilo coreano para eliminar los bastiones de los violadores de \"DDHH\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestras fuerzas armadas revolucionarias ya anunciaron a todo el mundo que esta firmado el plan de ataque total contra las bases de las fuerzas norteamericanas en el Pacifico, que apuntan sus armas hacia la RPDC, y las ciudades principales estadounidenses donde se encuentran los maniacos de guerra. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo ocultamos que la declaracion de nuestras fuertes contramedidas se basa en las poderosas y perfectas fuerzas armadas nucleares y los medios de ataque sofisticados que seran desplegados en la tierra, el mar, el aire y en las aguas submarinas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl mundo vera claramente como se ejecutaran nuestras fuertes contramedidas para destruir el bastion de la campana norteamericana de \"DDHH\" que sobrepasa su limite con el fin de acabar con la soberania y el poder estatal de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Nuestro ejercito y pueblo exhortan al mundo a frustrar estrictamente con la cooperacion antiyanqui de justicia y verdad la malsana cooperacion de agresion que persiguen EE.UU. y las fuerzas satelites so pretexto del \"problema de DDHH\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa susodicha cooperacion antiyanqui es la justa para que todos los paises que consideran como vida la soberania y todos los pueblos amantes de la paz se levanten para desmembrar a los imperialistas yanquis por doquier del  mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesarrollaremos con audacia la lucha justa contra los yanquis, enemigo jurado, hombro con hombro con todos los paises que aspiran a la justicia y la verdad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa cooperacion antiyanqui se extendera al combate de vida o muerte para aniquilar el hombre a la bestia, la justicia a la injusticia y la verdad a la falsedad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la realizacion de la cooperacion antiyanqui en escala mundial las fuerzas armadas nucleares y el disuasivo politico y militar poseidos por la RPDC pondran de pleno manifiesto su poderio inimaginable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa campana de \"DDHH\" anti-RPDC de EE.UU. fracasara sin falta porque es inventada por los agonizantes carentes de comprension elemental sobre su contraparte y basada en la logica hostil bandidesca y egotista."
