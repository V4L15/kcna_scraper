Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The letter pointed out that Kim Jong Il unrolled the effective Songun politics for the first time in the world history of politics and frustrated every move of the U.S. imperialists to isolate and stifle the DPRK, thus fully demonstrating the inexhaustible national strength and the invincible might of Juche Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It said the DPRK led by him is shedding its brilliant rays as a great country advancing, guided by the Songun idea, and winning victories thanks to the Songun policy and a country of the sun vibrating with his stamina and will of Mt. Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The vanguard fighters of the NDFSK and people in the south will deeply enshrine the absolute warship of him, decisively foil the reckless anti-north war policy of the U.S. and its stooges and their moves for isolating and stifling the north through national cooperation under the banner of the June 15 joint declaration and intensify the movement for independent reunification so as to brilliantly decorate 2005, the 60th anniversary of Korea's liberation and the 5th anniversary of the joint declaration, as the year of national reunification., it concluded.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
