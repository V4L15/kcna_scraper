            "content": "New Year editorial calls for stepping up general onward movement of Korean socialism\r\n\r\n   Pyongyang, January 1 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun, Joson Inmingun and Chongyon Joni, the newspapers of the party, the army and the youth, issue a joint ï¿½mew Year editorial today, calling on the whole party, the entire army and all the people to step up the general onward movement of Korean socialism this year.\r\n   The editorial entitled \"Let us make our country and motherland evermore prosperous under great party's leadership\" says among other things:\r\n   This year's general onward movement is a final campaign to finish the \"arduous march\" victoriously.\r\n   \"Let us all become victors in this year's'arduous march' \" is a revolutionary slogan we must put up this year.\r\n   We must take it as the general task to speed up the forced march of socialism, consolidate the political, economic and military positions of the Korean revolution into impregnable ones and improve the people's standard of living as much as possible.\r\n   In stepping up the general onward movement this year, it is important to imbue the whole of society with our party's idea of the red flag.\r\n   This idea is, in essence, absolute worship for the leader of the revolution and the spirit of defending him even at the cost of life and sharing weal and woe with him to the last.\r\n   The party members, people's army soldiers and all other people must fight full of confidence in victory and revolutionary optimism, always under the motto \"victory of socialism is in sight \".\r\n   The central task of socialist economic construction this year is to tap and utilize the economic potentials to the maximum, decisively solve the food problem, radically improve the people's standard of living, promote land administration and lay a solid foundation for the prosperity of the country under the slogan of self-reliance.\r\n   This year, too, we must strictly implement the policy of giving primary importance to agriculture, light industry and foreign trade, as demanded by the party's revolutionary economic strategy.\r\n   If we are to promote this year's general onward movement victoriously, we must increase the defence capabilities of the country as much as possible.\r\n   Today our people's army is exceptionally powerful and there are no bounds to its strength. Once determined, it fights and wins without fail. It charges at the enemies like an angry lion and annihilates them at one stroke. Our revolutionary army will never pardon any provocateur wherever he may be. In case the enemies unleash war, our army will strike and wipe out the U.S.  aggression forces before anyone else and uproot the source of war on the Korean Peninsula.\r\n   There is no change in the consistent position of our party and the DPRK government to reunify the country through confederacy based on one nation, one state, two systems and two governments on the principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity.\r\n   The international situation is still complex, but our party's foreign policy remains unchanged.\r\n   Come what may, our party and people will invariably hold fast to the position of anti-imperialism and independence and defend the banner of socialism to the last. \r\n \r\n"
