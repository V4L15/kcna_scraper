They got the International Hydrographic Organization registered the East Sea of Korea as \"Japan Sea\" by abusing the position of being a suzerain state in 1929.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe historic facts go to clearly prove that the designation of \"Japan Sea\" is a criminal designation the usage of which was forced by the Japanese imperialists in the period of their military occupation along with their occupation of Korea and a product of their policy for militaristic expansion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. has supported Japan in its moves to designate the above-said sea as \"Japan Sea\" before the general meeting of the said organization to be held next year, disregarding stark historical facts and data and international usage and principles governing dominion and designation of seas. By doing so, it is fanning up Japan's ambition for territorial expansion which has become more undisguised from the outset of the new century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. stand on designating the above-mentioned sea as \"Japan Sea\" reminds one of the \"Taft-Katsura Agreement\", a brigandish document as it provided a legal guarantee for the Japanese imperialists' occupation of Korea 106 years back.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan turned Korea into its colony by force of arms in the last century by dint of the above-said agreement. Because this agreement provided Japan with favorable international conditions and environment for converting Korea into its colony.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis unreasonable behavior of the U.S. encouraging Japan in its overseas expansion, oblivious of the lesson taught by history, will not escape world public criticism."

            "content": "EE.UU. ampara ambicion de agresion a ultramar de Japon, comenta ACNC\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPyongyang, 16 de agosto (ACNC) -- El Departamento de Estado de Estados Unidos publico oficialmente la posicion de anotar unicamente el Mar Este de Corea como el \"Mar de Japon\", lo cual provoca gran indignacion de los coreanos, siendo un proceder que ampara las maniobras de agresion a ultramar de Japon y denigra la dignidad nacional de la nacion coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo es conocido por todos, la nacion coreana vino utilizando durante largo tiempo el nombre del Mar Este de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde la epoca remota, los antecedentes coreanos dieron primeros pasos de explotacion al Mar Este de Corea, alcanzando profundos conocimientos y comprension sobre esa zona maritima y denominaron antes que nadie el nombre del mar como el \"Mar Este de Corea\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo comprueban los documentos historicos coreanos como \"Historia de los Tres Reinos\" y la lapida de la tumba del rey Kwanggaetho construida en el ano 414.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDespues del siglo XIII, los geologos y exploradores occidentales tambien anotaron en los mapas mundiales el mar entre Corea y Japon como el \"Mar Oriental\", o sea \"Mar  Este\" y lo llamaron como \"Mar de Corea\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEse nombre, utilizado durante miles de anos por el pueblo coreano y reconocido internacionalmente, fue tergiversado por la ocupacion militar de Corea por parte de los imperialistas japoneses. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos imperialistas japoneses ocuparon a Corea con la invencion del \"Tratado de 5 Puntos de Ulsa\" en 1905 y registraron en la Organizacion Internacional Hidrografica (OIH) el nombre del Mar Este de Corea como el \"Mar de Japon\" abusando de su posicion de metropoli en 1929.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl hecho historico muestra claramente que el \"Mar de Japon\" es el nombre criminal que empezo a utilizarse con la agresion de Japon a Corea y es el producto de la politica expansionista de los militaristas japoneses. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. da espaldas a esos datos historicos y a las costumbres y principios internacionales sobre la posesion y la anotacion del nombre de mar y coopera con Japon en registrar el nombre del Mar Este de Corea como el \"Mar de Japon\" antes de la Asamblea General de la OIH del ano proximo. De esta manera, instiga la ambicion de expansion territorial de Japon que se torna cada dia mas abierta en el nuevo siglo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa posicion de EE.UU. sobre la anotacion separada del \"Mar de Japon\" hace recordar el \"Convenio Taft-Katsura\", documento bandolero en que hace 106 anos el imperio garantizo legalmente la ocupacion de Corea por parte de Japon. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor el apoyo de EE.UU. en ese convenio, Japon pudo colonizar a Corea de manera violenta. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tProvocara el repudio de la sociedad internacional el proceder de EE.UU. que coopera con Japon que hasta en el siglo nuevo abriga la ambicion de expansion territorial sin tener presente de la leccion de la historia."
