Severed blood vein and territory were reconnected, the tour of Mt. Kumgang launched on a full scale and the Kaesong Industrial Zone developed, thus bringing great pleasure to all Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the inter-Korean relations have been bedeviled uncontrollably since the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors came to power in south Korea in Feb. 2008.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In a little more than two years since its seizure of office, the Lee group, keen on the sycophancy toward the U.S. and the scheme to stifle the fellow countrymen, brought the north-south relations to a total collapse. Its deliberate and systematic moves against reunification are the hideous treachery that can never be pardoned.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of traitors totally denied the historic June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration, its action programme, and turned the inter-Korean relations back to the relationship of acute confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the \"presidential inauguration ceremony\" traitor Lee Myung Bak set forth the watchword \"no nukes, opening and 3 000 dollars\" as the \"policy towards the north\". This is a vicious policy of confrontation with fellow countrymen intended to stile the DPRK, a version of the U.S. policy towards the DPRK which is aimed to disable the DPRK's nuclear weapons and bring \"change\" in its system and thus topple it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pursuant to this policy, the group of traitors slandered and nullified the historic declarations the keynote of which is \"By our nation itself\", the idea of national independence, as soon as it took office.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was, in fact, a revelation of the sinister intention to deprive the south Korean people of their spiritual mainstay for reunification movement and hamstring the nationwide progress of the June 15 era for independence, peace and great national unity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Traitor Lee told at a press conference in the U.S. that \"the ultimate goal is to achieve the unification under the system of liberal democracy\", thus revealing his ulterior intention for \"confrontation in systems\" and \"unification of systems\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to put into practice the \"policy toward the north\" the traitorous clique came out as a shock-brigade in carrying out the U.S. scheme to stifle the DPRK with two main levers--the nuclear issue and the \"human rights issue\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of traitors has frantically pushed ahead with the preparations for a war against the DPRK in league with the U.S., claiming that to secure the \"military superiority over the north\" is the shortest way to lead the DPRK to \"abandonment of nuclear program first\" and \"reform and opening\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It brought the inter-Korean dialogue and cooperation to total suspension by employing conspiratorial and deceptive tricks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has intensified the frantic moves for confrontation with the DPRK, thus spoiling the atmosphere of dialogue. After all, such actions led to closure the Red Cross liaison office in Panmunjom, which had been kept for several decades since the outset of 1970s, and the direct phones, which had been used as communication means between the north and the south, to severance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group also put a ban on the June 15 joint events for reunification, which had been regularly held between the north and the south, and meetings for reunification between people of different circles from the north and the south, including the May Day joint event of workers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After laying down the \"four principles on the work with the north\", the Lee group suspended the inter-Korean cooperation projects and cut off the south Koreans' tour of Mt. Kumgang under the pretext of the \"case of Mt. Kumgang tourist\" that occurred in July 2008. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Though the DPRK showed its positive willingness and decision for improved inter-Korean relations, dialogue and cooperation, the group of traitors turned down all the affirmative proposals of the DPRK and frustrated even the non-governmental exchange and cooperation, bringing up groundless conditionality. It asserted that neither improvement of relations nor cooperation between the north and the south can be expected unless the nuclear issue is settled and there can be no \"contact only for meeting.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Later, the group worked out the very provocative scenario for war of aggression on the DPRK called \"Emergency Ruling Plan-Puhung\" and has made desperate efforts to carry it into practice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since the case of sinking of the south Korean puppet navy's warship occurred in March this year, the group of traitors has made every possible effort to use this case to tide over its serious political crisis by turning the atmosphere of the \"elections to local self-governing bodies\" favorable for it and isolate and stifle the DPRK internationally.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the above-said elections resulted in giving a stern judgment of the south Korean people to the traitors going against the trend of the times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t History has already sentenced to death the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors equal to the \"five traitors of 1905\", branding them as \"group of traitors in 2010\". The group is bound to meet its destruction anytime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Definite are the validity and invincibility of the June 15 joint declaration, the supreme reunification programme of the nation, as it comprehends all Koreans' aspiration and desire and its scientific accuracy and truth are guaranteed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The grand march of the June 15 era vigorously advancing under the banner of \"By our nation itself\" can never be checked no matter how frantically such reactionaries of history as the Lee Myung Bak clique of traitors may try, and the nation's cherished desire for reunification will be surely realized in the near future."

A man of reason can easily understand that the case got the DPRK nowhere. That is why the world community has thrown big doubt about the attempt to link the case with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently, the relocation of the U.S. military base in Okinawa, an issue causing trouble between the U.S. and Japan, came to a settlement with a blitz. This goes to prove that the U.S. is the backstage manipulator and criminal chiefly responsible for the case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The relocation was vital to the U.S. because this problem was related to the prospect of its Asia-Pacific strategy as well as U.S.-Japan alliance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When taken into consideration what role the Futenma U.S. airfield station in Okinawa plays in the U.S. Asia strategy for aggression, anyone can guess with ease that the U.S. might concoct a shocking case enough to create an atmosphere of \"security crisis\" in a bid to maintain the said base.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is not without reason that these days there have been raised such public opinion that the U.S. has tactfully used the warship sinking case to put Japan and south Korea under its tight military control and lay a siege and contain China and assertions that the case was caused by attack of the U.S. marines. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. ruling quarters left no means untried to conduct an operation aimed at politically ostracizing the Hatoyama regime, but in vain. Finally, they brought down the Hatoyama group by inventing the farce as a pretext for \"security crisis\" that the warship \"Cheonan\" was sunken by \"torpedo of north Korea.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. does not hesitate to victimize its aggressor troops for aggression and war against other countries. Therefore, anyone can easily realize that it would have not been difficult for the U.S. to reduce to victims to the conspiratorial case the south Korean soldiers it regards as a mere cannon fodder. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The plot-breeders are bound to put in the dock of the international court anytime."
