            "content": "Victory Belongs to DPRK: KCNA Commentary\r\nPyongyang, December 31 (KCNA) -- World media are vying with each other to report respected Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un as saying at the First Conference of Chairpersons of the Primary Committees of the Workers' Party of Korea that it is the clearest proof of the DPRK's victory that the imperialist and reactionary forces have gone desperate in their moves while calling for sanctions on it.\n\t\t\t\t\t ITAR TASS, Kommersant and Nezabisimaya Gazetta of Russia, VOA, China's Global Times and Phoenix Satellite TV Holdings LTD., of Hong Kong, Japan's Kyodo, Nihon Keizai Shimbun and Mainichi Shimbun and other media cited famous quotations of Kim Jong Un, reporting the conference as a breaking news.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an expression of admiration of the international community at the victorious DPRK winning miraculous achievements startling the world people despite the worst sanctions and blockade by the hostile forces, and validity of the cause of building a socialist power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The year 2016 alone clearly proved that nothing can check the victorious advance of the DPRK along the only road of independence, Songun and socialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and its vassal forces, seized by anachronistic frenzy for confrontation, have gone desperate in their racket for escalating confrontation with the DPRK in all fields including politics, military, economy, culture and diplomacy this year, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They staged the largest-ever nuclear war exercises from the outset of the year, pushing the situation on the Korean peninsula and the region to the extremes, and resorted to vicious sanctions and smear \"human rights\" campaign while talking about \"system collapse.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the hostile forces' racket for stifling the DPRK ended in a fiasco.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK started the stand-off with the U.S. this year with the thunderous blow of H-bomb test and bolstered nuclear deterrence in a phased manner beyond imagination, thus foiling the arrogant hostile forces' racket for militarily stifling the DPRK and putting an end to the nuclear era of tyranny.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the 70-day and 200-day campaigns the DPRK demonstrated the self-development-first spirit and created the miracle of turning misfortune into favorable conditions in the northern areas hit by flood, thus making the enemy's moves to strangle our economy and put psychological pressure on us go belly-up.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This year the world heard louder shriek admitting complete failure of the policy toward the DPRK in the Western world including the U.S., a clear proof of the victory won by the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hostile forces have gone busy, talking about UN \"sanctions resolution\" and \"unilateral sanctions\" even at the end of the year but this is little short of admitting that their sanctions farce ran out.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a law governing development of history for independence to stand above oppression and justice to win injustice. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Victory will belong to the DPRK in 2017, too, just as was witnessed in 2016.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No force on earth can check the dynamic advance of the Korean people confident of the greater victory of tomorrow."
