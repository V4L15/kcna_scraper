They launched into comprehensive mock attacks on the north, 98 Foal Eagle and 98 Hwarang, in the broad area of South Korea on the back of the joint military manoeuvres.\r\n   98 Hwarang which began in the north and south Jolla and Chungchong provinces in late October is now staged in the Seoul region. This is aimed at rounding off in an all-round way war preparations of regular and irregular armed forces and increasing  the capacity to invade the north to the maximum.\r\n   98 Hwarang is a clear manifestation of the warmongers' criminal design to invade the north. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
