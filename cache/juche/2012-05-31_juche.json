This is a heavy blow at the conservative group including the \"Saenuri Party\" which faked up at random the pro-U.S. sycophantic and fascist unpopular laws while going unchallenged at the NA after occupying its majority seats, the bulletin noted, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative group feels a serious crisis that if the progressive forces occupy the NA, this may arrest its moves for confrontation and war and remarkably increase the atmosphere for reunification through alliance with the north to create the situation unfavorable for keeping its puppet ruling system and seizing the power again.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group is deeply interfering into the incident of the UPP and resorting to all intrigues to annihilate the progressive forces and, at the same time, trying to deliberately bar them from advancing into the NA.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative puppet group is making desperate efforts to create a situation favorable for the conservative forces' stay in power before the \"presidential election\" this year, availing themselves of this opportunity, by stifling progressive forces and blocking the solidarity among the opposition parties.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is nonsensical that the puppet group is branding persons of progressive forces as \"red men\", insisting that they had \"contact with the north\" and \"received the north's instruction\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group's fascist suppression is a most base politically-motivated killing, unprecedented in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than such pro-U.S. lackeys, anti-reunification confrontation maniacs, fascists and chief culprits of scandals as the group of the \"Saenuri Party\" that should be eliminated from the NA.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The people from all walks of life in south Korea should heighten vigilance against the puppet conservative group's intrigues and fascist repression of the progressive forces, strongly oppose and denounce them, check and frustrate its attempt to stay in power and certainly bring about a new politics and new world with their concerted efforts."

Over 10,000 drafted Koreans were forced to fight against the U.S. army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This brought to light another segment of the crimes the Japanese imperialists committed against the Korean people last century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"Okinawa murder case\" was an atrocity committed by brutes without an equal to exterminate the Korean nation and the most hideous crime against humanity that can hardly be found in the history of the imperialists' aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already known to the world, tens of thousands of innocent people lost their lives during the U.S. army's landing on Okinawa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Human scum of political circles including the emperor's family and the military used Koreans as \"human shields\" to save their dirty lives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not content with this, the Japanese imperialists, brutal vampire, forced the Koreans to carry explosives on their backs, pushing them to death.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There are anecdotes in history that slaves were forced to fight with swords and shields in battles. However, the world knows no such barbarians as the Japanese imperialists who offered Koreans \"as sacrifice\" in battles in a bid to prolong their remaining days in the wake of depriving the Korean nation of its national rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese imperialists, to avenge their defeat, exploded \"Ukishima-maru\" and buried at sea en masse the drafted Koreans who were working at a factory of the Mitsubishi Heavy Industry Company. This was a height of their moves to exterminate the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This clearly proves once again that Japan is the sworn enemy of Koreans with whom they can never live under the same sky.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is more enraging is that the Japanese reactionaries are marking desperate efforts to bury their massacre into oblivion of history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They have put all sorts of unreasonable pressure on a documentary film producer who disclosed the said fact and concealed the truth for two decades since the commander of the defense corps made the testimony.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Japanese imperialists against Koreans are so tremendous that the Japanese reactionaries can hardly cover up their past blood-stained history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Still resounding through mountains and rivers are the outcries made by those who were mercilessly killed in Japan, island country, at the hands of the Japanese imperialists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With nothing can Japan hide its crime-woven past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese government should honestly apologize for its past crimes and make reparations for them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will certainly force Japan to pay thousand-fold prices for all damage it inflicted upon Koreans and the DPRK."
