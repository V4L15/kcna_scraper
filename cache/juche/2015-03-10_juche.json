Pursuant to her order, the puppet group is busy holding a security meeting, etc. to kick off a racket of investigation after labeling the attack as a \"deed of a follower of the north.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Presidential Chief of Staff Ri Pyong Gi undisguisedly revealed his sinister design to link the case with the DPRK, crying out for \"taking a decisive measure\" against \"the forces denying constitutional value\", \"making a strict investigation into the case\" and \"clarifying as to whether there were wire-pullers or not\" and the like. Those of the \"Saenuri Party\" are becoming increasingly vocal terming the case a \"terrible one that targeted the heart of the south Korea-U.S. alliance\" and \"a deed of a follower of the north.\" They even talked about \"the case's ideological linkage with the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is part of moves of the puppet group to distract attention from the shame it experienced in international eyes, wipe out the pro-reunification patriotic forces and intensify its anti-DPRK conspiratorial racket in the international arena. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As claimed by the attacker, his deed was an eruption of his protest and indignation against Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military drills now underway by the south Korean puppet group in league with its U.S. master.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As far as U.S. Ambassador Lippert is concerned, he is no more than a bellicose element that has been keen on conspiratorial smear campaign against the DPRK since he took an important post at the Defense Department, asserting missiles of the DPRK and its \"programme for developing WMDs\" are posing a \"serious and direct threat\" to the U.S. allies in the region and the U.S. territory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Earlier this year shortly after his appointment as U.S. ambassador to south Korea, he appeared at a reception hosted by the U.S.-south Korea lawmakers' diplomatic council in Seoul. There, he talked such rubbish that \"the DPRK will be unable to simultaneously push forward two fronts,\" urging it to make one of the two \"choices\" -- \"abandoning its policy of simultaneously developing two fronts\" or \"getting exposed to severer sanctions.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At a meeting later, he talked such invectives that \"the north can never pursue its prosperity and security as long as it has nukes.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No wonder, such a guy was attacked as he worked hard to realize the sinister design to stifle the DPRK and spoil the north-south relations at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities' move to escalate the north-south confrontation by taking advantage of the above-said case is as foolish an act as digging up their own graves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Conspiratorial smear campaign is no more than the last-ditch effort of those facing a crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative group of south Korea should not run riot, facing up to the situation."

This is pursuant to the U.S. aggressive pivot to Asia-Pacific strategy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. seeks to tighten its control over the south Korean puppet forces through the joint war drills and use them as cannon fodder for encircling and containing countries in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What the U.S. wants is not peace as evidenced by its policy of showdown and war with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t So, it does not stand to reason to have dialogue with the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The opportunity for negotiated settlement between the DPRK and the U.S. has already been scuppered and military conflict has become unavoidable, the only issue that remains pending.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality urges the DPRK to further bolster up its war deterrent to cope with the U.S. military invasion getting highly possible. There is no other way for the former.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson says the U.S. imperialists and the puppet forces are scheming to pressurize and browbeat the service personnel and people of the DPRK through the demonstration of their strength in the massive drills but such saber-rattling will only precipitate their final destruction."

Tal crimen de esclavitud sexual del viejo ejercito japones es el antietico de gran tamano sin precedente en la historia de la humanidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA pesar de esto, Japon niega el mismo crimen de esclavitud sexual diciendo que no hay pruebas correctas para comprobarlo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi  pone al desnudo por si mismo su propia bajeza moral.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl crimen antietico de gran tamano cometido por el viejo ejercito japones nunca desaparecera aunque lo niegue y transcurra el tiempo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapon debe conocer exactamente que la disculpa y la indemnizacion por el respecto son el inevitable deber juridico y moral."
