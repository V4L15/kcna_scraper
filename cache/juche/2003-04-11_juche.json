            "content": "KCNA terms S. Korean \"National Assembly\" political waiting maid of U.S. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 10 (KCNA) -- The South Korean \"National Assembly\" reportedly decided on April 4 to recommend the authorities to fully examine the sanctions to be applied against the DPRK, talking about a solution to the \"nuclear issue.\"\r\n Earlier, the authorities and the \"National Assembly\" decided to dispatch troops to the Iraqi war of aggression launched by the U.S. in disregard of international law and the UN. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They did so under the pretext that they can solve the DPRK's \"nuclear issue\" in a peaceful way by currying favor with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These facts clearly indicate that the South Korean \"National Assembly\" is a group of warmongers keen on isolating and stifling the DPRK, pursuant to the U.S. strategy for world domination aimed to bring down one by one those sovereign states it had listed as part of an \"axis of evil\", its hostile policy toward the DPRK in particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reckless actions on the part of the authorities and \"National Assembly\" of South Korea are acts of treachery to the nation as they may bring a disastrous nuclear holocaust to the Korean nation. This is intolerable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Explicitly speaking, the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula surfaced because the U.S. posed a nuclear threat to the DPRK after massively deploying and stockpiling nuclear weapons in and around South Korea for the last more than half a century in line with its hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pursuant to the U.S. nuclear strategy, South Korea has turned into the biggest nuclear arsenal in the Far East as it has more than 1,000 nuclear weapons, a nuclear advance base for implementing the U.S. strategy to dominate Asia and the Korean Peninsula remains the world's most dangerous nuclear hotspot. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This goes to clearly prove that the U.S. moves to stifle the DPRK with nukes must be stopped and the nuclear weapons deployed in South Korea must be dismantled if the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula is to be settled. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This notwithstanding, the South Korean \"National Assembly\", while keeping mum about this, called for applying sanctions against the DPRK, talking about the settlement of the DPRK's \"nuclear issue.\" this can not be construed otherwise than a hideous crime as they are keen to stifle the DPRK echoing the U.S. gangster-like assertion for the DPRK's disarming in a bid to meet their sinister political aim and interests in utter disregard of the nation's destiny. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. demand for the DPRK's scrapping of its \"nuclear weapons program before dialogue\" would lead to inspection and the resultant disarmament spark a war. The only way of averting a war is to increase one's own just self-defensive means. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Iraqi war launched by the U.S. preemptive attack clearly proves that a war can be prevented and the security of the country and the nation can be ensured only when one has physical deterrent force, a military deterrent force strong enough to decisively repel any attack of the enemy with any types of sophisticated weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. launches a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula, all the Koreans in the north and the south will suffer from it and the Korean nation will be exterminated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the South Korean authorities and its \"National Assembly\" are truly concerned about the destiny of the nation, it should remain true to the June 15 joint declaration and opt for inter-Korean cooperation for the survival of the nation, instead of cooperating with outsiders.    \r\n\r\n"

Worse still, the Japanese conservatives say that in case \"North Korea is going to launch missiles to Japan\", it would not be a breach of the constitution to make an preemptive attack on the missile launching sites and that a war with North Korea would not be ruled out. They also say that before Japan is submerged in flames, it is necessary to make a preemptive attack on North Korea with the help of the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their remarks indicate that they want to repeat the holocaust Japan inflicted on Korea in the past, and establish the \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will never forget all crimes of the blackest dye committed by Japan during more than 40 years of its military occupation of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The indiscreet behavior of Japan, which still regards the DPRK as \"enemy\" and refrains from the settlement of the past wrongdoings, waiting for a chance to reinvade Korea, only heightens the vigilance of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to behave itself with a correct understanding of the situation.    \r\n\r\n"
