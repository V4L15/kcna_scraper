In the 1950s the U.S. imperialists perpetrated a surprise armed invasion against the young DPRK by mobilizing the Syngman Rhee puppet clique and even mercenaries of satellite countries. However, the aggressors suffered a miserable defeat in face of the heroic struggle waged by the army and the people of the DPRK all out in the sacred war of justice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. armed spy ship Pueblo incident and large spy plane EC-121 incident which took place against the backdrop of ceaseless military provocations of warmongers in the post-war period ended in the surrender of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the 1990s the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces worked hard to ignite a war against the DPRK while talking about unreasonable \"nuclear inspection\". But the enemies were hard hit by the DPRK's solemn proclamation of a semi-war state and its statement declaring the withdrawal from the NPT.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Much upset by this, the U.S. signed the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework and the U.S. president sent even a message of assurances to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has turned into a country manufacturing and launching satellites and a political and military power possessed of nuclear deterrent. It includes a high level of smaller, light and diverse A-bombs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Oblivious of the historic lesson, the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces are seeking to ignite a war against the DPRK again. This, however, will lead to a final destruction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is sadly mistaken if it feels easy as it is situated across the ocean. The sacred war for the country's reunification to be waged by the army and the people of the DPRK will be quite different from the Korean war fought in the 1950s.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces would be well advised to clearly understand that their on-going war maneuvers are as foolish actions as repeating the history of their disgraceful defeat."

The Korean people, however, steadily advanced the revolution and construction, each holding a rifle in one hand and a hammer or sickle in the other, true to the Workers' Party of Korea's line of simultaneously pushing forward economic construction and defence upbuilding.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the wake of the demise of the Cold War in the 1990s and the upsetting of balance of forces, the upbeat U.S. imperialists stepped up the sanctions and blockade campaign against the DPRK, fortress of socialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But, the enemies were utterly ignorant of the Korean people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was the revolutionary will of the Korean people that they could never abandon their faith even though they might collapse because of hunger.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The imperialists are foolish enough to calculate that the Korean people would yield to their sanctions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will neither recognize all the \"resolutions on sanctions\" unjustly adopted at the UN Security Council nor make any switchover in its option.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists and their followers had better stop their rash acts.
