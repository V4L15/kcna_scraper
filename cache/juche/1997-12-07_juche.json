General Assembly Session on dissolution of the 'U.N. Command'  and withdrawal of all foreign troops from South Korea\".\r\n   The chief of the Milano branch of the Italian committee for reunification and peace of Korea said in his speech that the U.S. troops present in South Korea are the very one who aggravates the tension on the Korean peninsula and obstructs its peaceful reunification.\r\n   He declared that they would use every possible opportunity and means to intensify the solidarity movement so that the resolution of the 30th U.N. General Assembly Session could be implemented at an early date.    \r\n\r\n"

Korea\r\n  Pyongyang, December 7 (KCNA) -- South Korean Prime Minister Ko Kon showed up at the defence postgraduate school on December 3 and made an address in which he cried that \"leftist forces\" sympathising with the north's line are seeking to \"divide public opinion and neutralize government power.\"\r\n   Commenting on his outbursts, a news analyst of Rodong Sinmun today says:\r\n   This is part of the desperate efforts of the South Korean puppets to save the shaking \"civilian\"-veiled fascist regime from the crisis by emasculating pro-reunification, pro-democracy  patriotic forces under the pretext of rooting out \"pro-communist leftist forces\".\r\n   Their outcries over \"following the north\" and over \"pro-communism and enemy-benefiting acts\" are nothing but a brigandish sophism to find a pretext to crack down upon the movement of South Korean people for independence, reunification and democracy.\r\n   Whenever they were thrown into the crisis, the successive rulers of South Korea clamoured about liquidating \"leftist pro-communist forces\" in a bid to bring the situation under control.\r\n   Isolated within and without, Kim Young Sam is on the verge of ruin at a time when \"Presidential election\" is at hand. Urged by the desire to escape from this, he is intensifying the anti-DPRK policy of confrontation and war and the crackdown upon the patriotic forces by linking them with the DPRK.\r\n   However, this is a foolish attempt.    \r\n\r\n"
