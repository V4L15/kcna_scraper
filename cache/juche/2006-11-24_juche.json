If the present \"government\" continues backing the U.S. in the above-said hostile policy, it is bound to face the nation's punishment, it warned.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Koreans Called upon to Support Great Songun Politics \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, November 23 (KCNA) -- The stirring reality today eloquently proves that the Songun politics serves as an invincible treasured sword and a great banner for coping with the imperialists' aggression and war and displaying the dignity and the honor of the nation. All Koreans are called upon to support the Songun politics irrespective of ideology, political view and ism. The Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland declares this in an appeal to all the Koreans at home and abroad issued Thursday.\r\n It is the shining fruition of the Songun politics that the DPRK proudly ranked itself among the nuclear weapons states, startling the world, the appeal notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK had access to nuclear deterrent, drawing a bitter lesson from the painful history of the nation and the present reality. It was a self-defensive measure to defend itself in this unjust world and a proper message to the U.S. imperialists posing a threat of aggression to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Different parts of the world are torn with wars and disputes due to the U.S. arbitrary practices but peace is firmly preserved on the Korean Peninsula. This reality clearly proves the DPRK was quite right when it decided to increase the national capacity for self-defence, tightening belts under the uplifted banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is thanks to the Songun politics that the Korean nation is known as the most proud and dignified nation in the world and peace and security of the nation are fully guaranteed on the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun politics is the great politics protecting the destiny of the Korean nation and safeguarding the peace of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But for the Songun politics, peace would not have been preserved on the peninsula for the last more than half a century nor the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration would have been recorded in the history of the Korean nation nor the present era of \"By our nation itself\" would have come. Thanks to this politics, there started the tour of Mt. Kumgang and the construction of the Kaesong Industrial Zone and the fellow countrymen have dreams and laughter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The stand and attitude toward the Songun politics is a touchstone to distinguish patriots from traitors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whoever has the blood and soul of the Korean nation, be he or she in the north or the south or overseas, is called upon to single-mindedly uphold the Songun politics in token of most ardent patriotism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The appeal calls on all the fellow countrymen in the north, the south and overseas to bravely come out in the struggle to frustrate the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK and the former's sanctions and blockade against the latter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It calls for a more dynamic struggle to foil the war exercises of the U.S. and south Korean bellicose forces against the DPRK and their arms buildup and put an end to the U.S. policy of military presence in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The appeal urges the south Korean people to shatter the \"Grand National Party's\" wild ambition to return to power, throw overboard all the traitors to the nation and unite closer in the idea of \"By our nation itself\" enshrined in the historic June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It calls on all Koreans in the north and the south and overseas to vigorously step up the grand national march to bring about independence and peace, reunification and prosperity under the banner of Songun.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
