It will surely make the u.s. pay for such impudent behavior intended to infringe upon its dignity and sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. wants dialogue with the DPRK, it should approach the dialogue on a fair and equal basis and make a political decision to renounce its hostile policy toward the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

In 2000 it conducted more than 50 large-scale military drills in this region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To carry out its Asia strategy the U.S. is sticking to its military strategy toward Korea in a bid to start a new Korean war, first of all, and put the whole of Korea under its military control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. hawkish elements have derailed the process of inter-Korean reconciliation and detente on the Korean peninsula and persistently pursued its policy to stifle the DPRK after defining the DPRK as its \"principal enemy.\" This is increasing the danger of war on the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they ignite the second Korean war, none of the aggressors will be able to go back home alive.    \r\n\r\n"
