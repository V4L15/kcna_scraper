It will surely make the u.s. pay for such impudent behavior intended to infringe upon its dignity and sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. wants dialogue with the DPRK, it should approach the dialogue on a fair and equal basis and make a political decision to renounce its hostile policy toward the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
