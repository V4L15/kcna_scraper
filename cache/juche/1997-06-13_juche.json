The Japanese authorities, currying favor with the U.S., do not dare complain of even what is harmful to the interests of the Japanese people and the security of the country and let the U.S. do what it wants.\r\n   Their position on the \"four-way talks\" and the \"suspected kidnapping of a Japanese girl\" offers a clear glimpse of Japan's sycophantic diplomacy.\r\n   As Japan has nothing to do with the \"four-way talks\", it has no ground to poke its nose into the matter. But it favors the U.S., raising the matter as a condition for the progress in DPRK-Japan ties.\r\n   Japan sees the south Korean puppets' face and acts as intended by them in dealing with the DPRK. It is really disgraceful.\r\n   Indeed, Japan lacks its own principle and independence.\r\n   How can such a country be put on a responsible post of the United Nations?\r\n   Japan should reshape the dependent diplomacy instead of coveting a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. \r\n   \r\n \r\n"

Now, they are vociferating about \"possible provocation by the north\", alleging that \"the food crisis in the north is insignificant\".\r\n   What they seek in this is to prevent the international community from giving humanitarian food aid to the DPRK, further aggravate the inter-Korean confrontation under the patronage of the United States and use the food shortage in the north as a chance to slander its ideology and system.\r\n   We cannot but feel a bitter hatred for the south Korean puppets who are obstructing even the humanitarian aid from the international community, bringing pains to the hearts of the fellow countrymen who are suffering from natural disasters.\r\n   If anyone conspires with the south Korean puppets in their despicable move and dances to their tune, it will be branded as another unethical act in history. \r\n\r\n"
