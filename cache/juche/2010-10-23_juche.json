            "content": "KCNA Blasts US Anti-DPRK Nuclear Policy \r\nPyongyang, October 23 (KCNA) -- It was recently confirmed through declassified documents of the U.S. Administration that the U.S. has persistently examined and planned the use of nuclear weapons against the DPRK for more than half a century, i.e. up to the present Obama Administration since the 1950s.\n\t\t\t\t\t The documents glaringly reveal the root cause of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and the arch criminal posing a nuclear threat to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to them, the U.S. brought nuclear weapons into the Korean front in mid-August 1950 right after its start of the Korean war. Whenever it was driven to a tight corner militarily and politically during the whole period of the war, it examined the use of nuclear weapons. It conducted several exercises under the simulated conditions of the operations to drop nuclear bombs in the northern half of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The successive U.S. presidents including Truman and military brasshats including MacArthur and Schlesinger let loose a string of outbursts threatening to use nukes against the then non-nuclear state DPRK. During the period of the Korean war Truman blustered that the U.S. was actively examining the use of nuclear weapons against the DPRK all the time. And U.S. high-ranking officials had threatened to use nukes against the DPRK on six occasions since 1976, counting only those disclosed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The three services of the U.S. forces have vied with each other to play a leading role in mounting a nuclear attack on the DPRK. The period since the 1950s witnessed the working out and updating of a series of nuclear war plans including \"OPLAN 8-53\" and \"OPLAN 5027.\" Exercises have been staged under these scenarios. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. nuclear threat was a wanton and brazen-faced violation of international law, a total departure from its obligation as a state assigned to custody of the Non-Proliferation Treaty not to pose a nuclear threat to non-nuclear states.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The NPT has failed to clear the DPRK of the U.S. persistent nuclear threat but has been misused by the U.S. as a means for stifling the DPRK with nukes. This compelled the DPRK to pull out of the NPT and have access to nuclear deterrent legitimately in order to protect the sovereignty and security of the country and the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As seen above, the root cause of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula lies in that a belligerent party possessed of nuclear weapons has posed constant undisguised nuclear threat to the other non-nuclear belligerent party. And the U.S. is the chief culprit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. remains unchanged in its ambition to preempt a nuclear attack on the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the Nuclear Posture Review published this April the Obama Administration did not hesitate to adopt the preemptive use of nuclear weapons against the DPRK as its policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was entirely thanks to the DPRK which has countered the U.S. blatant nuclear threat with a just measure for having access to nuclear deterrent that the nuclear imbalance on the Korean Peninsula was put to an end and the danger of a nuclear war drastically reduced. The DPRK's nuclear deterrent serves as a treasured sword for defending the peace and security of Northeast Asia and the DPRK was entirely right when it opted for having access to nukes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and its followers have claimed that the nuclear issue was spawned on the Korean Peninsula and no solution has been found to it due to the \"nuclear threat\" of the DPRK. It is the universally accepted understanding of the world community that this propaganda is a sheer fabrication and the DPRK was quite right and appropriate when it decided to have access to nuclear deterrence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t American and Japanese experts on international issues said that the experts on the Korean issue generally admit the assertion made by the DPRK that it developed nuclear weapons as a defensive means to cope with the U.S. deployment of nuclear weapons in south Korea, noting that the U.S. option for nuclear attack provides the DPRK with a pretext for developing, acquiring and possessing nuclear weapons. This is by no means accidental.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. would be well advised to stop the anti-DPRK nuclear racket based on lies and hypocrisy and take fundamental measures to settle the nuclear issue on the peninsula."

Tambien, en el periodo posterior al ano 1976, los altos funcionarios de EE.UU. amenazaron 6 veces a la RPDC con usar las armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   En su competencia para cumplir el papel protagonico en el golpe nuclear contra la RPDC, las fuerzas terrestres, navales y aereas de EE.UU. elaboraron, renovaron y ejercitaron por separado desde la decada de 1950 hasta la fecha los planes de guerra nuclear como \"OPLAN 8-53\", \"Freedom Dravvy\" y \"OPLAN 5027\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La amenaza nuclear de EE.UU. devino una flagrante y cinica violacion de la ley internacional porque como signatario del Tratado de No Proliferacion Nuclear tiene la obligacion de no amenazar con armas nucleares a los Estados desnuclearizados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Puesto que ese tratado no elimina la permanente amenaza nuclear de EE.UU. y fue usado por este como espacio para aplastar con armas nucleares a Corea, esta procuro el disuasivo nuclear retirandose justamente del tratado para defender la soberania y la seguridad del pais y la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Como se ve, la causa del problema nuclear de la Peninsula Coreana reside en que una parte beligerante portadora de armas nucleares no ceso de ejercer abiertamente la amenaza nuclear a la otra parte desnuclearizada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Tanto ayer como hoy sigue invariable la ambicion de EE.UU. de atacar con esos artefactos a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En el \"informe de revision del estado nuclear\" publicado en abril de este ano, la administracion Obama definio abiertamente como su politica el uso preventivo de armas nucleares contra la  RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Si la RPDC hubiera cifrado su esperanza solo en el dialogo o la ley internacional ante la recrudescente amenaza de guerra nuclear de EE.UU., ya habria estallado esta guerra en la Peninsula Coreana  y la nacion coreana y la region del Nordeste Asiatico habrian sufrido inevitablemente los desastres nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ya que la RPDC poseyo el justo disuasivo nuclear haciendo frente a la brutal amenaza nuclear de EE.UU., se rompio el estado desequilibrado nuclear y se disminuyo considerablemente el peligro de guerra en la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por lo tanto, el disuasivo nuclear de la RPDC deviene el medio omnipotente para preservar la paz y la seguridad del Nordeste Asiatico y la posesion del mismo fue la opcion mil veces justa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Hoy dia, la sociedad internacional reconoce que es un invento de punta a cabo la propaganda de EE.UU. y sus fuerzas satelites de que el problema nuclear de la Peninsula Coreana fue generado y sigue pendiente por la \"amenaza nuclear\" de Corea y que es muy justa la posesion del disuasivo nuclear de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Los especialistas en el problema coreano admiten en general el argumento de la RPDC de que esta desarrollo sus artefactos nucleares como medio defensivo frente al emplazamiento de armas nucleares norteamericanas en el Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  No por casualidad, el norteamericano Selig Harrison y el japones Yoshiki Mine, especialistas en asuntos internacionales, dijeron que es cierto que la opcion de ataque nuclear de EE.UU. \"da al Norte de Corea el pretexto de desarrollo, adquisicion y posesion de armas nucleares\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  EE.UU. debe abandonar sus enganosos y fraudulentos alborotos nucleares contra la RPDC y tomar las medidas fundamentales para la solucion del problema nuclear de la Peninsula Coreana."
