Among them were Egyptian and Lebanese presidents, the Libyan head of state, the Zimbabwean speaker of Parliament, the general secretaries of Maltese, Indian and Peruvian communist parties, the Secretary General of the Pakistan People's Party and the National Secretary of the Socialist Workers' Party of the United States.\r\n   Meetings for opening and closing the month of solidarity, photo exhibitions, film shows, seminars and other solidarity events were held in 60 odd countries and over 500 solidarity actions such as broadcasting, special writeups, statements and press statements and letters were taken. \r\n   The events and actions were unanimous in highly praising the immortal feats of the President Kim Il Sung who defeated the allied forces of imperialism including the United States which boasted of being the \"strongest\" in the world, and led the Fatherland Liberation War to victory. \r\n   They stressed that under the wise leadership of Secretary Kim Jong Il, socialist Korea will advance even though the united states is persistently trying to isolate and stifle Korea.\r\n   Expressing the belief that Korea will surely be reunified according to his intention, they held that the United States should respond to the DPRK proposal for establishing a new peace-keeping mechanism on the Korean Peninsula which will replace the outdated armistice system.\r\n   Messages and letters of solidarity and greetings to Secretary Kim Jong Il were adopted at the meetings.    \r\n\r\n"

This is a foolish act for fleeing from the responsibility for the aggravated situation of the Korean Peninsula.\r\n   Rodong Sinmun said this in a commentary today.\r\n   Synchronizing with the preliminary talks for \"four-way talks\", the U.S. House Committee of International Relations adopted a resolution concerning the Korean issue. The resolution said a lasting settlement of the Korean Peninsular issue is impossible unless the north and the south have one-to-one dialogue without others' mediation, the daily says, and continues:\r\n   Having dialogue with the south Korean puppets, who are seeking a way out of the ruling crisis in north-south confrontation, means killing time. Nothing can be resolved through such dialogue.\r\n   Admittedly, as long as the U.S. troops are kept in south Korea and the U.S. continues trying to stifle the DPRK by force of arms, inter-Korean relations can never be improved nor can peace be ensured in the Peninsula.\r\n   The U.S. should discharge its obligation for the settlement of the Korean issue, instead of calling for inter-Korean dialogue.    \r\n\r\n"
