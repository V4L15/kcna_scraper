            "content": "U.S. Ambition for World Domination Blasted \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 6 (KCNA) -- The U.S. newspaper Defense News said that the U.S. Department of Defense is now working out scores of new \"war plan scenarios\". According to it, the scenarios simulate \"contingency\" in independent countries and developing countries and envisage the worldwide expansion of the \"anti-terror war\".\r\n Commenting on this, a signed article of Rodong Sinmun today says that it is the invariable U.S. ambition to make preemptive attacks on anti-imperialist independent and progressive countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The simulated \"collapse of the regime which is possessed of nuclear weapons\" noteworthy in the scenarios clearly refers to the DPRK, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose forces listed the DPRK as a part of \"axes of evil\" and have worked up adventurous war scenarios to achieve their ambition for invasion of the north and are hell bent on the moves to stifle it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Never should it go unnoticed that the U.S. Department of Defense is testing the feasibility of the scenarios. As already disclosed, the U.S. troops made a sortie of planes from the U.S. military bases in Japan to commit test bombings based on the simulated Korean war twice a day during the Iraqi war according to Korean war scenarios. Special service units of the U.S. task force launched actual maneuvers in south Korea. Some days ago, it was disclosed that the U.S. warlike forces have already worked out in top secret a war scenario for invasion of the north to use 30 nuclear weapons in \"contingency\" in the Korean Peninsula and committed the exercise of dropping mock warheads. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n. The world peace-loving people should heighten vigilance against the U.S. new \"war scenarios\" and wage an active struggle against the U.S. aggression and war moves as the U.S. is leaving no stones unturned to achieve its ambition for aggression.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is little short of an official declaration that they will not withdraw the theory of the \"principal enemy\". The notion of \"substantial military threat\" they have decided to use externally instead of the \"principal enemy\" is also, in essence, nothing but another conception of the \"principal enemy\" which regards the north as the \"main enemy\", the information bulletin noted, and said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When all the fellow countrymen are ardently desiring to open up a new phase of independent reunification under the flag of cooperation for national independence, for peace against war and for reunification and patriotism, the south Korean authorities are seeking to keep the anachronistic notion of \"principal enemy\" which is different only in expression. This is an act of overtly going against the trend of the national history toward reconciliation and reunification as well as an intolerable challenge to the north.\r\n Their wrong stand toward the phraseology \"principal enemy\" clearly shows that they are still playing a double game with a dagger concealed under their clothes, though they are outwardly talking about \"reconciliation and cooperation\" and \"implementation of the June 15 joint declaration\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the south Korean authorities truly hope for improved north-south relations and have a willingness to implement the joint declaration, they should discard the theory of \"principal enemy\" against the north.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun Saturday says this in a signed article.\r\n Recalling that scores of acts are now in force in the U.S. for economic sanctions and blockade against the DPRK, the article refers to the historical fact that the former has intensified economic sanctions and blockade against the latter after listing it as \"an enemy state\" after its liberation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. economic sanctions aimed to isolate and suffocate the DPRK and bring it to its knees has become graver and more vicious in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits attention is that the U.S. imperialists are working hard to internationalize the economic sanctions and blockade against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. worked out the strategy of \"international siege\" to the DPRK involving the ban on remittance, actions to intercept and seize ships and planes and naval blockade and has entered the phase of its implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. strategy of blockade against the DPRK is aimed to drive the DPRK into greater economic difficulties and, furthermore, bring the DPRK under its control by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While persisting in its economic sanctions against the DPRK, the U.S. calculates that \"north Korea would not stand the protracted economic sanctions applied by the international community\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This only betrays the U.S. utter ignorance of the DPRK. The U.S. economic sanctions may impede the economic development in the DPRK to a certain extent. But such despicable method will get the U.S. nowhere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people have victoriously advanced the revolution and construction and increased the economic and military potentials of the country despite scores of years-long harsh economic sanctions and blockade of the U.S. imperialists and other imperialist reactionaries.

This provocative act is arousing deep apprehension among people at home and abroad who wish peace and reunification on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hostility toward fellow countrymen will bring nothing but national disaster and ruin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should have a correct view on their fellow countrymen and a will for reunification and throw away the criminal \"white paper for national defence\" into the dumping ground as it only gets on the nerves of the dialogue partner.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean Ultra-Right Wing Conservatives' Intrigue to Grab \"Power\"�@Assailed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 5 (KCNA) -- The south Korean judicial authorities recently staged trials against lawmakers one after another in a bid to upset\r\nthe balance of forces in the present south Korean National Assembly in which the ruling party holds the majority and the opposition party the minority.\r\n Commenting on this, a news analyst of Minju Joson today says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the NA turns into one in which the Grand National Party and other ultra-right wing conservatives following the U.S. against the nation hold the majority, the inter-Korean relations, no doubt, may be turned back to the state of confrontation which was before the publication of the June 15 joint declaration and fire clouds of a new war, a nuclear war, would hang over in the way of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The trials reflect the intention of the U.S., an actual ruler over south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is egging the south Korean judicial authorities on to stage the trials to remove the progressive reform forces from the 17th National Assembly. It is the ulterior intention of the United States to remove lawmakers from the Uri Party and the Democratic Workers' Party through the trials and create favorable conditions for the GNP clan dreaming of the ruling party to seize power. The trials by the U.S. scenario and control are, in fact, a political coup. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the south Korean political parties, factions and people of all strata should further intensify their struggle to resolutely foil the criminal U.S. moves to remove the progressive reform forces from the NA and ostracize the pro-American ultra-right wing conservative forces including the GNP which is seeking to grasp power with the U.S. backing.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
