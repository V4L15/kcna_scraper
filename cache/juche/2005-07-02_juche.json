And he openly vindicated the visits to the Yasukuni Shrine by the chief executive and other politicians of Japan.\r\n In this regard, Rodong Sinmun Friday in a signed article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The International Far Eastern Military Tribunal judged the war crimes perpetrated by the Japanese imperialists after starting the Pacific war according to the articles of the then international law and took relevant measures to punish them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the Japanese reactionaries are now perpetrating such reckless acts as asserting that even the international tribunal which judged the Japanese imperialists' war crimes was an \"illegal one\", not content with their denial and distortion of their past history of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is little short of rubbing salt on the wounds of the Asians who suffered immeasurable misfortune and disasters due to the Japanese imperialists as it is a challenge to justice and human conscience and a move to reverse the trend of history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' reckless remarks terming the above-said tribunal an \"illegal one\" are nothing but an open reinvasion agitation by those steeped in the militarist idea of aggression to the marrow of their bones. By negating the criminal nature of the past war of aggression, painting the war criminals as \"patriotic martyrs\" and paying tribute to them the reactionaries seek to instill the militarist idea of aggression into the Japanese and lay the ideological and political foundation for reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aggressive nature of Japanese militarism still remains unchanged. Japan has sped up the military preparations for reinvasion for the last several decades since its defeat and thus emerged a dangerous war force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the deliberate and premeditated moves for reinvasion for the Japanese reactionaries to have sparked territorial disputes with their neighboring countries including their claim to Tok Islet, part of the inviolable territory of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They would be well advised to properly understand the highly vigilant Asians and discontinue their reckless moves for reinvasion.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is working hard to provoke a new war in a bid to impose a nuclear disaster upon the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is an intolerable mockery of and challenge to the Korean nation and a blatant affront to justice and conscience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Neither advice nor reasoning would work on an aggressor or a burglar. There should be only a strong counter-action to defend national dignity and sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any massacre has become the target of international severe punishment and, accordingly, the last group of Nazi war criminals who had remained in hiding are now judged by human conscience. It is, therefore, a shame and disgrace to the Koreans if they allow the U.S. imperialists to go scot-free as they have committed atrocities more monstrous than what those criminals had perpetrated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people from all walks of life should turn out in the dynamic anti-U.S. struggle to force the U.S. imperialists to pay for all the thrice-cursed crimes committed against the Korean nation and drive their aggressor forces, the source of a nuclear war and its misfortune and pain, out of south Korea under the uplifted slogan \"Let us not allow the U.S. forces' presence in south Korea to go beyond 60 years.\"    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
