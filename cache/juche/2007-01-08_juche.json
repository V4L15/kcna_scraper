            "content": "General Offensive for Building Socialist Economic Power Called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 7 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Sunday in a signed article calls for waging a vigorous general offensive for building a socialist economic power, holding aloft the slogan of self-reliance.\r\n Self-reliance has been a source of strength that helped build a strong self-supporting national economy on this land and remains an invariable mode of struggle in socialist economic construction, the article says, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It, first of all, is a steadfast revolutionary stand to settle all issues arising in the socialist economic construction by one's own efforts in a responsible manner under any circumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to independently solve any problem with one's own technology and resources, believing in one's own people on the principle of self-reliance. This is a sure guarantee for success in building a socialist economic power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Self-reliance serves as a mode of struggle in making a leaping advance in building an economic power despite of challenges and obstructions of the imperialists and reactionaries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to depend on the might of the single-mindedly united people and the tremendous potential of our self-supporting economy under the uplifted revolutionary banner of self-reliance. Herein lies the master key to frustrating the vicious sanctions and blockade of the imperialists and reactionaries and achieving a victory in the offensive for the building of an economic power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Self-reliance represents a traditional work style and an invariable mode of struggle for the building of the economic power which has been consistently maintained by the Workers' Party and people of the DPRK in the revolution and construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Self-reliance at present means relying on one's efforts on the basis of modern science and technology. Science and technology are a powerful engine for building a great prosperous powerful nation. Self-reliance based on modern science and technology alone can serve as a mode of struggle for the building of the economic power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The self-reliance practiced at present means self-reliance for ensuring profitability on a nation-wide scale. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said self-reliance is aimed at lightening the burden of the state and enabling the country and its people to substantially benefit from it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is nothing but an impudent act of political dwarfs, a reckless behavior of Japs keen on overseas expansion, oblivious of their responsibility for redressing Japan's past crimes. Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed commentary. It says:\r\n This island country has neither settled its past nor shaken off the ill-fame of a war criminal state. Yet, it is working hard to hold a responsible post at the UN. This is as ridiculous an act as behaving erratically, forgetful of where it stands. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is bereft of independence. It expresses its view on any issues arising in the international arena without its own viewpoint or judgement. It behaves without any principle, reading the face of its senior ally the U.S. before saying anything and echoing its utterances to please it. This is the mean diplomatic posture of the land of Japs. How can the international community allow such country to sit on the UNSC mandated to handle such important international issues as war and peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to bear in mind that the permanent membership of the UNSC is not the post which anyone can hold as one wishes and it is not something that can be sold or bought nor is it the post obtainable with the backing of a big country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is the proverb \"One may point at a star but not pull at it.\" Japs had better properly know where they stand and honestly reflect on and redress its crime-woven past before the Korean and other Asian peoples as demanded by the times and their mind-set in order to win trust of the international community.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
