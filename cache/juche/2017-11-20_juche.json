This has made him the criminal who is sentenced to death by the army and people of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those who challenge the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and its social system can never find their place to live under this sky. Rabid dog Trump will certainly be made to pay dearly for his hideous crime."
