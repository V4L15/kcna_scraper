At the conference it asserted that \"the situation in Iraq was safer than anticipated\" and \"Iraqis were in the mood of welcoming south Koreans.\"\r\n In this regard Minju Joson today says in a signed commentary: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nOn November 30, a few days after the press conference members of the south Korean \"Omu Electrical Company\" in Iraq were attacked by Iraqi resistance forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The attack on the members of the south Korean electrical company was gainsaying what was stated by \"national assemblymen\" at the \"press conference,\" the Iraqi people's bitterness towards south Korea is clearly evidenced by the fact that after the south Korean authorities' decision on the additional dispatch of combat forces to Iraq, a staff member of the south Korean \"embassy\" there was abducted by Iraqi resistance forces and it is deluged with threatening phone messages and letters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The account of the \"press conference\" held by the \"National Assembly\" fact-finding group of south Korea and the report presented by it are now rebuffed by public circles of south Korea for misrepresenting the reality in Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Not only the south Koreans but the Iraqis are opposed to south Korea's additional troop dispatch to Iraq. This dispatch is an act of infringing upon the dignity and sovereignty of the south Korean people and offering young south Koreans as bullet-shields for the U.S. imperialists.    \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

And its defense budget for the fiscal 2002 was 343 billion U.S. dollars, 33 billion dollars bigger than that. The defense budget for the fiscal 2003 ran into over 379 billion U.S. dollars. This is equivalent to 40 percent of the total amount of the world military expenditure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The strategic aim sought by the U.S. in its madcap arms buildup is to retain its military supremacy in a bid to stifle those anti-imperialist independent countries incurring its displeasure by means of military intervention, military terrorism and war, seize major areas of natural resources and military strategic importance, establish an American-style iron-fisted order in the world and thus build a unipolar world dominated by it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This U.S. arms build-up may spark the second worldwide arms race as this policy is bound to lead to arms buildup, military intervention and war of aggression.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In the following five years at least 236,360 hectares of crop fields have been rezoned across the country, bring tremendous changes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The over 150km-long canal tens of meters wide from Taegak-ri, Kaechon City, South Phyongan Province, to Lake Thaesong in Kangso District, Nampho City, is a monumental creation of eternal value built by the Korean army and people in the Songun era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On August 29, Juche 88 (1999) Jong Song Ok, the DPRK woman marathoner, carried away gold medal at the women's marathon race of the 7th International Athletic Championships held in Sevilla, Spain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Great was the stir created by the grand Gymnastic Display and Artistic Performance \"Arirang\" performed by over 100,000 persons that opened at May Day Stadium in Pyongyang on April 29, Juche 91 (2002). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In Juche 90 (2001) the world was aboil with \"Kim Jong Il Impact\" and \"Kim Jong Il Storm\". Kim Jong Il made a long journey of more than 50,000 ri in Russia from July 26 to August 18 that year to perform an immortal exploit peculiar in the histories of the DPRK-Russia relations and world politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These miracles of Songun Korea are, indeed, a great pride of our sun's nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
