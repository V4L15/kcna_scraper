This is the work style of the officials required by the Party, he added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He set forth the tasks to be carried out by the factory, pointing out that it is of great significance in developing the national economy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After making the rounds of the factories in Wonsan City, he expressed expectation and belief that the workers of the city would bring about a great leap forward on all fronts by displaying the same indomitable mental power as they displayed when building the Wonsan Youth Power Station."

It demands that the higher organs help the lower and the superiors assist their subordinates, that officials always go down to work sites to acquaint themselves deeply with the real state of affairs and find correct solutions to problems and that they fulfill revolutionary tasks by giving precedence to the political work, the work among people, and enlisting the conscious enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe President made it his lifelong motto from the early years of his revolutionary career that if one trusts people and relies on them one will always be victorious, but if one turns one's back on the people and is forsaken by them one will always suffer defeat.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the period of the hard-fought anti-Japanese armed struggle, the President made it an inviolable iron rule of a revolutionary to rely on the people, saying the guerrillas could not get on apart from the people just as fish cannot live out of water. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the rigorous period of the Fatherland Liberation War and postwar days, too, he broke through difficulties in the revolution, regarding the people as his teacher and heaven and sharing weal and woe with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNow the Chongsan-ri spirit and Chongsan-ri method are applied more thoroughly by General Secretary Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He has consistently maintained them as the traditional working method of the Workers' Party of Korea since the early days of his guidance to the Party work. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He called on the workers of Kangson in December last year to light the flame of a new revolutionary upsurge and entering this year he has been making an endless journey of field guidance to meet people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Wherever he visited, the people are giving rise to a fresh revolutionary upswing, full of confidence in victory and optimism, displaying their utmost mental power in building a great, prosperous and powerful nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the leadership of Kim Jong Il the Chongsan-ri spirit and Chongsan-ri method will last as a precious treasure for the victory of the Korean revolution in the Songun era."

El traidor Lee no podra evitar el destino mas pobre que el del traidor Kim Young Sam quien fue echado al basurero de la historia sin poder realizar ningun dialogo con el Norte durante todo el periodo de su mandato.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La realidad mostro claramente que Lee es el traidor, quien no puede vivir bajo el mismo cielo con la nacion, y que al dejarlo intacto, no se puede realizar la paz ni la reunificacion del pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La banda de Lee sera condenada al severo castigo de la historia y la nacion."
