Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 12 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary says that the nuclear issue of south Korea, which was recently hushed up by the International Atomic Energy Agency, should be made clear.\r\n The nuclear issue of south Korea is a deep-rooted and serious problem as it was sponsored by the authorities, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was not secret that the Yusin government made it as its policy to develop nuclear weapons in the 1960s-1970s and had secured technical forces and stepped up nuclear armament including the production and preservation of fissionable materials and nuclear war exercises. Scores of years have since passed. It was proved through the recently disclosed tests of nuclear materials that during the time south Korea pushed forward the development of nuclear weapons behind the screen of \"threat from the north\". Therefore, south Korea has presented itself as the force of nuclear threat which has the main features of nuclear armament including extraction of nuclear materials, production of nuclear bombs, the preservation of nuclear warhead vehicles and preparations for a nuclear war. This is the truth behind the south Korean nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its truth has not yet been made clear. But the IAEA tried to put an end to the issue despite the remaining objects of additional inspection to be made for three years, which cannot be overlooked. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is ridiculous that the south Korean authorities have shelved the stark nuclear issue and joined in the U.S. moves to stifle the DPRK, clamoring about the \"nuclear issue\" of the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the south Korean authorities are really interested in the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and the peaceful reunification of the country, they should not cover up their nuclear issue and join in the outside moves to stifle the north but make clear their nuclear issue and stop developing nuclear weapons at once. Were it not so, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, the improvement of inter-Korean relations and regional peace are unthinkable.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Earlier, Nakayama, minister of Education and Science of Japan, said at a local meeting, in regard to the deletion of the past crimes in the preceding history textbooks: It is very good that such words as \"comfort women\" for the Japanese army and forcible drafting have been curtailed.\r\n Commenting on such remarks of those who are bereft of reason, buoyed up by the fever of reinvasion, Minju Joson today denounces them as an intolerable mockery and insult to the Koreans and other Asian people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The news analyst continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Visit to the Yasukuni Shrine and distortion of the past history are all open praise and sympathy with the Japanese imperialists' crime-woven history of aggression. This clearly shows what a reckless phase the Japanese reactionaries' reinvasion ambition for militarist overseas expansion has reached. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This rash act of the Japanese reactionaries to repeat the past history of aggression is another unpardonable crime of hurting again the remaining bruise of mind of the Koreans and other Asian people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Japanese reactionaries don't cool down their fever for reinvasion but persist in military expansion overseas, they will be bound to face an irrevocable doom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should squarely look at the reality and come out to the settlement of their crime-woven past, discontinuing such reckless reinvasion moves as digging up their own graves. This is what Japan should do above anything else at present.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Trend of Independence Irresistible\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 11 (KCNA) -- Nothing can stem the trend of the international situation towards independence, says Rodong Sinmun Saturday in a signed article.\r\n Noting that the international situation this year is characterized by the intensified criminal moves of the U.S. imperialists to hold in check the historic advance of humankind for independence, progress and peace, the article recalls that the U.S. has focused its efforts on the reorganization and redeployment of its forces overseas in accordance with its strategy for world domination in the new century and the \"strategy for combating terrorism\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The redeployment of the U.S. forces overseas was mainly aimed to prepare and round off the multi-faceted military operation to escalate the \"war against terrorism\" worldwide. The U.S. applied diverse methods to this war involving military option, operation to realize regime change, economic sanctions, blockade and an operation to create confusion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year progressive humankind has vigorously advanced along the road of independence and peace despite vicious challenges and obstructions of international reactionary forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  This year the Iraqi resistance forces have ceaselessly staged military actions in various parts of the country to drive out the U.S. occupation forces and many countries shunned or opposed the U.S. \"war against terrorism,\" aware of its injustice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  What merits attention is that those countries which had dispatched troops to Iraq in support of the U.S. \"war against terrorism\" took measures to pull their forces from there one after another. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Europe, strongly reacting to the U.S. arbitrary practices and unilateralism, pushed ahead with the regional integration and put spurs to the building of a multi-polar world. The developing countries have dynamically advanced along the road of independent development in a bid to ensure the security and prosperity of the region by their concerted efforts despite the challenge of imperialists keen to realize the \"globalization.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis is evidenced by the establishment of the Council for Peace and Security of the African Union and the conclusion of a free trade agreement between the Southern Common Market and the Andes Community of Nations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has become a trend of the times that the world supports and follows the policy of attaching importance to the military affairs, the Songun politics, and applies it to building up self-defensive capability and augmenting the state power. This is a main review of the international situation this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Witnessing this trend, the world revolutionary people came to know well who is the enemy of independence and peace and what they should do to defend the destiny of their countries and nations and accelerate the process of global independence. They are called upon to unite as one to decisively frustrate the U.S. imperialists' high-handed practices, unilateral policy and their \"strategy for war against terrorism\" and take the initiative to foil whatever moves for aggression by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year the DPRK has reacted to the U.S. imperialists' reckless war moves and pressure with its strong self-defensive measures, thus demonstrating the mettle and might of the country pursuing the Songun policy to the whole world, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The invitation of them was, therefore, of very humanitarian and ethical nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement said: This time, the Japanese authorities employed an underhand method in handling this issue: They allowed the entry of only two bereaved family members of victims while rejecting the entry of other members concerned. They did so for fear of the public protest and denunciation they are bound to face if they block the entry of the whole delegation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was the calculation of the authorities that the visit of the delegation to Japan could hardly take place as those aged bereaved families alone would not be able to make a trip there, unable to speak Japanese, and then they would be able to attain their objective and evade responsibility for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Clear is the aim sought by the authorities in disallowing the DPRK delegation's entry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are more desperately working to hype the issue of abduction of Japanese than ever before in a bid to infuse hostility towards the DPRK into the Japanese and create a social atmosphere for winding up the building of the foundation to turn Japan into a military power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the bereaved families and those concerned in the DPRK were allowed to visit Japan against this backdrop, they would tell how the Japanese imperialists abducted, took away and killed millions of Koreans and even refused to send their remains back to their country. Then this might hurt the \"Japanese feelings\" they have so far created for militarization. This was what the Japanese reactionaries feared most. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The action taken by the Japanese authorities once again clearly revealed their true intention not to admit their responsibility to reflect on their past crimes and apologize and compensate for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will counter such anachronistic and self-righteous attitude through strong actions to disclose and denounce the crimes committed by Japan against humanity in the past. We will actively join the world progressive forces in a more vigorous movement demanding Japan's liquidation of its past.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
