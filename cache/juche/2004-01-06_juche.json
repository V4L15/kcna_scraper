National cooperation based on the Korean nation-first spirit is the all-conquering weapon for smashing the U.S. imperialists' arrogant and shameless policy of aggression toward Korea and their moves to provoke a new war and advancing uninterruptedly the movement for reconciliation, unity and reunification. All the fellow countrymen should vigorously push forward the reunification movement in the new year under the slogan \"Let us pave a wide avenue for independent reunification through national cooperation under the banner of our nation-first spirit!\" set forth in the joint New Year editorial. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The whole nation should fight in close unity to dispel the danger of a nuclear war brought by outside forces every moment, defend peace in the country and achieve its reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
