At least 83,000 innocent people were killed by the U.S. imperialists' firing, violence, terrorism, robbery, rape, arson, deliberate traffic incident, spread of contagious diseases and spray of defoliant in the postwar period (August 1953-present). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to compiled data, a total of over 2,323,000 people were killed and 6,520,000 wounded. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The amount of damage inflicted by the U.S. imperialists upon the south Korean people runs into astronomical figures. If the victims are considered to be still alive and the income to be earned by them during their lifetime plus its interest and the changed value of U.S. dollar, etc. are estimated by the calculation method according to the international usage, the amount of damage caused to the dead is estimated to be 9,343,020,050,000 U.S. dollars, the amount of damage to the wounded 13,105,728,120,000 U.S. dollars, bringing the total amount of human damage to 22,448,748,170,000 U.S. dollars. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If a total amount of damage including the confiscation of \"enemy property,\" the levy of taxes, extortion of grains is estimated at the present price, it amounts to 4,281,665,880,000 U.S. dollars. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A total amount of damage caused by destruction runs into 5,145,398,340,000 U.S. dollars when estimated at the present price, and the amount of damage resulting from \"aid\" totals 2,341,469,900,000 U.S. dollars and the amount of damage incurred by trade and the market opening totals 1,413,903,760,000 U.S. dollars. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the amount of damage caused by the infiltration of U.S. monopoly capital plus its interest is estimated at the present price, it comes to 4,233,270,160,000 U.S. dollars. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This means, in the final analysis, the U.S. imperialists have inflicted upon south Korea material and economic losses worth 17,415,708,040,000 U.S. dollars through plunder, destruction, \"aid,\" trade and the market opening and the infiltration of capital since their occupation of south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, the loss south Korea has suffered due to the U.S. military bases totals 127,792,170,000 U.S. dollars and the loss incurred by its payment of the expenses for the upkeep of the U.S. troops in south Korea is estimated at 705,395,760,000 U.S. dollars. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Korea's loss caused by the forced purchase of war equipment totals 1,083,633,580,000 U.S. dollars when its interest and the changed value of a U.S. dollar are taken into account. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists have staged a total of 13,700 war exercises of various forms in south Korea, counting only those made public. The amount of damage caused by them is estimated to be 577,742,910,000 U.S. dollars. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the amount of damage caused to the land, forests and rivers and streams by environmental pollution and destruction is estimated on the basis of the expenses for restoring them to their original state, it totals 780 billion U.S. dollars. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A total amount of military damage the U.S. imperialists have inflicted upon south Korea totals 3,274,564,420,000 U.S. dollars. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have vandalized and looted at least 38,100 cultural treasures since their occupation of south Korea.
