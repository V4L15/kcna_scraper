This, however, is a sheer lie. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States is the world's biggest possessor of missiles and nuclear power. The U.S. move to establish the \"NMD\" is prompted by its aim to have military supremacy over the world. Its main target is big powers around the Korean peninsula. But, the \"ABM treaty\" is a stumbling block in carrying out its \"NMD\" plan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   That is why the U.S. seeks to modify the \"ABM treaty\" under the pretext of a \"missile threat\" from the DPRK and establish an unlimited \"missile defense\" system at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nBy doing so it wants to contain those big powers around the Korean peninsula which are challenging its move to build \"unipolar world\" and keep Europe under its military control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   With nothing can the United States conceal its sinister design and danger of the \"NMD\". \r\n\r\n"
