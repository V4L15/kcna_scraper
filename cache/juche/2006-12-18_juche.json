            "content": "KCNA Demands Thorough Probe into Case of Missing Korean Linguist \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, December 16 (KCNA) -- On May 2 the DPRK Red Cross Society asked the Japan Red Cross to render cooperation in finding the whereabouts of Kim Thae Yong who was reported missing in December of 1991 while working as a Korean lecturer at a reeducation college in Yuzhno Sakhalinsk, Sakhalin Province of the Russian Federation, at the request of his family. \r\n On Dec. 7 seven months since the request was made by Kim's family an insincere reply came from the Japan Red Cross which simply said it failed to find out his whereabouts. In the message the Japanese side gave no explanation about the letter written by him and a number of questions raised as to the case. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We express great disappointment and deep regret at this behavior. Kim sent the following letter to the DPRK Education Commission on April 30, 1992 right after he was reported missing: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"I am Kim Thae Yong, room chief of Kim Hyong Jik University of Education who had been teaching Korean language in Sakhalin. I was taken here while making arrangements for my trip to my country after I was told late in December of last year to celebrate the New Year's Day there. I was instructed to write a program for teaching Japanese Russian and Korean languages and methods of teaching them. Those who instructed me to do so are well informed of me. They say they will let me go back only after Korea is reunified. I have written to the best of my ability despite high blood pressure that torments me. I fell unconscious due to serious attack of brain hemorrhage early in the morning of last Feb. 16. Though my trouble has passed a critical point I remain completely paralyzed on the left half of my body. I am under treatment at a Japanese family at present. They say it is Sapporo in Hokkaido but it is a place far from human habitation. (It's my assumption I am in a place farther away from it.) They seem to do their best to cure me so that I may finish my writings. I tried to let you know about me as quickly as possible but there was no way. I am under strict control to bar me from getting in touch with outside. I am writing this letter, unobserved by anyone. An old person who cooks for me is sympathetic with me in the grip of anxiety, denying meal. The old person is kind-hearted.  It's hard to believe that this letter would reach the country. It may be my last risk. I long to see the country where I was born and grew up and miss very much the trustworthy disciples and comrades and the beloved members of my family who eagerly wait for me. I swear I will remain true to the beloved country and the comradely sense of obligation to the last moments of my life. Best regard. April 30, 1992.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Stamped on the envelop of the letter was 6.V.92 12-18 Japan HOKKAIDO WAATSU, part of the designation of a Japanese post office. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The members of Kim's family have made painstaking efforts to find out his whereabouts through various channels in the meantime. They repeatedly asked the Japanese side to settle the points raised, as early as possible, extremely worried about their father far beyond 70. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The insincere approach taken by Japan towards the issue of probing the case is intolerable both from the elementary humanitarian point of view and the standpoint on improving the DPRK-Japan relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We vehemently condemn this case as a serious infringement upon the sovereignty of the DPRK as Kim, able linguist of the DPRK is presumed to be lured and abducted by Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We once again strongly urge Japan to exert sincere efforts to ensure that the truth behind the case is thoroughly probed and clarified to help the members of his family realize their desire for reunion with him as early as possible.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The letter demanded the house take up the issue again and adopt another resolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the Japanese government has lavished money on its operation to prevent the issue of \"comfort women\" from being discussed at the U.S. Congress, the letter said this means Japan recognized itself that the sexual slavery for the imperial Japanese army is a hideous crime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The victims denounced the Japanese government for becoming evermore undisguised in beautifying and playing down Japan's war crimes as evidenced by its moves to revise the \"Pacifist Constitution,\" etc. far from drawing a lesson from its past crime-woven history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The survivors are dying one after another without having their grudge settled, the letter noted, adding that though all of them are no longer alive, the issue of 'comfort women' for the imperial Japanese army should be properly settled and their rights be restored.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S. has so far spent more than 500 billion dollars for the \"war on terrorism.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is that the U.S. stands no chance of winning this war despite this huge military spending. This war is engulfing the whole world, making all countries holding aloft the banner of independence against imperialism targets of the U.S. military operations. The U.S. has practically made many countries of the world its enemy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are too weak to fight this kind of war. The military strength of the U.S. is by no means \"matchless\" and its forces are no longer \"strong ones\" which no army dare attack. The U.S. forces which boast of being \"most elite forces\" equipped with latest weapons and equipment, are suffering an increasing number of casualties in face of attacks by the Iraqi resistance forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe reality goes to prove that now is the time to put an end to the bloody \"war on terrorism\" to conquer the world, a protracted war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bush, tight-cornered at home and abroad, was compelled to admit that the Iraqi war was a wrong war launched by mistake on an absurd ground. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists have made desperate efforts to escalate the \"war on terrorism,\" but after the lapse of five years they are caught in the trap dug by themselves. The Bush warlike forces are in the grip of the worst political crisis and isolation this year since they came to power. This clearly testifies to the total bankruptcy of the U.S. imperialists' \"strategy against terrorism\" and its inevitable failure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No hegemonic forces can ever block the advance of the just cause of the people and the times. Only self-destruction awaits the warmongers, who have committed so hideous crimes by frantically waging the \"war on terrorism,\" the war of genocide and destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The Koreans who live in the era of independent reunification in which the banner of \"By our nation itself\" flies high throughout the Korean Peninsula no longer want the presence of the U.S. aggressor forces in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and south Korean authorities should face up to this trend of the times and the history of the nation and stop the moves to increase the fund for the upkeep of the U.S. forces and opt for the total withdrawal of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces from south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is shame and tragedy for south Korea that it is still subject to all sorts of humiliation as it is under the U.S. military occupation and domination even in the June 15 era in which all Koreans aspire after independence and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people can never escape such shame and misfortune as long as the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces, the chief architect of the Korean division, the source of the danger of a new war and a stumbling block in the way of independent reunification, remain in south Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This party blustered that south Korea should take part in all operations for applying sanctions against the DPRK such as PSI. And when the U.S. pressurized south Korea to stop the tour of Mt. Kumgang and the construction of the Kaesong Industrial Zone, groundlessly complaining that those undertakings are little short of funding \"the development of weapons\" in the north, the GNP kicked off unprecedented racket of confrontation, crying out for the drop of \"the engagement policy\" and \"total stop\" to the north-south cooperation and exchange. It has gone the lengths of asserting that even a war with fellow countrymen should not be ruled out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation's cause of independent reunification that started under the banner of the June 15 joint declaration is facing great difficulties due to the traitorous moves of the GNP conspiring with the outsiders and the danger of a war is growing on the Korean Peninsula. The reality goes to clearly prove that all the precious achievements the Korean nation has made with much effort in the June 15 era may be spoiled unless such pro-U.S. traitorous party as the GNP is thrown overboard as early as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nation should not let the traitors of the GNP go scot-free under any circumstances.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

However, we have decided to start an anti-Japanese war by relying on the people. When the war starts, the people will become soldiers and rise up. Therefore, the guerrilla warfare which we shall wage can be called a people's war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And he put a period to the existing theory that the guerrilla warfare can be waged only under the backing of state rear or the regular army and decided the guerrilla warfare as the basic form of the anti-Japanese armed struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The theory on the people's guerrilla warfare reflected the unswerving will of the President to defeat the Japanese imperialists with the united strength of the Korean people and achieve the liberation of the country at any cost. The validity and vitality of the theory was glaringly proved in the battles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President, in his reminiscences \"With the Century\", writes that if we had dogmatically copied the experience of other countries in a guerrilla war, we would have met with irrevocable failure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The theory on the people's guerrilla warfare was, indeed, a unique theory on armed struggle advanced only by the President who had wisely led the Korean revolution from the independent stand.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
