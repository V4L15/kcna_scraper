            "content": "KCNA blasts U.S. decision to send carrier to S. Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 12 (KCNA) -- The U.S. reportedly announced that it would soon dispatch its carrier Carl Vinson, now operating in the West Pacific, to a South Korean port.\r\n The U.S. plan to send this super-class carrier dubbed \"golden eagle\" to South Korea to let it play a major role in the Foal Eagle joint military exercise betrays its operational intention to carry out the biggest-ever joint military exercise targeted against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and South Korean warhawks have ceaselessly staged north-targeted sabre-rattling. But it is the first time for them to mobilize troops and operational means huge enough to wage a war and use all parts of South Korea as theatres for month-long war exercises to be staged in the sky and seas and on land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is the growing danger of the U.S.-led exercises as the \"Foal Eagle\" joint military exercise, an annual event since 1961, is combined with Rsoi which has been staged since 1994. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. claims that the exercises are annual events which have nothing to do with the \"nuclear issue\" of the DPRK. But this is nothing but a broad hoax to mislead the public opinion and cover up its sinister military purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the U.S. campaign to internationalize the DPRK's \"nuclear issue\" and force it to scrap its \"nuclear weapons program before dialogue\" proved futile, the U.S. launched the large-scale war exercises in a bid to attain its strategic goal of militarily pressurizing and threatening it, while watching for a chance to mount a preemptive attack on the nuclear facilities in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is clearly evidenced by recent war outbursts made by U.S. President Bush that it would take a \"military option\" in case its diplomatic efforts to settle the DPRK's \"nuclear issue\" fail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"Foal Eagle\" joint military exercise is at its height with the carrier, to be involved in it, rendering the situation on the Korean Peninsula so tense that a nuclear war may break out any moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has consistently urged the U.S. to conclude a non-aggression treaty with it to cope with such disturbing development. But the U.S. turned down it and openly disclosed its intention to launch a war against the DPRK. This compels the people and the army of the DPRK to keep themselves fully ready to go into action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should not boast its military muscle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has self-defensive national defence capacity powerful enough to beat back any formidable enemy at a single stroke. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised not to run amuck, clearly understanding the DPRK's self-defensive power and single-hearted unity of its people.    \r\n\r\n"

They strongly demanded the U.S. immediately withdraw its plan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They declared that they would wage a large-scale death-defying struggle to check the plan while Foal Eagle and Rsoi are under way.    \r\n\r\n"

They have not made a formal apology for driving an armored car over Hyo Sun and Mi Son to death and are now bolstering the huge armed forces around the Korean Peninsula even at this moment to ignite a war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n How can they think of being a \"good neighbour\" of us? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. troops in South Korea should apologize for those thrice-cursed killings of civilians and all other crimes and quit this land at once. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"plan of making a good neighbor\" reminds one of a stray cat asking a fish shop owner to be on good terms with each other.     \r\n\r\n"

This is a mockery of the UN resolution and an act of impairing the authority and credibility of the UN. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is neither reason nor ground for the U.S. troops to remain in South Korea and their withdrawal from South Korea has been raised as an urgent need and irresistible trend of the times. The U.S. should roll back its policy of military presence in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. spawned the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and is staging large-scale war exercises under the simulated conditions of a real war after massively beefing up its troops in the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is part of its premeditated military operation to strangle the DPRK through preemptive nuclear attacks and its escalation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No U.S. saber rattling can browbeat the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the nation loves peace more than anyone else, the Korean people do not allow any slightest compromise or concession in the struggle against the harassers of peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The option is not a monopoly of the U.S. there is an option on the part of the DPRK, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should bear in mind that its forces may venture on a provocation and attack on the DPRK but they would not be able to go back alive in battles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK will wipe out at a single blow the aggressors coming in attack to torpedo the peace and reunification movement on the Korean Peninsula and firmly defend its peace and national security, pursuant to the army-centered policy.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan urged to mind its own business \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 12 (KCNA) -- Some time ago, Japanese Foreign Minister Kawaguchi said that it is the basic policy of the Japanese Government to settle the abduction issue and the issue of nuclear development, etc. in the direction of normalizing the relations between Japan and the DPRK. And she called for the establishment of the U.S.-Japan-South Korea \"cooperation system\" allegedly for a solution to the DPRK's \"nuclear issue\".\r\n Commenting on her remarks, Rodong Sinmun today says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nJapan adds fuel to the U.S. moves to ignite a war on the Korean Peninsula while turning aside the implementation of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration and supporting the U.S. pressure on the DPRK over the nuclear issue. It is as foolish an act as lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own toes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kawaguchi's remarks run counter to the basic spirit of the declaration, ignoring the fundamentals of the DPRK-Japan relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, the abduction issue, much touted by Japan, has already been settled and the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula is a matter that has nothing to do with Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Turning aside the past settlement, Japan is clamoring for the settlement of \"abduction and nuclear development\" issues, linking it with the matter of normalizing the bilateral relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSuch moves only prove that it is behaving without any principle just to join the U.S. in its anti-DPRK nuclear racket. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n High-ranking officials of Japan have implored other countries to put international pressure upon the DPRK or called for sanctions against it. Worse still, they went to the lengths of making provocative remarks that preemptive strikes should be made against North Korean military bases to remove \"missile threat\". These outbursts are intended to find a legitimate pretext for turning Japan into a military power and realizing its overseas military expansion, by joining the U.S. in its racket over \"North Korea's nuclear threat\" and evade the settlement of Japan's past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they are truly concerned for their country's security and hope for a peaceful solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, the Japanese authorities should not meddle in the matters that have nothing to do with them, but concentrate efforts on the past settlement, a key point for normalizing the DPRK-Japan relations, as clarified in the Pyongyang declaration, and urge the united states to come out to the direct dialogue with the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"

It is also a comprehensive economy that produces by itself in the main industrial goods and agricultural products needed for economic construction, defence upbuilding and people's living. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people built a solid independent national economy in a short period after the Korean War and developed it as a powerful economy equipped with a consolidated economic structure and modern technologies through the fulfillment of several economic plans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The abolition of taxation in 1974, the manufacture of such up-to-date machines as 10,000-ton press and large-scale oxygen plant and the successful launch of satellite Kwangmyongsong No. 1 in August 1998 are results of the country's powerful economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to the national economy, the country's defence industry is capable of fully producing by itself sophisticated weapons and technical means and equipment necessary for the defence of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With the independent national economy and a strong self-defence power based on it, the Korean people have defended socialism from the imperialists' military threat and aggressive moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean economy has developed, unaffected by the imperialists' economic blockade and the changed situation of world economic markets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any kind of their economic sanctions and blockade can never work on Korea with its own solid economic foundations.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
