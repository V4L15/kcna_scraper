            "content": "U.S. loudmouthed \"threat\" from DPRK rebuffed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 8 (KCNA) -- The deputy director of the U.S. CIA told a \"Seminar on North Korean Issues\" some time ago that the DPRK might have possessed one or two nukes as well as biological and chemical weapons.\r\n He also argued that DPRK's Rodong missile and improved versions of it, tipped with nuclear warheads, are capable of striking the U.S. mainland. \r\n Commenting on this argument, newspapers here today say that this is an old fiction dreamed up by the U.S. in an attempt to convince the public of the fictitious \"threat\" from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already known, the DPRK has nothing to do with the \"nuclear issue\" and transparency of its nuclear power system built for a peaceful purpose has been verified. the same is true of the \"missile issue\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is none other than the United States which poses a nuclear threat and is responsible for nuclear proliferation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is the world's biggest nuclear arsenal and the most dangerous nuclear and missile maniac. It has deployed a great number of missiles everywhere in the world and used them as means of blackmail against other countries, while undisguisedly pushing ahead with the design to weaponize outer space. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is ridiculous for the U.S. to raise a hue and cry over \"threat\" from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since it took office, the Bush administration has pursued the hardline policy to stifle the DPRK, calling for \"reduction of its conventional forces.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After all, this reveals the U.S. wild design to totally disarm the DPRK and then attain its aggressive aim with ease. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In floating again rumours about non-existent \"nuclear issue,\" \"issue of biological and chemical weapons\" and \"missile threat\" of the DPRK the U.S. seeks to shift the blame for the stalled process of the DPRK-U.S. dialogue on to the DPRK and find a pretext for the permanent presence of its troops in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should stop such nuclear and missile racket and pull its aggression forces out of South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson warns that the DPRK will take counteractions of its own style if the conservative forces of the U.S. continue to toy with it, pulling it up.    \r\n\r\n"

The spots and edifices are subtitled in Korean, English and Japanese and their locations on a map are given. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The sound and picture program \"friend of computer lovers\" is aimed at computer education. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This explains problems arising in understanding various programs and at least 100 common senses related to computer science.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's moves to tamper with history flailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 8 (KCNA) -- The central committee of the Union of Agricultral Workers of Korea released a statement today assailing the Japanese authorities for officially approving on April 3 the middle school history textbook which covered up and whitewashed Japan's past aggression.\r\n The statement says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists promulgated various \"laws\" including the \"law on land survey\" and the \"law on forest\" after occupying Korea by force of arms. On the strength of those \"laws\" they robbed Korean farmers of more than one million hectares of fertile land and plundered Korea of over 10 million hectares of forests, thus depriving Koreans of their right to existence. During their occupation of Korea they savagely looted a huge amount of grain, agricultural and live-stock products, industrial crops and specialities and recklessly cut down trees, stripping its mountains and hills bare. Korea thus turned into a veritable hell. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such being the hard facts, politicians and official figures of the Japanese government including four candidates who ran for the recent presidential election of the liberal democratic party do not hesitate to make remarks favouring the moves to tamper with history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The central committee of the union vehemently denounces in the name of all the agricultural workers in the DPRK the Japanese authorities' shameless moves to tamper with history and their arrogant behaviour encouraging them as one more grave insult to the Korean people and a blatant challenge to the international community and human conscience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities should immediately stop the criminal moves to distort history and take a responsible measure to ensure that crimes against humanity unprecedented in its history Japan committed during its war of aggression against Asian countries and its occupation of Korea are mentioned in history textbooks as they were.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
