            "content": "U.S. accused of turning away from proposal for non-aggression treaty \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 19 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK issued a statement on Tuesday accusing the United States of persistently turning down the DPRK's proposal for the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty aimed at finding a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and pushing the situation to the phase of confrontation.\r\n He said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is insisting on its strange assertion that it can not respond to the DPRK-U.S. talks as they mean a sort of reward for the DPRK despite the unanimous world public opinion that DPRK-U.S. direct talks should take place to find a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is an illogical far-fetched assertion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already clarified by the DPRK, it proposed to conclude a non-aggression treaty for the purpose of removing the unreasonable military threat posed by the U.S. to it, not for getting anything. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue emerged on the Korean Peninsula and the situation grew extremely tense as today mainly because of the U.S. military threat, a product of its deep-rooted hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. does not work hard to stifle the DPRK by force, its people can live as well as they wish on their own efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ours is a socialist system centered on the popular masses chosen by themselves and a system which has achieved single hearted unity and perfect political bability rare to be found in any other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We have a solid economic foundation and potentials created by ourselves with much efforts for scores of years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ours is not a system that may be destabilized or toppled in face of temporary difficulties. There is no need for us to threaten somebody in order to get something or to have our system guaranteed by somebody. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We are developing the relations of economic cooperation with neighboring countries entirely for purpose of meeting the mutual interests and requirements on an equal footing. We are now taking bold measures to improve the overall economic management system with a view to reenergizing the economy to suit the changed actual conditions in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An overwhelming majority of the countries are positively welcoming and appreciating these economic policies and measures adopted by us but it is only the U.S. that does not wish to see our socialist system make progress and our country prosper and is desperately working to hamstring its efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That is why the U.S. is increasing its military threat to our country, doggedly dodging our proposal for the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The just steps taken by us to cope with the U.S. military threat are only to serve the purpose of self-defence pursuant to the army-based policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those who describe this as a sort of flexible \"brinkmanship tactics\" only betray their utter ignorance of the reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Reality and delusion can not go together.    \r\n\r\n"

They opposed a war against Iraq, branding bush as a real terrorist. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A resolution was read out at the rally. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its participants marched as far as Kwanghwamun with candle-lights in their hands, chanting \"no war,\" etc. Then they held a candle-light function marking the 15th of January of the lunar year to pray for national independence and peace free from war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the function, speakers said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We have lived, exposed to the constant threat of war owing to the U.S. let's keep candles burning till the U.S. has accepted our demands. The 70 million Koreans want reunification, reconciliation and peace. They called for carrying on the struggle to prevent the war and give vent to the grudge of the two slain schoolgirls. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A resolution was read out at a similar rally held in Pusan on the same day. It opposed the U.S. attempt to attack Iraq and the \"government's\" support for the war in Iraq, demanded the U.S. drop its hostile policy towards the north and establish a peace mechanism on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the rally, the participants marched through the street, holding anti-war and peace posters.    \r\n\r\n"
