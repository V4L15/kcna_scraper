            "content": "KCNA Blasts Japan's Move to Establish MD \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 24 (KCNA) -- The Japanese government reportedly made a final decision on Dec. 19 at the National Security Meeting and ministerial meeting to introduce the Missile Defense System (MD).\r\n According to this, Japan will introduce MD developed by the U.S. and include the fund for it in the draft budget for the fiscal 2004 and will push ahead with increased zeal the deployment of MD to be completed by 2007. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On Dec. 15 the Japanese government decided to allocate 90 to 100 billion yen for the development of MD in the fiscal 2004. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This decision of Japan brought to light before the international community its sinister intention to realize its ambition to turn the country into a military giant and launch overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's move to establish MD can not but arouse protest and denunciation of the people in Northeast Asia including the Korean peninsula as it is a very serious development that escalates tensions in the region and the arms race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries claim that MD is the only means for protecting the lives and properties of the people. But this is nothing but sophism to cover up its aggressive and offensive nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has systematically stepped up its move to develop a large carrier rocket under the pretext of \"space development.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In 1969 it created a space development group and in 1989 it decided to intensify research into missile technology as part of its plan to increase the defence capacity. In 1984 it decided to develop perfect prototype rocket easily convertible into an inter-continental ballistic missile and in 1994 launched H-2 large carrier rocket. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year it put spy satellites into orbit with the help of H-2A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nOn August 6 it decided to create an integrated unit for missile defense to introduce MD. On November 24 it decided to reexamine the three principles for arms sale, a hurdle in the way of the joint production of interceptor missiles with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's decision to introduce the U.S-developed MD while zealously pushing ahead with the development of its own MD is a revelation of its crafty intention to introduce MD at an early date and strengthen its military nexus with the U.S. and escalate its moves to reinvade Asia with the backing of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is that the Japan is pushing forward its MD plan under the absurd pretext of \"missile threat\" from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the DPRK clarified more than once, the DPRK's missiles are means for self-defence as they are aimed to defend the security and dignity of the country from the hostile forces' moves to stifle it and therefore they do not pose any threat to Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's introduction of MD has entered the phase of its implementation under the pretext of the \"threat\" from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis is aimed, in the final analysis, to realize its intention to convert the country into a military giant and its ambition for expansion overseas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's production and deployment of missiles for self-defence in face of the U.S. nuclear threat are fundamentally different in their nature from Japan's MD move, which is a serious violation of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that the DPRK is the primary target of Japan's MD. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people and army of the DPRK are following with high revolutionary vigilance Japan's MD scheme and will increase its self-defence capacity to cope with it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Even tear gas has reappeared in this fascist suppression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such suppression is an anti-national and anti-reunification act as the present south Korean authorities are more desperately invoking the SL, a product of antagonism and confrontation, and negating the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This only stokes disillusion with the present \"government\" and lashes the south Korean people into fury. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Fascism can never be a way out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should face up to reality today when the nation desires reconciliation, cooperation and independent reunification, and stop at once the crackdown upon the pro-reunification organizations and people.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

On December 19 the U.S. Congressional Research Service issued a report on drug trafficking in which it said effective measures for blockade of the DPRK drug trafficking should be taken. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. stereotyped jargon about the fictitious suppression of religion and drug trafficking in the DPRK is a political burlesque which is not worth serious discussion as it is part of the U.S. mean anti-DPRK smear campaign to tarnish the image of the DPRK and justify international \"isolation and blockade\" against it at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is persistently conducting the anti-DPRK smear campaign, talking about dialogue without any precondition, which clearly proves that the U.S. policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK internationally remains unchanged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the last Korean war the U.S. troops dropped bombs on churches in the DPRK and destroyed all of them and mercilessly killed tens of thousands of church-goers. This was the most tragic incident recorded in the religious activities in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such being the case, the U.S. is now talking about the lack of \"religious freedom\" in the DPRK. This is a height of folly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is known to the world that freedom of religious belief is fully guaranteed by law in the DPRK and struggle against such crimes against humanity as drug trafficking is being intensified. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is completely mistaken if it thinks that the DPRK will be frightened by such third-rate reports.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
