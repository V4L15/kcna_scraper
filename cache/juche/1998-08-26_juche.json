Paektu\r\nPyongyang, August 26 (KCNA) -- Young soldiers of the Korean People's Army, who are on an excursion march to the Paektusan Secret Camp, climbed the top of Mt. Paektu, a holy mountain of revolution, on August 25.\r\n   They held a meeting to make an oath of loyalty in front of the monument on Mt. Paektu.\r\n   They renewed their firm determination to accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche, always sharing weal and woe with the Supreme Commander Kim Jong Il at the head of the party, the state and the revolutionary armed forces.\r\n   An anti-Japanese revolutionary fighter, Hwang Sun Hui, said the young servicemen should defend the Supreme Commander at the cost of their lives whatever storm may blow. Herein lies a sure guarantee for the victory of revolution and that is the tradition of faith and will, the revolutionary tradition of Mt. Paektu, she added.\r\n   The soldiers loudly chanted such slogans as \"human bombs\" and \"young vanguard\" and recited poems  reflecting the stamina and spirit of Mt. Paektu.    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n"

They avoid answering it, says Rodong Sinmun today.\r\n   The news analyst says:\r\n   For turning inter-Korean relations into those of reconciliation and unity from those of hostility and confrontation and achieving the unity of the nation for reunification, the South Korean authorities should admit that their practice does not consort with their preaching and should give up anti-reunification stand and, to this end, they should make clear their position on the principled matters raised by us in the open questionnaire.\r\n   They should not refuse to answer the open questionnaire, with unreasonable utterances, but answer it in any circumstances. It is an unavoidable question put by the whole nation.\r\n   Whether they give a correct answer to it or not will show whether they truly want improved inter-Korean relations, reconciliation and reunification or not and whether they still seek anti-north, anti-reunification confrontation and war or not.\r\n   They should get rid of a bad habit of letting out utterances without deliberating on a matter and be discreet.\r\n   We will wait for their answer with patience.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
