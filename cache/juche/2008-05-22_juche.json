From 1959 it reduced the agricultural tax in kind to 8.4 percent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The agricultural tax in kind, which had been instituted right after the liberation, was eliminated in the period from 1964 to 1966 for good in accordance with \"Theses on the Socialist Rural Question in Our Country\" authored by President Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a result there remained in the country only the income tax of the working people and the negligible local autonomy tax. The tax paid by the population amounted to two percent or less in the revenue of the state budget. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Third Session of the Fifth Supreme People's Assembly adopted the law on the complete abolition of the tax system on March 21, 1974. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK thus became the first tax-free country in the world.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Paektu which bears brilliant marks of the revolutionary history of the President has been converted into a socialist fairyland of the Songun era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such new architectures as the e-library of Kim Chaek University of Technology and Kim Won Gyun Pyongyang Conservatory and the recently rebuilt Moranbong Theater, East Pyongyang Grand Theater and Taedongmun Cinema demonstrate the advantages of the Juche-oriented architectural idea and theory put forward by Kim Jong Il. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Koreans could achieve landmark successes which they longed to witness so much after the publication of the historic June 15 joint declaration because the forces for independent reunification united close under the banner of \"By our nation itself\" were incomparably stronger than the anti-reunification forces. All Koreans at home and abroad aspiring after independence and patriotism should go united as one to frustrate the moves of aggressive outsiders and their followers, anti-reunification forces in south Korea. This is the only way for the Koreans to advance toward independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is important is that people from all walks of life in the north and the south and abroad should attach importance to the nation and harden their attitude and stance to pool efforts for the nation, aware of their position and role as a driving force for solving the issue of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The stand of attaching importance to the nation and the nation-first spirit serve as a motive force helping Koreans dynamically accelerate the advance for independent reunification with conviction in sure victory and indomitable fighting spirit. No force on earth can replace the Koreans in the efforts to accomplish the cause of national reunification.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

If this had been true, the U.S. should have refrained from military actions threatening the DPRK. However, it is smiling before delegates of the DPRK, while whetting swords to attack it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said frantic moves of the U.S. prove once again that it persistently seeks to stifle the DPRK by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reckless military moves stepped up by the U.S. trigger-happy forces to develop the new type weapon behind the scene of dialogue compel the DPRK to bolster its war deterrence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is sadly mistaken if it calculates it can go safe after its remote-controlled unmanned planes attacked other countries from its mainland. The capability to make long-distance strikes is not the monopoly of the U.S. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
