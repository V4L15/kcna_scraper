To put this idea into practice, the WPK held fast to the independent stand in its external relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK government established diplomatic relations with 143 countries on the principle of complete equality and mutual respect and is developing friendly and cooperative relations with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The WPK has consistently held fast to the revolutionary principle of not allowing encroachment upon the sovereignty of the DPRK and any interference in its internal affairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At a time when the U.S. infiltrated an armed spy ship \"Pueblo\" and a spy plane \"EC-121\" into territorial waters and air of the DPRK, provoked the \"Panmunjom incident\" and demanded compulsory \"nuclear inspection\" talking about the DPRK's non-existent \"nuclear development,\" the WPK and the DPRK government defended the sovereignty of the country and the nation by maintaining the uncompromising revolutionary principle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The WPK has waged an active struggle to defend global peace against the imperialists' aggression and war policies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   When the U.S. tried hard to hold an upper hand in strength, stepping up arms buildup behind the curtain of \"disarmament\" and \"detente,\" the WPK and the DPRK government laid bare their deceptive and dangerous nature and fought against their armed infiltration and war provocative moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They also took an initiative in making a proposal for turning northeast Asia including the Korean peninsula into a denuclearized and peace zone and organized the Pyongyang international conference for denuclearization and peace on the Korean peninsula in September Juche 75 (1986). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They have strengthened solidarity with the anti-war, anti-nuke peace movement and vigorously struggled against the setting up of foreign military bases and presence of foreign forces in different countries including non-aligned countries and to make military pressure upon them lifted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The WPK has pursued the policy of strengthening friendship and solidarity with world people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK government has extended an active political encouragement and sincere material aid to the peoples of non-aligned and other developing countries in their efforts to build  new societies on the revolutionary principle and in the spirit of comradely cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It also established good-neighborly relations with capitalist countries which respect its sovereignty and developed economic and cultural exchanges with them on the principle of equality and mutual respect. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   So, the DPRK is now enjoying a very high external dignity, and international solidarity with the Korean revolution has been strengthened. \r\n\r\n"

It cannot be judged as anything a premeditated and intentional criminal move to lead the situation on the Korean peninsula again from detente to the escalation of tensions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Lurking behind IAEA's move is a foolish attempt to shift the responsibility for the delay of the light water reactors project on to us. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As known to all, the lwr project according to the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework is not being smoothly stepped up and its prospect is gloomy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is entirely attributable to the obstructive maneuvers of the U.S. administration, conservative hard-liners in particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States intends to egg the IAEA on to brand the DPRK as a \"criminal\" in a bid to evade its responsibility for the delay in the project. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The project is a key to the implementation of the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework. The delay in the project means that the fate of the agreed framework is now at stake. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It does not matter to us whether the agreement with continue to exist or not. This is our stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. should clearly know our position and discharge its obligation to the agreement.
