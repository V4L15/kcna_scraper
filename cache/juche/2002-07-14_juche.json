The U.S. transnational companies have invested in developing countries undergoing economic woes under the pretext of \"aid\" and squeezed a profit of four or five dollars, even 10 dollars per one dollar. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is also escalating exploitation and plunder through \"loan.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Besides, under the cloak of \"joint development\" and \"technical cooperation\" it is expanding its interests by taking a grasp of the major economic sectors of developing countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world progressives should clearly know the U.S. imperialists' nature and wage a staunch struggle against aggression and plunder to make the new century free from exploitation and plunder, domination and subjugation.     \r\n\r\n"
