His leadership authority was absolute and his world-wide reputation was incomparably high. That was why the  ex-president of the United States, Jimmy Carter highly praised him, saying that he was a man greater than the three presidents put together, those who represented the building and destiny of the United States.   President Kim Il Sung, a great statesman of the 20th century, will live forever with man-centred socialist Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSitaram Sharma, chairman of the all-India Students Federation, said in a statement that the immortal exploits performed by the President for the popular masses' cause of independence, socialist cause, will shine forever as the greatest in human history and the history of the communist movement. \r\n\r\n"

The United States is describing the \"TMD\" as a \"shield\" and \"protection umbrella\" in a bid to provide justification for its development and deployment but this clumsy logic and trick do not go down with anyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"TMD\" development and deployment precisely means development and deployment of highly sophisticated guided weapons of a new type. This U.S. move is intended to increase combat power and sustain military supremacy.\r\n   The action taken by the U.S. and Japan to develop the \"TMD\"  is beset with a very potential danger as it presupposes its deployment and use. The aggressive nature and danger  of this move are more clearly evidenced  by the fact that the \"TMD\" is expected to be deployed mainly in South Korea, Japan and Taiwan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is as clear as noonday that the DPRK will be the primary target of the \"TMD\".\r\n   We will not remain a passive  onlooker to the U.S.-Japan move to develop and deploy the \"TMD\".

            "content": "KCNA on germ warfare by United States\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 10 (KCNA) -- A few days ago, the United States reportedly supplied an \"alarm system\" to the U.S. forces' unit present in South Korea allegedly to cope with \"germ warfare\" by the DPRK. Synchronizing with this, it is floating the rumour that the DPRK has hidden \"bacteria of smallpox\" and is \"capable of developing weapons for anthrax.\"   The  rumour about the \"development of biological and chemical weapons\" in the DPRK is a sheer lie which eloquently shows how frantically it is trying to hurt the DPRK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. vociferated about \"suspected nuclear development\" in the DPRK. However, its utterances proved to be groundless during its visit to the underground facility in Kumchang-ri.   It is now setting afloat the rumour about \"development of biological and chemical weapons\" in an attempt to do harm to the DPRK.   The fiction of \"development of biological and chemical weapons\" is a continuation and variant of the U.S. insistence on \"suspected nuclear development.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Accordingly, it is nothing but a preposterous piffle which cannot be overlooked.   In the past, too, the U.S. made a hue and cry about \"development of biological and chemical weapons\" in the DPRK. Then, why is the U.S. now loud mouthed about this old fiction?   This is because it seeks an ulterior purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S.-led NATO used weapons of mass destruction in air raids on Yugoslavia -- radioactive, depleted uranium and poisonous germ bullets and shells.\r\n   Since the Yugoslav war was a preliminary war and test war aimed at invading the DPRK, the U.S. use of biological and chemical weapons in the war hints that the U.S. will use a large number of such weapons of mass destruction in a war against the DPRK to be unleashed according to \"operation plan 5027-98.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   So, the U.S., in a bid to justify its preparations for nuclear and chemical warfare on the Korean peninsula, is spreading the rumour that the DPRK has concealed \"smallpox bacteria\" and is \"capable of developing weapons for anthrax.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the long run, the U.S. is the very one that possesses biological and chemical weapons and committed a germ warfare.   Therefore, its utterances about \"germ warfare\" by the DPRK is just like a thief crying \"stop the thief \"   the United States would be well advised to give up its criminal design to contain the DPRK with a nuclear club and through a bacteriological warfare. \r\n\r\n"
