But, it is certain that she does not know what an adverse effect it will have on Japan.\r\n   Through the statement of the spokesman for the general staff of the Korean People's Army, the DPRK has made it clear that it will  deal annihilating  strikes at the United States and its followers if they pounce upon the DPRK.\r\n   Japan will never be an exception to the striking objects. \r\nOur strikes will be merciless and powerful. The  Japanese reactionaries would be well advised to think and behave with prudence. \r\n\r\n"
