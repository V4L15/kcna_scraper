He then made clear what the unit has to do.\r\n   Seeing a weapon-handling training of soldiers, he voiced great satisfaction at the servicemen prepared to be a-match-for-a-hundred combatants and encouraged them.\r\n   Going round the unit's educational, cultural and logistic facilities, he said the KPA has a powerful weapon which cannot be made with any military science and technique, that is unity between officers and soldiers. \r\n   General Secretary Kim Jong Il saw an art performance given by the unit's servicemen and gave them a pair of binoculars and an automatic rifle as gifts before posing for a photograph with them.\r\n   He also inspected KPA unit no. 230 on the same day.\r\n   The unit was visited by President Kim Il Sung in September 1979.\r\n   General Secretary Kim Jong Il highly appreciated the achievements of the unit and had a picture taken with servicemen of the unit.     \r\n \r\n"

Many people, he noted, would visit the hospital to see patients in the future and, accordingly, a park must be built for them. As Korean men felt shy, they would be reluctant to give flowers to their wives in eyes of others, he added.\r\n   He stressed that a park covered with green foliage must be built so that husbands could present flowers to their wives and embrace newborn babies in arms, enjoying a pleasant time.\r\n   After the hospital was completed, he revisited it and went round the park in front of the hospital.\r\n   With deep satisfaction, he instructed those in the city management field should plant many trees and flowers in the park and manage it well.\r\n   His paternal love for the people deeply impressed the officials.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
