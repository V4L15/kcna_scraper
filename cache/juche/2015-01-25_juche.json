            "content": "S. Korea Should Not Forget Koreans Watch Them with High Vigilance: NDC\r\n Pyongyang, January 25 (KCNA) -- The Policy Department of the National Defence Commission (NDC) of the DPRK made public a statement Sunday in connection with the grim situation now prevailing on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t Growing stronger than ever before at present is the unanimous desire of the nation to break with the inglorious past and write a new history of the north-south relations, true to the noble intention of supreme leader Kim Jong Un, peerless great man. World people are also growing strong in their support and encouragement to it in response to the historic appeal for defusing the danger of war and creating a peaceful environment on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But even a basic climate for dialogue has not been created as the north-south relations are not freed from the phase of freeze.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that what is happening at present is very grave, the statement clarified the following principled stand:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 1. The south Korean authorities should stop making willful interpretation of the measures of great significance in the nation's history taken by the DPRK, and wagging their tongues at will.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The great calls made at the outset of the new year reflect the ardent desire to put an end to the 70-year long national division and build earlier on this land a reunified powerful country, dignified and prosperous.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the south Korean authorities backed by their American master are deliberately interpreting and slandering the measures taken by the DPRK, far from deeply studying them and positively responding to them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To cite a typical example, they are slandering the precious historic measures hailed by all Koreans as an \"option to get rid of international isolation\", \"the last resort to have economic blockade lifted\" and \"a peace offensive aimed at stirring up conflict among south Koreans\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They have even gone so blind as to term those measures \"proposals little different from the past ones\", \"measures devoid of sincerity\" and \"sleight of hand to hold initiative\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was not out of any calculation that the DPRK took such new measures. It was neither economic difficulties nor isolation and blockade that prompted it to take those measures.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The undesirable and hostile forces should clearly understand that political isolation, economic blockade and military pressure will never work on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We have never been benefited from the U.S. nor have we thought the south Korean authorities would help improve the living standard of our people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should neither misjudge nor make a mockery of the sincere will of the DPRK to put an end to the history of national division, a tragedy being suffered only by the Korean nation in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 2. The south Korean authorities should stop disappointing the nation with their double-dealing words and deeds.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are now loudly trumpeting about north-south dialogue and the improvement of the relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present chief executive has talked volumes, regardless of time and place, about \"steadily stepping up preparations for unification,\" \"creating conditions for holding dialogue of any form\", \"conducting trial operation of cross-peninsula railways\" and holding dialogue and negotiations for \"opening three channels for people's livelihood, environment and culture\" and giving \"priority\" to the reunions of divided families and relatives, while calling for \"putting an end to the 70 years of severance and conflicts\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Her loud words are quite different from her practical deeds.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea has already made it an established fact to conduct Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military exercises from March and Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military exercises from August as planned while creating impression that they have nothing to do with the removal of the danger of war and the creation of a peaceful climate.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the pretext of making full preparations for \"taking combined defence posture\", south Korea, while currying favor with its American master, has introduced aggression troops including a flying corps of strategic bombers carrying nuclear warheads to its land and vicinity, souring the atmosphere for the improvement of the relations with saber-rattling.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters is that such moves are being pushed forward in an undisguised manner as part of preparations for a preemptive attack on the DPRK in the run-up to the 65th anniversary of the conclusion of the shackling and sycophantic south Korea-U.S. \"mutual defence pact\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 3. The south Korean authorities should clearly know that in case they persistently refuse to respond to the call of great significance in the nation's history made by the DPRK, they will not be able to escape a stern punishment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Improving and developing the inter-Korean relations is the task of the times which brooks no further delay.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should sincerely respond to our call for opening up a broad avenue to independent reunification by concerted efforts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Intolerable and unpardonable are the incompetent behaviors of the south Korean authorities criminalizing the just acts to improve the inter-Korean relations and allowing human scum inciting confrontation with fellow countrymen to go scot-free, their poor position of failing to create elementary atmosphere of dialogue and their treacherous acts of joining the U.S. in its moves against national reunification and moves for disturbing dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is nonsensical to allow another long period of the tragedy to last, though the nation has spent 70 years in misfortune and pain.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The whole world knows well about the will of the DPRK to mercilessly punish the treacherous, anti-peace and anti-reunification acts of the hostile forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should ponder over their behavior more than once.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should not forget even a moment that all Koreans are following all their moves with high vigilance, ready to punish them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will resolutely punish the south Korean authorities in case they continue challenging the historic steps taken by it to re-link the severed bonds and blood vessels of the nation and bring about a great change in mending the inter-Korean relations."

Las autoridades surcoreanas no deben interpretar ni hablar a su antojo de las medidas nacionales de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl gran llamamiento hecho en el comienzo del ano nuevo contiene la ardiente sinceridad de dar punto final a la historia de division nacional de 70 anos que sigue siglo a siglo y adelantar la construccion de la digna y prospera potencia reunificada sobre este territorio patrio. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, a instigacion de su amo gringo, las autoridades surcoreanas las interpretan a su capricho y las cuestionan atrevidamente en vez de analizar profundamente y respaldar activamente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAcusan esas medidas historicas aplaudidas altamente por toda la nacion coreana de \"opcion tomada para salir del aislamiento internacional\", \"ultima medida para escaparse del bloqueo economico\" y \"ofensiva de paz para causar conflictos entre los surcoreanos\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY se atreven a calificarlas de \"propuesta igual a las anteriores\", \"medida carente de sinceridad\" y \"artimana para tomar la iniciativa\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo presentamos nuevas medidas bajo el calculo algo. Tampoco las tomamos para liberarse de las dificultades economicas, el aislamiento y  el bloque.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas fuerzas hostiles deben saber correctamente que el aislamiento politico, la asfixia economica y el aplastamiento militar nunca surtiran efecto en la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo nos beneficiamos nunca de Estados Unidos ni pensamos en la mejora de nuestra vida en virtud de las autoridades surcoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas no deben malinterpretar ni burlar nuestra sinceridad y la voluntad de acabar con la historia de division nacional que sufre solamente la nacion coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Las autoridades surcoreanas no deben cometer los delitos que desesperan a todos los compatriotas con las palabras y acciones diferentes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora las autoridades surcoreanas hablan ruidosamente del dialogo N-S y de la mejora de relaciones intercoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa mandataria dice que \"pondra punto final a 70 anos de division caracterizados por la ruptura y discordia\" y habla en alta voz de la \"ampliacion de los preparativos para la unificacion\", \"la preparacion de condiciones para la apertura de dialogo de cualquier forma\", la \"inauguracion ejemplar de los ferrocarriles que atraviesan la Peninsula Coreana\", el dialogo y negociaciones sobre \"la apertura de 3 vias: vida del pueblo, ambiente y cultura\" y la \"realizacion prioritaria\" del encuentro de familiares y parientes separados en el Norte y el Sur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, la accion se diferencia completamente de aquellas palabras dulces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tElla ya declaro que desde a principios de marzo se desplegaran los ejercicios militares conjuntos \"Key Resolve\" y \"Foal Eagle\" y en agosto el otro \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\" enganando la opinion publica como si tales entrenamientos belicos no tuvieran relaciones con la eliminacion de peligro de guerra y la preparacion del ambiente pacifico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo el pretexto de garantizar plenamente la \"posicion de defensa combinada\" lisonjeando a su amo norteamericano, introduce invariablemente en el suelo surcoreano y su contorno las fuerzas agresivas como la aviacion de bombarderos estrategicos cargados de bombas nucleares con el fin de romper a toda costa el ambiente de mejora de relaciones intercoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo problematico es que tales movimientos, que persiguen completar los preparativos de ataque preventivo anti-RPDC, se tornan mas abiertos con motivo del 65o aniversario de la concertacion del \"acuerdo de apoyo de defensa mutua\" Surcorea-EE.UU., de caracter humillante y vendepatria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Las autoridades surcoreanas deben saber correctamente que no podran evitar el castigo duro si niegan obstinadamente el historico llamamiento de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa mejora y  el desarrollo de las relaciones intercoreanas resultan una tarea impostergable de la epoca.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas deben sumarse con sinceridad al llamamiento de la RPDC de abrir el ancho camino para la reunificacion independiente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo se tolerara nunca la actitud incapacitada de ellas que dejan intactas a las escorias humanas que agitan la confrontacion fratricida, criminalizando los actos justos para la mejora de relaciones N-S, que no preparan ni siquiera el ambiente elemental para el dialogo y se suman al complot anti-reunificacion de EE.UU. y a sus abiertas maniobras para estorbar el dialogo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNunca es permisible que repitan otra vez las incontables desagracias y sufrimientos de 70 anos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodo el mundo ya conoce la voluntad de castigo despiadado de la RPDC a las acciones antinacionales, antipacificos y anti-reunificacion de las fuerzas hostiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas deben deliberarlo profundamente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo deben olvidar ni un momento que todos los coreanos estan observando con la mirada fria los movimientos de las autoridades surcoreanas manteniendo la disposicion de castigo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito y pueblo de la RPDC responderan con castigos duros en el caso de que sigan desafiando a las medidas historicas, para reconectar el lazo y la arteria nacionales y traer gran cambio en las relaciones intercoreanas."
