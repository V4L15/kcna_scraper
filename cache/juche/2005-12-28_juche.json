To tell the truth, it intends to brand the DPRK as a \"criminal state\" to build up world public and, on this basis, more legitimately strengthen its moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean army and people with strong independence and pluck neither care whatever the U.S. may say nor shake in its sanctions and pressure.

The Socialist Constitution was renamed the Kim Il Sung Constitution and the system of state organs changed into the system with the National Defence Commission as its backbone so as to make it possible to firmly defend the President's idea and exploits of state building in the new century and ensure a victorious advance of the Songun cause of Juche under any grave circumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Calling upon all the people to bear in mind the great pride of advancing the socialist cause of Juche with the greatest Kim Il Sung Constitution and speed up their advance in the new century, the editorial goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The whole Party, the entire army and all the people should uphold the Songun idea and leadership of Kim Jong Il with loyalty in one mind, bring about a surge of the Songun revolution and thus make a new turn in the building of a great prosperous powerful country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists and other reactionaries are now more vicious in their moves for ideological and cultural infiltration and economic blockade to undermine Korean-style socialism. This reality requires to further strengthen the socialist law-abiding life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The editorial calls for establishing the revolutionary atmosphere of law observance in the whole society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson editorially calls for applying the Kim Il Sung Constitution thoroughly to step up the building of a great prosperous powerful socialist nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
