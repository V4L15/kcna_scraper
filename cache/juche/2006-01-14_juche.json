The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint editorial referred to the significance of the 80th anniversary of the Down-with-Imperialism Union and the 60th founding anniversary of the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League to be celebrated this year and the tasks to be tackled to mark these anniversaries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We call on all the adherents to the Juche idea of the world to celebrate these important days with splendor.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is now set to put them into practice in real earnest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These moves of the U.S. imperialists are based on their foolish calculation that the DPRK is not in a position to stand up against the U.S., the world's \"only superpower\", and its economic and diplomatic offensives will bring Pyongyang to its knees. They are blocking the DPRK's trade channels, etc. in a bid to isolate and suffocate it at any cost. Their immediate aim is to force the DPRK to accept their unjust demand that it scrap its nuclear program first at the six-party talks. What merits a more serious attention is that their sanctions and blockade against the DPRK may lead to a war against it. This can be proved by the fact that they launched armed invasion against Iraq while imposing economic sanctions upon it for years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The injustice of the above-said sanctions and blockade lies in that they are illegal acts of defying international law and norms governing the relations among countries and swimming against the trend of the overall international situation toward peace and detente in the new century. \r\n  The U.S. would be well advised to seriously take stock of the setbacks and frustrations it has met in its policy of sanctions and blockage against the DPRK and reexamine it and make a policy switchover, urges the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And recently they are further intensifying the all-round offensive to put pressure upon the DPRK while fabricating and spreading absolutely unreasonable issues including \"human rights\" and \"money counterfeit\".\r\n The pro-U.S. conservative forces in south Korea are making last-ditch efforts to reverse the era of June 15 reunification to that of confrontation in the past and achieve their wild ambition for power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pak Kyong Chol, vice chief of a department of the Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, told KCNA that the movement for independent reunification, peace against war and great national unity is the greatest expression of patriotism for the Korean nation at the present juncture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the issues arising in accomplishing the reunification cause, he went on, should be solved by the way of giving priority to the dignity and interests of the nation in line with the requirement of the idea of \"by our nation itself\" and the nation-first spirit, the spirit of attaching importance to the nation, should be pervaded all places where Koreans live. Herein lies the path of independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n So long as the U.S. imperialist aggressive troops driving dark clouds of war over the Korean nation are left intact, it is unthinkable about anti-war and defence of peace. The peace on the Korean peninsula will be achieved only when the entire Koreans wage a nation-wide struggle for forcing U.S. troops out of south Korea to root out the source of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The independent reunification and peace against war can not be realized without achieving the great national unity.\r\n The whole nation should achieve the great unity irrespective of ideology, ideal, political party affiliation and position and thus to pave the shortcut to national reunification. \r\n When the entire Korean nation displays patriotism in the three-point patriotic movement, a fresh phase for national reunification will be brought about this year, he stressed.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It blocked the repatriation of unconverted long-term prisoners till the last moment of this event and totally rejected the June 15 joint declaration that paved a wide avenue for their return to the north, the bulletin says, and goes on:\r\n Now it is taking issue with the indictment, while falsifying truth in a bid to give impression that it did the unconverted long-term prisoners favor and saved a drowning man. This irrefutably proves that it is a group of impudent and brazen-faced fascists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Worse still, the GNP, which succeeded to the fascist dictatorial regime infamous for hideous human rights abuses, talked nonsense about human rights and the like, daring slander the dignified DPRK.  It is shameless and disgusting, indeed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP should stand a stern trial of history and the nation. It should face punishment and make an apology and compensation as demanded by the unconverted long-term prisoners before quitting the political scene without delay. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should ensure that an early appropriate measure is taken as regards the joint indictment if they truly want to settle the past history.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
