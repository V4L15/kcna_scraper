            "content": "American Arrestee Interviewed\r\n Pyongyang, February 29 (KCNA) -- Otto Frederick Warmbier, student at the University of Virginia, the U.S., was interviewed with domestic and foreign journalists in Pyongyang Monday. He was arrested for committing anti-DPRK hostile acts.\n\t\t\t\t\t Present there were domestic and foreign journalists, members of foreign diplomatic missions and missions of international bodies here and overseas Koreans staying in the homeland.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Warmbier spoke first.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On December 29, 2015, I entered the DPRK as a tourist. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On January 1, 2016, I committed severe crimes against the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I am 21 years old. I am a student at the University of Virginia. I am in my third year of the university. My residential address is Ohio, United States with my family. At the moment, I lived in a rented apartment near the university. My father owns a very small factory that barely makes enough to support my family. My mother is a housewife. I am the oldest son in my family. My brother and my sister are both high school students.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I committed the crime of taking out a political slogan from the staff-only area of the Yanggakdo International Hotel. The slogan inspires the Korean people's love for their system. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The task was given to me by the Friendship United Methodist Church. At the encouragement of the Z Society and the connivance of the United States Administration, I came to commit this task. The aim of my task was to harm the motivation and work ethic of the Korean people. This was a very foolish aim.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Growing up in the United States, I was taught that the DPRK is a mysterious, \"isolated communist nation\" from the mass media and education. This made me an innocent thinking adventurous young man like myself, want to show my bravery in this mysterious country in order to improve my reputation and show Western victory over the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I was scheduled to take part in a university-sponsored financial class in Hong Kong and I decided to use this opportunity to visit the DPRK as a tourist.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Based on my application's confirmation, I chose to have my tour at the end of December 2015.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On September 23, 2015, I was having dinner at my friend Stefan Webb's home with him and his mother, Sharon Webb. Sharon Webb is a deaconess in the Friendship United Methodist Church and her son Stefan Webb is an active believer in this same church.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Sharon emphasized that her church does not support the Government of North Korea and that communism should be ended. She said that communist nations rally around political slogans. She asked me to take an important political slogan from North Korea to be hung in her church as a \"trophy\". She continued to say that by taking this slogan, we would harm the unity and motivation of the North Korean people and show this country an insult from the West.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She offered me a used car worth $10,000 if I was successful. And she said if I was detained and not returned, her church would pay $200,000 to my mother in a way of charitable donations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since my family is suffering from very severe financial difficulties, I started to consider this as my only golden opportunity to earn money. Most importantly, Sharon said to never mention the Friendship United Methodist Church's involvement or no payments would come.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In early October, 2015, I informed my mother very little of my crime attempt offer, but I told that I planned to steal something precious from North Korea and if I was detained I told her that her bank account would receive transfers for my brother and sister's university tuition. She cried and said not to do anything dangerous.    I considered less, not wanting to hurt my mother. But since then, I got several alluring pressures from the Friendship United Methodist Church, leading me to finally decide my crime attempt.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the meantime, the Z Society also clandestinely encouraged my act. After I came to know that all members become very wealthy with high-paying jobs after they graduate university, I eagerly wanted to join the Z Society. That is why, in late November 2015, I intentionally revealed my plan of my act to a member of Z Society. He said my plan of action would certainly help the Z Society's goal of spreading \"freedom\" and eliminating \"tyranny\". He said if I was successful, he promised me that he would help me become a member in the Z Society. And he even said if I was caught, the Z Society could help pressure North Korea for my release. Finally, he said to never mention the Z Society's encouragement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I arrived in Pyongyang through Beijing and committed my crime against the people and Government of the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t My crime is very severe and pre-planned.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then he answered questions raised by journalists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The politicians and United States Administration use the Friendship United Methodist Church to harm the DPRK by all dirty means and ways. The Friendship United Methodist Church gave me my crime task, which is matched to United States' consistent hostile policy against the DPRK, with aims to spread Christianity in the DPRK and increase the support from the United States Administration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Therefore, my crime was the expected output of the U.S. Administration's consistent hostile policy against the DPRK and its implementation by the Friendship United Methodist Church.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere is no doubt that the CIA knows the Z Society's encouragement of my crime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I took many detailed steps to prepare for my crime in the DPRK while I was in the United States.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I have been very impressed by the DPRK Government's humanitarian treatment of severe criminals like myself and of the very fair and square legal procedures in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t And I've come to see that the current \"human right issues\" in the DPRK, consistently highlighted by the United States Administration is simply nothing more than a hypocritical excuse to eventually overthrow the Government of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I apologize to the people and the Government of the DPRK and beg for forgiveness."

Such claim is the height of the American-style double standards.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An article posted by Stefan Landman on the website of the Canadian Institute for World Studies \"Double standards of the West towards north Korea\" said the UNSC resolution banning Pyongyang's use of ballistic missile technology is a wrong one, adding that this resolution is not applied to any country, to say nothing of the western world, and this is the height of double standards.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A professor and doctor of the Socio-economic Faculty of the University of Vienna sneered by saying that the UNSC is discussing sanctions over the north Korea's satellite launch but the satellite launch is a legitimate right of a sovereign state and if it finds fault with north Korea's satellite launch, it has to adopt a new \"resolution\" some time banning the sale of kitchen knives to its commercial network for fear of killing people, he added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A colonel of the Spanish Ministry of Defence noted that it is the double standards to insist on slapping sanctions against north Korea as satellites are launched by all the countries capable of doing so, adding that it is also double standards that nuclear capable India and Pakistan conduct regular ICBM launches but no one takes issue with them, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A researcher of an American nonproliferation center said that he can say with confidence the rocket launched by north Korea was the satellite launch as it was designed as a mechanism for launching rockets into the space. There should be a considerable change in the design if the satellite launch is to be described as ICBM, he held.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the international public comments, the DPRK's satellite launch can never pose a threat to other countries as it is clear space development activity for peaceful purposes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is working hard to prevent the DPRK's satellite launches, absurdly claiming that they \"threaten\" someone. If this is allowed, the DPRK is barred from launching satellites for good. It is unpardonable double standards for the U.S. to assert that the DPRK is only not allowed to launch satellites, while launching different types of satellites including spy satellites at any place and times in a bid to militarize outer space in contravention of requirements of the international community. The U.S. naturally should stop taking issue with the DPRK's space development activities and halt the above-said moves as they are a grave threat to world peace and security, to begin with.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should not make an excessive reaction to the DPRK's satellite launch for peaceful purposes, prompted by the conception of confrontation, but view it from a fair stand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a law-governed requirement of the age of ultra-modern science and technology and world trend to launch and operate working satellites necessary for economic development and prosperity of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's position as a satellite manufacturer and launcher will never change because of the U.S. denial and the former's space development is not something to be given up because of someone's \"sanctions\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will as ever make greater successes in the field of space development so as to protect the self-respect and dignity of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is nothing but a pipe dream for the U.S. to expect the DPRK to collapse due to \"sanctions.\" This is as foolish as waiting the missions of the sun and stars to come to an end.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. persists in its desperate attempt to deprive the DPRK of its independent and legitimate rights, obsessed with its ill-intended inveterate repugnancy toward the latter, it will be left with no option but to take inevitable counter-measures to cope with it."

            "content": "Miserable Human Rights Situation in U.S. and Western Countries Disclosed (3)\r\n Pyongyang, February 29 (KCNA) -- The DPRK Association for Human Rights Studies in an indictment on Feb. 23 disclosed that the U.S. and the western countries are wantonly violating the rights of refugees after causing the worst refugee crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t The number of refugees went beyond 60 million in the world according to the recent data available from the UN, the indictment said, adding:  This refugee crisis is the inevitable product of the U.S. and the West's policy of interference for domination and hegemony.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the trite method of the U.S. and western countries to interfere in the social and political issues of the developing countries to aggravate antagonism and contradiction among nations and tribes and get craftily involved in disputes and escalate them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t U.S. tentacles were stretched to such countries as Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Yemen, destroying everything and reducing many war-torn countries to the states flooded with refugees.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"anti-terrorism war\" launched by the U.S. by taking advantage of the September 11 incident is state-sponsored terrorism against sovereign states and a war of aggression of new version.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Air strikes against Syria being made by the U.S. and the West under the pretext of \"anti-terrorism war\" are producing an unprecedented number of refugees.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Syria is now in the grip of the world's worst crisis and 4 million Syrians are on the way for taking shelters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is making air raids on Syria with neither approval nor request.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ceaseless war caused by \"Arab spring\" engineered by the U.S. and the West is turning the regional countries into ruins and their inhabitants are wandering in quest of means of living.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The refugee issue spawned by the U.S. and western countries is the human rights abuse and, therefore, it is their responsibility and duty under international law to settle the issue of refugees and guarantee their rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the U.S. and the West are evading their responsibility and wantonly violating the rights of refugees.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., chief architect of the crisis, remains a passive onlooker to it, claiming that the world should share the responsibility for it though Europe was embroiled in it for having toed the U.S. policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even the European countries which had created good impression by receiving refugees in the early period of the crisis are taking such measures one after another as preventing refugees from entering their countries and maltreating and expelling those already entered under the pretexts of social unrest and factor of terrorism. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Germany, Austria, France and many other countries, in a bid to block the influx of refugees, reintroduced 6 months-long border security control system. It was followed by the decision of EU to extend the border control period in countries of Schengen area to 2 years and create \"EU Border Coast Guards\" involving 1,500 troops.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Sweden announced that it would expel over 100,000 refugees, 45 percent of them, Finland 20,000 and Austria 50,000 under various pretexts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Switzerland took a measure to seize cash more than 1,000 Fr and valuables from refugees and give receipts instead. Following its example, Denmark adopted a bill on confiscating their properties.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Public demos protesting governments' refugee policy are going on in Germany and Britain day after day. Hundreds of demonstrators are staging protest demos in Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, causing social chaos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When France, Germany and other west European countries suggested \"proportional share\" of refugees as a stopgap measure, east European countries are rejecting it as an unfair one.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A large chunk of refugees are drowning while traveling to Europe.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even those refugees who could barely land in Europe are subject to unbearable misfortune and pain due to the intentional and undisguised human rights abuses by the European countries styling themselves \"human rights champions\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Britain is preparing a bill designed to tighten security control in such places where refugees may work as construction sites and private home cleaning companies and to fine organs and individuals that employed refugees and even sentence them to two years in prison.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t More than 200 fire cases against refugees occurred in Germany and 70 odd dead refugees were found at an abandoned refrigerator car on an express highway of Austria in 2015.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to a recent survey quoted by the European Police Organization, more than 10,000 children among incoming refugees were missing in European countries, most of whom fell victim to flesh trafficking and slave trade.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The British newspaper Independent on Dec. 17, 2015 recalled that 1,500 Kosovo people and 800 Iraqi and Afghanistan refugees, who had immigrated to Austria, expressed while going back home unbearable anger at bitter humiliation and treatment as \"terrorists\" there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now human rights abuses in the U.S. and other western countries are being committed institutionally due to policies of their governments and this matter can be settled only when a genuine human rights mechanism is built in those countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and other western countries should no longer find fault with others' human rights performance, describing themselves as \"icons of defending human rights\", but focus on minding their own business."

Pero eso fue una tonteria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCreciendo en Estados Unidos, recibi en las escuelas y a traves de medios de informacion la educacion de que la RPDC es una nacion comunista misteriosa y aislada. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEso incito a las personas jovenes aventureros como yo  hacer un acto valiente para mostrar la superioridad del Occidente sobre la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPlanee visitar la RPDC aprovechando la oportunidad de mi participacion en el cursillo financiero programado en enero de 2016 en Hong Kong. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe acuerdo con que fue determinada mi peticion de turismo, decidi visitar la RPDC a finales de diciembre de 2015.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 23 de septiembre de 2015, tome la cena en la casa de mi amigo Stefan Webb junto con el y su madre Sharon Webb. Sharon Webb es diacona de la Iglesia Metodista Unida de Amistad y su hijo Stefan Webb es el creyente activo de esa iglesia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSharon me dijo que su iglesia no apoya al gobierno de Norte de Corea y que el comunismo debe ser derrumbado. Prosiguio que los paises comunistas aglutinan a las masas con las consignas politicas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMe pidio que me trajera una importante consigna politica del Norte de Corea para colgarla como \"trofeo\" en su iglesia. Continuo que al eliminar esas consignas hay que debilitar la unidad y el entusiasmo del pueblo norcoreano y demostrar que ese pais sea insultado por el Occidente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMe dijo que me daria un coche usado que vale 10 mil dolares si yo saliera con exito. Agrego que en el caso de detenerse la iglesia pagaria 200 mil dolares a mi madre por conducto de donacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMi familia sufria grandes dificultades financieras y yo considere que eso es la unica oportunidad para ganar el dinero. Sharon me aconsejo no mencionar jamas en cualquier caso el hecho de la intervencion de la Iglesia Metodista Unida de Amistad. E intimido que no pagaria nada en el caso de revelarlo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA principios de octubre de 2015, explique sencillamente a mi madre sobre mi plan y le dije que ingresara en la cuenta de banco de madre el dinero a ser utilizado como gastos para estudios de mis hermanos menores durante su carrera universitaria en caso de que yo fuera arrestado en la RPDC tras fracasar mi plan de robar lo importante en ese pais. Entonces, mi madre nego llorando mi plan calificandolo como accion peligrosa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMe quede indeciso al leer el alma inquietada de mi madre, pero tome decision de cumplir la mision de crimen tras ser seducido y presionado varias veces por la Iglesia Metodista Unida de Amistad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYo deseaba con ansia el ingreso a la Sociedad Z desde cuando conoci que todos los miembros de ella viven ricos con empleos con mucho ingreso despues de la graduacion de la universidad y a fines de noviembre de 2015, revele de  proposito el plan de mi accion a un miembro de dicha sociedad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl me dijo que mi plan es bien adecuado al proposito de la sociedad de divulgar la \"libertad\" y eliminar el \"poder autocratico\" y me comprometio a ayudarme mucho para ingresarme a la sociedad si yo logro exitos en el cumplimiento de mi plan. Y dijo que si yo fuera arrestado, la sociedad impondra presion al Norte de Corea a ponerme en libertad y yo debo tener en secreto la incitacion de la Sociedad Z.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOtto Frederick Warmbier dijo que ejecuto su plan tras llegar a Pyongyang via Beijing y continuo que su crimen es muy grave y preparado con anticipacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA continuacion, Warmbier respondio a las preguntas de los reporteros del interior y exterior.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl senalo que los politicos y la administracion de EE.UU. intentan perjudicar la RPDC con malignos medios y metodos movilizando la Iglesia Metodista Unida de Amistad y revelo que esta iglesia le dio la mision de crimen con el fin de divulgar en la RPDC el cristianismo sumandose a la obstinada politica hostil anti-RPDC de EE.UU. y recibir mayor patrocinio de la administracion norteamericana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWarmbier revelo que su crimen es el fruto planeado de la politica hostil anti-RPDC de la administracion norteamericana y las actividades de la Iglesia Metodista Unida de Amistad para realizarla.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY menciono que la Sociedad Z relacionada intimamente con la Agencia Central de Inteligencia de EE.UU., le incito a cometer delito y el mismo lo preparo previamente en EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDijo que el mismo recibe en Pyongyang justas formalidades legales y el tratamiento humanitario.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl fin, Warmbier dijo que el comprendio que el \"problema de DDHH\" de la RPDC, cuestionado obstinadamente por la administracion norteamericana, no pasa de ser una excusa hipocrita para derrumbar el gobierno de la RPDC y pidio disculpas al pueblo y al gobierno de esta por sus actos criminales."

            "content": "ACNC comenta pauta de doble rasero a estilo norteamericano\r\nPyongyang, 29 de febrero (ACNC) -- Ahora, Estados Unidos aboga por la presion internacional y \"sancion\" acusando el lanzamiento del satelite de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea de violacion de las \"resoluciones\" del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU.\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto deviene la violacion grosera y el grave desafio a la soberania de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl lanzamiento de nuestro satelite de fines pacificos es el digno derecho independiente de un Estado soberano, reconocido por la ley internacional superior a la resolucion del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU, razon por la cual, nadie puede impedirlo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa censura aviesa y el alboroto de \"sanciones\" de los norteamericanos contra el lanzamiento de nuestro satelite es el manifiesto intensivo de la extremada politica hostil anti-RPDC de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEllos hablan de que es todo legitimo el lanzamiento de sus satelites, pero ilegal el lanzamiento de nuestros satelites. Esta logica bandidesca es precisamente el apogeo de la pauta de doble rasero a estilo norteamericano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tStefan Landman, senalo en su articulo intitulado \"Pauta de doble rasero del Occidente sobre Norte de Corea (RPDC)\", publicado en la pagina Web del Instituto de Globalizacion de Canada, que es una gran absurdidad la \"resolucion\" del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU que impide a Pyongyang utilizar la tecnica de misil balistica. Tal resolucion nunca se aplica en el Occidente y en ningun pais del mundo. Esto es claramente el climax de la pauta de doble rasero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"En estos dias, el CS de la ONU discute sobre la 'sancion' contra el lanzamiento de satelite del Norte de Corea, pero el lanzamiento de satelite es el derecho legitimo de un Estado soberano. Si cuestiona de esta manera el lanzamiento de satelite del Norte de Corea, se aprobara en algun tiempo nueva 'resolucion' que impide vender cuchillos de cocina en las redes comerciales del Norte de Corea, partiendo de la preocupacion de que con estos pueden matar a la gente.\", asi burlo el profesor y doctor de la Facultad de Socioeconomia de Noreste de Asia de la Universidad de Viena de Austria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl primer coronel del Ministerio de Defensa de Espana dijo que todos los paises aptos pueden lanzar el satelite artificial, por eso, \"sancionar\" solamente al Norte de Corea es la pauta de doble rasero. Tambien forma otra pauta de doble rasero impedir al Norte de Corea utilizar la tecnica de misil balistico porque ese pais posee armas nucleares. En efecto, India y Pakistan, poseedores de armas nucleares, realizan ordinariamente el lanzamiento de misiles balisticas intercontinentales, pero nadie lo cuestiona. Y el posgraduado del Centro de Estudios de No Proliferacion James Martin de Estados Unidos hablo con firmeza que puesto que fue disenado como proyectil espacial, el cohete lanzado por el Norte de Corea es cierto el lanzamiento de satelite e insistio en que para calificarlo de misil balistica intercontinental, se necesita el cambio considerable del diseno.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo estima la sociedad internacional, el lanzamiento de satelite de la RPDC nunca puede ser una amenaza a otros paises porque evidentemente es una actividad con fines pacificos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. impide el lanzamiento del satelite de la RPDC cuestionandolo como \"amenaza\" a alguien. Si la RPDC obedece al imperio, no podra hacer nunca el lanzamiento de satelite, derecho legal de un Estado soberano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl imperio norteamericano militariza el cosmos en contra de  la demanda de la sociedad internacional y lanza los satelites de distintas misiones, incluso los espias, en cualquier momento y lugar, y lo impide a la RPDC. Es intolerable esta pauta de doble rasero. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debera abandonar primero sus maniobras de militarizacion espacial que es gran amenaza a la paz y seguridad internacionales, en lugar de cuestionar las actividades de la RPDC para desarrollar el espacio, digno ejercicio de soberania de un Estado soberano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. no debe reaccionar demasiado al lanzamiento de satelite de la RPDC con la concepcion de confrontacion sino verlo con los ojos imparciales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLanzar y administrar el satelite de uso practico, aparato indispensable para el desarrollo economico y la prosperidad  del pais, es una demanda legitima de la epoca de las ciencias y tecnicas sofisticadas y una tendencia mundial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa posicion de la RPDC como pais elaborador y lanzador de satelite artificial no se cambia nunca aunque lo niega EE.UU., y la RPDC nunca abandonara el desarrollo espacial arrodillandose ante las \"sanciones\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el futuro tambien la RPDC alcanzara mayores exitos en el desarrollo de cosmos para defender la dignidad de la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSera una ilusion vana el intento de EE.UU. de esperar el derrumbe de la RPDC mediante las \"sanciones\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi EE.UU., preso por el veto a la RPDC, sigue intentando arrebatar a la RPDC el derecho independiente y legitimo, esta se vera obligada a tomar las contramedidas concernientes."
