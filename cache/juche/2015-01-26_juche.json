            "content": "Rodong Sinmun critica actitud dual del Sur de Corea en cuanto al encuentro de familiares separados\r\nPyongyang, 26 de enero (ACNC) -- Ahora las autoridades surcoreanas toman la actitud injusta en cuanto al problema de encuentro de familiares y parientes separados en el Norte y el Sur de Corea. La mandataria surcoreana engano la opinion publica hablando como si la RPDC fuera culpable de la no apertura del encuentro de familiares y parientes separados.\n\t\t\t\t\tEspecificamente, dijo que es necesario \"resolver\" ese problema apartandolo de la \"politica e ideal\" y el Norte (de Corea) debe acudir al dialogo con el \"alma abierta\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas no pueden evitar su responsabilidad por bloquear el dialogo y cooperacion poniendo obstaculos al encuentro de ese tipo con tales palabras que enganan la opinion publica tergiversando la esencia de la situacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi revela el diario Rodong Sinmun en su comentario individual divulgado el dia 26 y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl encuentro de familiares y parientes separados es una labor humanitaria muy importante para la nacion coreana separada artificialmente por las fuerzas extranjeras.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs una costumbre que aun en el tiempo de guerra, ambas partes cesan el fuego si surge el problema humanitario. Pero las autoridades surcoreanas usan hasta la cooperacion humanitaria en sus objetivos de politica conflictiva.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora ellas hablan del \"dialogo\" por una parte y por la otra, declaran que desplegaran segun lo planificado los ejercicios militares conjuntos con EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEntonces, les preguntamos: ?Son compatibles las labores humanitarias y las maniobras de guerra? ?los simulacros belicos para atacar a la parte connacional son mas importantes que el dialogo, la cooperacion y las labores humanitarias?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi las autoridades surcoreanas estan interesadas de veras en el encuentro de familiares y parientes, deberan tomar la valiente decision de eliminar primero los obstaculos principales como las \"medidas del 24 de mayo\" y cancelar los ejercicios de guerra anti-RPDC."
