            "content": "DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman on S. Korea-Japan \"fisheries accord\"  \r\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 29 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK described a new \"fisheries accord\" between South Korea and Japan as a criminal document of aggression and treachery and declared the \"accord\" null and void.\r\n   He made clear this position in a statement issued today after Japan and the South Korean authorities exchanged \"instruments of ratification\" of the new \"accord\" on January 22 to carry it into effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Both in view of content and in view of character, the new \"fisheries accord\" is a criminal document of aggression and treachery, which gravely encroaches upon the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Korean nation, he said, and continued:   The \"accord\" completely ignores Korea's claim to the sovereignty over Tok Islet, part of its territory. It mirrors unilateral interests of Japan in terms of the definition of the waters of jurisdiction.\r\n   The Japanese authorities goaded their South Korean counterparts with neither independence nor principle into signing the shameless \"accord\" of aggression in broad daylight. That fully shows that they are making desperate efforts to realise their wild ambition to stage a comeback to Korea as never before.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The dastardly treachery of the South Korean authorities who do not hesitate to sell off the interests of the nation in a bid to maintain their power and the criminal act of the Japanese authorities who are stretching their crooked tentacles of aggression to Korea give rise to the unanimous indignation from the Korean people. The treachery and criminal act can never be pardoned in any case.\r\n   We never admit the recent \"accord\"which was announced by  a herd of traitors in South Korea who are not entitled to represent all the Korean people rigged up in conspiracy with Japan obsessed by the wild ambition for staging a comeback.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We solemnly declare the \"accord\" null and void.\r\n   The aggressors and traitors have gravely encroached upon the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Korean nation by carrying into effect the \"fisheries accord\" at a time when the situation which can be seen only on the eve of a war is prevailing in the Korean peninsula as a result of reckless military provocation on the part of the U.S., Japan and the South Korean authorities.\r\n   They will certainly face a stern judgement.   \r\n\r\n"

It will unhesitatingly confront anything whether it is missile or nuclear weapon. \r\nIt will certainly win in a war.  This is just the stand and determination of the People's Army and the people of Korea.\r\n   The United States should clearly know that it can not subdue the DPRK with any up to date weapons or means.\r\n   In order to undermine Korean socialism, it employed every conceivable method  an isolation and suffocation policy, appeasement tactics and nuclear threat and military pressure. But none of them bears fruit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As everyone knows, the essence of the current DPRK-U.S. relations is not confrontation over the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction such as nuclear weapons and missile but ideological and political confrontation.\r\n   An ideologically powerful nation is sure to win in confrontation between strength and ideology.\r\n   As long as the United States does not abandon the intention to stifle the Korean socialist system, military conflict and nuclear war are inevitable.\r\n   The People's Army and the people of Korea are alertly watching the U.S. moves for provoking a nuclear war.\r\nIf the United States persists in nuclear confrontation, it will have to pay even for the crimes it committed a hundred years ago.\r\n   A Minju Joson commentary says the Korean people are ready for any nuclear confrontation, stressing it is the DPRK's stand that it cannot but take an appropriate counteraction if the United States persists in nuclear confrontation.   \r\n\r\n"

Jagang province stands in the van of the drive across the country. The province is located in the northern highlands with many steep mountains. The temperature and the ratio of hours of sunshine are low and arable land is limited.\r\n   But the province made use of all possible conditions in the past one year, undergoing a face-lifting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   First of all, it built more than 240 minor power stations along many rivers and streams. It satisfied the needs for electricity of hundreds of industrial establishments and farms and ensured electric heating of many dwelling houses by using more than 17,000 kw of the new generating capacity.\r\n   Songgan county, in particular, puts into the state electricity system the surplus power after meeting its demands for electricity.\r\n   Land construction was powerfully promoted. Last year some 1,740 objects were repaired, exteriors of more than 7,037,000 square meters of buildings painted, about 45,000 square meters of sidewalks mended and roads paved, so that the provincial, city and county seats assumed new looks. The technical security of all roads and bridges was improved.\r\n   By using dams of power stations built in different parts, the province arranged fish farms, readjusted rivers and streams and planted trees through a mass campaign, thus creating beautiful living circumstances.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A bright prospect was opened for increasing the agricultural production as a whole including vegetables and sericulture last year. Particularly, the number of domestic animals increased nearly 100,000 last year.\r\n   General Secretary Kim Jong Il, giving on-site guidance to the work in different sectors of the province early last year, highly praised the fighting spirit of self-reliance of the officials of the province.\r\n   Saying Jagang province has come to make a cheerful march from then on, not the \"arduous march\", he stressed that the whole country should follow the example of the province.   \r\n\r\n\r\n"
