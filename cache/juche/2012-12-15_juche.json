            "content": "Army-People Rallies Hail Successful Satellite Launch\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, December 15 (KCNA) -- There take place army-people rallies in different parts of the DPRK to hail the successful launch of the second version of satellite Kwangmyongsong-3.\n\t\t\t\t\t They were South Hamgyong, North Phyongan and Jagang provinces on Saturday.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Present there were officials of local party and power organs, working people's organizations, industrial establishments, co-op farms, universities, service personnel of the Korean People's Army, working people from all walks of life and youth and students.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Reports were made by Thae Jong Su, chief secretary of the South Hamgyong Provincial Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, Ri Man Gon, chief secretary of the North Phyongan Provincial Committee of the WPK, and Kim Tok Hun, chairman of the Jagang Provincial People's Committee, at the rallies. Then followed speeches.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reporters and speakers said that scientists and technicians of the DPRK succeeded in putting the second version of satellite Kwangmyongsong-3 into its planned orbit at a time when all the people throughout the country were strongly yearning for Generalissimo Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The successful launch of the satellite is a victory brought about by the matchless pluck, grit and extraordinary leadership of the dear respected Kim Jong Un, who has brilliantly translated into reality Kim Jong Il's plan of building a space power, they said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The launch of the satellite orbiting around the earth while giving out the immortal revolutionary hymns \"Song of General Kim Il Sung\" and \"Song of General Kim Jong Il\" is a laudable event as it helped the DPRK further consolidate its position and dealt a sledge-hammer blow at the south Korean puppet forces, they added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that the people all over the world clearly witnessed how Korea of Songun, stronghold of independence, frustrated the despicable reactionaries' obstructive moves and how it launched its satellite into outer space, they noted that all the forces hostile toward the DPRK now find it hard to resort to such a sordid bid as branding the DPRK's satellite launch as the launch of ballistic missile.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They called upon all the army and people of the DPRK to make dynamic efforts for the revolutionary cause of Juche, the revolutionary cause of Songun, true to the leadership of Kim Jong Un with the pride of living and working in the dignified political and military power that possesses satellites."
