This principle means an attitude and stand which calls for firmly maintaining independence in the overall movement for reunification and settling all issues with overriding importance attached to the will and interest of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All members of the nation are not observers but directly responsible for the settlement of the reunification issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nobody can replace the Korean nation in settling the reunification issue related to its destiny. Being a driving force for national reunification, all Koreans should turn out as one in the struggle to implement the joint declaration and play the role as a master. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If members of the nation behave against their principle, yielding to the pressure of foreign forces though they are required to take joint actions, they will not be able to protect the interests of the nation but allow themselves to support the foreign forces in their aggression against fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reunification movement of the Korean nation still assumes complicated and arduous nature as it has to advance amidst fierce confrontation with the forces at home and abroad standing in its way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The times have changed and history has advanced far but there still remain the leftovers of the era of confrontation to block national concord and the reunification movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Failure of Koreans to remain vigilant against this would help the anti-reunification forces bring the achievements made in the movement for independent reunification to naught. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans should come out to counter the anti-reunification offensive under the uplifted banner of the June 15 joint declaration, urges the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
