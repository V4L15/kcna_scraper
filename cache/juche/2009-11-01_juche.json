            "content": "Kim Jong Il Inspects Cooperative Farm\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\tPyongyang, November 1 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il provided field guidance to the Unhung Cooperative Farm in Thaechon County.\n\t\t\t\t\tHe looked at varieties of crops produced by the farm and acquainted himself in detail with the farming this year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe expressed great satisfaction over the fact that officials, farmers and technicians of the farm effectively did all farm work and successfully conducted double cropping, prompted by their ardent patriotic desire to contribute to building a thriving nation, thus bringing about the richest harvest ever known.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe said that the shining success made by the farm this year proved in practice that only when a tenacious drive is waged to increase the fertility of soil and the WPK's policy of green revolution is thoroughly implemented is it possible to make leaping progress in the agricultural production in every place.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is something admirable, indeed, that the officials and other working people of the farm have successfully carried out a vast construction project by themselves while systematically boosting the agricultural production by displaying patriotic devotion, he noted, highly appreciating their feats and extending thanks to them. He gave the farm newly made tractors as gifts in recognition of their feats.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSaying that it is one of the most important tasks for opening the gate to a thriving nation to increase the agricultural production, he indicated important tasks facing the field of agriculture.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe main task to be fulfilled to settle the rural question at present is to continue to thoroughly implement the party's policy of agricultural revolution, he stressed, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe thorough implementation of the party's policy of agricultural revolution provides a fundamental guarantee for bringing about an epochal turn in the agricultural production. What is important for this is to distribute crops and strains on the principle of sowing the right crop on the right soil and at the right time and put manuring and cultivation on a scientific and technological basis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe underscored the need to boldly improve the structure of the nation's agricultural production, to begin with, on the principle of sowing the right crop to the right soil as required by the country's natural and climatic conditions and distribute crops and species best suited to the topographical features and soil conditions of each locality and farm.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNoting that doing well double cropping is a great reserve for boosting the grain produce in the country where the area of cultivated land is limited, he called for developing the double cropping in a big way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn order to do double cropping well it is necessary to properly organize manpower and actively mechanize the farm work for the purpose of solving the acute shortage of manpower and successfully carry out all farm work in good season.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWithout making the green revolution is it impossible to abide by the principle of sowing the right crop to the right soil and in the right season and develop double cropping, he noted, underlining the need for the field of agriculture to establish Juche in cultivating seeds and channel great efforts into obtaining varieties of superior strains suited to the nation's climatic and natural features including high-yielding strains that grow fast and stand cold while requiring less fertilizers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe said that the most important issue arising in implementing the party's policy of agricultural revolution is to positively develop the agro-science and technology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn order to implement the policy of agricultural revolution it is necessary to strengthen the assistance to the countryside and improve the state supply to it and, at the same time, strengthen the guidance to the rural economy and its management.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe expressed great expectation and conviction that the farm would play a vanguard role in implementing the party's policy of agriculture-first policy in the future, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe was accompanied by Kim Phyong Hae, chief secretary of the North Phyongan Provincial Committee of the WPK, and Secretary Kim Ki Nam and Department Directors Pak Nam Gi and Jang Song Thaek of the WPK Central Committee."

Praying at the shrine while burning incense and with hands clasped is as good as an act of resolving to build the \"great Japanese empire\" without fail, cherishing the will of the predecessors who fell in the madcap militarist overseas aggression, and even risk a war if necessary.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThat is why the Asian people are sharply reacting to the visits to the shrine by the Japanese reactionaries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Japanese reactionaries seek, through the visit to the \"Yasukuni shrine\", to justify Japan's history of aggression and imbue its people with the militarist idea, but such scheme will bring nothing but disgraceful destruction to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMilitarism is no more than dead soul that has already been thrown into the dustbin of history with its stern punishment. It is futile to recall the dead soul."
