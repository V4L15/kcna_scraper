No one will lend an ear to its sophism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is seriously mistaken if it thinks it can justify its moves with anti-DPRK sophism. The U.S. is well advised to ponder over the consequences to be entailed by its moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Countries concerned are requested to see through the U.S. true intention of taking issue with the DPRK's \"missile threat\" and take a vigilant approach to it. \r\n\r\n"

This is chiefly attributable to the political aim to use the women issue in achieving a wrong purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan took away many Asian and European women including nearly 200,000 Korean women to reduce them to \"comfort women for the army.\" This is a universally known historical fact. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A correct solution of this problem is an important international issue in the settlement of the women issue and an apology and compensation is a prerequisite for its settlement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Deserved attention should be paid to such unceasing outrages in Japan where hooligans are tearing long skirts of Korean women to pieces and they are exposed to insult and assault prompted by national chauvinism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   GIs' violence towards women in South Korea such as rape, murder and insult should be immediately halted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He called on the session to direct particular attention to the steps to brand violence towards women as a crime without exception, take a legal action against those responsible for it and force them to pay mental and material compensation to the victims of all sorts of insult and violence. \r\n\r\n"
