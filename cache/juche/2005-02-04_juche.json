He continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is nothing but a premeditated political coup to upset the balance of forces in the \"National Assembly\" where the ruling party holds the majority while the opposition camp minority and set the stage for the Grand National Party, a group of pro-American fascists, to grab \"power\" in the next term with the U.S. backing, come what may. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This coup arousing apprehension of people is a serious development that can never be overlooked by any Korean no matter where he lives, because it is aimed to block the process for independence and democracy in the south Korean society and hamstring the implementation of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the GNP and other right-wing fascist forces again dominate the NA in south Korea, it will turn into a theatre of rowdyism of the fascist gangster party and there will be the same fascist rule as was enforced in the past period of military dictatorship. In consequence, the north-south relations will be brought back to those in the era of confrontation and the holocaust of a nuclear war will be imposed upon the Korean nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
