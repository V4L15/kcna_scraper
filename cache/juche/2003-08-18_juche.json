It is the way out for the south Korean people and the way of achieving independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people have shed much blood for democratization. The historic June 15 joint declaration marked an epochal occasion of expanding and consolidating the achievements made by the south Korean people in elementary democratization at the cost of blood and guaranteeing the advance of the movement for independent reunification. This is evidenced by the fact that landmark achievements hardly imaginable in more than 50 years of national division have been made in the last three years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, there is in south Korea the danger of losing all that has been gained. This danger is posed chiefly by the Grand National Party, a cursed traitorous party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As it is doing only the worst things, the south Korean people term it a \"party of a foreign country\" and a \"Nazi party\" and Choe Pyong Ryol who is representative of the party as Choetler likening him to Hitler, the worst criminal in the world. All the fellow countrymen in south Korea do not want to see inter-Korean relations going back to those in the era of distrust and confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is the back-stage force for the GNP. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to prevent the return of the nightmare of the fascist rule to south Korea and clear it of the danger of war, all the south Korean people should turn out as one in the struggle to dislodge the GNP from the political arena and give rise to fiercer anti-U.S. sentiment throughout south Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The base has an airstrip suitable for latest-type aircraft. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Russian warplanes to be deployed in the base will be on a mission to airlift rapid deployment forces to the territories of the member nations of the Collective Security Treaty Organization -- Russia, Belarus, Armenia, Kirgyzstan, Kazakhstan and Tajikistan -- and support their military actions. It is the view of analysts that Russia is planning to form allied forces involving the countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, Russia has staged military manoeuvres to increase the military capacity in this region. In July units of the North Caucasus Military District demonstrated methods of modern war and the might of sophisticated weapons through military exercises. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The intensified military moves of Russia in this region are attributable to the U.S. efforts to establish the sphere of its military domination in the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States, which carried out the Afghan war after the September 11 incident to pave the way of its military presence in the region, has challenged the Russian interests through the eastward expansion of NATO, the Iraqi war and indefinite military presence in the Central Asian region and other areas. It has revealed its intention to establish the sphere of its military domination in the Central Asian region, where Russia has long had concerns, by making use of NATO. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On July 9 a NATO AWACS plane made a demonstration flight over Tbilisi. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n NATO plans to make AWACS aircraft make routine flights over Georgia for the purpose of always keeping Russian military movements under its surveillance without entering the Russian airspace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some time ago, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said the country, in order to defend its security and interests, could not but takes countermeasures against NATO military moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States has had military contacts with not only Georgia but also Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kirgyzstan and other nations in this region to put them in the sphere of NATO's military influence and contain Russia in military and strategic way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the other hand, Russia is boosting bilateral and multilateral relations with Central Asian countries in political, economic, military and all other fields, while calling for the establishment of .a multipolar world and enhancing its position in the international arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Russian President Putin said Russia should become a strong and competitive country in today's hard and bitter race for expanding political and economic influence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the facts imply that the friction between Russia and the United States will get acute as regards the strategic interests in the Central Asian region.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
