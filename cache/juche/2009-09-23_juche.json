This appeal is made by leading newspapers Wednesday in editorials. \n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun notes that the shining victory won in the 150-day campaign helped the DPRK take a fresh giant stride forward in building a thriving nation and opened up a brighter prospect before the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During the 150-day campaign the Korean people fully displayed boundless loyalty in thoroughly carrying out the leader's idea and intention and the party's line and policies with one and the same thought and purpose and such inexhaustible mental power as implementing them in a do-or-die spirit. This period witnessed heroic struggles through which they fully displayed the invincible stamina of Songun Korea by turning impossibility into possibility and bringing about epoch-making changes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The 150-day campaign clearly testified to the fact that the party's intention and determination were entirely just and only victory and glory are in store for the Korean people making a steady advance while struggling with the above-said mental power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The shining victory won in the 150-day campaign is a precious fruition of the energetic and tested guidance of Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the traditional revolutionary mode and fighting spirit of the Korean people to effect uninterrupted innovations and make steady progress for greater victory, not remaining complacent with the achievements already made. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Workers' Party of Korea is calling on all the people to wage a 100-day campaign.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the party members and other working people should make greater leaping advances on all fronts with confidence and optimism about sure victory and thus provide without fail this year a sure guarantee for the final victory in the drive for building a thriving nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are sure to win in the 100-day campaign as long as there are the tested and experienced leadership of the great party, matchless military capability, the unbreakable single-minded unity, the foundation of the powerful self-supporting national economy and a large contingent of those strong in thinking and mental power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson calls upon all the officials and working people to dynamically conduct the 100-day campaign confident of victory and thus glorify this year as a year of great changes and a year of historic leaping advances without fail, the year which will witness a landmark turn in building a thriving nation."

The outside forces for aggression are making desperate efforts to keep Korea divided into two parts indefinitely but they will get them nowhere. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe progressive organizations and people from all walks of life in south Korea are now waging a dynamic movement for national reunification under the banner of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and the October 4 declaration. This is a manifestation of the firm will and faith of the south Korean people to shatter the anti-reunification moves of the separatist forces at home and abroad and achieve the independent reunification through an alliance with the north without fail. It is, at the same time, an expression of the Koreans' indomitable spirit of independence and their fixed will.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo force on earth can keep the homogeneous Korean nation divided indefinitely as it was formed and has developed through a long history or stamp out the national character peculiar to the Koreans. Steadfast are the will and faith of the Koreans to put an end to outside forces' domination and interference and build a reunified thriving nation on this land.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKorea will always remain one. If all the Koreans struggle, united close under the banner of \"By our nation itself\", they will certainly achieve independent reunification, pulling through all difficulties and obstacles lying in the way of national reunification."
