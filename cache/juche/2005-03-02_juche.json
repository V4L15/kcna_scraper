They also appealed to the officials and other working people in the agricultural field to fully apply Juche method of farming and work hard to thoroughly implement the Party's policies for the agricultural revolution including the policy of bringing about a signal turn in the seed improvement and the policy of cultivating two crops a year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They called on those in the field of local industries to make the best use of all possibilities to reenergize the production and, at the same time, concentrate efforts on the projects helpful to the improvement of the standard of people's living and complete them earlier than scheduled. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Party members and other working people should perform feats in the general charge to greet the 60th anniversaries of the WPK and the liberation of the country in hearty response to the appeal of the meeting and thus contribute to glorifying this significant year as the most fruitful and thriving year, they stressed.    \r\n\r\n"

The British Society for Friendship with the DPRK and the British Branch of the Association for Friendship with the Korean People released a similar joint statement on Feb. 20.\r\n Recalling that the U.S. demanded the DPRK scrap its nuclear program first and disarm itself after openly declaring it as a policy to conduct hostile acts against the DPRK and listing it as a target of its preemptive nuclear attack, the joint statements dismissed this as an unreasonable brigandish demand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statements continued: The U.S. is asserting that the DPRK should come out to the six-party talks, while pursuing its aim to stifle socialist Korea. This is nothing but a trick to mislead world public opinion. The U.S. should eliminate its nukes before urging the DPRK to dismantle its nuclear program and talking about the resumption of the six-party talks and abandon its hostile policy aimed to topple the system in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK was entirely just when it decided to suspend its participation in the six-party talks on the nuclear issue for an indefinite period as it is hard to expect any positive results from them due to the vicious hostile policy of the Bush clique. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue much touted by media of imperialist countries is an invention of the U.S. imperialists and it is no more than leverage to stifle the DPRK by force of arms and infringe upon its sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the meantime, Secretary of the Mfumalanga Provincial Committee of the South African Communist Party Juda Tsootetsi who is chairman of the South African Association of Friendship and Solidarity with the Korean People also published a similar statement on Feb. 15.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is working hard to impose economic blockade upon the DPRK and stifle it militarily under the pretext of nuclear issue. The Japanese reactionaries are dreaming of staging comeback to Korea and laying hurdles in the way of its reunification and independent development, availing themselves of the U.S. imperialists' moves to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Outsiders' domination and interference and their moves for aggression and war are main threats to the destiny of the Korean nation and stumbling blocks lying in the way of its unity and reunification and a main source of hamstringing the accomplishment of the cause of national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to stage a strenuous nationwide struggle to get the U.S. forces withdrawn from south Korea and put an end to the U.S. interference in the internal affairs of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is essential to decisively frustrate Japan's moves to stage comeback to Korea. Japan still remains the sworn enemy of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans should foil Japan's ambition to reinvade Korea with a strong will to force it to settle the crimes it has committed for the last one century and give vent to the towering grudge of the Korean people without fail this year, 100 years after the \"Ulsa Five-point Treaty\" was fabricated by the Japanese imperialists in a brigandish manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the fellow countrymen should turn out as one to realize cooperation for national independence, cooperation for peace against war and cooperation for reunification and patriotism, bearing deep in mind that it is vital for the Koreans to achieve those three forms of cooperation and thus meet the challenge of foreign aggressor forces and advance the cause of independent reunification with their might. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson says that no matter how desperately the anti-DPRK, anti-reunification forces at home and abroad work, they can never bar the Korean people from building a great prosperous powerful reunified nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Urged by the heinous intention to provoke a nuclear war against the DPRK, the U.S. even carried out an exercise of dropping mock nuclear warheads in its military base in south Korea. This makes it easy to guess where lies the true purpose of the U.S. policy of occupation of south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north, the south and overseas should turn out in the nationwide anti-U.S. struggle for ending its policy of occupation of south Korea with the might of the three forms of cooperation -- cooperation for national independence, cooperation for peace against war and cooperation for reunification and patriotism -- under the patriotic slogan \"Let us not allow the U.S. forces to stay in south Korea more than six decades!\"    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
