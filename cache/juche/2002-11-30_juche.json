Korea demanded \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 29 (KCNA) -- Rallies of teachers and students of Kim Hyong Jik University of Education and Pyongyang Ryongwang Middle School were held on Nov. 28 denouncing the verdict of not guilty given to the GI murderers of schoolgirls in South Korea.\r\n Speakers said at the rallies that the GIs killed the schoolgirls by an armored car in broad daylight, but the U.S. military court declared them not guilty, adding that this brigandish action clearly shows the true colours of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces as man-killers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They continued. This outrageous action committed by the GIs should no longer be tolerated and the U.S. imperialists should be forced to pay for the blood shed by Koreans generation after generation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They dismissed the GIs' arrogant action as an insult not only to the South Korean people but to all Koreans and a blatant challenge to justice, conscience, and ethics and morality and bitterly condemned the sworn enemy U.S. imperialists, the root cause of all misfortune, sufferings and evils, on behalf of all teachers and students. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is only the U.S. imperialists who openly declared the killers not guilty, they noted, strongly calling upon all Koreans to turn out in the sacred anti-U.S. war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean newspapers urged to think twice\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 29 (KCNA) -- Segye Ilbo, Choongang Ilbo, Kyunghyang Daily News and other newspapers of South Korea are spreading the misinformation that the DPRK was to blame for the suspension of the projects of reconnecting rail and road links between the north and the south. In this regard papers here today carry signed commentaries.\r\n Citing the facts to prove that the United States is to blame for bringing the mine clearing to suspension and making it impossible to push forward the projects as scheduled, a commentary of Rodong Sinmun says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some media of South Korea are imprudent and hasty. They were trying to shift the responsibility for the suspended projects onto the DPRK before it responded to the south side's proposal to discontinue the inspection of mine clearing. The DPRK cannot but ask if they were not requested by someone to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It cannot but question for whom they spoke. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The projects were suspended due to the south side's dependence on foreign forces. If some media of South Korea truly wanted inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation, they should have carried articles bringing the military authorities to account for delaying the projects, yielding to foreign forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Not content with slandering the DPRK, some media of South Korea clamored about the \"dual nature\", pulling up the DPRK over its promulgation of a decree on setting up the Mt. Kumgang Tourist Zone. This only revealed that they are too talkative. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nGarrulity makes a mess of things. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A commentary of Minju Joson says that if the South Korean newspaper Dong-a Ilbo takes such a treacherous road as putting a brake on the process of improving the inter-Korean relations, it will be cursed and condemned by the nation. It is well advised to take a right path, though belatedly, not lamenting its folly, the commentary warns.    \r\n\r\n"
