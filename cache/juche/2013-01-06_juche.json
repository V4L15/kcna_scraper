It is perpetrating a war for aggression, violating the sovereignty of other countries. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is free to cook up illegal international law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is evidenced by the fact that it attempted to fabricate \"a convention on state responsibility\" as a legal lever for justifying  interference in the internal affairs of any sovereign country and the use of force against it under the pretext of \"violation of international law\" in recent years and cooked up the PSI aimed at naval blockade against anti-imperialist, independent countries under the pretext of \"preventing the spread of WMDs,\" etc. and worked hard to upgrade it as an international legal system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. deployed more than 1 000 nuclear weapons in south Korea contrary to NPT, turning it into the biggest nuclear outpost and the most dangerous source of a nuclear war in the Far East. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is also staging ceaseless drills of various forms for a nuclear war in south Korea and its vicinity, escalating the nuclear threat to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is applying double standards, classifying international treaties into those essential and unnecessary for it. Moreover, it ignores the treaties. It was none other than the U.S. which unilaterally scrapped the interceptor missile limitation treaty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. contends that it has an \"international legal standard\" to judge right or wrong, it is allowed to do everything and other countries should unconditionally obey its intention. This U.S.-style brigandish logic is no longer workable."

Korean Authorities' Choice\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, January 6 (KCNA) -- The north-south relations stand at the crossroads of dialogue and confrontation, peace and war. The future developments entirely depend on what option the south Korean authorities will take.\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson says this in a bylined commentary.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak group of traitors is letting loose a spate of confrontational remarks bedeviling the inter-Korean relations from the outset of the new year, quite contrary to the nation's desire. This behavior is intolerable as it is a blatant challenge and deliberate provocation to the army and people of the DPRK, the commentary says and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What merits a serious attention is that the group dared hurt the dignity of the DPRK supreme leadership, blustering that \"north's new leadership should not be bound to the Cold War-minded framework\" and \"it should opt for reforms and opening\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group's recent reckless remarks hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK is just a deliberate action to strain the situation by getting on its nerves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The tenure of the office of the puppet group is to expire soon. What fate the traitors will face is as clear as a pikestaff. Under this situation the group is making desperate efforts to ignite a war by escalating the tension in its remaining days.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Already clarified was a principled stand of the DPRK to subordinate everything to the great objective of national reunification, the nation-wide cause, from the stand of giving priority to the nation, attaching importance to the nation and achieving unity of the nation this year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It takes two to make a quarrel, concludes the commentary."
