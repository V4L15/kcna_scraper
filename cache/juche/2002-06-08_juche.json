            "content": "Kim Jong Il gives field guidance to various places \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 8 (KCNA) - General Secretary Kim Jong Il gave field guidance to the Ryongsong Machine Complex and the Hamhung branch of the academy of sciences on June 7.\r\n The first leg of his field guidance was the Ryongsong Machine Complex, a leading large machine-building centre. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went round various places to acquaint himself in detail with the production and saw various new types of machines. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He noted with great satisfaction that the workers of the complex have produced excellent creations greatly conducive to the prosperity and development of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Describing their manufacture of uptodate machines by their own efforts on the basis of indigenous technology in a matter of several months as a big success, he highly praised their feats. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Seeing the 20-meter large lathe, he recalled that the complex has performed great feats in producing a 6,000-ton press, a 10,000-ton press and many other large machines and ordered equipment for the past decades. He proposed to award the title of hero to the lathe which has operated with the workers of the complex. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We could successfully realize the socialist industrialization in so short span of time and rapidly increase the economic potential of the country, strongly backed by many powerful machine plants such as the Ryongsong Machine Complex, he said. This proves the validity and the great vitality of the WPK's unique economic line of giving priority to the development of the heavy industry with the machine-building industry as its core, while developing the light industry and agriculture simultaneously. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Putting forward highly important tasks to be fulfilled by the complex, he underscored the need to push ahead with the process of placing the complex on a modern and scientific basis and widely introduce advanced technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then, he moved on to the Hamhung branch of the academy of sciences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went round various places of the branch for a long while to learn in detail about technological equipment and scientific researches. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He highly praised the scientists of the branch for their many achievements made in scientific researches in recent years. We are highly proud of having a large contingent of scientists and technicians, the priceless asset and treasure of the country and the nation, he noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that the WPK and the people have very great expectation for the scientists and technicians, he advanced highly important tasks which would serve as a guideline in their work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He called on all the scientists and technicians to become ardent patriots and revolutionaries and establish such a revolutionary trait in researches as going down to keep abreast of the vibrating reality and settling scientific and technological matters arising in different sectors of the national economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that if the country is to prosper, the scientists should set up many scientific hypotheses, prerequisite to practice, he set forth specific tasks and ways to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That day he met with two couples dr. Kim Sok Gun and dr. Kang Suk Gi, dr. Nam Jong Su and dr. Ryu Kyong Ok, researchers of the branch, had a talk with them and highly praised them for their many feats made in scientific researches for years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by Kim Kuk Thae and Kim Ki Nam, secretaries of the WPK Central Committee, and Ju Kyu Chang, its first vice department director.     \r\n\r\n"

This is a brigandish act of aggression and means state terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is busy staging computer mock exercises pursuant to the top secret war scenario. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday what disastrous consequences will be entailed by these reckless moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose forces formally listed the DPRK, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, China and Russia as the targets of their nuclear attacks. This is little short of making the U.S. use of nuclear weapons in the \"anti-terrorism war\" an established fact. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. self-justified and high-handed practices can never go down with the DPRK.\r\n The U.S. bellicose forces' attempt to ignite a war of aggression against the DPRK compels it to take corresponding countermeasures. The right to take an option does not reside with the U.S. only. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is seriously mistaken if it thinks it can overrun other countries with a military edge over them. The U.S. is well advised to face up to the reality and give up its reckless attempt. \r\n  \r\n"
