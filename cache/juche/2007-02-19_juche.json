            "content": "End to U.S. Hostile Policy toward DPRK Demanded at Int'l Meeting \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 18 (KCNA) -- An international meeting was held here on Feb. 17 in demand of an end to the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK. It was co-sponsored by the International Liaison Committee for Reunification and Peace in Korea and the Korean Committee for Solidarity with the World People. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The meeting was attended by delegations and delegates of international bodies such as the World Peace Council and the organizations for friendship and solidarity with the Korean people from countries and regions of Asia, Europe, Africa, Americas, and Oceania. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present there were delegates of the Korean Committee for Solidarity with the World People, the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea, the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League, the Korean Democratic Women's Union, the Korean Democratic Lawyers Association, the Korean National Peace Committee, the Korean Committee for Solidarity with Asia and Africa and officials concerned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The meeting laid bare the nature and injustice of the U.S. anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK, the very source of the tense situation on the Korean Peninsula and the danger of war to it, and discussed issues arising in ensuring peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The floor was taken first by Raymond Ferguson, national secretary general of the Australia-DPRK Friendship and Cultural Association. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kamal Haider, vice-president of the World Peace Council, in a keynote report, said that it is the unanimous desire of the Korean people and the world progressive people to completely clear the Korean Peninsula of the danger of war and bring lasting peace to it. It is entirely due to the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK that the situation is further deteriorating on the peninsula as the days go by quite contrary to their desire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said U.S. policy is aimed at completely stifling the DPRK. It is an infringement on sovereignty and a criminal act unprecedented in history as it constitutes a gross violation of the UN Charter and international law calling for observing the principle of respect for sovereignty, non-interference in other's internal affairs, territorial integrity, nonaggression and equality and mutual benefit among sovereign states. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is due to the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK that the DPRK-U.S. relations remain tensest on the world political arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the process of the six-party talks clearly shows, the U.S. is not using dialogue as a lever for seeking a genuine settlement of the U.S.-DPRK ties but for implementing its policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is keen to hurl not only its forces present in the Asia-Pacific region but those in its mainland and forces of its allies into a new Korean war to be provoked by it and busy egging Japan on to stage a comeback to Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-mentioned U.S. policy compelled the DPRK to have access to nuclear deterrence for self-defence in order to protect its security as it regards sovereignty as its life and soul. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It would be a right choice for the U.S. for meeting its own national interests to drop its hostile policy towards the DPRK and withdraw its forces from south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Mun Jae Chol, chairman of the Korean Committee for Solidarity with the World People, said in a supplementary report that the nature of the U.S. policy lies, above all, in that it is aimed at committing state-sponsored terrorism to attack and bring down the dignified socialist system centered on the popular masses chosen by the Korean people themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This policy is a policy of aggression aimed at stifling and controlling the DPRK by force of arms and an anti-reunification policy aimed at totally blocking the reconciliation and unity and cooperation and exchanges between the north and the south of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has firmly defended the ideology, system and sovereignty of the country from the U.S. military threat and sanctions as it holds Kim Jong Il, peerlessly great man born of Heaven, in high esteem. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will wage this year a dynamic struggle to smash every move of the U.S. to strangle the DPRK and accomplish the cause of national reunification, the cherished desire of the nation, holding aloft the slogan \"Add brilliance to the June 15 reunification era by attaching importance to the nation, maintaining peace and achieving unity!\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSpeeches were made by Anders Kristensen, secretary general of the Nordic Cooperation Committee for Friendship and Solidarity with the Korean People, Daniel Alvarez Celi, chairman of the Ecuadorian Committee for Supporting Korea's Independent and Peaceful Reunification, Abdel Azim El Maghraby, asst. secretary general of the Arab Lawyers Union, and others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An appeal to the world progressives that love justice and peace was adopted at the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It calls for a vigorous world-wide campaign demanding the U.S. abandon its policy towards the DPRK, a policy of high-handed and arbitrary practices. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also calls for staging in different parts of the world a movement for exposing the injustice of the U.S. forces' presence in south Korea and forcing it to withdraw its troops from south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It calls for positively supporting the Korean people in their just cause of defending peace on the Korean Peninsula and independently reunifying Korea in every way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A message to U.S. Congress was adopted at the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It warns that if U.S. congress overlooks the policy of the present administration aimed at settling all issues by force of arms, prompted by its unilateral and self-justified way of thinking, it will not be able to escape protest and condemnation from the world progressives and an international isolation and find itself in a tighter corner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is our expectation that you will exercise influence upon the present administration to make a new and positive switchover in its policy towards the DPRK, cogitating about the heavy responsibility and duty you have assumed before your people as politicians, it said.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Stop to Suppression of Koreans in Japan Urged\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 18 (KCNA) -- The press headquarters of the South Side Committee for Implementing the June 15 Joint Declaration reportedly made public a statement on Feb. 13 urging the Japanese public security authorities and ultra right forces to immediately stop the violation of the rights of Koreans in Japan and the political suppression of them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement referred to the fact that the Japanese police authorities mobilized a lot of armed policemen on Feb. 6 to search the office of the Hyogo Prefectural Headquarters of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) and other Chongryon-related facilities and walked away the chief of the Business Office of the Hyogo Prefectural Commercial Association. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said actions committed by the Japanese ultra-right forces against Koreans in Japan are a wanton violation of Chongryon's rights and political crackdown upon it, the statement said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Koreans in Japan were compelled to live in a foreign land entirely because the Japanese reactionaries forcibly drafted a large number of Koreans in a bid to force them to do slave labor at their coal mines and munitions factories when Korea was under Japan's military occupation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n The Japanese reactionaries look down upon and suppress Koreans in Japan instead of making an apology for the past crimes. This is the height of impudence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will never remain an onlooker to these outrages of the Japanese ultra-right forces.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
