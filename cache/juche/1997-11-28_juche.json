As for the south Korean economy, it is an empty \"economy\" depending on outside monopoly capital. The flunkeyist and treacherous, reactionary policies of depending on outsiders pursued by  Kim Young Sam made the south Korean economy with its structural vulnerability take a \"fatal disease\" of total bankruptcy, far from growth. It is he who plunged the south Korean economy into an irretrievable catastrophic crisis by pursuing big business-led economic policy which fans the crisis and committing ultra-large scandals including the Hanbo incident. It is all the more wicked that he attempted to shuffle off the blame for the catastrophic economic crisis on to the working people.\r\n   The south Korean workers' call for wage hike is an elementary demand for their existence. Nevertheless, Kim Young Sam revealed his attempt to ruthlessly crack down on the workers' struggle for the right to existence at the point of the bayonet, branding their demand as \"collective egoism\". He cannot but be labelled the enemy of the working people.\r\n   It cannot be overlooked that he said in the \"statement\" that anyone should not be charged or called to task for the present economic crisis but all should \"share burdens of pains\" and \"turn out to overcome the crisis\". His remarks are a brigandish sophism that anyone should not call him to account for his arch crime but obey his treacherous misrule. \r\n   \r\n"

Why did they do illegal photographing in Russia ?\r\n   The reason for it can be explained by the fact that the Japanese cameramen wormed their way into Russia and did photographing against the DPRK, a sovereign state, without legal permit from the Russian side.\r\n   It is clear that for the purpose of finding faults with the DPRK, they who had been bribed by those hostile toward the DPRK took unwarranted photographs of our area and north Korean lumbermen in Russia beyond the boundary of the DPRK.  \r\n  We cannot remain a passive onlooker to the dirty act of the Japanese cameramen to tarnish the high dignity of the DPRK. \r\n   It is advisable for them to be mindful of a Japanese saying that when you start a thing, you should think of its result.  \r\n   We believe that as the incident took place in Russia, the truth will be made clearer by investigation on the part of a Russian agency concerned.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
