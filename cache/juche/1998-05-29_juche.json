            "content": "May folk festival: Tano\r\n Pyongyang, May 29 (KCNA) -- Tano is a traditional Korean folk festival. It is the fifth day of the fifth lunar month. \r\nThis year Tano falls on May 30. In olden times, the peasants held this festival while preparing weeding and other farmwork after sowing seeds. They had this holiday, enjoying beautiful scenery.\r\n   Our ancestors celebrated the may festival from antiquity.\r\n   Historically there was some difference in the festive events and contents. But it has been handed down as a traditional folk festival.\r\n   The 18th century record \"Three Periods of Korea\" calls this day the \"Suri Day\" and explains its reason: \"Tano is called the Suri day. Suri means cart wheel. On this day people pounded picked mugwort hard, mixed it with rice flour, pounded it again and made fresh green mugwort rice cake in the shape of cart wheel and ate it. Hence the Suri Day.\"\r\n   People prepared and ate special foods, celebrating this festival. Popular festival foods were steamed rice cake, mugwort rice cake, cake flavoured with pine endodermis and fermented rice cake. Mugwort rice cake was an absolute must for the may festival.\r\n   On this holiday people, men and women and young and old, wore silk gauze, fine gauze and other thin silk clothes, adding to festive atmosphere. Various joyful games were played on the festival. Swinging and wrestling were most popular and tug of war, somersault and mask dance were popular in some localities.\r\n   Today, too, the Korean people observe this traditional festival.      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n"

Shenin, Chairman of the Council of the Union of Communist Parties-the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and Branko Kitanovic, General Secretary of the New Yugoslav Communist Party, in support of his historic letter \"Let Us Reunify the Country Independently and Peacefully Through the Great Unity of the Entire Nation\".\r\n   O. Shenin said that the proposal advanced by Kim Jong Il is good one that helps carry out the behests of President Kim Il Sung and fully reflects the requirement of the present struggle for the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea.\r\n   Branko Kitanovic said that the five-point policy of great national unity is the most realistic and reasonable political charter that indicates a short cut for achieving the vital interests of the Korean nation and peace and security. He wished the Korean people fresh success in their efforts for implementing the policy.    \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n"

The fighters and marine corps are a task force serving for the execution of the U.S. Korea and Asia military strategy.\r\n   Rodong Sinmun today berates the U.S. warmongers for frequently staging reckless war exercises for a forestalling attack on the DPRK with such means of war.\r\n   It is the keypoint of the U.S. policy of strength towards Asia to start the second Korean War with the U.S. troops present in South Korea and Japan as the main force and dominate the whole of Korea, the daily says in a commentary, and continues:\r\n   We associate the military exercises of the United States with its noncompliance with the framework agreement with the DPRK. The United States is playing hide-and-seek as regards the agreement. It has persistently sought to stifle the DPRK by military force, while breaking its promise.\r\n   We will as ever increase the country's defence capacity, constantly attaching importance to the military affairs, and keep oursevles fully prepared to smash the enemy's surprising invasion.\r\n   The United States must discard the unattainable desire. \r\n\r\n"

No matter how desperately they may try, they can never dominate Asia.\r\n   If they continue trying for overseas expansion, they will have nothing to get but ruin.\r\n   The Japanese government must clearly see the trend of the time and give up the adventurous design of overseas expansion.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
