If Japan recklessly \"intercepts\" the DPRK's satellite for peaceful purposes, the KPA will mercilessly deal deadly blows not only at the already deployed intercepting means but at major targets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. The U.S. should immediately withdraw its already deployed armed forces if it does not wish to be hurt by the above-said strike as DPRK clarified its stand on its projected satellite launch for peaceful purposes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. The south Korean puppet bellicose forces should refrain from disturbing the said launch, the pride of the nation, while currying favor with their U.S. and Japanese masters."

Rodong Sinmun Thursday says this in a signed article. \n\t\t\t\t\t It is the great exploits performed by Kim Il Sung in the cause of national reunification that he gave steady continuity to the said cause by consistently maintaining the line of one Korea, the line of reunification, and laid down the three charters for national reunification, providing a strong mainstay for achieving national independence and reunification, the article notes, and goes on: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The divided Korean nation should be reunified as one without fail. The issue of national reunification should be settled by the Koreans themselves according to their wishes and will free from foreign interference under any circumstances. This is the quintessence of the above-said line consistently maintained and implemented by Kim Il Sung in the whole course of the struggle to accomplish the cause of national reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said three charters are a reunification programme common to the nation the keynote of which are the  three principles of national reunification, the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation and the proposal for founding the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The President deemed it a principle of great national unity to subordinate everything to the cause of national reunification irrespective of ideology, political view and religion and helped whoever desirous of national reunification take the road of reunification and patriotism with his immensely broad-minded magnanimity and tolerance. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Grand festivals for reunification and pan-national rallies took place with fellow countrymen in the north and the south and abroad attending and the Pan-national Alliance for Korea's Reunification representing the will of all fellow countrymen for reunification was formed. The patriotic forces for reunification in different places in the north and the south and abroad have grown to be a driving force and are united closer than ever before under the banners of the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration. All these developments would be unthinkable without the indefatigable leadership provided by the President for strengthening the forces for reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said feats are the immensely precious legacies bequeathed by the President to the Korean people and nation and solid assets for accomplishing the cause of national reunification.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe President's distinguished and seasoned leadership over the movement for national reunification has been creditably carried forward by General Secretary Kim Jong Il who is identical to the President in the idea, leadership art and personality."

Si Japon comete la imprudencia de \"interceptar\" nuestro satelite pacifico, el EPC abrira implacable y rotundo fuego contra los medios interceptores desplegados ya y otros blancos importantes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Ya que EE.UU. expuso claramente su posicion en cuanto al lanzamiento de nuestro satelite pacifico, debe evacuar a sus fuerzas armadas emplazadas si no quiere sufrir danos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Los belicistas titeres surcoreanos no deben incurrir en acciones que obstaculizan el lanzamiento de nuestro satelite, que deviene un orgullo nacional, en su aduloneria a sus amos norteamericano y japones."
