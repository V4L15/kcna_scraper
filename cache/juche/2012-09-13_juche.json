Korean Puppet Group's Mockery of DPRK over Issue of Relief Aid Slammed \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, September 13 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Central Committee of the DPRK Red Cross Society gave the following answer to the question put by KCNA on Sept. 12 as regards the south Korean puppet regime's mockery of the DPRK over the issue of flood relief aid to it:\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean Red Cross on Sept. 3 sent a notice proposing to have a Red Cross contact between the north and the south, saying the south would \"render sincere aid without any conditions\" allegedly to help the north recover from the flood damage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An extremely tense situation is prevailing in Korea due to the south Korean puppet regime's reckless moves for a war, but we sent a notice to the south Korean Red Cross asking it to let us know about items and quantity of the aid materials, clarifying its stance to take into consideration the proposal if the latter provides goods substantially helpful to bringing the living of the inhabitants in the afflicted areas to normal and recovering from the damage in the spirit of humanitarianism. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We, at the same time, made it clear that if the south Korean authorities seek to make a mockery of us over the issue of flood relief aid as they did in the past, this kind of offer is worse than sending nothing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the south Korean Red Cross in its notice on Sept. 11 seriously insulted us again by offering to send a negligible quantity of goods to us.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group did not have even an iota of intention to sincerely help us recover from the damage from the very outset.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When different countries of the world and international bodies were rendering sincere help to us, the south Korean puppet regime chilled the atmosphere of aid to us, claiming that \"the north is exaggerating its flood damage.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Worse still, when non-governmental organizations of south Korea intended to send relief goods to us, the south Korean regime disallowed the action, talking about \"papers confirming the distribution of them\" and \"field confirmation.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It persistently insisted on disallowing the offer of rice, cement and equipment for rehabilitation, in particular, claiming that those things\" can be diverted to other purposes.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This goes to clearly prove that the south Korean puppet group's proposal to offer aid is nothing but a gesture to gain gratitude and save its face under the public pressure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There have been not a few cases of humanitarian cooperation between the north and the south of Korea so far but never has there been such mean group as the Lee Myung Bak group which made a mockery of the noble spirit of humanitarianism of Red Cross.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We were really shocked to see the Red Cross of south Korea joining the group of traitors in using the natural disaster that hit compatriots for its sinister aim as its marionette.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said action brought to light again the evil mind and ulterior motive of the puppet group. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From the outset we did not expect anything from the puppet authorities as regards the flood damage but their behavior increased our feelings of disillusion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group is doomed to meet the most miserable end, cursed by all Koreans, as it is bereft of elementary ethics and morality and even an iota of reason for being crazy for confrontation with compatriots."

Pero, nadie actuo tan groseramente como la banda de Lee Myung Bak insultando el noble espiritu humanitario de la cruz roja. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs muy ridiculo el que la Sociedad de la Cruz Roja del Sur de Corea abuse de los desastres naturales de la parte connacional actuando como titere de la banda traidora. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe han revelado una vez mas las entranas malignas y sucias de la banda de traidores surcoreanos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn cuanto a los danos por las inundaciones, no hemos depositado desde el principio ninguna esperanza en las autoridades surcoreanas titeres y se ha aumentado esta vez la decepcion sobre ellas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda del traidor Lee Myung Bak, que enloquecida por la confrontacion fratricida, ya perdio hasta la etica y moralidad elementales y el juicio del hombre, no podra evadir el arruinamiento mas tragico por la condena de toda la nacion."
