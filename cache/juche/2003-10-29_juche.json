The DPRK thus completely pulled out of NPT on January 11, 2003. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an internationally recognized fact that the DPRK is no longer bound to the Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA according to Article 3 of NPT as it withdrew from the treaty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has, therefore, nothing to do with IAEA. It has long forgotten the IAEA and feels no need to say about it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some days ago the IAEA adopted a \"resolution\" calling for the \"DPRK's return to NPT,\" slandering it for its withdrawal from the treaty. This time it presented its \"annual report for 2002\" to the UN General Assembly in which it attacked the DPRK. These facts clearly prove how brazen-faced the IAEA has become in its effort to slander and harm the DPRK in the international arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The IAEA shuts its eyes to the U.S. moves to increase its nuclear threat to the DPRK in wanton violation of the NPT and the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework and is pressurizing Pyongyang to fulfil its obligation, fully disclosing the body's true colours as a political maid of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The IAEA is turning aside the DPRK reasonable proposal for a package solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula based on the principle of simultaneous actions. Its behaviour is intolerable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The IAEA is only vociferous about the \"enriched uranium program\" and \"non-compliance with the Safeguards Agreement,\" echoing only the words of its master forgetful of its status and position whereby it has impartiality as part of its mission. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is shame on the IAEA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a pity that the U.N. has such partial and prejudiced agency acting under the pulls and strings of the U.S., bereft of any independent view.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Not content with this, the U.S. is going to additionally deploy 3 or 4 more high-speed transports there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is scheming to transfer an aircraft carrier from the U.S. mainland to Hawaii or Guam, have naval ships constantly deployed on the Korean East Sea and improve the submarine hunting capabilities, targeting the DPRK. Such military moves practically show that the U.S. is resorting to every conceivable means to ignite a nuclear war against the DPRK at any cost, balking at peacefully settling the nuclear issue with the DPRK through dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those U.S. moves to stifle the DPRK compel the latter to take appropriate self-defensive measures.

He was so reckless as to describe its top leader as a \"dictator\" and express \"loathing\" for him.\r\n The reported outbursts are touching off bitter indignation of all the Korean people and servicepersons of the People's Army as they are unpardonable remarks undisguisedly revealing his habitual rejection of the DPRK's supreme headquarters and social system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Bush actually said so, it would prove that his earlier remarks listing the DPRK as part of an \"axis of evil\" and a \"target of its preemptive nuclear attack\" still remain the core of the U.S. policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bush talked about giving \"written security assurances\" to the DPRK and seeking a \"peaceful settlement of the issue through dialogue\". As if he had said nothing, he continued hurling mud at the DPRK. This suggests that he lacks qualification as a politician and his remarks about the \"written security assurances\" to the DPRK were not prompted by his true intention to settle the problem. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration's loudmouthed \"concession\" and \"peaceful settlement\" are, in the final analysis, nothing but a sleight of hand to win in the next presidential election. This goes to prove that the U.S. does not seek to co-exist with the DPRK by finding a solution to the issue but disarm it and overthrow its political system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bush claims to be president of the world's only superpower. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBut his disqualification as a politician finds an expression in that he has no elementary way of thinking to analyze the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the DPRK's economic problem touted by Bush is concerned, it arose because the U.S. has pursued a hostile policy toward the DPRK for over half a century, imposing harsh economic sanctions against the DPRK and posing a grave threat to the existence of the Korean people and creating difficulties in their way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bush, however, said nothing of the U.S. crimes committed against the DPRK but attributed what he called \"starvation\" to the DPRK's supreme headquarters. This is unjustifiable and intolerable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world knows many political leaders. But it is only leader Kim Jong Il who gives field guidance day and night to solve the problem of people's living. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an anachronistic and foolish behavior to speak ill of the DPRK's supreme headquarters this or that way because it convinces no one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We solemnly state that the DPRK's supreme headquarters and the precious popular system enjoy the absolute trust of all the people and that any mud-slinging at them is what we guard against most strongly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people and People's Army of the DPRK regard it as the primary requirement of their life to devotedly defend the supreme headquarters representing their life and soul and do not hesitate to dedicate their lives to protecting it, a symbol of national dignity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to stop its rash acts, clearly mindful that with nothing can it break the single-hearted unity of the DPRK.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
