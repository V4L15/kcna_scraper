On this basis he founded a genuine people's government in the liberated country, setting an example of the times in solving the issue of power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history of the development of the people's power in the DPRK is associated with the energetic leadership of Kim Jong Il who has successfully carried forward the idea of building the Juche-oriented power and the exploits of the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il has wisely led the work of the people's power of the DPRK, ensuring that it steadily enhanced its function and role as the representative of sovereign rights of the popular masses, organizer of creative ability and activities and the master responsible for people's living as required by the cause of modeling the whole society on the Juche idea. He made sure that the Socialist Constitution was revised and supplemented to be the Kim Il Sung Constitution, thereby rounding off the state machinery in the DPRK as required by the era of Songun. This constitutes an immortal historical exploit performed by Kim Jong Il for accomplishing the cause of Juche and achieving the prosperity of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The election today marks an important occasion in fully demonstrating the might of single-minded unity of all the people around Kim Jong Il and their steadfast faith and will to firmly defend and glorify man-centered Korean socialism to the last. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il provides a sure guarantee for victory in strengthening the people's power and building a great prosperous powerful nation. All the people should successfully ensure the election and thus fully demonstrate before the world their strong faith and ardent enthusiasm to uphold the Songun politics of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson calls upon the people to take part in the election with the high awareness as citizens in order to reinforce the revolutionary power of the DPRK as firm as a rock.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is the very reason why the international community so sensitively reacts to the moves of Japan to distort history and cover up its past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is a growing tendency to take issue with Japan's past crimes even in the United States. This fact clearly proves that the international community considers this as a serious political matter at present. With nothing can Japan cover up its past crimes or evade its responsibility for them just as the sun can never be eclipsed by palms.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Hypocritical and Unpopular Nature of Election System under Capitalism under Fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 29 (KCNA) -- The \"freedom\" and \"democracy\" advocated by the imperialists and their mouthpieces are unpopular freedom and democracy as they protect the interests of a handful of exploiting classes only and infringe upon the rights and interests of the overwhelming majority of the toiling masses. This is well illustrated by the hypocritical and unpopular nature of the election system under capitalism. Rodong Sinmun Sunday observes this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Election in the capitalist society is unthinkable without money. During the presidential election in 1860 Presidential Candidate Lincoln spent 100,000 dollars, a big amount of money in those days, and during the presidential election campaign in 1952 Eisenhower and his rival were known to have spent a total of 11 million dollars, stunning people. During the presidential election in 1972 two decades later the election funds spent by the Republican and Democratic Parties surpassed one hundred million dollars. The amount of the money spent during the presidential election in 2000 reached 2.5-3 billion dollars, even according to the information released by American media. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The same is the case with Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During a House of Representatives election in Japan candidates each spent the same amount of money as what an ordinary worker had to save for a hundred years without using even a single penny for food and clothes, taking the public by surprise. What was more surprising was that there was rumor that a candidate required 500 million yen to win the election. It is, therefore, something unimaginable for an ordinary worker to be a Dietman in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The election system under capitalism imposes a lot of restrictions upon the electorate, excluding broad strata of toiling masses from the election, the article notes, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  According to the \"election law\" in the U.S., a citizen of 18 and above has the right to elect and in case of the Senate a citizen of 30 and above has the right to be elected to it and a citizen of 25 and above has the right to be elected to the House of Representatives. It is said that men and women citizens of 35 and above who have lived for more than 14 years since their birth in the U.S. are eligible to run for presidency. It is stipulated by the \"election law\" in the U.S. that one has suffrage only when one meets more than 60 conditions including property status, education, period of residence, occupation, race and nationality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Tens of millions of people are excluded from the election due to various kinds of restrictions including lack of property. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the election under capitalism is characterized by fraudulence and corruption, the article stresses: All facts go to prove that \"equality for all,\" \"freedom\" and \"democracy\" much touted by the imperialists and their mouthpieces are nothing but hypocritical slogans for pulling the wool over the eyes of the toiling masses and covering up the unpopular nature of the capitalist system.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It was a fascist law which called for harshly suppressing assembly, association and demonstration and all other activities of Koreans and patriotic people and organizations any time when the Japanese imperialists deem courting their displeasure. Rodong Sinmun Saturday says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: The \"security law\" made itself infamous as a lever for cruelly suppressing and stamping out the anti-Japanese actions of the Korean people and forcibly dissolving the patriotic anti-Japanese organizations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists cooked up all sorts of fascist laws such as \"the Maintenance of the Public Order Act\" besides the \"security law\" and brutally suppressed the Korean people, blustering that \"Koreans should obey the Japanese law or die.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should kneel down and make an apology before the Koreans and adequately pay for the crimes committed against them as it enforced the harshest colonial rule over their country in the past after illegally occupying it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The cunning and cruel Japanese reactionaries, however, are recklessly challenging the just demand of human conscience, denying their crime-woven past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are going mad with their campaign to suppress the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan as part of their moves to bring their hostile policy towards the DPRK to an extreme phase. They went lengths of openly designating Tok Islet as part of the Japanese territory in the 2007 \"Defense White Paper.\" All these facts go to prove that their hysteria for reinvasion has reached a very serious phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation will never forget the crimes perpetrated by the Japanese imperialists in the past no matter how much water may flow under the bridge but surely force Japan to pay for its crime-woven history.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They should be aware of the fact that they are following in the footsteps of the war criminals who had met judgment of history and been executed at the Tokyo Military Tribunal for Far East for the aggression and human rights abuses committed by Japan during World War II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a perfidy to the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration that the group is evading its responsibility to compensate for Japan's past crimes and protect the Koreans in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Japanese authorities do not immediately stop such suppression of Chongryon, they will face strong legal counter-measures under international law concerning state responsibility and diplomatic protection. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Abe group will never be able to evade the legal responsibility for all the consequences to be entailed by the suppression of the Korean nationals in Japan and the moves to destroy Chongryon.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Tales hechos prueban evidentemente que llegan a la etapa gravisima sus maniobras de nueva agresion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Aunque pase mucho tiempo y cambie el mundo, la nacion coreana nunca olvidara esos crimenes cometidos en el pasado por los imperialistas nipones y saldara la cuenta sin falta de esta horrorosa historia criminal.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
