Clarifying the DPRK government's stand to build a world for children, the delegate pointed out: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is most important is to adopt a correct national policy and institutional mechanism for the existence, protection and development of the children. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to improve and perfect a system for guaranteeing the children rights suited to the specific conditions and requirements of each country, take social measures for its effective operation, strengthen the legal system for the protection of their rights and create and improve conditions and environment for education as required by the it era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also necessary to develop the national economy, a material guarantee for the children's wellbeing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the existence, protection and development of children are to be promoted nationwide and a world is to be built for children it is essential to create an international environment for this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to lift the high-handed economic sanctions and economic blockade that violate the sovereignty of states and cause all sorts of children's problems to arise, take appropriate measures to solve disputes peacefully, increase the donation for solving the children's problem and strengthen the international cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK delegate called upon all the countries to sincerely implement the political commitments made at the extraordinary session of the UN General Assembly on children this year, and  the un and un organizations to increase the developed countries' donation for solving the children's problem in conformity with the noble idea of humanitarianism -- \"priority to children\" and make efforts to strengthen the regional and international cooperation and coordination.    \r\n\r\n"

It also means thinking and doing everything with the revolution in one's own country put into main consideration and acquiring the viewpoint and attitude of solving all questions by one's own talents and initiative. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWithout this viewpoint and attitude, one can neither display an independent thinking ability nor conduct creative activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to establish Juche in ideology, it is necessary to equip oneself with the revolutionary ideas of the working class and with the policies of one's party. Only then, will one be able to carry out the revolution and construction successfully, however difficult and complex the situation is, with the awareness that one is the master of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If one is to establish Juche in thinking, one must be well versed in one's own things. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when one knows the things of one's country well, will one be able to solve all problems to suit one's specific conditions and in conformity with the aspirations and requirements of one's people. \r\nIt is also necessary to possess a high sense of national dignity and revolutionary pride. A nation with a strong sense of national dignity and revolutionary pride is unconquerable, but a nation without this attribute is powerless. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Juche is to be established in ideology, flunkeyism, dogmatism and other outdated ideas should be rejected categorically. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nthe elucidation of the principle of Juche in ideology provided a powerful ideological and theoretical weapon to bring up the masses as the true masters of the revolution and fully enlist their strength in achieving victory in the revolution and construction. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
