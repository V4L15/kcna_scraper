They removed millions of cubic metres of earth and built over 20,000 meter of road and mountaineering course. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They built rest homes, hotel, Jangsu pavilion and dwelling houses of modern and national architectural styles in every valley to match its beautiful landscape. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At least 20 beauty spots such as a pond, Sonnyo Lake (fairy girls' lake) and Jangsu spring were unearthed and rebuilt. Animal sculptures were also erected to add beauty to its exquisite landscape. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The mountain had been called Mt. Chiak as it abounded in pheasants. But people began calling it Mt. Jangsu because many inhabitants there live long thanks to its beautiful landscape, fresh air and clean water. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The mountain linked with the range of Mt. Myolak stretching from the great Paektu mountain range is 747 meters high. It is standing imposingly like a folding screen at the southern end of the vast Namuri plain in Jaeryong county. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is called \"Mt.

The capitalists tend to steadily increase their share in value by cutting down the wages of the mental workers as low as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such capital's exploitation of mental labor results in more widening the gap between the rich and the poor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As mental labor plays rapidly increasing role in social production, the capitalists are getting desperate in their bid to get best brains in and outside their countries, regarding it as a vital need to increase their profits. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another feature of capitalist exploitation in the era of the information industry is that it is based on the use of information technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The capitalists' introduction of it is aimed to rake up more profits. This is the main reason why they are vying with each other to introduce it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are steadily heightening the labor intensity of the mental workers in the field of it in a bid to intensify the exploitation of them. And they work hard to increase profits with less mental labor, taking advantage of it's possibility replacing a big portion of labor for the creation of material wealth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The development of the information industry in the capitalist society only helps intensify capital's exploitation of hired labor and thus will result in further aggravating the class contradiction and confrontation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

On October 8 it launched a military operation against Afghanistan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a consequence, the world faces another war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already clarified, it is the principled stand of the DPRK to oppose all forms of terrorism and any support to it and so the DPRK has been consistently opposed to terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's opposition to terrorism is aimed to promote global peace and stability and defend the sovereignty of the country and nation and protect the safety of the people and their properties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The method of combating terrorism should be in full accord with such purpose in any case. The use of armed forces or a war to kill innocent people and aggravate regional situation and disturb regional stability contrary to the purpose can not be justified under any circumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We hold that the action of the U.S. should not be a source of vicious circle of terrorism and retaliation that may plunge the world into the holocaust of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has so far done what it is obliged to do to combat terrorism. The U.S., however, has pursued a hostile policy toward the DPRK, still keeping it on the list of \"sponsors of terrorism\" under an unreasonable pretext. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under this situation the DPRK is following the situation with vigilance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is proud that it has increased its national defence capabilities of its own choice in every way no matter what others may say. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will closely watch the developments in full readiness to cope with any case.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
