Lurking behind this is a sinister aim of Japan to play the role of a shock brigade in internationalizing the \"nuclear issue\" of the DPRK in a bid to realize its ambition to emerge a military power and overseas expansion with the strong backing of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the invariable wild ambition of Japan to establish its unchallenged domination over Asia through the tightened U.S.-Japan military nexus, toeing the U.S. line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Being keen to reinvade Asia, Japan actively took part in overseas military actions under the pretext of \"logistic support\" to the U.S. military operation for retaliation in the wake of September 11 incident and in the U.S.-led multi-national joint naval exercises, the biggest-ever annual exercise in Asia. It also came first to support the on-going U.S. attack on Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently it is attempting to threaten the DPRK militarily while staging joint military exercise with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should drop its old dream of the \"Great East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\" and its ambition for reinvasion of Korea. \r\nIt should do what it should do to remain true to the spirit of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration for the peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in the rest of Asia.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
