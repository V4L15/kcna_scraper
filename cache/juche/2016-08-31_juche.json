Por esta razon, la peligrosidad y gravedad de este simulacro llegaron a la extremidad produciendo gran preocupacion de la nacion coreana y los paises regionales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. habla por una parte del \"no uso de armas nucleares primero\" y por la otra, despliega abiertamente los ejercicios belicos de ataque preventivo nuclear como UFG perturbando la paz y la estabilidad de la region, lo cual es precisamente la naturaleza del imperio yanqui.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs muy natural que EE.UU. se haga objeto de las censuras e indignaciones de todo el mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo mas grave es el proceder de la traidora Park Geun-hye que se adhiere al frente a la estrategia de guerra nuclear de EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa camarilla de Park, que se desespera por acarrear a los connacionales los desastres nucleares que sufrio el pueblo japones en el siglo pasado, es la horda de peores traidores a la nacion y sirvientes de la guerra nuclear. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido a tales maniacos de guerra nuclear, la nacion coreana ha venido viviendo durante varios decenios en el peligro de la guerra nuclear y se ven amenazadas gravemente la paz y la estabilidad de la region. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras existan los maniacos de guerra nuclear como los yanquis y los titeres surcoreanos, no podran pensar en el alivio de la tension y el aseguramiento de la paz en la Peninsula Coreana y el resto de la region, ni en la paz del mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los coreanos deben levantarse con mas dinamismo en la sagrada lucha por frustrar los imprudentes alborotos de guerra nuclear de EE.UU. y los titeres surcoreanos. Y, al mismo tiempo, la sociedad internacional debe elevar la vigilancia sobre las maniobras fraudulentas de los maniacos de guerra nuclear. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC consolidara constantemente el disuasivo nuclear de autodefensa, remedio todopoderoso para la defensa de la paz y estabilidad de la Peninsula Coreana."
