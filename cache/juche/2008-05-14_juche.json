            "content": "Kim Jong Il Provides Field Guidance to Units in Kilju County and Kim Chaek City \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 13 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il gave on-the-spot guidance to various units in Kilju County and Kim Chaek City of North Hamgyong Province. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The first leg of his guidance was the Kilju Farm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Going round the room for the dissemination of scientific and technological knowledge, a thrashing ground, a seed store, a nursery, a fish farm, a bath house, a barber's and other places, he was greatly satisfied to learn that the village has turned into a socialist land of bliss, a cradle of happiness, good to work and live in. He put forward the tasks to be fulfilled by the farm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The per-hectare yield should be decisively raised to settle the food problem under the conditions of our country where the area of cultivated land is limited, he noted, adding that to this end it is necessary to put the farming on a scientific and technological basis as required by the Juche method of farming the advantages of which have been proved in practice and strictly adhere to the principle of the right crop on the right soil and the right crop in the right time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to do the labor-consuming farm work with ease it is imperative to realize the comprehensive mechanization and steadily improve the management including labor organization, he noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He visited the family of ex-serviceman Sim Yong Chol of Workteam No. 4, which moved to a new house. He gave a  warm pep talk to him and his family that are devoting themselves to the agricultural front, pleased to learn that they are leading the same happy life in the modern house with all amenities as that in a city. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The next leg of his guidance was the Kim Chaek Taehung Fishery Enterprise. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After looking round the room devoted to the history of the enterprise, he visited the canned fish workteam, a fish meal workteam and a wharf to acquaint himself in detail with the technological equipment and production there. He appreciated the efforts made by the officials and workers of the enterprise, saying that they have produced a lot of aquatic products and supplied them to the people in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He underscored the need to more thoroughly establish a scientific fishing system and, at the same time, do the work to search for new fishing grounds under a long-term plan in order to catch fish under the changed fishing conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After learning about sea culture including kelp, scallop and sea cucumber conducted by the enterprise, he called for simultaneously pushing forward fishing and sea culture and set forth tasks to be fulfilled to develop the fishing industry and ways to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went round the monument to the victory in the battle in the northern area of Korea, a historic relic. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The monument in Rimmyong-ri, Kim Chaek City, was erected in 1708 to commemorate the great victory Jong Mun Bu's volunteer corps won by decisively wiping out the Japanese aggression troops in Jangphyong, Rimmyong, Tanchon, Paekthap and other areas after their intrusion into Hamgyong Province during the Imjin Patriotic War (1592-98). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After being briefed on the monument, he went round it and acquainted himself with its preservation, management and use. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The monument is significant for studying the history of the struggle of our ancestors who valiantly fought against the enemy Japan's invasion and educating the younger generation  in the Korean nation-first idea, he said, stressing the need to preserve and manage the monument, the precious historic relic, with good care and conduct effective education through it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During his on-the-spot guidance to North Hamgyong Province, he got familiar with the overall work of the province and expressed great satisfaction over the fact that it has done a lot of work in less than one year since his on-the-spot guidance given in August last year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by Hong Sok Hyong, chief secretary of the North Hamgyong Provincial Committee of the WPK, and Kim Ki Nam, secretary of the C.C., WPK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea's War Moves against DPRK Assailed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 13 (KCNA) -- The warmongers of the south Korean puppet military are these days speeding up the introduction of latest war hardware while staging military exercises of different missions one after another, including the puppet air force's combined drills with the U.S. counterpart, to incite the fever of war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on this, Minju Joson Tuesday says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is the fact that such war moves are in relation to Lee Myung Bak's recent junket to the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the junket, Lee begged the U.S. to cancel the planned reduction of its troops in south Korea and promised to cover the expenses for their upkeep as much as the U.S. demands, loudly talking about the \"strategic alliance in the 21st century,\" \"three principles of alliance\" and the like. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"strategic alliance,\" raised by Lee, is no more than a treacherous alliance as it is aimed to boost in an all-round way the collusion with the U.S., thus allowing it to intensify its domination and interference in south Korea in political, military, economic and all other fields and turning south Korea as a whole into an advanced base for the implementation of the U.S. aggression and war policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Value,\" \"confidence\" and \"peace building,\" advertised by him as the \"three principles of alliance\" between south Korea and the U.S., are just a revelation of his willingness to act a shock-force in carrying out the U.S. policy of war of aggression on the basis of American-style democracy and its doctrine of aggression and reactionary view on value. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lee also asked the U.S. master to prolong the period of transferring the \"the right to command the wartime operation\" and raise the status of south Korea in buying American weapons to that of NATO. This was prompted by his sinister intention to invariably entrust the U.S. with the south Korea's military prerogative and purchase more weapons from it for mounting a preemptive attack on the fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His junket to the U.S. was a dangerous war trip as it served to support the U.S. strategy for a war of aggression on the DPRK, thus deteriorating the inter-Korean relations and further aggravating the tense situation on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Should the Lee Myung Bak group persist in pro-U.S. sycophancy and confrontation with the fellow countrymen, it will not escape from a stern punishment by the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

In its wake the House Foreign Relations Committee recently passed a \"bill\" on raising the above-said status of south Korea to that of NATO. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. move to step up the sale of its weapons to south Korea in real earnest is a revelation of its invariable hostile policy towards the DPRK and a dangerous military move to mount a surprise preemptive attack on the DPRK. Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the scenario of the U.S. to neutralize the military operation capability of the DPRK through a surprise preemptive attack on it in contingency and conclude through blitz tactics the second Korean war with the involvement of U.S. reinforcements including task force from Japan, the Pacific including Guam and Hawaii and the U.S. mainland and the troops in south Korea and south Korean armed forces, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. proposed massive sale of its weapons to south Korea is aimed at tightening the \"strategic alliance\" with south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and south Korea are linked with each other by the \"mutual defense treaty.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If this \"mutual defense treaty\" is reinforced by a new \"strategic alliance,\" it will help further tighten the \"military alliance\" targeted against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tightened \"strategic alliance\" with south Korea much touted by the U.S. is a dangerous military nexus aimed at \"strangling\" the DPRK by force through reviving the already bankrupt \"cooperation system.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. intends to intensify military activities after amassing latest military hardware in south Korea and lay a foundation for a new military bloc by drawing south Korean warmongers into it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Korea is now turning into a source of a new war, nuclear war and the situation on the Korean Peninsula is getting extremely tense due to the U.S. moves for bolstering combat forces.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
