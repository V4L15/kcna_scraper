Korean Troops in Iraq\" under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 8 (KCNA) -- The Youth and Students Solidarity of south Korea to Implement the June 15 South-North Joint Declaration reportedly released a statement on Jan. 3, condemning the south Korean authorities for passing a \"motion on reextending the term of presence of south Korean troops\" through the \"National Assembly\".\r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unprincipled and base action of the \"government\" fawning on the outside forces while talking about \"alliance\" with the U.S. is to encourage the U.S. policy of aggression and incite war. If the passage of the motion is overlooked, the U.S. and the anti-reunification forces will desperately try to make the Korean Peninsula once again a dark land of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We, youth and students, will never pardon the reckless action of the pro-American sycophantic politicians but turn out in the struggle against the U.S. and war with firmer confidence and stamina this year.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Successive Fascist Dictatorial Regimes in S. Korea Indicted \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 7 (KCNA) -- The former unconverted long-term prisoners who had come into the care of the north sent a joint indictment to the \"Human Rights Committee\" and the \"Committee for Settlement of the Past History for Truth and Reconciliation\" of south Korea through a liaison office in Panmunjom on January 6. The indictment cited facts about all sorts of monstrous atrocities they experienced or witnessed in prisons in the period of the south Korean military fascist dictatorial regimes and demanded the punishment of those chiefly responsible for them and the compensation for these crimes.\r\n This indictment sent in the name of the whole nation and human conscience is based on the undeniable evidence proving the monstrous crimes perpetrated by the successive dictatorial regimes of south Korea. It has such sub-titles as \"Unprecedentedly harsh system for ideological conversion,\" \"0.75-phyong prison cell of death\", \"Most brutal torture for man-killing\" and \"Criminals should be punished and apology and compensation should be made.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the indictment, at the instigation of the U.S. the south Korean regime introduced the ideological conversion system of south Korean style, more fascist than the system that existed in the period of the Japanese imperialist rule, in a bid to maintain the U.S. colonial rule and dampen the desire of the people for independence, democracy and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ill-famed \"National Security Law\", \"Anti-Communist Law\", \"Law on Social Security\" and \"Law on the Supervision for Public Peace,\" etc. were the direct product of the above-said system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean fascist rulers harshly cracked down upon those who took the right path of reunification and patriotism by invoking such evil laws and imposed ideological conversion upon them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those fascist regimes pressurized the unconverted prisoners to make ideological conversion on charge of violating such evil law as the \"Law for the Supervision for Public Peace\" even after the expiry of their decades-long terms in \"prisons\" and \"camps for the preservation of public peace.\" \r\nThe criminal nature of ideological conversion is fully proved by the conditions in the hell-like prisons where the unconverted long-term prisoners were detained. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A solitary cell of 0.75 phyong which admitted no light where each unconverted prisoner spent several decades was more like a hell on earth and a grave. \r\n The successive fascist ruling quarters of south Korea severely punished the unconverted prisoners for the mere reason that they pursued different ideology and ideal and tortured them to death for refusing to make ideological conversion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The innumerable methods of torture applied by them included \"roast chicken torture,\" \"cold water torture,\" \"torture by pouring water into nose,\" \"torture by pushing one's head into water box\", \"torture  with ornamental hairpin,\" \"airplane torture,\" \"rapid dive-bombing torture\" and \"electric shock torture.\"\r\n The unconverted long-term prisoners reserve the right to punish the assailants and demand them make apology and compensation for the mental and material losses they suffered as miserable sufferers and victims. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They branded the fascist atrocities perpetrated by the successive dictatorial regimes of south Korea as hideous crimes against justice and conscience and a wanton violation of the human rights recognized by international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the victims who survived tragic deaths and as plaintiffs we the unconverted long-term prisoners demand the above-said regimes, assailants, and their descendants that are the accused as follows: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n First. The arch criminals and the law-enforcement agents in the period of the fascist dictatorial regimes who committed crimes baffling human imagination against the unconverted long-term prisoners while pressing them to abandon their ideology and faith and their descendants should be brought to the court of history and the nation and sternly punished. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Second. Apology and compensation should be made for the crimes perpetrated by the past dictatorial regimes against the former unconverted long-term prisoners. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n 63 unconverted long-term prisoners who had come into the care of the north and Ri In Mo, who had already repatriated to it, spent a total of 2,074 years in nightmarish prisons in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The physical damage except mental damage done to them stands at one billion U.S. dollars even according to a preliminary estimate made by specialists of the DPRK in line with international practice. It would come to several billions of U.S. dollars at least if the damage done to all those unconverted long-term prisoners killed in prisons is put together. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We are suffering from the aftermath of hardships we experienced in prisons and receiving help in terms of medical treatment and living. This also deserves compensation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Grand National Party, direct successor to the past fascist dictatorship, should not turn its face away from our just demand for compensating for the damage but make a hundred-fold apology and compensation before quitting the arena of history for good. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP is now represented by Pak Kun Hye, daughter of the ill-famed \"Yusin\" dictator. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She should sit in the dock before anyone else for zealously supporting the past \"Yusin\" regime and leading the GNP, a centre of present fascist dictatorial clans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is our expectation that the fair public opinion of the world and international organizations, authorities and organizations of south Korea concerned with the issue of liquidating the past and people from all walks of life will pay deep attention to our just voices and positively respond to the demand for the disorganization of the GNP, the punishment of its clans and compensation for the damage.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The Korean nation should make it a tradition to grandly mark June 15 every year as the day of \"By our nation itself\" as already agreed upon between the north and the south.\r\n The U.S. is the main target of struggle in the patriotic movement for independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to advance the cause of national reunification more dynamically this year the Korean nation should stage a vigorous struggle to smash the U.S. imperialists' moves to strengthen domination and block Korea's reunification, to begin with. It should, at the same time, thoroughly isolate, reject and condemn the pro-U.S. conservative forces in south Korea which are hell-bent on the moves to stamp out the cause of national independence and bring back the old era of inter-Korean confrontation, while cooperating with the foreign aggressor forces.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
