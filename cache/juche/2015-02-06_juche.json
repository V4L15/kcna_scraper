But such pressure led the DPRK to successful nuclear test and possession of nuclear deterrent and, consequently, the U.S. could not but delete it from the list of \"sponsors of terrorism\" and put an end to the application of the \"Trading with the Enemy Act\" to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the present Obama administration of the U.S. has tightened its hostile policy towards the DPRK, brining about unimaginable consequences. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt adopted a policy of \"strategic patience\" envisaging that tightened isolation and blockade would lead the DPRK to dismantlement of its nukes and changes. To cope with it, the DPRK came to arm itself with diversified precision nuclear striking means and advanced a strategic line of simultaneously pushing forward the economic construction and the building of nuclear force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK National Defence Commission in a statement on Feb. 4 declared the stand that since the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK is getting extremely ferocious, the army and people of the DPRK would take stronger counteraction of justice and write the last page of the U.S. history of shameful defeat about its final ruin exactly on the U.S. land.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this regard, a Russian expert on the Korean affairs said that it is hard to rule out the possibility of war on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even think tanks of the U.S. claimed that the Obama administration's policy of \"strategic patience\" has led the DPRK to the intensified development of nukes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should squarely face up the history and reality."

This is an intolerable behavior escalating the confrontation and a blatant challenge to the will of the Koreans to take retaliatory actions against the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lurking behind this is the sinister intention of the conservative forces to lay the blame for the situation on the Korean peninsula driven into an extreme phase due to the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK getting extremely tense at the door of it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is well known that in the past conservative media became venal trumpeters for the U.S. and south Korean authorities and cooked up false stories to hurt the fellow countrymen and chill the atmosphere for mending the north-south relations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Among them Channel A has earned an ill-fame for airing extreme anti-reunification and traitorous programs. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This time it shielded once again the hideous germ warfare committed by the U.S. imperialists against the Korean nation during the Korean War, once again bringing to light its true colors as a faithful dog of the U.S., cursed media for confrontation with the fellow countrymen and the media showing extra zeal in hatching plots. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The monstrous germ warfare perpetrated by the U.S. against the Korean people during the Korean War baffled human imagination. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. dropped all kinds of germ bombs over 169 areas of the northern half of Korea through a total of 804 air raids from early January to March, 1952 with hundreds of planes involved. It also used chemical weapons which were banned by international law in cities and counties of the northern half of Korea and front areas from February, 1951 to July, 1953.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is just a tip of iceberg of the germ and chemical warfare committed by the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The undisguised germ warfare and the chemical warfare perpetrated by the U.S. in stealthy and crafty methods were the most horrible crimes committed by it against the Korean people and mankind and heinous crimes committed in an organized and premeditated manner according to the policy of the U.S. government.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The truth about the U.S. shuddering germ warfare was clearly exposed by the investigation conducted by the international fact-finding group and lots of testimonies and evidence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Moreover, the original text of a report made by a UK bio-chemist on the germ warfare committed by the U.S. against the Korean people in 1952 was opened to the public recently, stunning the world once again.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Unspeakable was the damage suffered by the south Korean people due to the U.S. monstrous germ and chemical warfare and massacres of civilians.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, Channel A committed such an act of treachery.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This reckless behavior can be conducted only by a group of traitors who have not iota of national soul. It is nothing but a poor jargon of the colonial stooges to calm down the ever-mounting anti-American sentiment and patronize their master, the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet group is shielding the U.S. with plots and fabrications against the DPRK by setting in motion reptile media including Channel A. This will only reveal the despicable true colors of confrontation maniacs and pro-U.S. stooges.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group should clearly know that with no rhetoric can it shake the will of the army and people of the DPRK all out in the final sacred war with the gangster-like U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK have already declared that they would mete out a stern punishment not only to the U.S. but to the riff-raffs of Channel A keen on anti-DPRK plots in league with the aggressors and the puppet conservative group, its backstage manipulator. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pro-U.S. sycophants and lackeys are bound to face a stern judgment while the U.S. final doom is drawing nearer."
