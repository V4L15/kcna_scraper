Korean Foreign Minister \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 25 (KCNA) -- It was reported that South Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Ri Jong Bin in a \"speech\" at the U.N. General Assembly session said that the historic Pyongyang meeting in June last was arranged as a \"result of the 'engagement policy' of the South Korean government.\"\r\n   It is, indeed, preposterous. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is an unpardonable remark which lays an artificial obstacle in the way of implementing the June 15 north-south joint declaration that reaffirms the three principles for national reunification clarified in the July 4 north-south joint statement and aspires after national reconciliation and unity, exchange and cooperation and peace and reunification. and it gets on the nerve of the dialogue partner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Some conservative forces of South Korea had said this or that about the June 15 north-south joint declaration since its publication but none of them had openly told the same as he did in the U.N. arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His remarks, which reverse black and white, throw a wet blanket over the nation's aspirations for reunification and cast a dark cloud on reconciliation and unity between the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The historic Pyongyang meeting and the publication of the north-south joint declaration in June are a shining fruition of the resolution and will of the leaders of the north and the south and the aspirations and desire of the 70 million nation for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade could not have been unaware of this stark fact. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   However, he made such remarks because he has double-faced ulterior intention. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The historic Pyongyang meeting was hailed in the international arena including the U.N. millennium summit and world's attention is turning to the northern half of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He, getting nervous of this fact, seeks to mislead the public opinion to save face.\r\n   And his remarks are intended to earn international support for the already-ruined \"engagement policy\" and realize it at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But it is a folly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"engagement policy\" he mentioned is none other than a variety of the \"sunshine policy\" aimed to hurt the dialogue partner of the same blood with the help of outsiders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Anti-reunification separatists should be awakened from their foolish day dream and drop a dagger carrying under their belt. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean politicians should not put ideology,  idea and system to the fore but do something helpful to achieving the independent reunification of the country with a patriotic stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   When he went out in the international arena with bloody tax collected from the people, he should have done good things for national reunification wanted by the people and the nation. if he pursues the confrontation policy of doing harm to the same nation in collusion with the foreign forces, he will never escape a stern trial by the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the South Korean authorities truly value the successes of the historic Pyongyang meeting and have willingness to implement the June 15 north-south joint declaration they should not talk about the \"engagement policy\" and the like and throw a wet blanket over the development of the inter-Korean relations any longer but do work for the common interests of the nation in the spirit of national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is too plain that if they continue taking the road of confrontation with the dialogue partner, turning a deaf ear to our repeated advice, it will exert serious consequences upon the favourably developing inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities should think twice before doing something and clearly know that they will be responsible for all the consequences to be entailed by their reckless acts.    \r\n\r\n"

This fact proves eloquently how outstanding his judgement on the essence and correlations of intricate problems is. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is thanks to his distinguished judgement of finding the most effective way of solving vast problems that he ensured profitability  in the economic work, built large and small hydroelectric powers through mass movements to solve the shortage of electricity pushed forward the campaign for potato farming and the large-scale rezoning of land to bring a new turn in the agricultural production. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   With this clearcut judgement he solved all the problems in such a way that may be flawless in the far future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His clairvoyant wisdom and judgement have been proved by the settlement of theoretical and practical matters arising in the party, state and army building and the youth problem, the guidelines of the present scientific research work, the direction of economic development, ways of improving and strengthening land management and the plan for urban and rural construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His ability of judgement beyond human imagination is based on his extraordinary ability and outstanding character.    \r\n\r\n"
