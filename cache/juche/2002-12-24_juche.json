If their moves are overlooked, it will be hard to implement the June 15 north-south joint declaration, a landmark of Korea's reunification in the 21st century, and they will do harm to the movement for independent reunification of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The motto \"by our nation itself\" encourages the Korean nation to creditably fulfil its responsibility and role and gives impetus to the movement for reunification. If the nation fails to do so, outside forces will find a pretext to interfere in its internal affairs. In that case the joint declaration can not be implemented nor can the Korean nation shake off the disgrace of being the divided nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now is the time for all the Koreans to frustrate the U.S. imperialists' aggression and anti-reunification moves and vigorously push ahead with the reunification movement under the uplifted banner of national independence, the banner of \"by our nation itself.\"    \r\n\r\n"
