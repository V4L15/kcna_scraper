            "content": "Japanese Reactionaries' Moves to Convert Their Country into Military Giant Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 20 (KCNA) -- The Japanese government at a recent ministerial meeting officially approved a draft amendment to a \"Law on Self-Defence Forces\" which calls for raising the Defence Agency to the status of ministry. The amendment also defines overseas military operation as a basic mission of the SDF.\r\n Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are working hard to promote the Defence Agency to a ministry to ensure more legitimate, active and effective overseas military operation of the SDF and convert the country into a military power. This is the last phase of their moves to turn the country into a military giant. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Overseas aggression is their invariable ambition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is well known that they have been keen to realize their ambition for overseas aggression for the last several decades. The SDF have all means and capabilities to launch overseas aggression, going far beyond the mission as forces for self-defence. The Japanese reactionaries have secured even legal and institutional mechanism for the SDF's overseas military activities. It is their calculation that they would be able to successfully realize their militarist ambition, unhindered, only if the present \"Pacifist Constitution\" is revised and the Defence Agency is raised to the status of ministry in the efforts to carry out their militarist overseas aggression.  The Japanese reactionaries' moves to promote the Agency to a ministry are aimed to convert the country into a military giant and effectively mobilize the militarist armed forces for overseas aggression any moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Of late they decided to introduce nine inter-continental ballistic missiles from the U.S. with an aim to increase the offensive capacity of the SDF and step up the moves to emerge a military giant. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson Monday in a commentary observes that lurking behind the Japanese reactionaries' moves to promote the agency to a ministry is an intention to achieve with ease their sinister political aim to emerge a military power and launch overseas aggression.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n"

But this is, to all intents and purposes, a sophism to cover up the sum and substance of the matter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  In case the U.S. deploys military hardware even in the space, the world will be embroiled into a space arms race, like or not, and this will lead to a fierce strife for supremacy among the powers in the space that was not witnessed even in the Cold War days and touch off a space war in the long run. This is as plain as noonday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world is not allowed to avert its face from the grave situation in which it is facing the danger of a nuclear shower from the blue sky. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the United States pursues the expansion of space weaponization, urged by its concept of confrontation of the old era, it will drive it to its final destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should drop at once its scheme of space weaponization which would inflict nuclear disasters on humankind, the analyst urges.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is ascribable to the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il who values them more than anything else and glorifies them.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says this in a signed article. It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il formed the \"group for study of short biography of General Kim Il Sung\" in Juche 42 (1953) and started the study tour of revolutionary battle sites in the area of Mt. Paektu in June Juche 45 (1956). They marked historical events which declared at home and abroad his strong faith and will to defend the revolutionary traditions through generations and accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche started in the forest of Mt. Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He is the great leader who has firmly defended the revolutionary traditions of Juche and glorified them generation after generation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is his immortal historic exploit for carrying forward the revolutionary traditions that he has preserved the purity of the revolutionary traditions of Juche and added shine to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He made a scientific clarification that revolutionary traditions are precisely the ones established by a leader of revolution and the revolutionary traditions of Juche established by President Kim Il Sung are the only traditions for the Workers' Party of Korea to inherit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He made sure that the attempts of the anti-party factionalists to defile the purity of the revolutionary traditions of Mt. Paektu and stamp out them were decisively foiled. He, at the same time, took measures to actively find out things valuable gained in the period of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He has comprehensively carried forward and developed rich and precious contents of the revolutionary traditions of Juche. This is another undying exploit performed by him in the cause of inheriting the revolutionary traditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The wise leadership of Kim Jong Il who has successfully carried forward the revolutionary traditions of Mt. Paektu finds its expression in that he has firmly defended the revolutionary idea of Kim Il Sung and dynamically advanced the revolution and construction as guided by it, consolidated the single-minded unity of the revolutionary ranks around the headquarters of the revolution as firm as a rock and prepared the servicepersons and people of the DPRK as staunch revolutionaries armed with the revolutionary spirit of Mt.

This has stirred up the surging indignation of the Korean people against the U.S. imperialists.\r\n According to the letter written by the then U.S. ambassador in Seoul, the order was decided a day before the massacre in Rogun-ri. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was on the evening of July 25, Juche 39 (1950) that the 7th regiment of the first armored division of the U.S. fled to the area of Jugok-ri, Yongdong County, North Chungchong Province, by the strong counteroffensive of the Korean People's Army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that they would evacuate the villagers to safe places, the GIs forced villagers and refugees to gather on the railway lines nearby Rogun-ri on July 26. And then U.S. fighter planes dropped bombs and strafed to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The survivals ran to a railway tunnel to take shelter from the air-raid. The GIs machine-gunned to them from low hills and approached to both entrances of the tunnel and opened fire into the tunnel. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The genocide continued for four consecutive days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They slew more than 400 people out of those forcibly evacuated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The carnage in Rogun-ri was part of the massacre committed by the GIs during the Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the Rongun-ri massacre, GIs brutally killed over 100 people in Changnyong County of South Kyongsang Province at a time. Similar slaughters were committed in Kochang, Uiryong, Hamyang, Tanyang, Mungyong, areas along the River Rakdong and other places of south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The peaceable inhabitants killed by GIs in south Korea during the war totaled over 1.24 millions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will not forget the genocide committed by the GIs in Rogun-ri and other parts of south Korea and their brutal nature and make the enemy pay for the blood shed without fail.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
