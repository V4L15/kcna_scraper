Z. Umalatova, chairperson of the Party for Peace and Unity of Russia, in a report said Kim Jong Il began his work at the C.C., the WPK on June 19, 1964. She noted: He, overflowing with youthful vigor, won boundless respect of all the people for his extraordinary sweep in work, purposefulness and warm love of and trust in the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In face of his Songun politics the persistent and vicious moves of the imperialists to stifle the DPRK miscarried. The single-hearted close unity of the DPRK around him is unbreakable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under Songun politics, the greatest efforts were channeled to increasing the military potential in the DPRK and the Korean People's Army has been turned into the most powerful army politically and ideologically and in military technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Herein lies the key to defense of sovereignty of the country and socialism from the repeated anti-DPRK moves of the U.S. and western forces. \r\n The people are the very one directly entrusted with socialist construction and the army is the core force and pillar of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then speeches followed.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This, however, is a crude and despicable attempt to craftily shift their responsibility on to the others by an unpopular sleight of hand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has drawn a precious lesson from the ignorant act of the Bush administration which cast away in a moment even an official document signed by the ex-president of the U.S. itself like a scrap of paper. The lesson is that relations based on confidence are out of question with the Bush administration and that every issue with the U.S. must be settled strictly on the principle of one to one simultaneous action. According to this very lesson, the DPRK proposed simultaneous action on the principle of \"reward for freeze\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration would be advised not to bend vain efforts to dodge the responsibility for the present state of things and, though belatedly, make a practicable option to open the door of confidence-building.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In October 2002 it openly threatened and pressurized the DPRK, groundlessly charging that it violated the AF by going ahead with its \"uranium enriched program\" for the purpose of manufacturing nuclear weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK side only told the U.S. special envoy that it is entitled to have a nuclear weapon and even something more powerful than it in order to protect its sovereignty from the U.S. escalated threat to stifle the DPRK with nukes. The DPRK has never admitted any \"uranium enriched program\" absurdly claimed by the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the U.S. unilaterally announced its step to stop the supply of heavy oil to the DPRK as from November 14, 2002 and totally halted even the LWR construction as from December 1, 2003 under this pretext. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This was nothing surprising for the DPRK as it had already expected such action from the U.S. administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From the very outset the DPRK has never anticipated that the Bush administration would complete the LWR construction to the last as it was steeped in hostility toward the DPRK to the marrow of its bone. The issue of LWRs taught the DPRK a serious lesson that there can be no relationship based on confidence with the U.S. government as it scrapped the AF the core issue of which is the provision of LWRs to Pyongyang, regarding even this document signed by its president as a pair of old shoes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to settle any issue with the U.S. through a one-one agreement on the principle of simultaneous actions. This alone may lead to the process of building confidence, the most important issue in the present DPRK-U.S. relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will settle any issue with the U.S. on this principle in any case in the future    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The essence of the idea is the theory of uniting around the leader which clarifies that the leader is the supreme brain of the revolution and the centre of socio-political organism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary ranks can achieve unity strong and stable enough to overcome any hardships and ordeals and surely ensure victory in the revolution only when they get united around the leader in thinking, purpose and in the sense of moral obligation, guided by the idea of the leader with him as a central figure. It is the maxim for the servicepersons and people of the DPRK that they consider joy, sorrow and ordeal in their way of following  Kim Jong Il as honour. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The single-hearted unity present is the revolutionary unity based on the invincible army achieved on the basis of the great Songun idea of Kim Jong Il and a matchless harmonious whole as the headquarters of the revolution, the army and people share the same destiny as Songun revolutionary comrades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the unshakable faith of the army and people of the DPRK that there can be neither sovereignty, dignity and life nor the glorious history and bright future of the country and the revolution without Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il, the Workers' Party of Korea, the army and people form an invariable harmonious whole as they have one and the same idea, faith, destiny and future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unshakable are the determination and will of the army and people to defend the idea, system and cause in the DPRK to the last, holding fast to arms and unity as an invincible weapon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The single-hearted unity of the Party, the army and people serves as a strong motive power to bring about a leap forward in building a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Party, the army and people will glorify the long journey of the revolution for carving out the future of the cause of Songun as an eternal history of the victory of the single-hearted unity just as they ushered in the most brilliant era of the Juche revolution, having Kim Jong Il as the centre of the unity.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
