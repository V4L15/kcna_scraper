            "content": "KCNA on anti-DPRK false propaganda \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 29 (KCNA) -- The United States is getting ever more pronounced in its hostile policy towards the DPRK.\r\n Some time ago, it bribed Hong Kong's reptile newspaper south china morning post into floating a sheer lie about the DPRK which was cited by some media of South Korea and Japan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It asserted that in the 1990s there were frequent \"anti-government demonstrations\" and \"armed rebellions\" in east coastal and northern areas of the DPRK and the government \"has cut off supply of the food from international relief bodies\" to \"punish\" inhabitants in those areas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is no more than a sheer deceptive propaganda because neither \"anti-government demonstration\" nor \"armed rebellion\" is conceivable in the DPRK where the popular masses enjoy an independent and creative life as true masters of the state and society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In recent years the DPRK had to make an \"arduous march\" owing to the imperialists' moves to isolate and stifle it and natural disasters that lasted for several consecutive years, and food has, therefore, remained in short supply. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But, the government has ensured an equal supply of food to the entire population under such difficult conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has been officially recognized by members of WFP and other international bodies and humanitarian aid organizations active in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This notwithstanding, such a false report was fabricated and spread to slander the DPRK. It is entirely due to the U.S. imperialists and their stooges' hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is nobody's secret that in the past they egged venal writers to conduct a smear campaign in a sinister bid to tarnish the international image of the DPRK and check the international community's humanitarian aid to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent false propaganda was evidently cooked up by them in a bid to break the singlehearted unity of the DPRK where the leader, the party and the masses have formed an integral whole, and infringe upon its sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such provocation will only touch off bitterer hatred of the people's army and people of Korea against the U.S. imperialist aggressors and harden their determination to take revenge upon them and spark curses and condemnation from the truth-loving international community and public opinion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the South Korean authorities echo the U.S. false report, banking on its hostile policy toward the DPRK, this will have an adverse on the north-south relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this case, they will be entirely held accountable for it. \r\n\r\n"

This is clearly evidenced by its moves to keep pace with the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This U.S. policy is an anachronistic Cold War policy and a policy of strength to isolate and stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite clear that \"cooperation\" with the U.S. keen to stifle the DPRK will only spark confrontation and clash between the armed forces of the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Acting in pursuance of the U.S. policy to invade the DPRK is nothing but a behaviour of a miserable political servant dancing to the tune of others, bereft of his senses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to refrain from any \"cooperation\" with the U.S. that has only brought misfortune to the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is important is to discard any illusion about the U.S. The U.S. is neither \"liberator\" nor \"friend\" nor an \"apostle of peace.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is the very root cause of all misfortune and sufferings the Koreans are undergoing. \r\n South Korea should not rely on outsiders in betrayal of the nation but take a stand of national independence, that is working for the nation and relying on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Korea will not be afraid of any pressure from outside forces, if it firmly maintains this stand.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's tampering with history flayed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 29 (KCNA) -- The history society of the DPRK on June 28 released an article disclosing the true intention of Japan's moves to distort history as regards the Japanese authorities' action to instruct schools to use the controversial history textbooks for education. \r\n The article refers to the gross distortion of facts made by the authors of history textbooks which were approved at the examination, in a bid to justify the history of Japan's domination over Korea and the true aim sought by it in this misrepresentation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The textbooks revive the long-bankrupt theory of \"Mimanamiyake\" while grossly tampering with the early history of Korea-Japan relations, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By the theory of \"Mimanamiyake\" Japan means that Japan had ruled Imna (Mimana), the southern part of  Korea, for hundreds of years after establishing its \"local headquarters\" (Miyake) there after the 4th century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's revival of this fallacious story in history textbooks is aimed to convince the young Japanese that the Yamato nation is a \"superior nation\" which colonized Korea from more than a thousand years ago and the Korean nation is an \"inferior\" nation which was subjected to Japan's domination from long ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The textbooks deliberately asserted the \"superiority\" of Japan's history by citing the Korean history as an example to prove it and \"justify\" its history of domination over Korea. Their aim was to give the impression that the Korean history was a history of subordination and the Korean nation has been historically subjected to the destiny of a \"dependency.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Calling attention to the fact that the textbooks whitewashed Japan's aggression to occupy Korea, the article lays bare the aim sought in this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The books dealt with the fiction of \"threat from the Korean peninsula\" while talking about a geopolitical reason to justify its aggression of and rule over Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This fiction is, in essence, a brigandish logic of aggression as it asserts that Japan must conquer Korea and put it under its control for the sake of its own security and an undisguised declaration of reinvasion reiterating its ambition to dominate Korea as long as the geopolitical location remains unchanged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The textbooks described Japan's aggression of Korea as legitimate self-defence by misrepresenting Japan's logics and acts for aggression such as \"theory of conquest of Korea,\" \"Kwanghwa island treaty\" and \"Korea-Japan annexation.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They also grossly distorted the history of the Korean people's struggle  for modern reforms. \r\n Their authors wrote that Japan helped Korea in its modernization by misrepresenting the \"coup in 1884\" and the peasant war in 1894. This is a despicable distortion of history intended to justify Japan's aggression to colonize Korea and cover up its criminal obstruction of the movement for modernization in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the fact that the textbooks did not mention the crimes committed by Japan during its colonial rule over Korea but covered them up, the article discloses Japan's true intention. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They made a gross misrepresentation of Japanese imperialists' annexation of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Without clarifying the reason behind the assassination of Hirobumi Ito, the then governor-general in Korea, they wrote that Japan annexed Korea as a \"retaliation\" for this action and covered up the fact that Japan cruelly killed many anti-Japanese fighters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is aimed to justify the Japanese imperialists' occupation of Korea and create the impression that its colonial rule was smoothly enforced, not subject to any strong resistance by the Korean people in a bid to downplay Japan's past crimes and evade the responsibility to repent of and apologize for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is most intolerable in the Japanese authorities' retrogressive revision of textbooks is the fact that their authors did not mention at all the most hideous crimes as mass killings, plunder of resources and forced drafting, while whitewashing Japan's crime-woven history of its colonial rule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their authors played down human, material and mental damage done to the Koreans during the colonial rule or made a rough mention about it in a crafty manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They deliberately deleted from history textbooks the issue related to the \"comfort women for the imperial Japanese army,\" which was an organized crime committed by the Japanese government and the military, in bid to keep it buried into oblivion.     This is a shameless evasion of its responsibility, an open challenge to human morality and justice and a never-to-be-pardoned crime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article also points to the fact that the history textbooks described Japan's wars of aggression as just ones and explains what they sought in doing so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on to say: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They justified those wars of aggression undertaken by Japan including \"Imjin Patriotic War\" (1592-1598), the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), Russo-Japanese War, the Sino-Japanese War and the Pacific War, belittling or covering up its crimes in a bid to evade its responsibility for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's distortion of history found its clear manifestation in its description of the Korean War. Their authors wrote that \"Japan only supplied lots of materiel to the U.S. forces\" in an effort to conceal its involvement in the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All sorts of distortion of the issues related to Korea in the junior middle school history textbooks are aimed to downplay or hide those crimes committed by Japan in the past and evade at any cost the apology and compensation for its shameful crimes of aggression. These were prompted by the Japanese authorities' deliberate and intentional moves to implant the idea of aggression into the young Japanese and drive them to overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historians of Korea strongly urge the Japanese authorities to immediately withdraw the controversial history textbooks and rewrite true history textbooks on the principle of historicism and teach them to the young Japanese, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n"
