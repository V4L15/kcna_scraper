It is only the methods of carrying it out that have undergone changes. The U.S. is talking about \"dialogue\" at the negotiating table but sharpening its sword to stifle the DPRK militarily as soon as its negotiators went back. This double-dealing attitude of the U.S. is compelling the DPRK to bolster its war deterrent to the maximum with a high degree of vigilance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the DPRK's independent mode of counter-action to respond to good will with good will and react to a hard-line policy with the toughest measure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The rights to option and decision are not the monopoly of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. persistently pursues its hostile policy to stifle the DPRK, talking about \"dialogue\" with the DPRK with an ulterior motive, the latter will exercise its right to decision and go ahead as it is determined. The U.S. should be held fully accountable for all the ensuing consequences, concludes the commentary.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

These funds will directly go to the U.S. forces and the rent of the U.S. military bases and other indirect expenses will be far bigger than those funds, they added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They accused the U.S. of forcing south Korea to increase its share to 50 percent of those expenses from the present level of 42 percent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They also noted that the south Korean authorities would have to pay additional fund amounting to at least 520 billion won to cover the expenses for the transfer of bases, overseas dispatch of puppet troops and the expansion of the drill ground in Mugon-ri, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Criticizing the U.S. for scheming to cover the expenses for the transfer of its military bases with funds for the upkeep of its forces, they noted that this would sharply increase south Korea's share of the funds for the upkeep of the U.S. forces in the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present ruling forces are in such a deplorable position that they had no option but to meet all demands of the U.S. as they are keen to \"restore confidence as regards the south Korea-U.S. alliance\", they lamented, adding that Lee Myung Bak's \"diplomatic profile\" is worse than that under the former dictatorial regime.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
