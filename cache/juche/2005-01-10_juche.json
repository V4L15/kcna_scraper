The victory of the DPRK in the anti-imperialist struggle constitutes the victory of Syria and other independent forces against imperialism, he noted, and added: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun politics is the most correct political mode that helps defend and develop the cause of socialism under the present complicated international situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Communist Party of Syria (Bagdash) positively supports the Songun policy, which calls for attaching importance to arms and giving priority to military affairs, pursued by General Secretary Kim Jong Il and extends full support and solidarity to the Workers' Party of Korea and the Korean people in their struggle.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan Urged to Settle Its Past Wrongdoings \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 8 (KCNA) -- Japan should apologize and compensate for the human, mental and material losses it inflicted upon the Koreans and other Asians in the past. This is not a mere humanitarian issue nor an issue of the past but a sensitive, pending political issue, a historical commitment the fulfillment of which brooks no further delay. Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed commentary.\r\n Recalling that on Dec. 20 last, Germany, which has already paid compensation to the victims of Nazism after admitting the crimes it committed during the Second World War, started paying compensation to another group of Russians who had undergone sufferings due to Nazis, the news analyst says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, Japan, another war criminal, is quite different from Germany in the attitude and stand on the settlement of the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is nearly 60 years since the Japanese imperialists suffered a defeat in the bloody war they launched to invade and dominate Asian nations in a bid to realize \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\". But, Japan has not yet redeemed its past crimes. Instead of sincerely repenting of its past wrongdoings and compensating for them, Japan denies and embellishes them while persistently working to revive militarism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For its criminal moves to repeat its crime-woven past, far from working to redress them, Japan has become a target of the world people's caution after losing international confidence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its authorities are entirely to blame for Japan's failure to settle its past. They have failed to take a proper stand on Japan's past crimes while resorting to all sorts of tricks to gloss over the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government had better make a political decision, mindful that an early settlement of the crime-woven past is the only way for Japan to become a full-fledged member of the world community.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Cooperation for National Independence Called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 8 (KCNA) -- Achieving cooperation for national independence calls on Koreans to make concerted efforts and take joint actions in their efforts to protect the sovereignty and dignity of the nation from foreign domination and interference and independently carve out its destiny. It is entirely just and opportune that the joint editorial made a militant call for holding aloft the banner of cooperation for national independence this year. Rodong Sinmun Saturday says this in a signed article.\r\n The United States is getting evermore undisguised in its moves for interference and obstruction aimed to violate the sovereignty and dignity of the Korean nation, menace the peace of the country and block national cooperation and independent reunification and the anti-reunification forces in south Korea are putting the brake on the process of improving inter-Korean relations and the development of the movement for reunification, resorting to pro-American \"cooperation\", the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n History eloquently proves that without cooperation between Koreans in rejecting foreign domination and interference and keeping an independent stand it is impossible to protect the sovereignty and dignity of the nation and achieve a due success in the movement for reunification, the cause of the whole nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Cooperation for national independence would have been unthinkable without an anti-U.S. struggle. All Koreans should intensify the struggle to realize cooperation for independence against the U.S. in order to put an end to the U.S. domination and interference and protect the sovereignty and dignity of the nation this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is the very one that is chiefly to blame for Korea's division and has hamstrung national cooperation and the independent reunification of Korea. Without putting an end to the U.S. domination and interference it is impossible to have the country reunified and defend the sovereignty and the dignity of the nation. All Koreans should turn out in a dynamic and decisive struggle against the U.S. to put an end to its military occupation and domination of south Korea and check its moves to interfere and obstruct north-south reconciliation and cooperation and the movement for reunification.\r\n \"Cooperation\" with the U.S. is one for subjugation and treachery. It is necessary to smash sycophantic and traitorous \"cooperation\" with the U.S. with the might of cooperation for national independence and deal a blow to the traitors who pursue cooperation with outsiders against the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is important to firmly establish the principle of national independence in the movement for national reconciliation, cooperation and reunification, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is the main principle of activity of the Party and the government to think and judge all problems independently, act according to their faith and solve all the problems independently. The DPRK does not allow others to infringe on its sovereignty, interfere in its internal affairs and dominate and control it. It also resolutely rejects the violation of the sovereignty of other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will as ever respect independence of other countries and resolutely oppose all sorts of attempts and moves to infringe on the sovereignty and interests of others and interfere in the internal affairs of others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will always remain faithful to the idea of peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is making all efforts to frustrate the U.S. moves to isolate and stifle it, achieve peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula and defend the peace and security of Asia and the world in unity with all the peace-loving forces of the world. Its army and people will staunchly struggle to frustrate the U.S. imperialists' aggression and war moves and defend global peace and security under the banner of peace against war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the consistent policy of the WPK and the DPRK government to develop friendly and cooperative relations with all the countries that respect its sovereignty. The DPRK will develop relations of neighborly friendship with all the countries of the world on the basis of mutual respect for independence and strive to improve relationship with those countries which had been hostile toward it if they respect its sovereignty and give up their hostile policies.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
