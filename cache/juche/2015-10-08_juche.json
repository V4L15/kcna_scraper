So, he waited for an hour and thirty minutes till tens of thousands of service personnel have gathered for the event.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had a photo session with soldier-builders with newly built dwelling houses as a background.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Hwang Pyong So, Kim Ki Nam, Kim Yang Gon, O Su Yong, Jo Yong Won, Kim Yo Jong and Ma Won Chun."

This clearly proves the validity and vitality of the proposal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Il Sung also wisely led the struggle to materialize the proposal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He paid a primary attention to providing prerequisites for founding the DFRK and made sure that climate for reunification was created through multi-channel dialogue and negotiations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a result, a chapter for nation-wide dialogue was opened in the 1990s, the Pan-National Alliance for Korea's Reunification formed and the inter-Korean high-level talks held, creating an environment favorable for achieving reunification by federal formula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He made public a famous work \"10-Point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the Reunification of the Country\" in April, 1993 to provide a sure guarantee for building a reunified state, independent, peaceful and neutral, by federal formula through the great unity of the entire nation at an early date.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t True to his last instructions for national reunification, leader Kim Jong Il powerfully aroused all Koreans to the struggle for realizing the proposal for reunification by federal formula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He made public the famous work \"Let Us Carry Out the Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung's Instructions for National Reunification\" in August, 1997, formulating the three principles of national reunification, 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the country and the proposal for founding the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo as the three charters for national reunification and put forward it as an immortal banner for achieving independent reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He provided the north-south summit, the first of its kind in the Korean nation's history of the movement for national reunification, and made sure that the proposal for reunification by federal formula shed more brilliant rays as one for reunification common to the nation through the June 15 joint declaration. This is the distinguished exploit he performed in the history of the nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He made the historic north-south declarations serve as great programmes for national reunification in the new century. Under his wise guidance contacts, dialogue and cooperation between the north and the south made brisk headway and the air and sea routes, railways and roads which had remained cut off for over half a century were rejoined, a dream-like reality. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The cause of national reunification started and led by the great leaders is now greeting a new landmark phase thanks to the wise guidance of Marshal Kim Jong Un, another peerlessly great man of Mt. Paektu. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Regarding the accomplishment of the historical cause of national reunification true to the noble intention of the great leaders as his sacred mission, Kim Jong Un is steering the movement of the nation for independent reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In his historic New Year Address this year he comprehensively clarified the ways for the north and the south to open up a broad avenue to independent reunification including the matter of settling the issue of national reunification in the common interests of the nation transcending the differences in ideology and social system and the matter of bringing about a great turn in the inter-Korean relations, as they had already agreed upon. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Prompted by his iron-will to settle all the issues arising in the north-south relations in the spirit of By Our Nation Itself, Kim Jong Un provided energetic leadership over the movement for national reunification. As a result, the service personnel and people of the DPRK could make positive efforts to open up the way for peace and reunification even under the grave situation which reached to the brink of war in August this year and finally possibility was created to put spurs to the development of the north-south relations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All Koreans in the north and the south and overseas will surely build a reunified thriving nation on the land of Korea by working hard under the uplifted banner of immortal great programmes for reunification associated with outstanding wisdom and noble patriotism of the peerlessly great men of Mt.
