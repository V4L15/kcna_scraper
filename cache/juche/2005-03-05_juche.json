It bitterly assailed the Bush administration's wild design to stifle the socialist system in the DPRK.\r\n Accusing the U.S. of crying out for a \"regime change\" in the DPRK after defining it as an \"outpost of tyranny\", the statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. move to force American style \"freedom and democracy\" upon all other countries is an act of stamping out people's freedom and democratic rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We fully understand that the DPRK government was left with no other option but to suspend its participation in the six-party talks for an indefinite period under this situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We fully support the just stand of the DPRK and strongly demand the U.S. government roll back its hostile policy towards the DPRK and create a reasonable environment for a peaceful and diplomatic solution to all pending issues. \r\n Meanwhile, Nuran Nabie, general secretary of the Bangladesh-Korea Friendship Association, in a statement on Feb. 20 strongly urged the U.S. to positively respond to the statement of the DPRK Foreign Ministry reflecting its peace-loving stand.    \r\n\r\n"

The aggressive nature of the war games is accentuated by the expected involvement of the task force brigade which has been knocked together as a link of the whole chain of the reorganization of the U.S. forces for aggression on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States branded the DPRK as an \"outpost of tyranny\" at the beginning of the year, making it its policy never to coexist with the latter.

They are now contemplating a retrogressive revision of them by including the issue of \"nuclear crisis\" in them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This indicates that the south Korean authorities are not interested in implementing the June 15 joint declaration and developing the north-south relations, but waiting for a chance to occur with daggers hidden in their belts, while talking about \"peace, cooperation, co-existence and co-prosperity.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their attempt to renew the provocative \"Chungmu plan\" with calls for \"coping with the nuclear crisis\" and \"emergency plans\" goes to prove that they are heading for confrontation with the north and a war against it, availing themselves of outside forces' nuclear racket against it in breach of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To expect \"a sudden change\" in the north is as foolish an act as trying to beat the air. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north will never pardon those who defile and hurt its dignity and system and force them to pay a very high price for their act.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is also Korea that had it belonged to its territory and declared its possession of the islet. This has been clarified by many historical books and old maps including \"Newly Supplemented Reference Book\", \"The Chronicles of Three Kingdoms\", \"The History of Koryo\", \"The True Records of the Ri Dynasty\", \"Territory Map\", \"Geography in the True Records of Sejong\", \"New Account of Expedition to Korean Territory\" as well as Royal Decree No. 41 of the government of the Ri dynasty dated October 25, 1900. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is also proved by documents of the Japanese government and old maps made by it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Particularly, an ordinance issued by Tomomi Iwakura, a top official of the then Japanese government, to the Ministry of Home Affairs of Japan on March 20, 1877, notes that it should know Japan has nothing to do with the Ullung Island and Tok Islet. The recently discovered copy of the military operation map made by Kawagami, a general of the Japanese army during the war unleashed by Japan against Korea in 1592, and the Korean map made in 1785 by a famous geologist of Japan, Shihei Hayashi, eloquently prove the fact. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Korea is not what it was in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will never allow the Japanese reactionaries to rob Korea of Tok Islet, an inviolable part of its territory.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
