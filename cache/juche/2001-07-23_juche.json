Not content with this, they are going to bring a new carrier flotilla and airborne and maritime landing forces there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In recent years they created mobile strike units by reorganizing the U.S. air force stationed in the Asia-Pacific region into 10 expeditionary forces in pursuance of their strategy for a showdown of strength on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. staged such war exercises as a joint mine warfare exercise with the South Korean military authorities in a bid to round off the operational plan to rapidly hurl reinforcements into South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It leaves no doubt that the U.S. bellicose forces would unleash a war of aggression against the DPRK as they designated it as their \"no. 1 enemy.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is busy with preparations for a war against the DPRK, while talking about \"dialogue.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to face up to the reality and abandon its reckless policy of confrontation.    \r\n\r\n"

But the primary task before the Korean nation is to achieve national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Patriotism serves as a great banner grouping the Koreans from all walks of life in the north, south and abroad for national unity and reunification, regardless of differences in ideology, system, political view, religious belief, interests of individual class and social strata. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Leader Kim Jong Il's policy is the most patriotic all-embracing policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He has wisely led the struggle for great national unity and reunification holding aloft the banner of patriotism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Workers' Party of Korea and the DPRK government have exerted all efforts to achieve the cause of national reunification in conformity with the historic circumstances where the inter-Korean relations and the movement for national reunification have entered a new phase unprecedented in its history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation is carrying on its vigorous struggle to frustrate by the concerted efforts of the nation the challenge of the outside and anti-reunification forces and their moves to check the advance of the movement for independent national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans will more vigorously accelerate their march for independent reunification, true to Kim Jong Il's noble patriotic intention.    \r\n\r\n"
