            "content": "Spokesman for DPRK FM Clarifies Principled Stand on Building Peace Mechanism on Korean Peninsula \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 22 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK Friday issued a statement clarifying the principled stance on building a peace mechanism on the Korean Peninsula in the run-up to the 52nd anniversary of the conclusion of the Korean Armistice Agreement (KAA).\r\n It said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The process of building a peace mechanism on the Korean Peninsula should contribute under any circumstances to creating an atmosphere for the peaceful co-existence between the DPRK and the U.S. and achieving peaceful reunification of the north and the south of Korea. The building of a peace mechanism is a process which the DPRK and the U.S. should go through without fail in order to attain the goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By nature the ceasefire was realized on the premise of a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean issue has not yet been solved due to the U.S. unreasonable policy toward the DPRK though more than half a century has passed since the conclusion of the KAA. \r\n The U.S. adopted \"National Security Council Resolution 170\" in November 1953 right after the ceasefire, defining it as its policy to perpetuate the division of the Korean Peninsula, while indefinitely keeping the ceasefire mechanism till it puts the whole of Korea under its occupation. In June, 1954 the U.S. deliberately brought the Geneva conference on the Korean issue to rupture, completely blocking the withdrawal of all the foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful solution of the Korean issue envisaged in the KAA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the subsequent period, too, the U.S. sought only confrontation and tension on the Korean Peninsula, turning down the proposal for holding the tripartite talks inviting south Korea, too, to participate in the DPRK-U.S. talks and all other fair and realistic proposals and initiatives advanced by the DPRK government to replace the armistice agreement by a peace agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK also had the four-party talks to build a lasting peace mechanism on the Korean Peninsula but they could not prove successful due to the U.S. insincere approach towards the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As seen above, due to the U.S. anachronistic policy aimed to maintain the ceasefire mechanism on the Korean Peninsula, Northeast Asia still remains the biggest hotbed in the world, the only region where there is the structure of confrontation dating back to the Cold War era in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To replace the fragile ceasefire mechanism by a lasting peace mechanism on the Korean Peninsula with a view to doing away with the last leftover of the Cold War era is essential not only for the peace and reunification of Korea but for the peace and security in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Moreover, this presents itself as an issue pending an urgent solution for fairly settling the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S., a matter of concern of the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Replacing the ceasefire mechanism by a peace mechanism on the Korean Peninsula would lead to putting an end to the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK, which spawned the nuclear issue, and the former's nuclear threat and automatically result in the denuclearization of the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The replacement of the fragile ceasefire mechanism by a lasting peace mechanism on the Korean Peninsula would precisely mean a process of peacefully settling the Korean issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Successful progress in the process of building a peace mechanism on the Korean Peninsula would not only help towards achieving peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia and the rest of the world but give a strong impetus to the process of the soon-to-be-resumed six-party talks aimed to settle the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the hope of the DPRK that the U.S. and other countries concerned would pay due attention to the just stand of the DPRK on building a peace mechanism and positively respond to it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Virtually every south Korean, naive child, the aged, girl and woman, has suffered from atrocities of the aggression troops. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is that those crimes were neither accidental occurrences nor privately motivated but products of the savage nature of the aggression troops. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A pamphlet distributed among the U.S. imperialist aggression forces has on its first page letters that they should be merciless and good at killing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is by no means fortuitous that the U.S. imperialist aggression troops have unhesitatingly committed bloody massacres, insulting south Koreans as field rats or pheasants since they set their feet on south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One can never be in peace as long as there is a wolf nearby. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the south Koreans are to lead a peaceful and stable life, they should pull the U.S. imperialist aggression troops, a group of murderers and hooligans, out of south Korea as early as possible.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Flunkeyism and dependence on outside forces would only lead to allowing foreign aggressor forces to meddle in the internal affairs of the Korean nation and make it impossible to settle the issue of the country's reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An independent stand can remain unshakable only when one is confident of the advantages and capability of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north and the south should preserve the present trend and atmosphere of the improving relations, tide over the complicated and serious situation and difficulties with their own wisdom and efforts and wage a dynamic struggle to achieve national reconciliation, cooperation and reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But such clumsy sleight of hand and plot will never work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They cooked up a lot of fictions about \"political refugees\" and \"defectors from the north\" whenever an opportunity presented itself. To whom did these smear campaigns bring disgrace? They must know about this better than any others as they orchestrated and staged the farces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is elementary common sense that such acts will hamstring the efforts to solve the nuclear issue and will not do the Koreans including those forces good.\r\n The orchestrators of the recent charade should apologize and pay a dear price for telling sheer lies.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
