The banner of the DIU, a symbol of struggle and glory, will always fly high over the earth.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "S. Korean Authorities Accused of Blocking Visits to Pyongyang \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, November 9 (KCNA) -- The south Korean authorities disallowed the visits to Pyongyang by the visiting group of south Korean youths and students for reunification, representatives of various reunification movement organizations, non-governmental aid organizations and religious organizations. Such action is a reckless act of hamstringing the process of reconciliation and cooperation between the north and the south as it is quite contrary to the spirit of the June 15 joint declaration and the trend of the times. \r\n Rodong Sinmun Thursday observes this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe south Korean authorities are blocking the exchange of visits between the north and the south and hamstringing even the process of inter-Korean cooperation and exchange, while reading the faces of foreign forces. This is a revelation of their deep seated flunkeyism towards the U.S. as they consider foreign forces more important than fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their flunkeyism towards the U.S. adversely affects the inter-Korean relations. Yielding to the pressure of Washington and instigated by it, the south Korean authorities have recently come out with what they call \"a proposal for sanctions against the north\" to join their American master in the racket of sanctions against the DPRK. As a matter of fact, the south Korean military authorities sent an \"observers' group\" to the U.S.-led PSI exercises targeted against the DPRK in the waters off Bahrain. Worse still, the south Korean authorities disallowed Pyongyang visits by the above-said visiting group and non-governmental organizations. The reality goes to clearly prove that they are taking part in real earnest in the sanctions against the DPRK under foreign forces' coercion and pressure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an unpardonable crime against the nation to join the U.S. imperialists in the above-said sanctions. Peace and stability of the country are achievable only when all Koreans cooperate with each other and pool their efforts, opposed to foreign forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities' involvement in the U.S. sanctions against the DPRK would only touch off strong protest and condemnation among the fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should unconditionally allow Pyongyang visits by different organizations and figures, fully aware of this.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "High Display of Revolutionary Spirit of Self-Reliance Urged \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, November 9 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Thursday editorially calls for ever higher display of the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance in all fields and at all units for the purpose of making a new leap in the building of a great prosperous powerful nation and successfully closing the drive for this year. \r\n Self-reliance is the traditional fighting morale and mighty mode of revolution of the Korean people advancing under the uplifted banner of the Juche idea, declares the editorial, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is noble truth substantiated by the prolonged struggle of the Korean people for socialism that only self-reliance is the way out and the road of eternal victory and prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There can be no slightest vacillation in the stand and will of the people of the DPRK to make the revolution to the end with confidence in their strength, no matter how the world may change and what grim test may face them in the way of their struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the vast plan of the Workers' Party of Korea for the building of a great prosperous powerful nation is to be carried out successfully at an earlier date, production and construction must be pushed ahead vigorously under the uplifted slogan of self-reliance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The drive for this year proves that strength of the DPRK built up under the banner of Songun is inexhaustible and there is nothing impossible and a higher leap can be brought, should all the people turn out with rare resolution and give fullest scope to the might of the economic foundation of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are getting more desperate in their moves to stifle Korean-style socialism which is advancing under the banner of Songun held aloft. The most powerful weapon for smashing the dastardly anti-DPRK maneuvers of the enemy is close single-minded unity around the headquarters of the revolution and the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance. The people of the DPRK should powerfully display the independent dignity of Songun Korea and the spirit of great strength and prosperity by resolutely foiling the enemy's moves with the revolutionary strategy of self-reliance and setting off a raging storm of great leap.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
