In 1942 more than 2,000 hectares of farm land and over 1,000 houses were inundated and many people were drowned.\r\n   President Kim Il Sung initiated the Pothong River improvement project right after the liberation of the country and came out to the spot on May 21, Juche 35 (1946). \r\n   At the ground-breaking ceremony  he made an address, before taking the first shovel in person, that the Pothong River improvement project was the first work with which Pyongyang citizens would  contribute to building a new democratic Korea and  the work  for the liberated Korean people to harness nature for the first time. \r\n   Thanks to the repeated on-spot guidance of the President and the patriotic enthusiasm of the citizens, the project was completed in 55 days. The Japanese imperialists had failed to finish it for ten years. \r\n   Waterway of the river was detoured and a  9-kilometer canal  and 3 million-square meter recreation grounds were built instead.\r\n   Standing on the river, once thick with wormwood stalks and weeds, are Chollima, Rakwon, Pipha, Kyonghung, Hasin and Changgwang streets with high- and ultra high-storied buildings in rows. And the victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum, the People's Palace of Culture, the Pyongyang Indoor Stadium, the Changgwang Health Complex, the International Telecommunications Centre and many other monumental edifices have been built.\r\n   Indeed, the change on and around the river adds lustre to the landscape of Pyongyang and shows well part of the Korean society that has changed beyond recognition.\r\n   In order to hand the President's undying feats for the river down through generations, the Korean people erected the monument to the Pothong River improvement project in May 1971, 25 years after he took  the first shovel in person.\r\n   Korea observes May 21 every year as day of builders.    \r\n \r\n\r\n"

A peach was engraved in its middle part and chrysanthemum and plum flowers in its fringes.\r\n   This eloquently shows the beautiful aspiration and character of the Korean people who have kind and strong dispositions and steadfast principles.\r\n   Rings were used in Korea from ancient times as a finger ornament.\r\n   In the Ri Dynasty, rings were made of gold, silver, copper, amber and white gem, and peach, tree leaves, flowers and birds were chiefly engraved in them.\r\n   The newly-unearthed gold ring is an excellent national inheritance of the Korean nation, which makes it possible to have a better knowledge of gold workmanship in those days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
