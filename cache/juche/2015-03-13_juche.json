Rodong Sinmun Friday says this in an editorial. \n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The history of building a rich and powerful country over seven decades can be characterized by self-reliance in a word.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the days of building socialism by their own efforts, the Korean people underwent unprecedentedly great difficulties and ordeals but they enjoyed all sorts of honor unimaginable in the history of the nation spanning thousands of years.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Had the DPRK abandoned the principle of self-reliance, yielding to outsiders' pressure, Juche-based socialism could not have been built on the earth and the name of the DPRK would have been eclipsed with the collapse of the world socialist system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Fullest play is given to the Korean nation-first spirit and mental power based on national self-esteem in the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is frustrating all the moves of the U.S. imperialists and their followers with powerful war deterrent for self-defense built with much effort and making a high-pitched drive for breaking through the latest science and technology and updating everything in Korean style. This is the stirring reality of Songun Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean people showed their mettle to the U.S. imperialists in the period of the great Chollima upswing though they blustered that Korea could not rise up on its feet for a hundred years. Koreans made the Arduous March, forced march, weathering the most stern test of history by themselves. The world will clearly witness how Songun Korea will tower high, meeting all challenges of the imperialist reactionaries and overcoming manifold ordeals just as they did in those days."
