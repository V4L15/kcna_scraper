            "content": "Minju Joson (organ of DPRK government)on best settlement of nuclear issue \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 27 (KCNA) -- The best way of solving the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula under the present situation is to hold negotiations in the wake of removal of threat to the DPRK. This is an expression of the DPRK's greatest magnanimity based on its principled and consistent stand, says Minju Joson in a signed commentary today.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The proposed conclusion of the non-aggression treaty between the DPRK and the U.S. serves as the reasonable and realistic step to bridge over the grave situation prevailing in the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. unilateral and high-handed attitude toward the DPRK over the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula makes it more difficult to settle the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our criterion of the settlement of all the issues is the preservation of our sovereignty and right to existence. There may be negotiations and use of deterrent forces to this end. We are prepared for all of them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. truly wants the settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, it should adopt practical measures to do away with threat to the DPRK, including the conclusion of the non-aggression treaty between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. gives legal assurances of non-aggression including the nonuse of nukes against the DPRK through the non-aggression treaty, the DPRK will be ready to clear the U.S. of its security concerns. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to have a good understanding of the DPRK's stand over the nuclear issue and make a proper choice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ball is in the U.S. court. \r\n   \r\n"
