All the fellow countrymen should unite into one, transcending the difference in ideology, ideal and social system to this end.\r\n   That is why in the declaration of national reunification Pomminryon called upon all the Koreans to turn out in a struggle to adhere to the three principles of national reunification as a reunification programme and charter and carry them into practice.\r\n   The organisation also reiterated that Korea should be reunified by a confederacy formula based on one nation, one state, two systems and two governments. Its call reflects the specific conditions of the country.\r\n   The confederacy formula is the best way of achieving reunification with the north and south not fighting with each other nor encroaching upon each other's interests.\r\n   All the Koreans in the north, south and abroad should firmly unite under the banner of the three principles of national reunification, frustrate the manoeuvrings of the separatist forces at home and abroad and turn out as one in a sacred, patriotic struggle to achieve national reunification, the cherished desire of the nation, at an early date. \r\n\r\n"

In particular, we will make every possible effort to take the upcoming August 15 as a historic occasion in making a turning-point for national independence, peace and national unity.\r\n   The south Korean authorities must look straight at the trend of history and the nation, stop the reckless acts against reunification at once and release all the detained pro-reunification, patriotic-minded figures without delay. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
