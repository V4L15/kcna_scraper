Korea Denounced \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 22 (KCNA) -- The Association of Koreans in the United States on November 15 reportedly released a statement titled \"Let's bring to justice principal culprits who cut off Internet links\" as regards the fact that the south Korean authorities cut off the links to the Internet sites of such organizations of Koreans overseas as Minjok Thongsin and the Institute of Reunification Studies on the charge of being \"pro-north sites.\"\r\n Noting that the anti-reunification forces including the Grand National Party, the Ministry of Information and Telecommunication and the Intelligence Service infringed upon the people's right to know and the freedom of expression on the strength of the outdated \"National Security Law\", the statement said those violators of human rights must be punished by the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will strengthen solidarity with patriotic compatriots and reunification movement organizations in all parts of the world and patriotic civilians and organizations in south Korea and wage a vehement struggle to have the NSL scrapped and punish those who took the step of cutting off the links to the Internet sites, the statement declared.           \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Interference in Internal Affairs of Korean Nation Flailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 22 (KCNA) -- The United States recently announced that it would transfer at least 20 persons including the secretary of its side to the Military Armistice Commission to the joint security area of Panmunjom and the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and leave them permanently there to let them perform the duty of \"approving\" and \"permitting\" the entrance and exit of south Koreans and materials into and out of the DMZ.\r\n Commenting on this, a Rodong Sinmun analyst Monday says this reveals the sinister intention of the U.S. to put the joint security area and the DMZ under its permanent control and hamstring inter-Korean economic cooperation including the construction of the Kaesong Industrial Zone. Branding this move as a wanton violation of the sovereignty of the Korean nation and an open interference in inter-Korean cooperation, the analyst goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has no justification to interfere in inter-Korean economic cooperation including the construction of the Kaesong Industrial Zone as it is an undertaking to be carried out by the Korean nation itself for its common prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation has never asked the U.S. to help it in its economic cooperation. It is quite nonsensical to leave the sovereignty and dignity of the nation at the tender mercy of the U.S. imperialists, a gang of robbers who broke into its home. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has hamstrung the construction of the Kaesong Industrial Zone ever since its start, displeased with it. Some time ago, it made its government officials grumble that the project was arousing concern and too much expectation must not be hinged on it, thus manifesting in public its stand against the project. As if it were not enough, the U.S. is now openly poking its nose into the internal affairs of the Korean nation to scuttle the project. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality once again makes it plain that the U.S. is a disturber and aggressor who unreasonably interferes in everything the Koreans do between them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We can never tolerate the high-handed arbitrary acts of the U.S. to besmear and infringe upon the dignity and sovereignty of the Korean nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

According to sources, they are now planning to smuggle reactionary propaganda materials into it by illegal channels .They are going to throw millions of U.S. dollars every year into the extension of the hours of slanderous broadcasting toward it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the past, they have carried on tenacious radio propaganda and psychological warfare to destroy the unity in mind of the Korean people which is more powerful than the nuclear weapon, create an internal disorder and bring ideological and mental degeneration and collapse to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through their psychological plot-breeding tools and bases around the DPRK, the U.S. imperialists are now trying to infiltrate capitalist publications of all shades into the DPRK, while spreading superstition. They have gone into extremes in their psychological warfare and reactionary ideological and cultural intrusion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world progressive people should heighten their vigilance and wage a vehement struggle to frustrate the reactionary ideological and cultural infiltration of the U.S.-led imperialists and hasten the victorious advance of the cause of independence.     \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"
