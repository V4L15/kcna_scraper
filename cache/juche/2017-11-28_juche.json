He added that his confidence grows stronger upon hearing that the people of the province came to keenly feel again, through the construction of the farm, that they can do anything and can be better off when they give play to the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He highly appreciated the feats performed by the officials, builders and volunteers for building the perfect farm as intended by the Party, saying he was very satisfied with the farm completed to be impeccable even in the distant future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed expectation and belief that the officials and employees of the farm would surely turn out 1 200 tons of catfish every year for the people of the province under the banner of scientific fish farming, and had a photo session with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accompanying him were O Su Yong and Pak Thae Song, vice-chairmen of the C.C., WPK, and Jo Yong Won, vice department director of the C.C., WPK."

Current situation evidently shows that it is only a matter of time that a nuclear war breaks out on the peninsula due to Trump's war mania and that the choice made by the DPRK was absolutely right.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The attempts to defame the dignified image of the DPRK by spreading baseless allegations against it are further increasing our vigilance as they are happening at the time when Trump designated the DPRK as a \"state sponsor of terrorism\" after vowing to \"totally destroy\" it and the moves of the Trump administration to stifle the DPRK are reaching the extremes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To make it clear once again, the DPRK's nuclear force which targets none other than the U.S. is the reliable deterrent to prevent a nuclear war and firmly defend peace on the Korean peninsula by thoroughly eradicating the half-a-century long unilateral nuclear blackmail and threat from the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We take this opportunity to issue a warning to the pseudo-intellectuals who are hurling vicious abuse at the DPRK in pursuance of the moves of the Trump administration and some of the Western media that are producing false reports based on absurd and groundless speculations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If you are truly interested in the settlement of the nuclear issue and peace and security, you should properly understand the root cause of the nuclear issue based on your own principles and contribute to international justice by being true to the principle of objectivity and unbiasedness, the very life and mission of the media."

However, it can never cover up the inhumane and criminal features of the sanctions to isolate and stifle our State and nation by primitive means, who never gave in to nuclear threats.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t History shows that if our country, the east gate to the Asian continent, is weak, the Korean peninsula would become the competing ground of the powers and whole of Asia would be involved in the vortex of war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our army and people, holding in high esteem respected Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un, will resolutely smash the reckless nuclear war provocation and the sinister moves of sanctions and pressure of the Unites States by further increasing our own strength under the banner of independence and self-reliance. And we will also fulfill our mission in the struggle to safeguard the peace in the Korean Peninsula and Asia and realize international justice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I am convinced that the theme of this plenary; achieving peace and development of Asia, will surely become a reality when all Asian peoples are united under the idea of independence, peace and friendship.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In conclusion, I would like to express unreserved support to and solidarity with the peoples in Asian countries including Iran, Syria and Palestine who are struggling to put an end to the interference of foreign forces and to defend the sovereignty of the nation."

Foreign Minister Kono on Nov. 24 said that \"north Korea's nuclear test and its missiles that fly over Japan constitute unprecedented threats not only to Japan but the international community as a whole. This can never be tolerated\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is the strategic purpose sought by Japan which is so much concerned about the situation on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan has persistently tried to prove the conditions of \"emergency\" around Japan by taking the advantage of the situation on the Korean peninsula while trying to use it as a pretext for the increase in the defence budget and military capabilities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Abe government has created the atmosphere favorable for defusing internal political crisis and realizing the constitutional revision by citing \"nuclear and missile threats from north Korea\" as a pretext.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Abe, in particular, seeks to arouse social concerns and make society veer to the right through the collusion with right-wing forces in a bid to remain in power for long.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What he seeks here is to build up the public opinion inside Japan by spreading the \"story of crisis on the Korean peninsula\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During the recent election of the members of the House of Representatives Abe and the Liberal Democratic Party went around, loudly claiming that \"nuclear and missile provocation by north Korea is a great threat to Japan\" and asking for \"encouraging the Liberal Democratic Party so that it can resolutely counter the threat from north Korea\". This is just a typical example.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan keen on meeting its own interests by finding fault with others is trying to incite hostility toward the DPRK to the maximum, embroil the whole Japanese archipelago into the militarist whirlwind and thus realize the constitutional revision for becoming a military giant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural that the international community and even the Japanese are describing the Abe ruling forces' moves as the ones aimed at the \"revival of militarism under the pretext of threat from north Korea\", \"creation of pretexts for justifying preemptive attack on the north\" and a \"political trick to turn the table in its favor\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Abe group is going reckless in its moves to impose sanctions and pressure on the DPRK while loudly trumpeting about \"nuclear and missile threats from the north\". This is an intolerable act of hostility toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean people will not just remain an on-looker to the vicious moves of the Japanese reactionaries who are spurring their moves for reinvasion with the backing of the U.S. only to add crimes to those already committed by them."
