Korea Accused of Lobbying Anti-DPRK Act \r\n Pyongyang, June 20 (KCNA) -- The DPRK condemned the south Korean group of traitors for their ongoing attempt to lobby \"north Korean human rights act\", extremely provocative to the DPRK, despite the strong protest of people at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea made this criticism in its information bulletin No. 973 on Monday.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The act is an anti-reunification and confrontation law aimed at sinister political purposes to slander and defile the socialist system of the DPRK and the dignity of its leadership and undermine it from within, the bulletin said, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet group made several attempts so far to enact this law but failed with rejection by people at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now it is again trying to railroad the law through the \"National Assembly\", which shows how far the group has gone in inciting confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"north Korean human rights act\" is an anti-reunification, treacherous and inhumane law much more vicious than the notorious \"National Security Law\" in terms of its character, purpose and contents.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through this act, the group of traitors seeks to justify abduction of DPRK citizens, psychological warfare against it and other confrontation and smear campaigns and lay a legal foundation for such moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this way it schemes to realize its pipedream about \"contingency\" and \"unification under the liberal and democratic system.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such attempt is just an official and total denial of the system, sovereignty and dignity of the DPRK and it is for legalizing confrontation in system with the DPRK. This is a reckless deed designed to totally break the north-south agreement on recognizing and respecting the system of each side and push the north-south relations deeper to deadlock and confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the puppet group enacts the criminal act, the army and people of the DPRK who regard socialism as their life and soul will consider it as an official declaration of war against the system and people of the DPRK and the second \"target case\" and take decisive counteraction against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group will be entirely to blame for unimaginable grave consequences to be entailed by its persistent moves to enact the anti-DPRK law despite the DPRK's warning, it said."

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun S. Korean Authorities' Remarks about \"Apology\" Blasted\r\n Pyongyang, June 20 (KCNA) -- A mandarin of the south Korean puppet Ministry of Unification in a recent press interview blustered that south Korea would not \"gloss over\" the \"Cheonan\" warship case and the Yonphyong Island shelling incident, adding there would be no \"next phase\" of the inter-Korean relations unless the two cases are settled. He went the lengths of vociferating about \"the unification of the systems,\" talking this or that about \"the three-phase unification proposal\" touted by the south Korean authorities. \n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Monday observes in a by-lined commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conspiratorial and provocative nature of the above-said two cases had already been brought to daylight. It was none other than the Lee Myung Bak group that spawned the two controversial cases. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They were an inevitable product of the anti-DPRK confrontation policy of the conservative group as it pushed the inter-Korean relations to a collapse by hamstringing the efforts to implement the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee regime's policy of confrontation is still pursued and there is no knowing when it will spark military provocations. How there be \"next phase\" of the inter-Korean relations under this situation?  These relations have been practically frozen as the puppet forces are stepping up the moves to escalate the confrontation with the DPRK while groundlessly passing the buck for the two cases on it. The call for \"admission and apology\" made again by the above-said guy reminds one of a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their oft-repeated call for \"apology\" and the like is nothing but a subterfuge to shun the process to improve the inter-Korean relations and justify their policy of confrontation with the DPRK. Tight-cornered by the total failure of their policy toward the DPRK, the puppet forces are now working hard to evade the responsibility for the prevailing situation and intensify the confrontation racket in a bid to realize their wild ambition for \"the unification of the systems.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is evidenced by their talk about the above-said proposal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean authorities do not wish to see the situation inch close to an uncontrollable phase, they had better stop talking about nonsensical \"apology\" and respond to the DPRK's call as early as possible, urges the commentary."

            "content": "Immediate Halt to U.S. Saber-rattling against DPRK Demanded \r\n Pyongyang, June 20 (KCNA) -- Some days ago the U.S. forces in south Korea conducted combined tactical exercises in Phaju City, Kyonggi Province with the puppet forces. Involved in the maneuvers were huge aggression troops including tanks, armored cars, artillery pieces and unmanned reconnaissance planes belonging to the 1st Brigade of the U.S. 2nd Division and the 2nd Armored Brigade of the 1st Corps of the puppet army.\n\t\t\t\t\t Timed to coincide with these exercises, joint ground exercises were staged in Phaju and Koyang cities, Kyonggi Province, with civilians, administrative officials and police involved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Monday observes in a by-lined commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said saber-rattling is a blatant challenge to the DPRK and a revelation of a criminal scenario to escalate the military tension on the Korean Peninsula and ignite a war of aggression against it at any cost, the commentary notes, and continues:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The danger of the recent maneuvers lies in that they were just like an overture of a ground attack to be mounted on the DPRK from an area close to the Military Demarcation Line.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is the fact that the U.S. imperialists hurled into the war maneuvers the Bradley armored cars which they  used in the land attack operations in Iraq in 2003.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is by no means fortuitous that the above-said tactical maneuvers were staged by the U.S. warmongers who are contemplating conducting joint military maneuvers in the waters around Paekryong Island with south Korean puppet forces in July.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is their scenario to finally round off their naval strike operation in the waters around Paekryong Island and ground attack operation in the areas along the MDL in an effort to create a phase favorable for provoking the second Korean War. The combined tactical exercise staged by them in the area close to the MDL was to serve that purpose. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. would be well advised to stop at once the above-said adventurous saber-rattling."
