Leader Kim Jong Il paid a visit to China in April during which he met the new collective leadership including Hu Jintao and deepened the friendship. This marked an event of weighty importance as it brought about an epochal turn in boosting the friendly relations in line with the desire and will of the two peoples and the need of the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The hard-working and resourceful Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. have made strenuous endeavours to firmly defend the revolutionary gains already achieved and embark on modern civilization free from backwardness and poverty, thus bringing about a remarkable turn in the vast land of China. The new Chinese collective leadership is striving hard to build China into a comprehensively well-off society by uniting and leading its people, guided by the important thought of \"three represents\" and principles of \"people first\" and \"governance for the people\". China is energetically pushing forward the work to reunify the whole country. The international position of China is rising day by day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the consistent stand of the Party and government of the DPRK to set store by and boost traditional friendship with China generation after generation. The Korean people will make positive efforts to bring this friendship into fuller bloom in the new century.\r\n Minju Joson says it is beyond doubt that the visit will make a significant contribution to boosting the DPRK-China friendship.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S. would be well advised to make a bold decision to pull its forces out of south Korea without delay, mindful that its wild design to dominate Korea is a ridiculous dream that stands no chance of realization and it will touch off a nationwide anti-U.S. resistance of the Korean people.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This proves that his remarks reflect not merely his own opinion but the views of the authorities on national cooperation. If that is true there would be nothing to expect from the south side for the improvement of the inter-Korean relations nor any reason to follow its attitude towards it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality proves that the south Korean authorities have not yet gotten rid of their anti-national and anachronistic stand of seeking cooperation with outsiders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The cooperation with the U.S. to stifle the DPRK is a traitorous cooperation to launch a war. The era of reunification after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration undergoes pain due to the south Korean authorities who deny the idea and political system in the DPRK, their dialogue partner, and seek cooperation with the U.S. in line with traitorous logic as asserted by Mun. This is the very reason why the inter-Korean relations are at a stalemate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should bear deep in mind that the national cooperation can never go together with cooperation with outsiders and that it would be impossible for them to become an independent dialogue partner as they prefer cooperation with outsiders rather than that with their fellow countrymen.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
