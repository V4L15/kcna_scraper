For instance, the fifth inter-Korean ministerial talks slated to take place in March 2001 could not open as scheduled. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As there was a sign of a thaw in the temporarily frozen inter-Korean relations with the visit of a special envoy of the south to Pyongyang in April 2002 as a momentum, the U.S. peddled \"satellite photographs\" to spread the rumor about \"the danger of the possible collapse of the dam of Mt. Kumgang\" in order to frustrate the inter-Korean dialogues. In June of the same year the U.S. egged the south Korean bellicose forces on to spark off an armed clash in the West Sea, pushing the north-south dialogue to a crisis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. administration has instigated and pressurized the south Korean authorities to raise the nuclear issue of the north at all inter-Korean dialogues and contacts, laying a stumbling block in the way of the dialogues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. kicked up a noisy racket against the DPRK over its human rights issue plus the nuclear issue in a bid to create hurdles in the way of the inter-Korean dialogues and spark international disputes. It thus egged south Korea on to declare a state of emergency, pursuant to this campaign, obstructing the inter-Korean dialogues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the cooperation between the north and the south was brisk to implement the June 15 joint declaration, the U.S. invented all sorts of pretexts for holding it in check such as \"drain on resources,\" \"outflow of strategic materials\" and \"use for a military purpose.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  A typical example of this was the fact that the U.S. obstructed the tour of Mt. Kumgang, a symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation, asserting that \"funds paid for tourism might be used for a military purpose.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has openly interfered in and hampered like a gendarme the work of reconnecting the rail and road links between the north and the south and the construction of the Kaesong industrial zone under the pretexts of \"approval\" or \"permission\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has also demanded the south Korean enterprises get approval on a-case-by-case basis before their entry into the zone under the pretext of \"blocking the introduction of strategic materials\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has stood in the way of the inter-Korean cooperation in the field of electricity supply.\r\n The first meeting of the panel for inter-Korean cooperation in power supply was opened in Pyongyang in Feb. 2001. But the U.S. pressurized the south Korean authorities not to discuss the issue, asserting that it could not allow the discussion on the issue because south Korea's supply of electricity to the north might deprive it of the nuclear card. In consequence, the discussion of the matter proved unsuccessful at the meeting and the cooperation in this field has failed to make any progress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has tried hardest to deter south Korea from supplying fertilizers to the north under the pretext of the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to what has been disclosed, 90 percent of the CIA agents active in south Korea are specializing in the issues related to the inter-Korean relations and watching and controlling all the south Koreans who have visited the north by directly grasping their tendencies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The real aim sought by the U.S. in meddling in and obstructing the undertakings done by Koreans and hamstringing the efforts to implement the joint declaration is to perpetuate its military presence in south Korea and colonial rule over it and escalate the moves for a war of aggression on the Korean Peninsula.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Blasts Japan's Despicable Political Plot\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 13 (KCNA) -- The Japanese magazine Weekly Post carried a false article slandering the DPRK which says Japan has obtained new shocking information about the surviving Yokota from U.K. intelligence service.\r\n According to the article, the British intelligence service obtained a photo of surviving Yokota through a military reconnaissance satellite in the summer of 2004 and a British government source conveyed to the Japanese prime minister's residence in the autumn of that year information that there was evidence proving that Megumi Yokota is alive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The story said a diplomat of the British embassy in Pyongyang is an agent MI 6 who obtained convincing evidence to prove her survival, adding a journalist in Japan proved this by talking to the agent over phone. The information was immediately passed to some heavyweights of the Japanese regime and it was obvious that the information was greatly instrumental in heightening the anti-DPRK bitterness of the hardliners including Abe, acting secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, the article added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We do not like to say anything about the misinformation floated by the magazine as it specializes in spreading rumors among the political and social circles as a mouthpiece of the Japanese ultra-right conservatives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBut we cannot but take note of the fact that there is the story about the British government's involvement in the \"abduction issue\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In connection with the content of the article, an organ concerned of the DPRK officially asked the British embassy to confirm whether it is true or not. The British side's answer was negative. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As seen above, the Japanese ultra-right wing conservatives, hell bent on the anti-DPRK propaganda, have gone the lengths of resorting to such a shameless political adventure as plugging even an intelligence service of other country into the \"abduction issue\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The spread of such baseless story can not be construed otherwise than a product of their foolish attempt to inject fresh energy into the waning smear campaign over the \"abduction issue\" and enlist support from the experienced British intelligence service for their bid to create again an atmosphere of sympathy with \"abductees\" among the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is another base political charade staged by the Japanese ultra-right conservatives to drive a wedge in the relations between the DPRK and the U.K. developing on good terms and cover up the truth behind the issue of examination of Yokota's remains. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already reported, it is needless to say that the hysteric attitude of the Japanese ultra-right conservatives toward the \"abduction issue\" has not been recognized by the international community. And their preoccupation with the issue of Megumi Yokota has only been ridiculed and censured by the international community for their vulgar purpose and method. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the husband of Megumi Yokota handed her remains to the Japanese side last year, the ultra-right forces floated the sheer fiction about \"false remains\", asserting that the results of the examination of the remains proved they were false. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Subsequently, the world-famous British science magazine Nature and the Japanese scientific circles gave a scientific explanation and recognition of the mistakes made in examining her remains, asserting that science and politics were mixed with each other as far as the issue of her remains is concerned. This has fully proved the truth behind the case. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese ultra-right conservatives have gone the lengths of resorting to any political chicanery, feeling unashamed at all of behaving against political and moral values and ethics. They can replace Yokota's remains by another's and paint even the dead as a person still alive, when necessary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They do not bother to reduce science to a waiting maid of politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The same can be said of their relations with other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Plugging an intelligence service of other country into the \"abduction issue\", a sensitive issue between the DPRK and Japan, is aimed at triggering off a diplomatic friction between the DPRK and the country concerned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One may say it is the Japanese ultra-right conservatives' wicked political and moral point of view to make no scruples of sacrificing other country and people to achieve their purpose. It is, therefore, not hard to guess the truth behind this shocking farce and draw a conclusion from it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese ultra-right conservatives are only keen on meeting their own political interests, regardless of whether they stand to reason or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This will, however, get Japan nowhere. For this behavior Japan will stand further marginalized and isolated in the international community.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Short as his life was, it was a brilliant life for the country and the nation during which he showed how the revolutionaries should remain loyal to the leader and his cause.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
