It is, therefore, none of its business. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the DPRK does not care whether the U.S. lists the former as a \"sponsor of terrorism\" or not, the spokesman clarified the DPRK's principled stand of opposing all forms of terrorism and any support to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had better properly face up to the reality and drop its anachronistic hostile policy towards the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This cannot but draw a very serious attention as it is part of the moves of the U.S. imperialists to round off their preparations for a new Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such U.S. military moves against the DPRK indicate that the U.S. does not truly want a negotiated solution to the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. talk about \"negotiated and diplomatic solution\" is nothing but hypocritical sophism about \"peace\" as it is intended to seek the moral laxity and disorganization of the Korean people and cover up its war moves. In other words, it seeks to buy time behind the scene of the six-way talks in a bid to round off its preparations for the second Korean war and stifle the DPRK through its high-handed military actions and preemptive attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Military actions are incompatible with dialogue. If the United States truly has no will to invade the DPRK but stands for a negotiated and diplomatic solution to the nuclear issue, it should give up such reckless acts as posing a serious military threat to its dialogue partner and putting pressure upon it and increasing the danger of war. The U.S. saber rattling against the DPRK will only vitiate the atmosphere of dialogue and complicate the situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. attempt to mount an adventurous military attack on the DPRK under the hypocritical cloak of dialogue and diplomacy compels its army and people to bolster its war deterrent force with highest revolutionary vigilance.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It dismissed the heavy penalty unreasonably imposed upon the pro-reunification patriot who had invariably striven for the implementation of the June 15 joint declaration to achieve national reunification by invoking the SL, a leftover of the old age, as a political plot intended to scuttle the implementation of the joint declaration and drive the south-north relations to the era of confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The letter urged the public security authorities to stop the premeditated intrigues for the suppression of pro-reunification patriotic organizations including the South Headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification and immediately set free Min Kyong U.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
