            "content": "Japan urged to stop reckless anti-DPRK campaign \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 19 (KCNA) -- The Japanese authorities, including the chief executive, are busy discussing the matter of such international pressure on the DPRK as \"restriction on remittance\" and \"ban on the export of weapons of mass destruction.\" \r\n Rodong Sinmun today in a commentary denounces such moves as a provocation to seriously get on the DPRK's nerves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The intention of the Japanese reactionaries is to invariably seek confrontation with the DPRK and reinvade Korea with the help of the U.S. imperialists, the news analyst points out, and says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They regard the U.S. escalated pressure on the DPRK over the nuclear issue as a good opportunity to turn Japan into a military power and stage a comeback to Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The bellicose forces of Japan are undisguisedly advocating the theory of preemptive attack on the DPRK. This is an open military threat to the DPRK and agitation for reinvasion of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We take this opportunity to reclarify the stand of our army and people. The DPRK will take a serious view of Japan's intensified anti-DPRK campaign and take a strong counteraction against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Japanese reactionaries persistently engage themselves in such anti-DPRK campaign, supporting the U.S. pressure on the DPRK over the nuclear issue, Japan's security will not be guaranteed and it may entail catastrophic consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are well advised not to make a rash act.    \r\n\r\n"

No one can take issue with this as it was a just self-defensive step taken against the U.S. moves to stifle the DPRK with nukes and the unreasonable behavior of the IAEA. Ever since its withdrawal from the NPT, the DPRK has made every possible effort for the peaceful settlement of its \"nuclear issue\" caused by the U.S. as the former values the peace and stability in and around the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is, however, peddling the \"nuclear issue\" on the Korean Peninsula on the international arena while talking about its \"peaceful solution.\" This indicates that the U.S. is challenging the efforts of the DPRK for its peaceful settlement and keen on putting undisguised pressure on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is noteworthy is that there is no justification to deal with the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula at the abovesaid meeting as the DPRK is no longer a signatory to the NPT. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a well-known fact that the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula is a product of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK from a to z. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ever since its emergence the present U.S. administration has escalated its hostile policy toward the DPRK and wantonly violated all the international agreements including the NPT by listing it as part of an \"axis of evil\" and a target of a preemptive nuclear attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the preparatory committee is to successfully perform its function, it should discuss the criminal acts committed by the U.S. as the biggest nuclear proliferator in gross breach of the NPT and force it to own responsibility under international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should not be so foolish as to bring the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula to the international arena but make a switchover in its hostile policy toward the DPRK, the key to settling the issue.    \r\n\r\n"

The departed souls of innocent Koreans killed by GIs in cold blood are calling for taking revenge upon them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans are called upon to give vent to their pent-up grudge against the U.S. imperialist aggressors.    \r\n\r\n"

His remains are buried in the Patriotic Martyrs' Cemetery in Sinmiri, Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though tricksters are experts at dreaming up lies, how can they assert that the deceased sought asylum in the U.S. across an ocean? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They will blush themselves with shame over telling the most sheer lies for a smear campaign if they visit the cemetery and confirm the fact with their own eyes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as Han Myong Chol, vice-president of the Jogwang Trading Corporation, who they claimed sought refuge in the U.S. with Kil Jae Gyong, is concerned, he is now active at his post. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHe appeared at a recent press conference in Macau, far from seeking asylum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The same is true of Yom Ki Sun's son. He is now carrying out his routine duty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Yom Jin Chol is in a foreign country where he sought refuge as tricksters claim, he must be a bogus one serving their sinister political purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The more sheer lies political plot-breeders spread, the more glaringly they reveal their true colors as anti-DPRK smear campaigners. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What they seek in this burlesque in South Korea is to impair the political system in the DPRK, tarnish the image of the north where single-hearted unity has been achieved and isolate and stifle it at any cost. But that is no more than a pipe dream. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean tricksters should apologize for such clumsy smear campaign launched against the DPRK in a bid to cripple its image and stop such farce at once, clearly understanding the revolutionary faith and will of our people who are advancing to build a great prosperous power in firm unity.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
