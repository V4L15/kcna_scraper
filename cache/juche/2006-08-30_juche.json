            "content": "KCNA Comments on \"Ulji Focus Lens\" Joint Military Exercises \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, August 29 (KCNA) -- The U.S.-south Korea \"Ulji Focus Lens\" joint military exercises against the DPRK are now getting frantic. \r\n The large-scale joint military exercises targeting the DPRK at a time when the political and military situation of the Korean Peninsula has become extremely strained and complicated are a prelude to the second Korean war to be launched by the U.S. according to its nuclear preemptive attack strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now the confrontation between the DPRK and the United States has gone to extremes owing to the U.S. moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK and, accordingly, it is more important than ever before to ease the tension and ensure peace in and around the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is nonsensical for the U.S. to claim that the joint military exercises getting on the nerves of the DPRK are \"annual military exercises\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This clearly proves that the U.S. has no willingness to remove the standoff with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The exercises are an undisguised military threat to the DPRK and a dangerous war move as they were prompted by the U.S. adventurous attempt to lead the DPRK-U.S. confrontation to a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is now stepping up the reinforcement and relocation of its troops in south Korea under the pretext of \"strategic flexibility\" and modified its operation plan against the north on the basis of its preemptive attack strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"Ulji Focus Lens\" is also a preliminary war to perfect the combat command and operation system of the armed forces of aggression and complete the preparations for a war on the basis of the U.S. new military policy against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is asserting that the \"exercises are aimed to help the U.S. forces and the south Korean army get familiar with the procedures of cooperation in case of emergency on the Korean Peninsula.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What they called \"emergency on the Korean Peninsula\" means the second Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The exercises simulate an actual war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the past military exercises, too, the U.S. and south Korean warmongers conducted different forms of military drills from \"exercises of commanding staff\" for a preemptive attack on the DPRK to \"landing operations,\" \"naval offensive operations,\" \"surprise air strike exercises,\" \"river-crossing operations\" and even \"biological and chemical warfare drills\" with weapons of mass destruction under the simulated conditions of an actual war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its alleged annual military exercises show that the U.S. is steadily increasing, training and perfecting its capability to wage an actual war against the north according to its operation plan for invasion of the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the facts clearly prove that the joint military exercises are a dangerous preliminary war, a nuclear test war for surprise invasion of the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. can never evade the responsibility for aggravating tension and harassing peace in the Korean Peninsula.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Military Collusion between U.S. and Japan under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, August 29 (KCNA) -- Japan requested cooperation from the U.S. in the earlier deployment of the missile defence system (MD) at an examiner-level consultation between foreign and defence authorities of the U.S. and Japan held in Washington on August 7 and 8.\r\n Japan decided to allow the deployment of nuclear-powered carrier \"George Washington\" in the Yokosuka naval base. According to the agreement of the U.S. and Japanese authorities, the deployment of the latest Aegis missile cruiser \"Shiloh\" in the naval base had already been decided. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson Tuesday says in a signed commentary carried in this regard: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and Japan are amassing means for preemptive attack in Japan and other parts of Northeast Asia, raising a hue and cry over \"military threat\" from someone. This is a serious development as it is rendering the situation in the region extremely tense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is zealously toeing the U.S. policy at a time when the latter is stretching its tentacles to the Asia-Pacific region to dominate it in a bid to make signal progress in executing Tokyo's old policy for militaristic overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Of late Japan has directed special attention to the establishment of the MD and the revision of its \"Pacifist Constitution\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By introducing the MD with the political and military backing of the U.S. the Japanese reactionaries seek to provide a military guarantee for preemptive assaults on other countries and round off the capability to mount a preemptive attack upon the DPRK as early as possible among other things. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is their aim to launch wars of overseas aggression in real earnest with regular aggression forces by replacing the \"Pacifist Constitution\" by a war constitution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This clearly indicates that everything Japan is doing is aimed at building a militaristic state for overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reactionaries of Japan would be well advised to immediately stop getting on the nerves of its neighboring countries.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

If there is a threat, it is a threat posed by the U.S. to other countries. It is none other than the U.S. that has defined the preemptive nuclear and missile strikes as the hard core of its military strategy and it is again the U.S. which actually makes missile attacks on other countries. Yet the U.S. warlike forces are working round the clock to establish an MD system, raising terrific outcries over somebody's \"threat\" to misrepresent truth. What they seek in this is a dangerous purpose to contain other countries by strength and establish an order of global domination. The U.S. advertisement that its scheme to deploy an MD system is intended to confront somebody's \"threat\" is a ruse to justify its drive for global domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an invariable ambition of the U.S. imperialists to dominate the world by strength. The U.S. MD scheme is a grave criminal act threatening and wrecking peace and security of the world and bringing a renewed arms race. The U.S. would be well advised to abandon its ambition to rule the world by strength and drop its scheme to build an MD system.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
