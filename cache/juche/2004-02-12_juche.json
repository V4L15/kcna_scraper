It even went to the lengths of saying that most of the Koreans in Japan came from the Korean peninsula according to their free will.\r\n By explaining that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Justice of Japan have the same opinion with the organization, the statement admitted that it represented the stand of the Japanese government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary says that the forcible drafting and abduction were one of the hideous crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists against humanity in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling the fact that the Japanese imperialists forcibly drafted and abducted more than 8.4 million Koreans during the period of their occupation of Korea to reduce them to cannon fodder or drive them hard like beasts of burden and killed them individually or in groups, the commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The forcible drafting and abduction committed by the Japanese imperialists were clearly confirmed and proved by historical data and testimonies made by victims and also recognized by the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The list of 427,000 Korean victims of forcible drafting discovered and made public in Japan last year clearly testifies how the Japanese imperialists forcibly drafted Koreans and forced them to do slave labour. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Therefore, what the organization asserted is sheer falsification of the truth and a whopping lie. The crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists in the past can be neither reversed nor hidden nor erased. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The distortion of history and mockery of the public opinion can never help Japan escape a severe punishment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should bear this in mind, honestly admit the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists in the past, make public the truth behind all of them and fully compensate for them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Tokyo is gravely mistaken, however. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is an invariable mode of counteraction of the DPRK to react to the hard-line policy with the toughest stand in its relations with those forces hostile to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's carriage of the amendment is a very dangerous act which may bring unpredictable consequences. Japan comes to know well what miserable consequences will be entailed by its rash act. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan will have to be wholly accountable for all the ensuing consequences.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The Korean nation must never allow the high-handed arbitrariness of the U.S. and its interference but resolutely frustrate the U.S. moves to stifle the DPRK and start a new war through cooperation and concerted efforts of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The June 15 joint declaration agreed upon and adopted by the north and the south is the nation's common program of independent reunification and an invariable landmark of national reunification. The way indicated by the joint declaration is exactly the way of reconciliation and cooperation and the way of independent reunification. The main spirit running through the declaration is the idea of national independence and \"By our nation itself\". The Korean nation should promote reconciliation and cooperation and strenuously carry on the movement of reunification by the efforts of our nation itself with the conviction that our nation is the best and nothing is impossible when the whole nation pools efforts. Either anti-U.S. anti-war struggle or the work for independent reunification should be conducted by our nation itself under the banner of the Korean nation-first spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Sure is the victory of the cause of independent reunification as the whole nation is advancing under the banner of our nation-first spirit, well aware that the destiny of the nation is held in its hand.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

At that time, he had it made clear that the DPRK would not send the captives back to the U.S. before it submitted a written surrender to the DPRK, and even though the U.S. delivered the surrender to the DPRK, the ship would not be sent back. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He also had an ultimatum issued declaring that if the U.S. refused to make an apology, all of the captives would be referred to a military trial. As a result, the U.S. imperialists admitted their crime and apologized to the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A touch-and-go situation was caused by the Panmunjom incident on August 18, 1976, the largest military conflict between the DPRK and the U.S. in the 1970s. But he, with composure, had a large number of servicemen mobilized in the face-lifting of the capital. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAnd he told a senior official of the Ministry of the People's Armed Forces that it was not good to have servicemen sent back to their units from rest homes because of the tense situation and that even if a war broke out, the rest homes should be animated with servicemen's singing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In May 1981 when the situation still remained tense, he charged the army with the construction of the West Sea Barrage, one of the biggest in the world, so as to answer the U.S. imperialists' new war preparations with a large-scale project. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In December 1998 when the U.S. imperialists were bringing the situation to the brink of war after working out the \"5027 Operation Plan\", a scenario for the second Korean war, he saw to it that the spokesman for the General Staff of the Korean People's Army released a statement declaring that the KPA's strike had no limit and there was no place on the globe to escape the strike. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Encouraged by such grit of Kim Jong Il, the Korean army and people have advanced victoriously, meeting the enemy's tough policy with tougher countermeasures and countering the enemy's rifle with gun.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The meeting drew a serious attention to Japan's above-mentioned moves for reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of Japan's redemption of its past is an important issue in protecting the dignity and the sovereignty of the Korean nation, defending the peace and stability in Asia and establishing basic ethics and order in the international community, it said,\r\ncalling for launching an all-out offensive to force Japan to redeem its past crimes against humanity this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It adopted a resolution after discussing the issue of conducting thorough investigation into the cases of serious human rights abuses committed by Japan, exerting efforts to trace the whereabouts of survivors, the issue of denouncing Japan's past crimes on the international arena including the UN and raising the voices demanding Japan redress them at home in solidarity with organizations concerned.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
