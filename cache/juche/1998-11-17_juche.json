Underlying its moves is its revengeful ambition to realise the fantastic design for \"greater east Asia coprosperity sphere\" which it failed to in the past war of aggression as well as the comeback to Korea.\r\n   The present situation in which Japan's ambition for military expansion is getting all the more undisguised, urges Asian nations who hope for regional peace and security to join in the efforts to check and frustrate Japan's design for militarist reinvasion and its moves for military power.\r\n   The Japanese authorities should ponder over miserable consequences their reckless attempts to reinvade Korea and turn Japan into a military power will bring to the future and destiny of Japan.\r\n   They should look squarely at the trend of the times and stop running amuck. \r\n\r\n"

Inexhaustible is the might of the collectivist method which makes the producers give full play to the consciousness of being the masters and creative enthusiasm and strengthen unity and cooperation.\r\n   To rely on the socialist principle and method is an essential requirement for thoroughly shattering the counterrevolutionary offensive of the imperialists.\r\n   Standing back a step and deviating from the socialist principle and method give way to tens of backward steps in confrontation with the imperialists and this leads to a collapse of socialism.\r\n   It is under the wise guidance of the party which is firmly defending the revolutionary principle of the working class that the Korean people, rallied around the party and the leader in one mind, are now smashing the imperialists' heinous and persistent moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK and emerging victorious.\r\n   If one maintains  the  revolutionary principle in the struggle against the imperialists, one will be a victor and if one gives up the principle, one will be a slave. \r\n\r\n"
