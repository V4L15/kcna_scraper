The U.S. Ambassador answered that the U.S. would monitor the human rights performance in the north with concern. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently in the U.S. the \"bill on relief and protection of North Korean refugees\" was passed at its senate as part of its vicious moves to use the DPRK's non-existent \"human rights abuse\" as another pretext for carrying out its policy to stifle the DPRK by manipulating \"defectors from the north\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Seeing that its \"nuclear issue\" strategy did not work on the DPRK the U.S. is now going to put up the issue of \"human rights abuse\" in the north and the issue of \"refugees\" in a bid to tarnish the image and the dignity of the DPRK. But this is nothing but a foolish ruse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seeks in this to hamstring the process of reconciliation and cooperation, incite confrontation and escalate tension between the north and the south in the end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The defectors cited by the U.S. are criminals who ran away after committing such unpardonable crimes as murder, rape and theft in the north and human scum such as hooligans, swindlers and idlers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The mean operation launched by the U.S. against the north with such human trashes involved only lays bare its base and shameless nature and its piteous position. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There exist no issues of \"political offenders\" and \"human rights abuse\", to say nothing of \"refugees\" in the DPRK as the country forms a big harmonious family in which people help and lead each other forward. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is that the U.S. which has the world's poorest human rights record, is saying this or that about the \"human rights performance\" of someone, styling itself a human rights judge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the U.S. where the human rights are most wantonly violated and which has the biggest exodus of refugees. It has violated the human rights of peoples of other countries by provoking wars of aggression and created a great number of refugees. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such being a stark fact, the U.S. is going to attach the label of \"human rights abuse\" to the DPRK. This is a height of folly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The burlesque staged according to the U.S. scenario and at its manipulation has only touched off the Korean people's anti-U.S. sentiments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should drop such burlesque at once.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
