            "content": "Kim Jong Un Sends Message of Congratulations to Teaching Staff, Students of Korea University\r\nPyongyang, April 11 (KCNA) -- Supreme leader Kim Jong Un Sunday sent a message of congratulations to the teaching staff and students of Korea University on its diamond jubilee.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe full text of the message of congratulations reads as follows:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tI, in the name of the people in the homeland, extend warm congratulations and compatriotic greetings, along with the hearts of the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, to all the teaching staff, students and graduates of Korea University who are celebrating their university's 60th founding anniversary at a meaningful time when the dignity and national strength of our Democratic People's Republic of Korea are being demonstrated on the highest level and a new era of prosperity is dawning in the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe 60-year history of Korea University is a history of the deep, warm and ennobling affection for the compatriots and the nation cherished by the peerlessly great men of Mt Paektu, who made every possible effort for the education of the younger generations of Chongryon (General Association of Korean Residents in Japan), and a history of patriotic devotion with which the officials of Chongryon and other compatriots resident in Japan worked to safeguard their democratic national rights and promote national education. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUntil the last period of his life since he had Korea University built in the heart of Japan as the supreme temple of democratic national education during the difficult period of postwar rehabilitation, President Kim Il Sung showed unstinting affection and benevolence for the development of Chongryon and Korea University. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was under his warm care that, even when the country was facing economic difficulties, a large amount of educational aid funds and stipends were sent to the students of Korea University on a yearly basis; such a legendary tale of great love is unprecedented in the history of overseas compatriots' movement. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGeneral Kim Jong Il made painstaking efforts to build up Korea University, which was developed under the President's close concern, into the base for training Chongryon officials where the ideological and leadership system of Juche has been thoroughly established, and into the \"pedigree farm\" for training native talents. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDespite his tight schedule for the Songun-based revolutionary leadership, the General met the teaching staff and students of Korea University, according them the greatest honour, and showed particular care and benevolence for the bright future of the university. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe paternal love he showed to train the children of Chongryon-affiliated compatriots into dependable successors to the patriotic cause permeates the whole of Korea University?faculties, educational system, curriculum, modern educational equipment, specimens of animals and plants, and campus. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIndeed, the President and the General were the founder and builder of our Korea University, benevolent fathers and mentors of its teaching staff and students, and Korea University is, both in name and in reality, the university of the President and the General, the DPRK's dignified, Juche-oriented university for overseas compatriots, which was founded and built up under the great leaders' benevolent care. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOver the past 60 years since its establishment Korea University, as the supreme temple of national education, centre of scientific research and bulwark for the preservation of the national identity, has rendered a great service to building up the organizations of Chongryon and developing the movement of Koreans in Japan under the wise guidance and warm care of the great leaders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the past the teaching staff of the university have devoted their all to the national education of Chongryon without pursuit of any personal fame or reward, and its graduates have performed with credit the core role in developing the movement of Koreans in Japan by taking over the baton of love for their homeland and nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRecorded in the chapters of the proud history traversed by the university are the ardent patriotic loyalty and devoted efforts of the university graduates and their parents and other compatriots from all walks of life in Japan who have worked with devotion for the development of Chongryon and the future of the movement of Koreans in Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBecause we have such dependable patriots who strive not for their own wealth and prosperity but solely for the development of national education and Chongryon, invariably following the road of patriotism on which nobody can easily embark in an alien land where money talks, the dignity of our country is further exalted and the baton of the patriotic cause of Chongryon is being carried forward reliably.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKorea University, the one and only university in the world for a country's overseas compatriots, is indeed a source of great pride and honour for our country and nation and a precious asset for Chongryon and Korean compatriots in Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tI extend warm thanks to all the teaching staff of the university, officials of Chongryon and other Korean compatriots in Japan who, as gardeners and foundation for cultivating the flower garden of national education of Chongryon, have rendered a positive contribution to founding and developing Korea University, upholding the great leaders' Juche-oriented idea of national education and leadership.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tToday, when the movement of Koreans in Japan has entered a historic stage of ushering in its new heyday holding the great Comrades \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il in high esteem in the vanguard of the Juche-oriented overseas compatriots' movement, Korea University shoulders a very heavy responsibility.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn accordance with the historic mission and basic duty it has assumed before the times and the country the university should train all its students to be the backbone of the movement of Koreans in Japan and reliable successors to the patriotic cause, who are possessed with an ennobling spirit and profound knowledge, so as to continuously demonstrate its prestige and fame as the university of the overseas citizens of the dignified DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe tradition of loyalty and love for the country and nation is the original feature and lifeblood of Korea University. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKorea University should champion and add eternal brilliance to the great leaders' immortal leadership exploits associated with it and establish in it the ideological and leadership system of Juche in a more thoroughgoing way, so as to train all its students to be the youth core who are fully equipped with the Juche-oriented outlook on the world and are ready to share life and death with their socialist homeland whatever the situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt should produce a larger number of competent experts ideologically steadfast and well-versed in science and technology as demanded by the organizations of Chongryon and the community of Koreans in Japan, by establishing the Juche orientation in national education and putting the contents and methods of education on a patriotic, scientific and IT footing in line with the requirements of the movement of Koreans in Japan and the new century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn order to train students to be reliable youth core and patriotic talents who can shoulder the future of the movement of Koreans in Japan, teachers, who are in direct charge of education and edification, should become genuine revolutionaries and educationists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTeachers of Korea University, by steadily improving their political and ideological, scientific and technological qualifications, should ensure political and ideological character, scientific accuracy and applicability of the contents of education, and conduct all forms of education, including lessons and seminars, in conformity with the levels of the students and their ages and psychological features.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCherishing a high aim and beautiful dreams and ideals to shoulder the future of Chongryon and the movement of Koreans in Japan, all the students of Korea University should learn and learn zealously, keep up-to-date with the reality of their prospering socialist homeland and breathe the same air as it all the time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe committee of the Korean Youth League in Japan at Korea University should prepare all the students as pillars of the patriotic cause, who are steadfast in their faith and ready to devote their all to their organization and collective, by establishing a revolutionary habit of studying and effectively conducting five-point education among students.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNational education is the lifeline and great foundation of the movement of Koreans in Japan which has a bearing on the destiny of Chongryon and determines the success or failure of its patriotic cause.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOrganizations, affiliates and other organs of Chongryon at all levels including its Central Standing Committee should bear deep in mind that the lifeline of the movement of Koreans in Japan is guaranteed by Korea University, the supreme temple of national education, take warm care of its students as their own flesh and blood, and vigorously advance the educational work of the university as an undertaking involving the whole community of Koreans in Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBright and promising is the future of Korea University shining together with the august names of the peerlessly great men of Mt Paektu, and definite is final victory for Chongryon and the movement of Koreans in Japan as there is a large contingent of reliable successors who are studying at this university, the \"pedigree farm\" for training the core of Chongryon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tI firmly believe that Korea University will fully guarantee the long-term development of the Juche-oriented movement of Koreans in Japan by training reliable successors to the patriotic cause of Chongryon as intended and desired by the great leaders."

It is because the on-going joint drills are targeting the supreme leadership of the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The chairman of the World Peace Council said that the U.S. and its allies are pursuing the sinister goal of bringing down the socialist system of Pyongyang by force, adding it is part of Washington's scenario to carry out its strategy of dominating Asia and a war scenario against independent countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The chairman of the Al Hadi Islam Propaganda Organization of Iran blamed the U.S. for persisting in reckless nuclear threat and blackmail against the DPRK for decades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the unanimous view of the international community on the aggressive nature and gravity of the joint military drills being staged by the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The on-going biggest-ever nuclear war drills involving huge troops of the U.S. and south Korea and all nuclear strategic weaponry of the U.S. are seriously harassing peace and security on the Korean peninsula and in other parts of the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The gravity is that the drills are aimed to realize the hideous criminal scenario of eliminating the supreme leadership of the DPRK that represents the destiny, future and life of the Korean people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"operation for advancing into the depth of the north\", \"operation for occupying Pyongyang\", \"beheading operation\" and \"precision strike drill\" were openly staged.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This reckless saber-rattling of the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces is the most undisguised blatant challenge to the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and an open declaration of war against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality clearly proves what is the root cause of the touch-and-go situation prevailing on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is entirely attributable to the U.S.-south Korea joint military drills and the hostile policy being pursued by the White House toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is now busy making profound confusion of right and wrong by creating impression that the tension on the Korean peninsula was caused by the DPRK's access to nuclear weapons. But this is no more than rhetoric to cover up the aggressive scenario of the U.S. administration to \"topple\" the DPRK dynamically advancing, holding aloft the banner of independence, and lay a springboard for dominating the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's access to nuclear weapons is a due measure for self-defence to cope with the outrageous military threat being posed by the U.S. to seriously impair the dignity and prestige of the DPRK and to wantonly abuse the right of its people to existence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is the arch criminal that compelled the DPRK to have access to nuclear weapons and bolster them up.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the U.S. gets more desperate in pursuing its nuclear war strategy and goes more reckless in its joint war drills to carry it out, the DPRK's nuclear deterrent gets stronger.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's nuclear weapons are symbolic of justice and peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's bolstering its nuclear weapons strike capability is entirely designed to increase its muscle for deterring the aggression and war of the U.S.-led hostile forces and thus prevent the nuclear disaster on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has never invaded other countries and the Korean people set store by peace more than any others.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S.-south Korea joint war drills targeting the supreme leadership of the DPRK show any slight sign of going over into an actual war, the DPRK will launch a merciless preemptive nuclear attack to reduce the enemy bases to ashes.
