This proves that the U.S. imperialists' moves to bring down the system of the DPRK are entering into an earnest and undisguised stage of action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is foolishly calculating that it can realize its ambition for \"change of the system\" in the DPRK with carrot and stick tactics. But it is seriously mistaken.\r\n It is a strategic error for the U.S. to try to carry out its ambition for the \"change of the system\" in the DPRK while trampling down on its sovereignty by force of arms.\r\n A war has not yet broken out in the Korean Peninsula despite the U.S. reckless military adventurous moves. This is because of the army and the people of the DPRK full of conviction of victory and strong fighting spirit to resolutely beat back the imperialists' aggression and eradicate the cause of war and the powerful military might of the DPRK built up under the banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are unfazed as they have the powerful military muscle to defend the cause of socialism and their destiny under the leadership of the illustrious commander born of Heaven. The might of the DPRK will be steadily strengthened and the anti-imperialist military front more firmly cemented as long as it is pursuing the Songun policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any attempt to disarm the Korean people ideologically and bring down the system of the DPRK with \"human rights\" offensive and the strategy of undermining from within is as like as a daydream. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Korean-style socialism centred on the popular masses is genuine popular socialism chosen by the Korean people themselves and absolutely trusted and supported by them and herein lie the solidity and invincibility of Korean-style socialism. Steadfast and immutable are the Korean people's faith in socialism and will to defend the country.\r\n The single-minded unity of the leader, the party and the masses is the special feature which can be found only in Korean socialism. The unity is a patent weapon of the DPRK and it is more powerful than nuke. Anachronistic is the attempt of the U.S. to realize its ambition for bringing down the system of the DPRK by undermining and degenerating Korean socialism in which the leader, the party and the masses are united firmly.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
