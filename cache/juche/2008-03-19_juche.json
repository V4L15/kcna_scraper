            "content": "KCNA Blasts Fukuda Regime's Suppression of Chongryon \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 18 (KCNA) -- Japan has intensified the suppression of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon), a dignified organization of overseas citizens of the DPRK, and Koreans in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chongryon has played the role of an overseas mission of the DPRK in the absence of the diplomatic relations between the DPRK and Japan. This status is recognized not only by the international community but by Japanese. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities, however, have held trials to seize the Central Hall of Chongryon and its premises which have been used as a center for Chongryon's activities. They also confirmed the policy for extending again the unilateral sanctions against the DPRK which call for putting an embargo on the ship \"Mangyongbong-92\", etc. under the pretext that there is no progress in the settlement of the \"abduction issue\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A whirlwind of anti-Chongryon campaign is sweeping different parts of Japan including Kyoto and Osaka at the prodding of the Fukuda Cabinet. Actions are taken to search for Korean halls and schools and other Chongryon-related facilities, force sale upon them and write off them from the list of tax exemption and arrest Chongryon officials. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This reveals Japan's very hostile policy toward the DPRK and indicates that the present Japanese authorities are worse than the Abe regime in the wanton violation of the rights of Koreans in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As well known to the world, the Abe group was ousted from power as it staked its political fate on its hard-line policy towards the DPRK, clean indifferent to the interests of the Japanese people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Far from drawing a serious lesson from it, the Fukuda Cabinet extended the sanctions against the DPRK, etc. as soon as it came to power, stoking bitterness towards Koreans in the archipelago of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is a saying \"One devil knows another\". \"Pressure and dialogue\" are just the same as \"dialogue and pressure\" and the Fukuda regime's anti-DPRK and anti-Chongryon campaign has become craftier than what was conducted during the Abe regime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Fukuda Cabinet worked hard to create impression in the international community that it is somewhat different from the preceding cabinet. But its true colors have already been brought to light. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It pricked its own eyes with its own hands. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is the only land of brazen-faced gangsters with the worst human rights record in the world because it has suppressed foreign residents en masse, regarding them as a lever for carrying out its policy of pressure upon their homeland, and has gone the lengths of trying to destroy their organization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The relations between countries are one thing and the guarantee of legitimate status and national rights to foreign residents is another matter. The Japanese authorities can neither sacrifice the Koreans in Japan and Chongryon nor use them as hostages for achieving their political aims under any circumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' short-sighted and desperate anti-DPRK and anti-Chongryon moves are, in fact, doing harm to the interests of Japan.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This clearly indicates how desperately they are staging the anti-DPRK, anti-Chongryon campaign, says Minju Joson Tuesday in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The moves to destroy Chongryon that started when Abe was in power have become all the pronounced under the Fukuda regime, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Fukuda regime is pursuing with increased zeal the anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK shaped by its predecessor who went to ruin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fact that it is following in the footsteps of its predecessor indicates that Japan's \"sanctions\" against the DPRK are proving absolutely futile. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Much upset by this, the Fukuda regime seeks to attain its sinister political purpose by suppressing the activities of Chongryon through the escalated anti-Chongryon campaign, inflicting greater pain upon the Koreans in Japan and thus putting pressure on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities, however, are gravely mistaken if they calculate they can gain something by regarding Koreans in Japan as hostages and employing a sleight of hand. This will only bring into bolder relief their despicable true colors as those responsible for deliberately aggravating the DPRK-Japan relations and entail such consequences as precipitating their domestic and international isolation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people in the DPRK will never remain an onlooker to the Japanese reactionaries' anti-DPRK and anti-Chongryon campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Fukuda regime had better stop at once all its moves against the DPRK and Chongryon if it does not want to suffer what its predecessor did, warns the commentary.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is shameless distortion of history aimed to seize territory of other country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By deleting from history textbooks the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists in the past or playing them down the Japanese reactionaries seek to implant a wrong view on history into the younger generations, arm them with revanchism and ultra-nationalism and thus hurl them into overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such moves to distort history and agitate for overseas aggression are led by such ultra-right elements as Tokyo Metropolitan Governor Ishihara. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's militarization is becoming reality due to the Japanese reactionaries' despicable moves to distort history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world peace-loving people including those in Asia should clearly see through the reactionary and dangerous nature of Japan's distortion of history and resolutely frustrate it.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Esta realidad es reconocida por la sociedad internacional y por el mismo pueblo japones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Sin embargo, las autoridades japonesas realizan en estos dias un turbio proceso judicial para arrebatar el predio y el edificio de la Casa Central de la Chongryon, centro de actividades de esta entidad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAl mismo tiempo, pretextando el estancamiento del \"problema de secuestro\", ellas tomaron la decision de volver a dar prorroga a las medidas de sancion contra la RPDC, inclusive la prohibicion de la entrada del barco \"Mangyongbong- no. 92\" en los puertos japoneses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBajo la instigacion del gabinete de Fukuda, en Kyoto, Osaka y otras localidades de Japon se levanta ahora un oleaje de violencia como el registro forzado y la venta de casas culturales, escuelas y otras facilidades de la Chongryon, la exclusion de estas de la lista de los establecimientos eximidos de impuestos y el arresto a los funcionarios de la misma entidad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEsta expresion de la brutal politica hostil a la RPDC corrobora que los casos de violacion de DDHH de los coreanos radicados en Japon por parte de las actuales autoridades japonesas superan los registrados en el regimen del anterior gabinete liderado por Abe por su gravedad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nComo es conocido por todo el mundo, la banda de Abe fue destronada mientras se jugaba su vida politica por las medidas intransigentes sobre Corea sin tomar en consideracion los intereses de los habitantes japoneses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEl gabinete de Fukuda, en vez de sacar debida leccion de ello, tan pronto como tomo el poder, hace reinar mas temerosamente el sentimiento de chovinismo contra los coreanos en el archipielago japones, mientras prolongo la sancion contra la RPDC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Como reza el refran \"cada oveja con su pareja\", son iguales la \"presion y el dialogo\" y viceversa. Las maniobras del gobierno de Fukuda contra la RPDC y la Chongryon se perpetran de modo mas astuto y siniestro que en el periodo del gabinete de Abe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El gabinete de Fukuda trato de dar a la sociedad internacional alguna impresion diferente al gobierno antecedente, pero ya es tarde. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ellos denigraron su imagen por si mismo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Japon es el unico pais de descarados gangsteres y el lugar privado de derechos humanos donde se consideran los extranjeros residentes en su pais como medio de realizacion de la politica de presion contra la patria de estos, los acosan  colectivamente e  incluso se eliminan sus organizaciones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El problema entre estados es diferente  del asunto de aseguramiento de posicion legal y de derechos nacionales de los extranjeros, y los coreanos residentes en Japon y la Chongryon no pueden ser en todo el caso el objeto de sacrificio politico y el rehen de las autoridades japonesas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Lo que se sacrifica realmente por las maniobras miopes y brutales de los reaccionarios japoneses contra la RPDC y la Chongryon es solo el interes estatal de Japon.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
