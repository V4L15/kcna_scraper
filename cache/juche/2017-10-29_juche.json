However the people's desire for righteous new politics, society and life remains a dim dream.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was natural for the \"government of candlelight\" to work for stop to the anti-north war exercises bringing the dark clouds of nuclear war to the Korean peninsula. But the present authorities are hell-bent on the joint military drills almost everyday, begging the U.S. to offer \"extended nuclear deterrence\" and introducing more nuclear assets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Precious fruitions of the candlelight resistance have been mercilessly violated to cause serious damage to the social development and the remnants of the Park Geun Hye group and other conservative forces have revived to reverse the history. The present situation awakens all the people and calls for restart of the candlelight action.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The candlelight resistance has not yet ended but should be continued. This is the exclamation of all the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present authorities can never be allowed to get hell-bent on sycophancy toward the U.S. and confrontation with the compatriots and drive the south-north relations to the extreme phase, following in the footsteps of the conservative regime although they took power thanks to the candlelight action.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The righteous new politics, society and life indicated by the candlelight are related to national reunification and the mindset of the candlelight demonstrators can never be mentioned without national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A single candlelight is small but the candlelight action of ten million people is tremendously strong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The victory of the candlelight resistance is for our popular masses to continue the struggle for independence, democracy and reunification in the same fighting spirit as displayed to oust traitor Park Geun Hye.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The appeal called upon all the people to hold candlelight of action higher so as to bring about righteous new politics, society and life without fail."

            "content": "FDNA llama a la lucha por la nueva politica, nueva sociedad y nueva vida\r\nPyongyang, 29 de octubre (ACNC) -- Segun el sitio Web Frente de Salvacion Nacional, el Comite Central del Frente Democratico Nacional Antiimperialista publico el dia 28 un llamamiento a toda la poblacion con motivo del primer aniversario de la sublevacion popular que dio sentencia a la banda traidora de Park Geun-hye. \n\t\t\t\t\tLos habitantes de diferentes estratos del Sur de Corea se levantaron en la lucha con velas encendidas expresando gran indignacion por el inaudito escandalo de manipulacion chapucera de los \"asuntos estatales\" por la traidora Park Geun-hye, recuerda la nota y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark Geun-hye y sus complices se enfrascaron en la \"purga de comunistas\" y libraron hasta el mitin de respuesta con velas para salir de la crisis irreparable, pero la lucha de la poblacion con velas encendidas logro encarcelar a la traidora Park y sentenciar el arruinamiento a la banda conservadora. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGracias a la lucha con velas, fue sustituido el \"poder\" y pasaron ciento y decenas de dias despues de la aparicion del \"poder\" de reforma democratica. Pero, se queda todavia como sueno la aspiracion de la poblacion surcoreana a la nueva politica, nueva sociedad y nueva vida. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi el nuevo \"poder\" surcoreano representara el criterio de la poblacion levantada en la lucha con velas, deberia exigir debidamente el cese de los ejercicios de guerra de agresion anti-Norte que acarrean el nubarron de guerra nuclear a la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, las actuales autoridades surcoreanas mendigan a EE.UU. el ofrecimiento del \"disuasivo ampliado\" y libran diariamente los ejercicios belicos conjuntos introduciendo las propiedades estrategicas nucleares norteamericanas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor culpa de ellas, se ven violados los frutos valiosos de la sublevacion popular con velas y se obstaculiza gravemente el desarrollo social, asi como se revitalizan los remanentes de la banda de Park Geun-hye y otras fuerzas conservadoras para dar marcha atras a la rueda de la historia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta situacion llama de nuevo a la poblacion a la lucha con velas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodavia, no ha terminado, sino debe ser continuada la sublevacion popular con velas, esto es la unanime demanda de la poblacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo se debe tolerar a las autoridades surcoreanas que se entregan al servilismo pronorteamericano y el enfrentamiento fratricida y llevan a la crisis extremada las relaciones intercoreanas repitiendo el expediente criminal del \"poder\" conservador, pese a que tomaron el poder gracias a la lucha con velas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl margen de la reunificacion de la patria no se puede pensar en la nueva politica, nueva sociedad y nueva vida, deseadas por la poblacion levantada en la lucha con velas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs pequena una vela encendida, pero son grandes y potentes miles y miles de velas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa victoria de la sublevacion con velas es de la poblacion surcoreana que sigue marchando hacia la independencia, la democracia y la reunificacion con el temperamento de haber sepultado a la traidora Park Geun-hye.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los habitantes surcoreanos deben levantarse como un solo hombre en la lucha con velas para lograr sin falta la nueva politica, nueva sociedad y nueva vida."
