            "content": "CPRF on \"pardon and reinstatement\" in S. Korea\r\n Pyongyang, December 27 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland issued a statement on Friday, denouncing the South Korean rulers for granting \"pardon and reinstatement\" recently to the Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae Woo and all others involved in the \"December 12 army purge coup\" and the May 18 Kwangju massacre.\r\n   The statement brands the \"pardon and reinstatement\" as another anti-national, anti-democratic crime that flouts and insults the pro-democracy forces of South Korea, especially the fallen resistance fighters of Kwangju, their bereaved families and public opinion at home and abroad.\r\n   The statement says:\r\n   This heinous crime can be committed only by  Kim Young Sam. He engaged in fascism and corruption in South Korea in league with Chun and Roh, who left indelible wrath in the hearts of South Korean people.\r\n   Kim Young Sam can never be justified in releasing the murderers while keeping behind bars and persecuting the members of the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils and the south headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification who conducted righteous activities for independence and democracy in South Korean society and national reunification.\r\n   Through the \"pardon\" Kim Young Sam intends to win favor of conservatives and find a way out thereby. This is a foolish attempt, however.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
