The fatherland will never forget the mass heroism and noble self-sacrificing spirit displayed by soldier-builders and the feats performed by them for the country and the people, he declared.\r\n   Now seen at workplaces of Korea are slogans and posters reflecting the firm determination to live and work in this revolutionary spirit of soldiers.\r\n   Displaying the spirit, Korean people and servicemen made great achievements in socialist construction last year. \r\n Among the achievements is the completion of such projects as 100 km-long Wonsan-Kumgang youth railways, pleasure grounds of Mts.
