This unbearable national insult and humiliation compel the South Korean people to hold higher the banner of the struggle for independence against the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. aggressor troops are harassers of peace and stability who pose constant threat to the South Korean people's lives and properties after setting up military bases and firing ranges not only in Maehyang-ri but in all other parts of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is a lesson taught by history that the South Korean people cannot escape disaster and misfortune nor can peace, stability and reunification be realized on the Korean peninsula as long as the U.S. troops are allowed to stay there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the U.S. truly wishes peace and stability on the peninsula, it should dismantle its military bases and withdraw its forces from South Korea as demanded by the Korean nation and the world peace-loving peoples. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the South Korean authorities have even an iota of national conscience, they should stop paying lip-service to \"an end to the cold war on the Korean peninsula\" but put the withdrawal of the U.S. troops, a prerequisite for the solution of the Korean issue, on top of their agenda. \r\n\r\n"

This report was followed by the disclosure of some 40 cases of GIs' mass killings of civilians which had been concealed in South Korea. More facts about their atrocities are being brought to light as the days go by. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Despite these hard facts, some U.S. reptile papers and magazines are resorting to despicable moves to falsify the truth of GIs' massacres in Rogun-ri. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is an unbearable mockery and challenge not only to the Korean nation but to world conscience and an outrageous act of tampering with the history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   These moves do not reflect any private instruction or opinion but the attitude of the government of the United States toward the Rogun-ri massacres. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the real intention of the United States to evade its responsibility for the mass killings of Korean by hushing up the cases. In other words, it is not willing to make apology and compensation to the Korean people for its war crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States is seriously mistaken. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean nation will certainly force the U.S. to pay for the blood shed by compatriots a thousand times. \r\n\r\n"
