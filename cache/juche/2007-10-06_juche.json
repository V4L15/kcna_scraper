He, in the speech, put forward the direction and way for building true people's armed forces which would carry forward the revolutionary traditions of the anti-Japanese guerrilla army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The famous work served as guidelines in strengthening and developing the army into the people's army, a modern regular army which would defend the country and the gains of the revolution from the encroachment of the imperialists and all the class foes and firmly guarantee the building of an independent and sovereign state and the cause of the socialist construction by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean People's Army (KPA) which was strengthened and developed to be invincible revolutionary armed forces under his wise leadership has carried on with credit its mission and duty assigned by the Party, the leader, the country and the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the Fatherland Liberation War, the officers and men of the People's Army covered the enemy's pillboxes with their bodies to ensure the advance of the units and became human-bombs to wipe out the enemy soldiers by displaying unrivalled heroism and noble patriotism, thus protecting with honor the freedom and independence of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the postwar period, too, they reliably safeguarded the security of the country and people and the gains of the revolution, smashing the ceaseless war moves of the imperialists at every step. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The servicepersons of the KPA took upon themselves the national defence and socialist construction in the middle of the 1990s when the country and the people should undergo grave ordeals. They erected tremendous edifices for the happiness of the people in different parts of the country while increasing the combat capability of the army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the KPA is fully discharging its lofty mission and duty as the defender and creator of the people's happiness, the vanguard of the times in the ideological, moral and cultural life, and the main force to accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche. It is also demonstrating its might as the matchless elite armed forces which are capable of wiping out any aggressors at a stroke.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He made a great contribution to the medical development of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With a view of life that a teacher should find himself worth of living in rearing rising generations, he dedicated his doctorial thesis to training several Doctors and 36 Masters and continued writing teaching materials till the last moment of his life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The teachers of Sudu Middle School in Sinphyong County have made thousands of pieces of teaching materials, many stuffed specimens of animals and herbals and built a well-furnished swimming pool and laboratory by themselves under difficult conditions. And the teachers of Pyongyang Kwangbok Primary School are exerting all their mind and energy to raising the abilities of pupils. Such true educationists can be found in all parts of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was proved by the fact that last year, alone, thousands of educational workers and teachers joined the ranks of the \"October 8 Model Teacher\" all over the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The educators are striving hard to give ample knowledge to the students and, at the same time, to noble patriotism in their minds. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Teachers of Tongrim Middle School in Onchon County are visiting revolutionary sites together with students in order to bring literature circle members up as true human-beings who know the fatherland ahead of literature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The teachers of Samchon Primary School in Samchon County are imbuing patriotism in the minds of pupils through the rabbit-raising campaign to give a help to the country even a little. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to the efforts of the educators, many heroes have been produced. Among them are Song Pong Un, ex-officer of the Korean People's Army who saved 15 servicepersons in a crucial moment at the cost of his life and Ri Yong Thaek, creator of the Mansudae Art Studio, and Hong Won Phyo, director of the Forest Management Office in Pyoksong County, who have made a positive contribution to the socialist construction. And the number of schools named after heroes is growing day by day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the occasion of the World Teacher's Day (October 5), model teachers are being widely introduced and the traits of respecting and preferentially treating the teachers are further pervading the whole society in the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But this is nothing but a cynical ploy to cover up the true nature of the unpopular and corrupt capitalist society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n So says Rodong Sinmun Friday in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With nothing can the corrupt nature inherent to the capitalist society be covered up or denied, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The capitalist society seems prosperous outwardly, but it becomes degenerated and its people are mentally and physically handicapped. This is a true picture of the capitalist society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The capitalist society causes deformed material life, making people corrupt and depraved. This is one of the basic features proving the corruption deep-seated in the capitalist society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Poor mental and cultural life is another specific feature proving the deep-seated corruption of the capitalist society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the capitalist society the capitalists try to benumb the independent ideological consciousness of the people and reduce them to slaves of money and working tools obeying the given destiny. The capitalists spend a great amount of money in spreading reactionary ideology and corrupt bourgeois lifestyle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The corrupt bourgeois lifestyle prevails in capitalist society today, paralyzing sound mentality of people and leaving them in ignorance and benightedness. A huge number of people captive to the bourgeois way of life have been reduced to mental and physical cripples and slaves of money. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In capitalist society, a lifestyle based on the jungle law is fostered to become a social fashion and all sorts of social vices such as immorality and corruption, fraud and swindling, and violent crimes are rampant, making people shiver in uneasiness and fear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The capitalist society is neither a civilized nor an eternal society as claimed by those who speak for the bourgeoisie.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
