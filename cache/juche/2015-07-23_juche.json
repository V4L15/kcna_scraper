            "content": "Kim Jong Un Gives Field Guidance to Newly Built Sinchon Museum\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, July 23 (KCNA) -- Supreme leader Kim Jong Un gave field guidance to the newly built Sinchon Museum.\n\t\t\t\t\t While providing on-the-spot guidance to the museum in November last year, he advanced the task to newly build it as required by the new century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He chose the site of the museum and energetically guided its construction on a series of occasions, ranging from its design and layout to the creation of fine art pieces, display of relics inside it, slogans and guide notes. He also entrusted its construction to the Korean People's Army standing at the outpost of the class struggle and settled all the problems arising in the project.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Enjoying a bird's-eye view of the museum impeccable in its architectural beauty, he said that the appearance of the new Sinchon Museum in the run-up to the victory day when the Korean people defeated the U.S. imperialists is a striking demonstration of the spirit of the service personnel and people of the DPRK and their indomitable will to glorify forever the history and tradition of victory, holding aloft the banner of anti-imperialist, anti-U.S. struggle under the guidance of the party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round a room for the education in the revolutionary history, room dedicated to the history of the museum, the general introductory room, exhibition rooms, video room, general lecture room, bomb shelter of the former Sinchon County Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, powder magazine, the ground for having a meeting to pledge revenge and other places of the museum.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed great satisfaction over the successful completion of the museum as a center for anti-imperialist and anti-U.S. education and class education.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He noted that the museum exhibited in various forms and methods the relics and data on the brutal atrocities committed by the U.S. imperialists and class enemies in Sinchon to ensure a high level of visualization and vivid expression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said the museum served as a center for class education and source of the will to take revenge upon the enemy and a historic place bearing witness to the U.S. imperialists' monstrous atrocities. He gave an instruction to intensify the education through the museum.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how crafty the U.S. imperialists become in their moves to cover up their crimes, they can never erase the traces of massacre of Koreans left in this land, he said, adding that we should force them to pay for the blood shed by Koreans and settle accounts with them with arms without fail.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To intensify the anti-imperialist and anti-U.S. education and class education is an issue of weighty importance as it is decisive of the prospect of the revolution and the destiny of the country, he noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is our duty to lay bare the cruel and cunning nature of the U.S. imperialists and settle accounts with them, he said, adding that it is reality in the world the people are taken in by the U.S. imperialists' hypocritical propaganda to paint a wrong picture of the U.S. as a guardian of peace and human rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said in order to firmly defend the position of the revolution, the working class position and win the final victory in the Juche revolution it is necessary to intensify the class education among all the party members, servicepersons and people and push ahead with this work consistently and in a sustainable manner under the banner of preparing them to be vanguard fighters of the working class defending the forefront of the anti-imperialist and anti-U.S. struggle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He highly praised the soldier-builders for successfully building the museum like a university for class education.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had a photo taken with the officials and employees of the museum.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Hwang Pyong So, Kim Ki Nam, Ri Jae Il, Kim Yo Jong and Ryom Chol Song."

For instance, when the D-dos attack on the homepage of the central election committee in south Korea, the March 20 hacking case, etc. took place, they painted each case as \"the north's deeds.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet IS confessed this time that since it purchased the above-said hacking program for its \"cyber terrorism against the north\", it has eavesdropped 87 overseas computers and hand phones and most of their IP addresses are connected to the DPRK. This clearly proves that the puppet group is getting desperate in its hacking operations against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Hye was behind the IS's illegal hacking operations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With no sleight of hand can those behind the illegal operations cover up the true colors of the Park-led IS as a sinister plot-breeding base.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The IS should be dismantled at once, and chief culprits should be sternly punished by history and the nation."

Korean Authorities' Fascist Suppression under Fire \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, July 23 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Measure Council for Human Rights in South Korea Thursday made public a statement lashing out at the Park Geun Hye group for intensifying the fascist suppression of the progressive and democratic forces for reunification since ultra-right conservative Hwang Kyo An of wicked public prosecutor origin took office as puppet prime minister in June. \n\t\t\t\t\t No sooner had Hwang been appointed as puppet prime minister than a warrant of arrest was issued for the chairman of the south Korean Confederation of Trade Unions who demanded elementary right to existence, opposing the wrong labor policy of the authorities, the statement said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The police stormed and searched the April 16 Solidarity, a civic organization which led the struggle for probing the truth behind the ferry Sewol disaster and 33 people related to the Teachers Union were massively indicted by  the prosecution for the mere reason that they called for education in reunification, supporting the north-south joint declarations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prosecution authorities had searched the houses of leading members of the former Unified Progressive Party for three days from July 15 and confiscated personal documents and computers. The co-chairman of the All-People Measure Council for Ferry Sewol Disaster was thrown into prison after a memorial service for the victims of the ferry Sewol was labeled \"illegal.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities branded the Korea Solidarity for Independent Reunification and Democracy as an \"enemy-benefiting organization\" for the mere reason that its assertion was \"identical to the north's one\" and arrested those related to the organization and kicked up a row of putting them on a want list. Moreover, they hurled human scum \"defectors from the north\" into an anti-DPRK reckless leaflet-scattering operation.  The puppet Intelligence Service is busy every day kicking up a confrontation racket against the DPRK, cooking up sheer lies about it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Justice, progress, freedom and democracy are now wantonly violated in south Korea and fascist dictatorship abusing elementary human rights reigns in south Korea due to Hwang Kyo An who plays the role of a shock brigade for enforcing Park Geun Hye's dictatorial politics, the politics of terror. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the height of absurdity and shamelessness for the unprecedented human rights abusers and fascist rulers to trumpet about \"human rights\" issue in the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Hye is enforcing a hideous tyrannical rule with Hwang Kyo An playing a major role in order to carry out her sinister scenario to completely stamp out the democratic forces for reunification and thus ensure the stability of her rule, lay a groundwork for the stay of the conservative forces in power and justify the confrontation with the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, they should clearly know that their fascist repressive rule would only precipitate the people's severe punishment and miserable destruction."

El hecho muestra cuan freneticamente se dedicaba la banda titere a la campana de hacking contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark Geun-hye es la autora del incidente de hacking ilegal del SNI del Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAunque los delincuentes se desesperen, no pueden ocultar ni esconder la fachada intrigante y la verdad del SIN encabezado por Park.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsa maldita entidad, aparato de la dictadura fascista y nido de la confrontacion fratricida, terrorismo y complot, debe ser disuelta de inmediato y los delincuentes autores deben ser castigados duros por la historia y la nacion."

Tambien, fueron acusadas a la fiscalia las 33 personas relacionadas con el Sindicato Nacional de Ensenantes quienes se dedicaban a la educacion de reunificacion apoyando las declaraciones conjuntas Norte-Sur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY durante 3 dias desde el 15 de este mes los titeres surcoreanos  registraron a fuerza las viviendas de los ex relacionados medulares del Partido Progresista Unido y confiscaron los datos personales y ordenadores y   encarcelaron al copresidente del Consejo Pannacional de Medidas del Desastre del Ferry \"Sewol\" calificando el mitin de recordacion del \"Sewol\" como \"acto ilegal\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, diciendo que la Solidaridad de Corea por la reunificacion independiente y la democracia \"hizo la misma insistencia que el Norte\" la tildaron de \"entidad pro-enemiga\" y arrestaron a los interesados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY lanzaron a los fugitivos norcoreanos a lanzar los volantes de contenido anti-RPDC e hicieron que el Servicio Nacional de Inteligencia desplegara las maniobras de invencion de la erronea opinion publica sobre la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido a Hwang, agente de la politica dictatorial y la de terror horroroso de Park Guen-hye, en el Sur de Corea reina la dictadura fascista que viola despiadadamente la justicia, el progreso, la libertad y la democracia y extermina hasta los derechos humanos elementales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTales criminales de violacion de DDHH y gobernadores fascistas cuestionan los \"DDHH\" de alguien, lo cual es absurdidad y el climax de cinismo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark recurre a la brutal gobernacion represiva poniendo al frente a Hwang, maldito fascista con el objetivo de asegurar la estabilidad de poder eliminando totalmente las fuerzas democraticas por la reunificacion, consolidar la base para la retoma de las fuerzas conservadoras en el poder y justificar la confrontacion anti-RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, deben tener presente que con la gobernacion de represion fascista obtendra solo la sentencia severa de la opinion publica y la ruina tragica."
