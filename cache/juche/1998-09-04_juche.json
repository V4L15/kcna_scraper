Its period is 165 minutes 6 seconds.\r\n   The satellite is equipped with necessary sounding instruments. It will contribute to promoting scientific research for peaceful use of outer space.\r\n   It is also instrumental in confirming the calculation basis for the launch of practical satellites in the future.\r\n   The satellite is now transmitting the melody of the immortal revolutionary hymns \"Song of General Kim Il Sung\" and \"Song of General Kim Jong Il\" and the Morse signals \"Juche Korea\" in 27 MHz.\r\n   The rocket and satellite which our scientists and technicians correctly put into orbit at one launch are a fruition of our wisdom and technology 100 percent.\r\n   The successful launch of the first artificial satellite in the DPRK greatly encourages the Korean people in the efforts to build a powerful socialist state under the wise leadership of General Secretary Kim Jong Il. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Foreign Ministry spokesman on successful launch of artificial satellite\r\nPyongyang, September 4 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement today over the successful launch of an artificial satellite carried out by a competent department of the DPRK recently.\r\n   The spokesman says:\r\n   The satellite launch is one more fruit of the independent national economy, a product of 100 percent local technology and local effort. This gives pride and delight to the Korean nation and their friends.\r\n   Some people around the DPRK, however, are making a fuss, ignorant of this valuable success of science and technology which will add to the common treasurehouse of humanity. They suspected it to be a ballistic missile launching test, expressed some \"apprehensions\" and described it as \"serious event.\" their rash behavior reminds one of the saying \"once bitten, twice shy.\"\r\n   Some people in the United States talk as if the ballistic missile launched by the DPRK had made it difficult for them to fulfil their obligation under the DPRK-U.S. framework agreement. They try to link this matter with food assistance which they have described as a purely humanitarian issue.\r\n   What is more intolerable is Japan's behavior.\r\n   Although they have no information on what happened, the Japanese authorities, blindly accepting rumours about the ballistic missile  launching test in the DPRK, are threatening that they will bring this issue to the United Nations Security Council and that they will take \"countermeasures.\"\r\n   Before announcing that they would \"put off\" negotiations for normalisation of diplomatic relations, Japan must not forget that it is our right, not any bargaining thing, to demand apologies and compensation for its past crimes and that we are  willing to exercise our right.\r\n   It is an internationally recognized right of a sovereign state to peacefully  use the space. It is also a strong trend of modern science and technology to develop, launch  and use an artificial satellite in line with this.\r\n  We have never criticized the United States and Japan for having launched artificial satellites. We are well aware that these satellites have been used for espionage on our country.\r\n  For our country to have an artificial satellite, therefore, is  an only too natural exercise of sovereignty= whether this capacity will be used for a military purpose or not, entirely depends on the attitude of forces hostile towards us.\r\n   The United States must ponder over its military pressure upon and preemptive attack on the DPRK.\r\n   Japan must be aware that an attempt to enact a law for involvement in belligerent to relations between the DPRK and the U.S. is tantamount to a declaration of war against the DPRK.\r\n   The artificial satellite recently launched just before the historic first session of the 10th Supreme People's Assembly of the DPRK manifests the iron will and indomitable spirit of our party, army and people who are working hard for the greater prosperity of the country, pulling through difficulties.\r\n   Those two countries must be aware of this.\r\n   Particularly, the forces hostile towards the DPRK must be mindful that their attempt to lead the DPRK to a change will bring them nothing but destruction. \r\n\r\n"
