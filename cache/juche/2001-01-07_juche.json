So, differences in ideology, system, political view, religious belief, classes and social strata do not pose any problem. All the Koreans should do their bit as the driving force of national reunification. To this end they should not read other's face nor align themselves with outsiders but achieve great national unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To reunify the country is to put an end to national division caused by outsiders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; National reconciliation and great unity is a top priority for national reunification in view of the intrinsic nature of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National reunification is the cause of national independence designed to establish national sovereignty throughout the country free from the intervention by outsiders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National reunification, national independence, can be achieved only by the concerted efforts of the entire nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north and south should get united so as to settle all the issues arising in reunifying the country with credit. The unity of all the Koreans makes it possible to remove misunderstanding and distrust and to promote reconciliation and confidence. this will enable the people in the north and south to rejoin blood ties in political, economic, cultural and all other aspects. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north, south and abroad should turn out as one to implement the June 15 north-south joint declaration irrespective of ideology, system, political view and religious belief.    \r\n \r\n"

Herein lies the nature of the historic changes in the 20th century and this is a main review of the century.    \r\n\r\n"
