This is the height of hypocrisy and impudence. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What the survivors of the A-bomb disasters in Japan want to hear from Obama is nothing but the answer to the question as to whether he can completely eliminate the nuclear weapons in the world or not\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's ulterior design should never be overlooked.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through Obama's visit to Hiroshima Japan seeks to put under carpet its true colors as a provocateur of the war and aggressor and go with impunity despite its past crimes by stirring up the \"feelings of war victims\" among its people and giving the international community a strong impression that it is a \"war victim.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such clumsy political calculation of the U.S. and Japan will only result in heightened vigilance of the international community."

This is a very just position as it is nothing surprising.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a very simple logic that if a country has access to nukes and is not ready to use them, it is bound to go to ruin.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is the country from which we can learn a lot, indeed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Swiss internet magazine Le Grand said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is a clear intention and reason for north Korea to push ahead with the development of nuclear weapons and experts clearly recognize the fact that the DPRK poses no \"threat.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t North Korea laid down the line of simultaneously developing the two fronts to cope with the U.S. north Korea policy and is preventing any aggression and attack with its creditable nuclear deterrence and diverting the expenses and resources for the service personnel on the frontline units and huge artillery force to economic construction by drastically cutting down their number. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hawks of the West, the ultra-right forces of Japan, in particular, are dreaming of their access to nukes under the pretext of \"nuclear threat\" from north Korea, and the U.S. is seeking to establish a new MD system in south Korea capable of neutralizing China, not aimed at containing north Korea under that pretext.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some countries may underestimate north Korea's recent declaration not to mount a preemptive nuclear attack but there is need for them to take note of the fact that the history of nuclear deterrence started with such declaration and this promise has been kept.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As commented by world public, the DPRK's access to nuclear weapons is the most just choice in the present world where a weak country can never protect itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will never dismantle its nuclear weapons first unless the U.S. rolls back its hostile policy toward the former and defuses its nuclear threat fundamentally.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It will bolster its nuclear deterrence both in quality and quantity to firmly protect its sovereignty as long as the U.S. persists in nuclear threat and hostile policy."

            "content": "Only Way out for U.S. Is to Roll back Its Hostile Policy towards DPRK: Rodong Sinmun\r\nPyongyang, May 26 (KCNA) -- The Wall Street Journal said that Marshal Kim Jong Un's declaration of the dynamic struggle to put an end to the U.S. threat of a nuclear war with powerful nuclear deterrent at the Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) suggested the DPRK's capabilities to mount a nuclear strike at the U.S. mainland.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe National Interest, the U.S. magazine dealing with the international relations, asserted that the UN and the U.S. ratcheted up the sanctions but they are far less likely to change the DPRK. As the DPRK has codified the access to nukes and put it forward as an idea of the WPK, the only way out for the U.S. is to start the negotiations with the DPRK, it noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Prestigious experts on political situation and mass media of the world commented that the DPRK, which has miniaturized nuclear warheads to be mounted on ballistic missiles, may produce 20-100 nuclear weapons by 2020. If the U.S. sticks to the high-profile pressure on the DPRK for its change as now, the DPRK's nuclear negotiating position will grow stronger when the next U.S. president comes to power and this will pose an increasing threat to the U.S. hour by hour and present itself as an issue pending an urgent solution, it added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRodong Sinmun Thursday says in a commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThese voices of the world reflect the strategic position of the DPRK which has joined the advanced ranks of nuclear powers and the ever-changing trend of the times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe commentary goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFor the U.S. to roll back its hostile policy towards the DPRK meets the requirements of the ever-changing international relations and is very helpful to the world peace and security.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK doesn't beg the U.S. to roll back its hostile policy towards the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt doesn't care about whether the U.S. withdraws its hostile policy or not.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. authorities would be well advised to bear in mind the only way out for them is to roll back its anachronistic hostile policy against the backdrop of acute DPRK-U.S stand-off."

Korean Military Warmongers for Escalating Tension\r\n Pyongyang, May 26 (KCNA) -- Shortly ago, the south Korean military warmongers staged the firing drill in waters around five islands in the West Sea under the pretext of coping with someone's \"provocation\" and the combined marine drills with the U.S. Navy in the West and South seas of Korea by mobilizing the warships, while crying out for coping with someone's SLBM.\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson Thursday says in a commentary that their moves are the dangerous military provocation aimed at chilling the climate for national reconciliation and enthusiasm of the Korean nation for national reunification which are mounting with the fresh line and policies for national reunification set forth by the DPRK as a momentum.

Their acts only result in escalating the situation on the Korean peninsula and in Northeast Asia and increasing the danger of a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean authorities are truly willing to improve the north-south relations, they should come out for dialogue and negotiations with a sincere and honest stand, not seeking sinister purposes any longer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should also stop all their hostile acts against the DPRK such as the reckless political and military provocation and war exercises being staged, pursuant to the U.S. policy, only to do harm to the compatriots in the north and harass peace and security on the Korean peninsula."
