Its appearance only helps one clearly notice the spirit of the officials and employees to devotedly implement without an inch of deflection the instruction given by leader Kim Jong Il to modernize it during his visit to the factory in the last period of his life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round the monument to the field guidance given by the peerlessly great men of Mt. Paektu and the room devoted to the education in the revolutionary history and the room dedicated to the history which were newly arranged at the factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching the valuable historic data including photos of President Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il providing field guidance to the factory, he said that the factory developed into a treasure of the country which made positive contributions to improving the people's standard of living under the particular loving care of the great leaders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He acquainted himself in detail with the production, management and operation of the factory while looking round its different places.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The officials and employees have made a lot of successes through a vigorous struggle to firmly consolidate the material and technical foundations of the factory which were provided by the President and Kim Jong Il, he said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are taking good care of modern production equipment associated with the warm loving care of Kim Jong Il like the apple of the eye and successfully doing the work for updating outdated equipment and making a good use of them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He praised the officials and employees of the factory for devoting their creative wisdom to the drive to produce synthetic leather whose quality is as good as natural leather in physical nature and use such as tensile and bending strength and working hard to make a variety of bags in high demand among people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the factory has an important duty and role to perform, he set forth the tasks which would serve as guidelines for managing and operating the factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said the factory should put production on normal footing and sufficiently provide raw and other materials for the steady increase of the production as the factory has turned into a huge one capable of fully satisfying the nation's needs for synthetic leather and he took a benevolent measure to this end.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had a photo session with the officials and employees of the factory after expressing expectation and belief that they would boost the production of quality synthetic leather and thus glorify forever the legendary love for the people shown by Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il at the factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Pak Pong Ju, premier of the Cabinet, An Jong Su, department director of the Central Committee of the WPK, and Pak Myong Sun, vice department director of the C.C., the WPK."

Anadio que MINREX de la RPDC declaro el 7 de julio que si EE.UU. niega la demanda de la RPDC de retirar la presente sancion se interrumpiran de inmediato todos los espacios y vias de contacto diplomatico entre la RPDC y EE.UU. y se tomaran las medidas intransigentes para frustrar tajantemente los actos hostiles de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl mencionar que en contubernio con EE.UU., los titeres surcoreanos siguen agravando la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana decidiendo emplazar en el Sur de Corea el THAAD a pesar de la fuerte protesta de la RPDC y los paises circunvecinos, enfatizo que todos los paises asiaticos deben tratar con alta vigilancia y saber claramente el autor y el delincuente que danan la paz y la seguridad de la region, y no tienen que adherirse ni tomar parte en las acciones que perjudican la preservacion de la paz y la estabilidad de la region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos representantes diplomaticos expresaron profundo entendimiento sobre el hecho de que la malvada politica hostil de EE.UU. a la RPDC llevo a la extrema tension la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana y la region."
