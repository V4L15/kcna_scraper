As long as the South Korean authority's flunkeyist and treacherous, anti-popular misrule persists, the South Korean worker's ever more intensified struggle is inevitable and their just actions to survive can never be arrested. \r\n\r\n"

This is a sheer sophism, I dare say.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Answer by Hong Sun Ik:&nbsp;&nbsp;  You are right. The South Korean authorities are now persistently refusing to repatriate those unconverted long-term prisoners of the north origin.   The prisoners have consistently demanded their repatriation since they were taken prisoner of war. They became crippled after scores of years of imprisonment. They do not have any kinsmen who they can depend upon in South Korea.   They in the sunset of their years are impatiently waiting for their return to the DPRK to reunite with their families and relatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAnswer by Jong Ho Jin:&nbsp;&nbsp; In the DPRK there is no \"'ROK' army POW\" claimed by the South Korean authorities. The DPRK government already sent all of the south-origin POWs back to South Korea just after the cease-fire in keeping with the international convention on POWs and the requirement of the Korean armistice agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAnswer by Choe Won Su:&nbsp;&nbsp; There are no \"persons kidnapped by the north\", but those who voluntarily defected to it according to their faith and will.   Unable to live any longer in the south, a colony of the United States, we all defected to the north where genuine human life is guaranteed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAnswer by Kwon Hyok Jo:&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been neither \"army POWs\" nor \"persons  kidnapped\" nor can there be such persons in the DPRK where human dignity and life are ensured substantially.   It is preposterous to call us, voluntary defectors to the north, \"POWs\" and \"those kidnapped\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAnswer Ri Jong Ju: &nbsp;&nbsp;It is an intolerable insult to us, defectors, that the South Korean authorities raised the issue of nonexistent \"army POWs\".   The rulers in the south should not urge us to come back but immediately repatriate the unconverted long-term prisoners of the north origin as they demanded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The participants in the interview were unanimous in saying that they are not \"POWs\" nor \"persons kidnapped\" and defected to the north of their own accord, turning against the South Korean society, a veritable hell.   They declared that none of the defectors in different parts of the DPRK wants to go back to the south. \r\n\r\n"

Korea's \"Intelligence Service\" exposed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- The South Korean authorities, having renamed the \"Agency for National Security Planning\" (ANSP), the headquarters of anti-north fascist plots, the \"Intelligence Service\" some time ago, are crying as if its character and function were changed.   In this regard, the national reunification institute in the DPRK made public an open statement on April 21 disclosing its real nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt said: &nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of this renaming is to improve the ugly image of the \"ANSP\" tarnished for all kinds of wrongdoings it has committed for scores of years and to intensify the fascist rule and the policy of confrontation with the north.   Their talk about \"information-gathering\" means a pronoun of surveillance, control and suppression of pro-reunification patriots and democratic forces as well as espionage, plots, subversive activities and sabotages against the north.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Under the signboard of \"simplification of the structure,\" divisions of the \"Intelligence Service\" scattered in various places were amalgamated and invested with a greater role and function than ever before.   As far as the reshuffle made at the \"Intelligence Service\" is concerned, the present ruler replaced his political rival and factions close to him with his right-hand men to set up a \"pro-government system.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   According to the \"Law on the Intelligence Service,\" it is empowered to gather international information and domestic information on public peace, conduct activities for public peace and investigate violations of the \"National Security Law.\"  In fact, this shows that the \"Intelligence Service\" is a power machine invested with the same intelligence and investigation powers as those of the past \"Central Intelligence Agency\" and the \"ANSP.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the last one year since the appearance of the present \"government,\" the number of people detained on the strength of the \"National Security Law\" has more than doubled as compared with the figure at the time of the preceding regime and cases of political intervention, torture and wiretapping have multiplied.  When reorganizing the \"ANSP\" into the \"Intelligence Service,\" the South Korean authorities increased its function and role related to the north. They merged the international and north affairs divisions into one division specializing in gathering information on the north and promoted the \"training course\" once operated under the \"Intelligence Service\" to the \"postgraduate course\" which can train a large number of experts on anti-north intelligence every year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe \"Intelligence Service\" outshines the \"ANSP\" in its methods of intelligence activities, subversive acts and sabotages against the north.  The former \"Central Intelligence Agency\" and the \"ANSP\" conducted all their intelligence activities, subversive acts and sabotages, advertising the principle of \"unofficial and secret activities.\" On the contrary, the \"Intelligence Service\" is openly conducting such activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It stretches out its tentacles to all the public circles of South Korea. In particular, it is getting frenzied in its intelligence activities, subversive acts and sabotages against the north in other countries.\r\nAll facts prove that the \"intelligence service\" is a group of anti-north fascist plotters who are more disgusting and slovenly than those of the former \"central intelligence agency\" and the \"ANSP.\" \r\n\r\n"
