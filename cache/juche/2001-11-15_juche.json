            "content": "Korea's endemic plant: Rheum coreanum nak \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 15 (KCNA) -- Rheum coreanum nak is a perennial grass of the smartweed family that grow in the alpine areas at least 2,000 meters above sea level, including Kwanmo and Chail peaks. It is nicknamed \"king grass\" for its height of two meters (2.5 meters at most) and magnificent appearance.\r\n The reddish hollow stem grows straight, five to six cm in diameter, and the round-shaped root is 15 cm thick and 8- to 150 cm long. The blades are round and broad, sometimes attaining a length of 1.5 meters. It is propagated by seed or root.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Abundant with glucosides and tannin, the grass is used to produce peptic tablets and remedies for jaundice as well as for dyeing and tannin materials. it is sensitive to changes in temperature, and, when it grows in higher than normal temperatures of lower areas, its size and value decrease. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This endemic plant of Korea was first discovered in Juche 9 (1919). The government has designated it as a living monument of economic and academic value and has taken steps to ensure its protection and propagation. Its prime habitat, Chail peak, has been made a plant reserve and it is under artificial cultivation outside its natural environment. \r\n\r\n"

This politics is a great political mode in the era of independence progressive humankind sought, looking back on the history and foreseeing future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists are pursuing aggression and war, domination and subjugation. This situation requires the people desirous of independence and peace to tighten their belts and build up the country's defence capability by themselves by use of huge resources though they are not well off. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they fail to do so, they will not be able to escape from imperialists' aggression and military intervention and the lot of a slave. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was because of the DPRK's strong capability for self-defence that the enemy suffered a defeat in acute confrontation while the DPRK emerged victorious in it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unity is one of the powerful weapons to check the imperialists' war of aggression and defend peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unity leads to victory and disunity means defeat. This is a lesson and truth taught by history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's single-hearted unity is more powerful than a nuclear weapon. This is what the enemy fears most.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
