Kumgang Resort and video meetings between separated families and relatives on the occasion of upcoming harvest moon day and thus give further momentum to the atmosphere of humanitarian cooperation between the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The chief delegate of the south side made a speech. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The talks continue.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The Japanese people have suffered a lot at the hand of the U.S. forces present in Japan and so the voices demanding the pullout of the U.S. forces are growing louder. The Japanese reactionary ruling quarters, however, offer larger portions of the land of Japan to the U.S. as its operational base and supply base. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are out to achieve their ambition for making Japan a military power and for overseas expansion at any cost with the patronage of the United States. To this end, Japan carries out obediently what its senior ally wants, as a political servant and a war stooge. Winning the favor of the U.S., its master, by blindly following and yielding to it, Japan is running about with increasing frenzy to gratify its ambition, while raising more terrific outcries for a tighter alliance with the U.S. as the days go by. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is the first target of the reinvasion of the Japanese militarist forces. They are kicking and struggling to jump onto the road of reinvasion of Korea, pulling the war chariot of the U.S. imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But Japan should know that reinvasion will lead it directly to self-destruction.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
