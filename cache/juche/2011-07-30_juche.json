            "content": "S. Korean Authorities' Servile Attitude toward Japan Censured\r\n Pyongyang, July 30 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea issued information bulletin No. 976 Saturday accusing the group of traitors of south Korea of its equivocal attitude towards the Japanese reactionaries' moves to grab territories of Korea and its behavior to calm down the anti-Japanese sentiment of south Koreans of various strata.  \n\t\t\t\t\t It says: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries recently banned the Japanese public officials from using a south Korean airliner, \"protesting\" against the plane's test flight over Tok Islets. Assemblymen from the Liberal Democratic Party are mulling visiting Ullung Island. This aroused a strong rebuff from the south Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Various civic and public organizations and the Democratic Party, the Democratic Labor Party and other political parties of south Korea held a protest rally outside the Japanese embassy in Seoul, strongly denouncing and rejecting Japan's ambition to seize Tok Islets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities, however, took passive approach toward Japan, saying that \"south Korea should not be embroiled in disputes with Japan\" and talking about \"silent diplomacy\", \"regret\" and \"self-restraint\". They are trying to calm down the people's anti-Japanese sentiment, describing the LDP assemblymen's visit to Ullung Island as \"tour\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries' recent moves are serious issues not to be tolerated by the Korean nation as they revealed once again their ambition to seize Ullung Island and Tok Islets, inalienable parts of the territory of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a result of the present south Korean conservative ruling forces' servile diplomacy toward Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean conservative group has never taken issue with the Japanese reactionaries whenever they designated Tok Islets as Japan's territory in their defense white paper and distorted history textbooks.  When the Japanese prime minister said that \"it cannot but write about Tok Islets in 'new teaching guidelines'\" for social subjects at primary and secondary schools, the group asked Japan to \"wait,\" saying that \"it finds itself in an embarrassing situation.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When a south Korean marine institute tried to set up a Tok Islets combined marine research center, the group attempted to delete words Tok Islets from the name of the center, saying that it can rattle the nerves of Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is due to the present south Korean ruling forces' servile attitude toward Japan and their treachery to serve it that the Japanese reactionaries are set to visit Tok Islets like their own land and went the lengths of disclosing their territorial ambition on the spot.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean group of traitors is taking such ambiguous stand toward the Japanese reactionaries' moves to seize Korea's territories, prompted by its sinister intention to avoid conflict with Japan and strengthen cooperation with it in the moves against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts prove that the south Korean conservative group is made up of the most despicable sycophants and traitors and anti-reunification elements without equals as they are working with bloodshot eyes to escalate confrontation with fellow countrymen even giving up the territorial sovereignty of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The Koreans will never remain a passive on-looker to the nation's territory being encroached upon and its dignity and interests violated at the hands of the south Korean group of traitors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Koreans and all other fellow countrymen will never pardon the puppet group kowtowing to outsiders but turn out in the anti-Japanese and anti-\"government\" struggle to protect the territories of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Should the south Korean puppet group persist in escalating the confrontation with the DPRK, selling off the dignity and interests of the nation, it will meet only a shameful destruction."

En este contexto, prohíben a los oficinistas de su país usar aviones surcoreanos de pasajeros y los parlamentarios del Partido Democrático Liberal de Japón intentan visitar la isla Ullung, provocando gran repudio de la población surcoreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas entidades civiles y sociales y los partidos políticos del Sur de Corea incluso el Partido Democrático y el Partido de Obreros Democráticos sostuvieron un mitin de protesta frente a la embajada de Japón acreditada en el Sur de Corea para denunciar y rechazar la ambición de Japón de usurpar el islote Tok. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, las autoridades surcoreanas toman una actitud pasiva diciendo que \"no debemos involucrar en el conflicto con Japón\" y hablando de la \"diplomacia silenciosa\", \"lástima\" y \"control de sí mismas\".
