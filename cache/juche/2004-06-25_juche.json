            "content": "Foreign Ministry Spokesman on U.S. \"Arms Reduction\" \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 24 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA Thursday as regards the U.S. recent decision to scale down the U.S. forces in south Korea:\r\n The U.S. made public its plan to cut down part of its troops stationed in south Korea but is massively shipping latest weapons and war means into south Korea under the \"arms buildup plan\" that calls for spending 11 billion dollars. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. Heavyweights are now claiming that this measure will have no impact on the U.S. capability to cope with the emergency on the Korean peninsula, saying that means capability is more important than the numerical strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a matter of fact, the U.S. plans to transfer and deploy modern war means it had tested in the Afghan and Iraqi wars in and around south Korea in the near future in the wake of its deployment of latest type PAC missiles and reconnaissance planes in south Korea for an actual war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This clearly proves that the \"arms reduction measure\" does not mean any switchover in the U.S. Korea policy but is aimed at retaining a \"qualitative edge\" to stifle the DPRK by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that there is no change in the U.S. policy to stifle the DPRK by force, the latter is left with no option but to strengthen the measures to cope with the U.S. \"qualitative edge.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world public is taking note of the fact that the measure was taken according to the U.S. unilateral decision with neither prior discussion nor notification to the UN. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has claimed for the past more than 50 years that the U.S. forces in south Korea are the \"UN forces.\" The recent measure unilaterally taken by the U.S. in utter disregard of the UN is little short of admitting themselves that the U.S. forces are occupation forces, not the \"UN forces.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that practical measures are taken by the military authorities between the north and the south to remove the root cause of mistrust and confrontation, the U.S. is left with no justification to keep its forces in south Korea any longer.\r\n If the U.S. truly hopes peace and detente on the Korean peninsula, it should completely withdraw its troops from south Korea, far from deceiving the world public opinion with talk about so-called \"arms reduction.\"    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on Truth behind Outbreak of Korean War \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 24 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Thursday carries a signed article disclosing how frantically the U.S. imperialists stepped up their preparations for the last Korean war (1950-1953).\r\n The article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After appointing McArthur as commander-in-chief of the U.S. Forces in the Far East on December 16, 1946, the U.S. imperialists organized their Far Eastern forces with the most of the former U.S. forces in the Pacific and rounded off the ABC plan, a scenario to invade the Far East. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They worked out a detailed military strategy plan for \"northern expedition\" early in 1949. They committed ceaseless military provocations in areas along the 38th parallel in a bid to put the plan into practice in July and August 1949. But they were frustrated by the strong counter-actions taken by the Security Forces of the DPRK for self-defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Finding it hard to realize the plan for the \"northern expedition\" with the strength of the south Korean force, the U.S. imperialists amended their plan for the Korean war from the end of 1949 to early 1950 and replaced it by a new Korean war scenario which reflected the diplomatic strategy and intelligence operation plan of the U.S. State Department to politically support their military operation. It was examined by the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff in January 1950 before being discussed and ratified by the U.S. National Security Council. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  In order to successfully carry out the plan the U.S. imperialists organized and bolstered the south Korean forces and concluded the \"status of forces agreement on tentative military forces and security in the transitional period\" with traitor Syngman Rhee on August 25, 1948, thus seizing the command over the army and the right of control over the military bases and facilities in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The U.S. fabricated the law on conscription in peace time in June 1948, the first of its kind in the history of the U.S., in a bid to reinforce the U.S. forces which would play the role of a main force in carrying out the Korean war, drastically increased its military budget and hired at least 100,000 Japanese in units of the U.S. 8th Army in Japan before provoking the Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  After concluding with south Korea an \"agreement on mutual defence assistance\" and the \"agreement on establishing military advisers group\" in south Korea on January 26, 1950, the U.S. imperialists stepped up the conclusion of bilateral military agreements with its satellite countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  They pushed forward a plan to hurl the U.S. forces and armies of its satellites into the Korean war under the signboard of the UN and worked out a draft UN resolution even before the war in a bid to justify their future \"aggression of north Korea.\" Having singled out the \"UN Commission on Korea\" as the third party which would submit a report on \"north Korean invasion\" to the UN, the U.S. provided it with every necessary condition for acting to realize its plot. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The U.S. imperialists and the south Korean military committed at least 5,150 military provocations by mobilizing a total of 83,800 troops up to the day the Korean war broke out since 1947. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  When the scenario for the Korean war was completed in early 1950, McArthur called Syngman Rhee to Tokyo in mid-February, 1950 and gave him 11-point special instructions related to launching the Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  As seen above, the U.S. imperialists and Syngman Rhee traitors provoked the Korean war of aggression by mounting a surprise attack on June 25, 1950 on the basis of these careful preparations.       \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The previous discovery was in 2001.\r\n Among the remains are cranial bones riddled by bullets and broken into pieces. Carpal bones remained tied twofold or threefold with copper wire 3.5 mm in diameter. The ends of the wire were twisted by pincers some 20 times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though several decades have passed, the marks on the remains clearly show the thrice-cursed atrocities committed by the American murderers who took human killing for pleasure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. troops revealed their brutality by killing innocent people in cold blood from the very days of their occupation of Sinchon in October 1950. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On October 18, 1950, GIs drove some 900 innocent people into an air-raid shelter and sprayed gasoline over them and burnt them to death. In such way, they killed more than 1,550 people in and around the air-raid shelter in a few days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aggressors did not hesitate to massacre some 580 people including old people, women and children, or 70 percent of the villagers in Unbong-ri, Onchon-myon (sub-county), Sinchon county in November that year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that it was happy for the mothers and children to stay together, the GIs threw them into a warehouse, separated from each other. They sprayed gasoline over the crying children, set fire to them and even threw hand grenades into the warehouse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are tombs of the 400 women and the 102 children in Sinchon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During their 52-day occupation of Sinchon, the GIs cruelly killed more than 35,000 patriots and innocent people, a fourth of the county population, in such a way as torturing, burying alive, hanging, burning and driving nails into heads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
