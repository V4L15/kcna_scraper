Then he called upon all Koreans to turn out in the nationwide drive for implementing the behests of the President for national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the great loss of the nation in the 1990s, the history of the President's leadership for national reunification was carried forward and the movement for reunification faced a fresh period of upsurge. This would be unthinkable without the efforts of Kim Jong Il who instilled the three charters of national reunification, precious patriotic legacy of the President, into the minds of Koreans as strong mainstay of independent reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The June 15 era of reunification ushered in 2000 by Kim Jong Il is the valuable crystal of his patriotism for achieving independent reunification, peace and prosperity by the concerted efforts of our nation true to the behests of the President.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the noteworthy exploit Kim Jong Il performed for the country and the nation that he developed the movement for national reunification into the patriotic movement for national independence and national unity and thus laid the strong foundation for independent reunification, true to the behests of the President."
