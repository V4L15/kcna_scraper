Korea \r\n  Pyongyang, August 6 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the National Democratic Front of South Korea (NDFSK) made public a statement on August 1 vehemently denouncing the present South Korean regime for rigging up a \"case of underground revolutionary headquarters of the North and South Kyongsang Provincial Committee of the NDFSK,\" according to Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation.\r\n   Branding this as an anti-social, anti-democratic case woven with deception and fabrication, the spokesman said:\r\n   The case shows that, upset by the intensified national democratic movement including the labour movement, the present rulers are desperately trying to stifle it by inventing \"procommunist cases\" as the dictators of the \"fifth and sixth republics\" did.\r\n   They are premeditatedly rigging up \"cases\" in a bid to find a way out of its serious crisis in suppressing the labour movement which has appeared as the main obstacle in the way of maintaining their regime  and in dampening the ardent desire for reconciliation and unity between the north and the south.\r\n   What cannot be overlooked is the fact that they cooked up a dastardly \"procommunist case\" against the NDFSK.\r\n   The present rulers must release unwarrantably arrested champions of the labour movement without delay and put an immediate end to the brutal suppression of national democratic movement forces. \r\n\r\n"

Driven into a tight corner,  the present South Korean ruler dismissed Pak Jong Su. \r\n\r\n"

Korean authorities denounced for trying to destroy August 15 pro-reunification festival\r\n  Pyongyang, August 6 (KCNA) -- The South Korean authorities said that in case the south headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification (Pomminryon) and the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils (Hanchongryon) force the August 15 pro - reunification event, they will arrest the prime movers and prime backers and keep those organizations from joining other public organisations in pro-reunification event. \r\n   A spokesman for the north headquarters of Pomminryon issued a statement on August 5 in this regard.\r\n   The statement bitterly condemns the utterances of the South Korean authorities, considering them a challenge to the desire of the nation for reunification and an unbearable Insult to all patriotic political parties, organisations and prominent figures at home and abroad in a struggle for the success of the August 15 grand, pro-reunification festival, a nationwide event.\r\n   It goes on:\r\n   The South Korean authorities are attempting to describe Pan-Korea Rally and a grand, pro-reunification festival of the National Alliance of Youth and Students for the Country's Reunification (Pomchonghakryon) as \"pro-north, enemy-benefiting events\" and nip them in the bud. The attempt is designed to throw a wet blanket over the desire of the fellow countrymen for great unity and destroy the August 15 grand, pro-reunification festival. It more vividly proves that the self-styled \"people's government\" of South Korea is a herd of traitors who want neither national unity nor reunification.\r\n   The South Korean authorities should stop unreasonably describing Pomminryon south headquarters and Hachongryon as \"enemy-benefiting organisations\" and allow their free reunification movement and participation in the grand festival. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Wartime sexual slavery, however, is still being forced in many areas of the world.\r\n   This is ascribable to Japan's refusal to liquidate its past.\r\n   The past crimes which have not yet been liquidated is the root cause of today's crimes.\r\n   The Japanese authorities must honestly apologize for the past, adopt a political determination to make a governmental atonement for this and translate it into practice at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
