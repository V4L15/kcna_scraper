            "content": "S. Korea Can Never Evade Blame for Putting KIZ at Risk of Closure\r\n Pyongyang, April 11 (KCNA) -- The General Bureau for Central Guidance to the Development of the Special Zone gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA Thursday as regards that the south Korean group of traitors are kicking up a confrontation racket over the DPRK's important step concerning the situation in the Kaesong Industrial Zone (KIZ):\n\t\t\t\t\t As already reported, the DPRK Monday declared an important step of withdrawing all its employees from KIZ and temporarily suspending the operations in the zone and stated that it will examine the issue of whether it will allow the existence of the zone or close it in view of the grave situation prevailing in the zone due to the U.S. and the south Korean puppet group's hostile acts and their war moves against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The step is a resolute answer and natural decision of the DPRK against the puppet group seeking to use KIZ, symbolic of reconciliation, cooperation, peace and reunification, as a theatre of confrontation between compatriots and a hotbed of war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t So, south Korean minor enterprisers and people of different social standings are deeply concerned about the developments in the days ahead, condemning the puppet group for driving KIZ into a crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet authorities and warmongers, however, are letting loose a spate of invectives to evade the blame for the situation, slandering the DPRK's important step with such remarks as \"disappointment\" and \"regret\", far from apologizing for their treacherous acts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"Saenuri Party\" and conservative politicians and paid trumpeters are fostering an atmosphere of confrontation, crying out for \"height of pressure on the south\", \"chocking technique pursuant to minute scenario\" and \"card for forcing the south to surrender with white flag\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Worse still, the chief of the inner room of Chongwadae said that the north \"suspended normal operations in KIZ\", \"it breached international norms and broke promise\" and \"the south wants the north to stop wrong act and have correct option.\" It is a shameless act just like a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean regime is trying to avoid the blame for the grave situation in KIZ and shift it onto the DPRK. It is a ridiculous act to distort the truth, avoid public criticism and lay the blame at the door of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As known, KIZ is a crystal of leader Kim Jong Il's love for the nation and people and ardent will for reunification and the historic June 15 joint declaration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK readily offered a vast area of militarily important vantage along the Military Demarcation Line to be used as the industrial zone and this helped the south side greatly benefit from it economically.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When traitor Lee Myung Bak worked hard to destroy KIZ, getting on the nerves of the DPRK after coming to power, the latter showed self-restraint out of compatriotic feelings, taking into consideration the situation of minor enterprises of south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is needless to say that KIZ can no longer exist if even the Park Geun Hye regime stands for confrontation with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is clear who has driven the situation to an extreme phase being keen on the moves for confrontation with fellow countrymen and north-targeted nuclear war moves and who has gone reckless to turn KIZ into a hotbed of war by introducing a U.S. special force there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than the puppet group, plot-breeders, who slandered the DPRK's efforts to maintain KIZ with such rhetoric as \"financial source\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group totally nullified and ditched the north-south agreements, put the inter-Korean relations at state of war and is kicking up the frantic anti-DPRK racket under the pretext of the DPRK's satellite launch whose legitimacy is recognized by international law. This being a hard fact, the group branded the important step taken by the DPRK for the defence of its dignity and sovereignty as the \"violation of the north-south agreement and international norms\". This is utterly shocking.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts clearly prove that it is none other than the chief of the inner room of Chongwadae who should stop \"wrong acts\" and make a \"correct option\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present chief executive of south Korea can never shirk off the responsibility for putting KIZ, which continued its existence even in the period of traitor Lee Myung Bak's rule, at the risk of closure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is an unpardonable treacherous crime to turn KIZ, a precious result of the June 15 joint declaration, into the hotbed of confrontation with compatriots and the source of war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the puppet group continues its bid to make a fun of the DPRK's important step, this will entail irretrievably serious consequences.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group should bear in mind the DPRK's warning that this important step is temporary and what will happen in the days ahead entirely depends on the attitude of the south Korean authorities."

Korea Not to Make Misjudgment\r\n Pyongyang, April 11 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) released information bulletin No. 1029 Thursday.\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group of south Korea, taken aback by the toughest steps taken by the DPRK to defend its dignity and sovereignty, is letting loose absurd remarks, the bulletin said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those concerned of the puppet regime including Chongwadae, experts and conservative media have remarked that the north will not provoke an all-out war even though it ratchets up threats. They are describing those steps as \"brinkmanship tactics\", saying that study into the inside of the north shows that the people are leading a peaceful life as usual.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are also calling those steps an \"extreme psychological warfare\" and \"sort of propaganda\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our comment to their rhetoric about \"psychological warfare\" and \"propaganda\" is that they are free to think at their will but should not belatedly regret having done such a thing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now south Koreans buy out food and daily necessities out of extreme war-phobia, making volumes of sale soar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Several countries are taking measures to provide shelter or evacuate their people residing in south Korea, and foreign students, businessmen and institutions are thrown into chaos, trying to find their way out of south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group of south Korea is resorting to smear propaganda campaign to seek its comfort by forcing others into death like itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The arrows indicating the merciless retaliatory strikes have already been drawn directing at the U.S. mainland, U.S. military bases in the Pacific and all other bases where the U.S. imperialist aggression forces station.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The powerful strike means of the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK have been put in their places and the coordinates of targets put into the warheads.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Just pressing the button will be enough to turn the strongholds of the enemies into the sea of fire.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the south Korean regime is talking about \"psychological warfare\" and \"propaganda campaign\". This is a despicable act which can be done only by imbeciles and fools unaware of what an all-out action declared by the DPRK is like and what consequences their acts will entail.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As for their talk about peaceful activities in the north, it is the fixed will of the army and people of the DPRK to carry on production and construction till midnight today and have children taught at schools even though a war might break out tomorrow.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has won victories in confrontation with the U.S. in this spirit and is waging an all-out action with it, with confidence in final victory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The enemies should know that it is the era of the great Marshal Kim Jong Un, leader of the most powerful country and invincible great Paektusan nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and south Korean war maniacs are gravely mistaken and misjudged if they think they can have lucky chance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t War can break out any moment and what remains to be done is merciless punishment of the enemies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Belated regret will be useless and not a single man will be able to survive to regret for his doing."

            "content": "Guerra sagrada es unico remedio para la paz en Peninsula Coreana, senala Rodong Sinmun\r\nPyongyang, 11 de abril (ACNC) -- En un articulo individual divulgado este jueves, el diario Rodong Sinmun puntualiza que el unico remedio para lograr la paz duradera de la Peninsula Coreana reside en librar la sagrada y justa guerra orientada a dar punto final al acto provocativo politico-militar de los belicistas yanquis y surcoreanos y alcanzar la reunificacion de la patria, y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\tLos freneticos entrenamientos militares conjuntos para la agresion al Norte de Corea, que desarrollan el imperio y la banda titere surcoreana, llevan la situacion de la citada peninsula al umbral de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstados Unidos y los titeres surcoreanos rumorean la llamada \"provocacion\" de la RPDC imputando la responsabilidad de la aguda situacion dada ahora en la Peninsula Coreana, la cual recae en ellos mismos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas presentes maniobras EE.UU.-Sur de Corea son producto de la politica agresiva anti-RPDC del imperio y de la obstinada ambicion de agredir al Norte de los titeres surcoreanos. Y ademas constituyen la etapa final de la campana belica que vino ampliandose e intensificandose historicamente de manera escalonada como factor de guerra nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY ademas ponen en peligro la Peninsula Coreana, el Nordeste Asiatico y todo el mundo amenazando con imponer desastres de guerra nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC vino esforzandose ingentemente hasta la fecha para mejorar las relaciones intercoreanas y lograr la paz y la reunificacion del pais. Pero tiene limite su paciencia tambien. De ahi, se ha sacado la conclusion de que hay que controlar el fuego y la fuerza con las mismas cosas."
