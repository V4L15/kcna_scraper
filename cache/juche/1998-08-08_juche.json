And this predicts that they will more shamelessly try to conceal the past crimes of the Japanese imperialists and evade their obligation to liquidate them.\r\n   Their attempts to negate and justify the past crimes are an expression of dangerous militarism which seeks to repeat the past.\r\n   The Japanese authorities must honestly admit the past crimes and , apologize and compensate for them.  \r\n\r\n"

They have persecuted and tortured the people on charges of distributing \"handbills benefiting the north, the enemy,\" and encouraging workers to go on strike.\r\n   Several days ago, the chairman of the National Reunification Committee of the Kwangju-South Jolla Provincial Federation of University Student Councils was arrested and the chairman of the 5th-term South Korean Federation of University Student Councils penalized.\r\n   Rodong Sinmun today views the suppression as part of the premeditated fascist offensive against the patriotic-minded people aspiring after democracy, vital rights and the country's reunification.\r\n   The daily says in a commentary:\r\n   Even former dictators who made themselves infamous with manhunting could not penalize workers who fought for democracy and vital rights on charges of being \"pro-north.\"\r\n   But the present rulers have put such workers on the altar of fascist laws, charging them with \"benefiting the enemy.\" \r\nThis is apparently a provocation against the north.\r\n   The South Korean authorities intend to chill the desire for national reconciliation and unity which is ever growing with the approach of the August 15 grand pro-reunification festival, and emerge from the serious crisis of the regime by means of provocation against the north and harsh suppression of the South Korean people.\r\n   With brutal suppression, however, they cannot check the people's ardent desire for independence, democracy and reunification. \r\n\r\n"

It is also designed to hold sway over economic life of the world. In a nutshell, it is a strategy of the imperialists to establish a new world economic order of westernstyle, use the economic life of the world for their purpose of dominating the world and facilitate unrestricted exploitation and plunder throughout the world.\r\n   The world people should have a good knowledge of the reactionary nature of the imperialists' \"globalisation of the economy.\"  They should not accept nor allow it. \r\n\r\n"
