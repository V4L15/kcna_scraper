They are most reasonable and patriotic reunification proposals to rejoin the severed blood ties of the nation, preventing the moves of separatists at home and abroad and transcending the differences in ideology, ideal and system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The President Kim Il Sung said the greatest gift that he could give to the Korean nation was national reunification. He devoted his whole life to the patriotic cause of the country's independence and reunification. He died at his post, examining a document on national reunification at the last moments of his life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The great leader Kim Jong Il is the lodestar of reunification who is confidently leading the cause of national reunification, true to the President's behest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The three principles of national reunification--independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity--and the proposal for founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo are the most reasonable and patriotic reunification principle and proposal set forth by the President and held fast to by Kim Jong Il. The DPRK will surely achieve the historic cause of national reunification by putting them into practice at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Independence is precisely Kim Jong Il's political philosophy, philosophy for reunification. Great national unity constitutes his warm love for the country and nation and the noblest will for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His benevolent politics, all-embracing politics and army-first politics are politics of love for man and the nation and politics for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Optimistic is the prospect of national reunification thanks to the guidance of Kim Jong Il, lodestar of independent reunification and peaceful reunification and center of great national unity. \r\n\r\n"
