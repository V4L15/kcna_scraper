To prevent the U.S. imperialists from indiscriminately killing peaceable civilians after igniting a new war, it is necessary to probe the truth behind those mass killings to the last. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The basic way of barring them from committing mass killings is to force the U.S. forces to quit South Korea.    \r\n\r\n"

It is urging the DPRK to cut down its military forces on the front while seeking the permanent presence of the U.S. troops in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such behavior proves that the bush administration does not have any intention to ease the military confrontation on the Korean peninsula but works hard to escalate it against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should take a practical step to pull its troops out of South Korea before talking about \"cutdown of conventional forces\" of the DPRK, if it truly wants  disarmament and peace on the Korean peninsula.    \r\n\r\n"

Through visits to the shrine they seek to imbue the younger generation with militarism so that they may turn out in a war to realize their dream of \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\" which they failed to achieve in the past. Their other aim is to create a social atmosphere favourable for arms buildup needed for overseas invasion and completion of the wartime law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently they disclosed that Japan would dispatch its \"Self-Defence Forces\" to the Korean peninsula if a war breaks out there. This is little short of a declaration of a war of aggression to seize the DPRK any moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' ambition for aggression remains unchanged though one generation is replaced by another. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they dare undertake any military action against the DPRK they will not escape a merciless retaliation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
