Its keypoint is to make preparations for carrying out wars simultaneously on the Korean Peninsula and in the Persian Gulf region.\r\n   Since the termination of the Cold War, the United States has concentrated the strategy of strength on the Korean Peninsula and Persian Gulf and regarded the two regions as keys to the execution of its reactionary world strategy.\r\n   In the strategy the United States gives priority to a Korean war. The reason is that the Korean Peninsula has the \"greatest possibility of war\" in the world. It is an undeniable fact and the United States is responsible for the possibility.\r\n   The United States has massed huge combat forces in South Korea and its vicinity, going ahead with war preparations.\r\n   Since the Cold War came to an end, it has sought to take a military initiative and a strategic position in quarrel with powers over the sphere of influence in Asia with the Korean Peninsula as a main front, dominate the continent and easily execute the aggressive world strategy based on strength.\r\n   It will put its seventh fleet it describes as the \"strongest fleet in the world\" under the operational control of the U.S.-South Korean combined forces command in wartime. It is keeping 100,000 troops in South Korea, Japan and other East Asian regions. It has established the aggressive U.S.-Japan-South Korea \"Collective Security System\" and is pushing ahead with preparations for carrying the new \"U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation Guidelines\" into effect.\r\n   All this indicates that it intends to raise the curtain of the \"two wars\" scenario anytime on the Korean Peninsula.\r\n   If the United States unleashes a war in Korea, however, it is as good as suicide.\r\n   The United States had better discard the conception of war and rewrite the aggressive Korea policy.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean parties, organizations called for\r\nPyongyang, February 18 (KCNA) -- Political parties and organizations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea held a joint meeting here today to discuss finding an independent way out for the nation with concerted efforts of the north and the south.\r\n   In a report Kim Yong Sun, Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea Central Committee and Chairman of the Reunification Policy Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, said:\r\n   The Kim Young Sam regime, which has made the reunification timetable exist in a vacuum for five years and driven back the fellow countrymen's march toward reunification, will soon leave \"Chongwadae.\" new politics aspiring after independence and national unity is a task which should be fulfilled immediately in South Korea.\r\n   The north and the south should seek independence and unity, regarding as guidelines the three charters of national reunification -- the three principles of reunification, the proposal for founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo and the \"10-Point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the Reunification of the Country\" -- as General Secretary Kim Jong Il said in his historic work concerning national reunification published last year.\r\n   With South Korea remaining dependent on foreign forces, no genuine improvement of inter-Korean relations can be expected.\r\n   The improvement of these relations must be free from interference of foreign interests.\r\n   We must resolutely reject the shameful \"international cooperation\" which the Kim Young Sam regime established with foreign forces against the fellow countrymen and which leads to foreign interference in the internal affairs of the nation.\r\n   A pressing task facing us is to turn inter-Korean relations which are now in the worst phase into relationship of reconciliation and unity. Along with the end of the Kim Young Sam regime, the anti-north confrontation policy should be renounced and confrontation should be replaced with reconciliation with the north.\r\n   The institutional mechanisms hampering reconciliation should also be eliminated as early as possible.\r\n   Kim Yong Sun urged an unconditional abolition of the fascist, anti-reunification \"National Security Law\" (NSL) and \"Agency for National Security Planning\" (ANSP).\r\n   He further said:\r\n   As the present-day politicians of South Korea were also hurt seriously by the \"NSL\" and \"ANSP\" and called for their unconditional and total abolition, they have no reason not to do it.\r\n   We strongly demand that the suppressive tools, which have stood in the way of national reunification and killed a large number of patriotic-minded champions of reunification  over the past 50 years, should be removed unconditionally now when the military fascist dictatorship already collapsed and the \"civilian\" fascist dictatorship has come to a miserable end.\r\n   The north and the south must promote co-existence, co-prosperity, common interests, mutual collaboration and unity between fellow countrymen. \r\n   All the political parties and organisations in the north and the south must respect each other's ideology, religious belief and social system, accept with an open heart and without prejudice whatever is good for national reunification and beneficial to both the north and the south and solve everything through mutual solidarity and unity.\r\n   We consider that the historic Ten-Point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation which opens wide the road to national reconciliation and unity is a valuable treasure of the nation and a common foundation for great unity. We earnestly call on all the political parties and organisations in south korea to fully support the programme and take joint action with us to carry it into practice as soon as possible.\r\n   We make clear that we are willing to have dialogue and negotiation with anyone in south korea including political parties and organisations if they truly want to open the way of national reunification on the principle of national independence and great unity, discarding their past conception.\r\n   The politicians of south korea must not follow in the footsteps of the criminal \"civilian\" dictatorship. They must promote a new change from dependence on foreign forces and inter-Korean confrontation to national independence and unity to meet the earnest desire of the South Korean people for a new reunification policy.\r\n   Following the report, representatives of political parties and organisations took the floor, expressing full support for the ideas of the report.\r\n   The meeting adopted a letter to the political parties and organisations of South Korea. \r\n   Present at the meeting were Vice-President Pak Song Chol, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, Vice-President Kim Pyong Sik, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Social Democratic Party, and others.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
