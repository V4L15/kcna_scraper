The monstrous human rights abuses committed by the Japanese imperialists during their occupation of Korea are recorded in history as stark facts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDuring their more than 40 year-long colonial rule over Korea after illegally occupying it by force of arms in the first half of the 20th century the Japanese imperialists forcibly drafted and kidnapped at least 8.4 million young and middle-aged Koreans either to use them as cannon fodder in the shambles of war or force them to do slave labor. They, at the same time, took away 200,000 Korean women, reducing them to \"comfort women\" for the Imperial Japanese Army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMany of those Koreans were killed by them. Not content with these atrocities, they committed such unheard-of crimes as depriving Koreans of their own names and spoken and written languages.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan, however, is brazen-facedly denying its crimes and distorting its crime-woven history, far from honestly reflecting on its past crimes and settling them. These behaviors are an intolerable insult and a mockery of the Korean people as they only add to its crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statute of limitation is not applicable to the human rights abuses. Japan should, therefore, stop evading its responsibility for its past hideous human rights abuses and redeem them as soon as possible."

This was, in essence, an entreaty not to fire him as he proposed defining \"no nukes, opening and 3,000 dollars\" as a \"principle of the policy towards the north\" this year and has put it into practice and insisted that the \"north's dismantlement of its nuclear weapons\" is a \"cornerstone of the inter-Korean relations.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is impossible to expect the improved north-south relations and the reunification of Korea as long as such guy hell-bent on confrontation with fellow countrymen is allowed to remain in office.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is shame on the south Korean people that the post of the minister of \"Unification\" is held by such bete noire who only twists the reality, ignorant of the principle and cornerstone already provided through the process for settling the inter-Korean relations and the issue of reunification."
