            "content": "U.S. urged to opt for signing peace agreement \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 8 (KCNA) -- The Korean peninsula is not yet free from the danger of war although nearly half a century has passed since the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement (KAA), says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary.\r\n Explaining its main reason, the commentary says that it is due to the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK and its forces' presence in South Korea which militarily backs the policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. unilaterally derailed the Geneva conference called to seek the withdrawal of all the foreign forces from Korea after the signing of the KAA and has consistently pursued the policy of military confrontation with the DPRK, while systematically increasing the number of its troops present in South Korea for nearly half a century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The root cause of a war on the Korean peninsula is the U.S. imperialist aggression forces  present in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is already publicly recognized that  U.S. combat forces are deployed in South Korea to launch an offensive against the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bellicose forces of the Bush administration are deploying new task forces and sophisticated operational equipment in and around South Korea under the pretext of \"threat\" from the DPRK. \r\n As seen above, the U.S. troops present in South Korea are the main forces which deteriorate the situation and pose a threat to peace and security on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The adoption of a peace agreement between the DPRK and the U.S. and the withdrawal of the U.S. troops from South Korea are prerequisites for defusing the tensions, creating an atmosphere of lasting peace on the peninsula and improving the DPRK-U.S. relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. troops are left with no justification to stay in South Korea any longer and there is no reason to refuse to adopt a peace agreement, given that the confrontation between the Soviet Union and the U.S. came to an end long ago and the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration is at the phase of its implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Everything depends on the U.S. attitude.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. obstructions to tour of Mt. Kumgang assailed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pyongyang, August 8 (KCNA) -- If the United States persistently hampers the tour of Mt. Kumgang, it will meet a protest not only from the Korean people but from the world peace-loving people and will be held wholly responsible for all the ensuing consequences.\r\n A spokesman for the Korean Asia-Pacific Peace Committee said this in a statement issued today denouncing the U.S. administration for working hard to put the tour into stagnation and foil it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went on to say: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tour of Mt. Kumgang was arranged thanks to the noble patriotic desire and great compatriotic decision of the DPRK to realize the wishes of the South Korean people to see Mt. Kumgang, a famous mountain of the nation, even once and achieve the great unity of the nation to make a short cut to national reunification. It has been promoted as a work for non-governmental cooperation between the Korean Asia-Pacific Peace Committee and the Hyundai Business Group of South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Mt. Kumgang tour which began in November 1998 was warmly welcomed at home and abroad and has been turned into a nationwide work to pull down the barrier of division and give momentum to the desire for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While the tour was making progress, the historic Pyongyang meeting of the heads of the north and south was held and the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration published.\r\n Therefore, the Mt. Kumgang tour is not a mere tour but a foundation and a starting point for the development of the present inter-Korean relations and has been a work common to the whole nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the U.S., which has stood in the way of the peace and reunification of the Korean peninsula after occupying South Korea by force of arms, was not pleased with the tour from its very start. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since the emergence of the bush administration, the moves to obstruct the tour have reached their height for which all means and methods have been employed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has been engaged in a wholesale campaign to derail the tour. It spread a false rumor that the DPRK is \"using the payment for the tour for a military purpose.\" To make this sound plausible, it asserted that the DPRK is using the payment for it for the \"missile development\" and the \"threat from the DPRK has got more serious than last year.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bosses of the U.S. department of state, intelligence service and military summoned the South Korean officials concerned to put pressure upon them, resorted to all sorts of obstructions to the tour and created a terror-ridden atmosphere to scuttle it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In particular, the commander of the U.S. forces in South Korea and other brasshats undisguisedly brought pressure to bear upon Hyundai Business Group that has undertaken the project out of the ardent desire to contribute to national reconciliation, unity and reunification, while wantonly meddling in it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, the U.S. instigated some right-wing conservatives and reactionary media of South Korea to slander and hamstring the tour of Mt. Kumgang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under its wirepulling, those right-wing conservatives are making every possible effort to foil the tourism, claiming that it is \"profitless business\" and \"a drain on resources.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the facts clearly show that the main obstacle to promoting the north-south reconciliation and unity and cooperation such as the Mt. Kumgang tour in line with the interests and desire of the Korean nation is none other than the united states which keeps South Korea under its military occupation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We take a serious note of the U.S. hindrance to the nationwide work going on between the north and the south of Korea, and bitterly denounce it on behalf of all the Koreans.    \r\n\r\n"
