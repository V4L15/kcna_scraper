            "content": "Kim Jong Il Inspects Huichon Power Station\r\n Pyongyang, April 17 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il gave field guidance to the Huichon Power Station under construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t After acquainting himself with the progress made in the construction of the power station, he visited the surge tank construction site of Guards Unit 210 of the KPA, riding along lots of ridge roads newly constructed on many mountains.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After receiving a salute, he personally made his way to the underground cutting face where water was dropping from its ceiling to learn in detail about the progress made in the project and warmly encourage the soldier-builders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was greatly satisfied to learn that they have done a lot of work in a short span of time. He highly appreciated their success in the construction and extended thanks to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a great success that the soldiers of the unit have carried out a huge volume of work in a matter of a few months which would have taken several years at ordinary pace, he said, adding that this is a great miracle of Songun Korea which can be worked only by the servicepersons of the KPA who created the revolutionary soldier spirit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Inexhaustible is the mental power of the servicepersons, the fighters who flatten even a high mountain at one go in a do-or-die spirit, if instructed by the Party to do so, he noted, adding that no force on the earth can overpower this great strength of the KPA single-mindedly rallied around the WPK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then, he mounted an observation platform to command a bird's-eye view of the construction sites.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Feasting his eyes on the construction sites alive with the labor drive, including the iron pipe construction and the construction of the generator room, he expressed great satisfaction over the rapid progress made in the construction of the power station.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching the eye-opening construction sites of the power station now being successfully built with the domestic efforts, technology and materials, he said: It is possible to undertake any gigantic nature-remaking project by our own efforts if we have a will as there is the powerful Juche-based industry firmly built by us, tightening our belts. This clearly proves the validity and tremendous vitality of the WPK's line of economic construction on giving priority to the development of heavy industry.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the devoted labor drive of the soldier-builders who created \"Huichon Speed,\" a new Chollima speed, and other builders of the power station opened a bright prospect for completing the construction of the large-scale Huichon Power Station before 2012, he extended warm greetings to all the builders waging a high-pitched drive in the revolutionary soldier spirit and the revolutionary spirit of fortitude.   \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The construction of the power station is one of the priority tasks for building a thriving nation and, at the same time, an important work to carry out President Kim Il Sung's behests, he noted, advancing important tasks that would serve as guidelines for completing the construction of the power station earlier than scheduled. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is difficult to build a hydro-power station but once it is constructed, it is more advantageous than an atomic power plant, he said, underlining the need to build more hydro-power stations in different parts of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pointing out that supply service is one of the main factors of increasing the speed of the construction, he stressed that it is necessary to take warm care of the builders so that they may not feel any slightest inconvenience in their living.   \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had a photo session with the soldier-builders of KPA Unit 210.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Chief Secretary of the Jagang Provincial Committee of the WPK Pak To Chun, Department Directors Kim Kyong Hui and Jang Song Thaek, First Vice Department Directors Ju Kyu Chang, Ri Je Gang and Ri Jae Il and other leading officials of the WPK Central Committee, KPA Generals Hyon Chol Hae and Ri Myong Su and other commanding officers of the army."

But from some days ago he began making a spate of accusations against the north while blustering that it is necessary to \"probe the accident without a shred of suspicion on the premise of the possible linkage with the north\", \"thoroughly cope with the movement of the north\" and \"south Korea will resolutely counter\" the north if the cause of the accident is finally confirmed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The gentries of \"Chongwadae\", though they asserted that \"there was slim possibility of the north's attack,\" are now taking an attitude that they are not ruling out the \"story about the linkage with the north,\" jabbering that the testimonies of the survivors and the conditions of the sunken ship suggest a large possibility that the ship was hit hard from outside.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The military warmongers are getting more undisguised in their moves to link the accident with the north though it was caused by their fault. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Disclosing the aim sought by the group in the above-said behavior, the article continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is prompted by its ulterior intention to get rid of the worst ruling crisis caused by the \"state management failure\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If public opinion is built to claim that the accident occurred due to \"an internal factor\" and its cause is not properly clarified, the group of traitors will be held directly responsible for it and, accordingly, will not be able to escape a heavy defeat in the forthcoming \"June 2 local elections\". This will lead to the split of the conservative camp including the \"Grand National Party\" and the weakening of its ruling power, throwing the group into an inescapable predicament. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Another sinister aim sought by the puppet regime in floating the above-said story is to justify the persistent and anachronistic policy towards the DPRK and shirk the blame for having driven the inter-Korean relations to the worst crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a well-known fact that from the outset of its office the group of traitors has persistently pursued the inter-Korean confrontation, insisting that \"the north dismantle its nukes first.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t People from all walks of life in south Korea are now becoming evermore vocal critical of the wrong policy pursued by the group towards the north, blatantly challenging the demand of the times and the desire of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is against this backdrop that the group is hyping the \"story about linkage with the north\" in a bid to flee from the responsibility for having deteriorated the north-south relations and justify their mean policy toward the north with the sinking of its warship as a momentum.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ruckus kicked up by the puppet authorities while peddling the story is designed to stir up the atmosphere of international sanctions against the north and increase pressure upon it in various aspects. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of traitors is zealously supporting its American master in his moves to bring down the system in the DPRK, while trying to give impression that the U.S.-led sanctions are proving effective.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This group is making desperate efforts to block the general advance of the north toward the eminence of a great prosperous and powerful nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Herein lies another sinister aim sought by the group of traitors in floating the nonsensical \"story about the linkage with the north.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a trite trick of the stupid to hatch plots and stoop to any infamy under that pretext whenever they are driven into a tight corner. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of traitors would be well advised to face up to the trend of the times and refrain from uttering any word as it pleases."

It was in pursuance of this scenario that the U.S. Department of Defense sent a fact-finding group to Japan and south Korea a few years ago to study the topography and geological structure of the DPRK.

            "content": "South Korea's \"Grand Bargain\" Blasted\r\n Pyongyang, April 17 (KCNA) -- Recently the south Korean puppet group peddled the so-called \"grand bargain,\" i.e. \"a package solution to the nuclear issue of the north\" allegedly calling for giving an \"economic reward\" in return for the north's dismantlement of its nukes. It is now busy soliciting support for it, ballyhooing that the \"grand bargain\" paves a new \"way for settling the nuclear issue of the north\" what it called \"irreversible abandonment of the nuclear program\" based on a version of \"package deal.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Saturday observes in a commentator's article in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"grand bargain\" is sheer sophism as it betrayed the puppet group's ignorance about the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By nature, the puppet group has neither qualification nor face to talk about the nuclear issue or get involved in it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the puppet group is truly concerned about the nuclear issue, it should apologize for its criminal acts of shielding the U.S. nukes, to begin with, get rid of its American master's \"nuclear umbrella\", force the U.S. to pull back its imperialist aggressor forces and nuclear weapons from south Korea and come out against the U.S. strategy of preemptive nuclear attack upon the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now the Korean Peninsula is in the state of ceasefire and the situation is so tense there that a war may break out any moment. It is self-evident that the DPRK cannot unilaterally dismantle its nukes, risking sacrifices under this situation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group is sadly mistaken if it calculates the DPRK will willingly respond to the \"grand bargain\" if it shows off a very big purse for \"economic reward.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This group seeks to goad the DPRK into abandoning its powerful nuclear deterrent which provides a sure guarantee for protecting the dignity of the nation and the sovereignty of the country by showing such hypocritical \"generosity.\" This is a mean and disgusting thought of the narrow-minded merchants who know nothing but money and business. Such jargon is a mockery of the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group had better care for saving south Korean economy from catastrophe and delivering the people from destitution, rather than dealing with the DPRK's nuclear deterrent with the above-said honeyed words.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is foolhardy for the political imbeciles who know only economy based on spadework to try to solve the complicated nuclear issue at one time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is ridiculous for the group to try to settle at one time the matters to be dealt with at the last phase of the talks for solving the nuclear issue in the absence of any confidence-building measure. How is it possible to deal with such matters as the withdrawal of the U.S. forces, prerequisite for settling the nuclear crisis, a halt to the joint military exercises, the conclusion of a peace treaty between the DPRK and the U.S. by a version of \"package deal\" at one time and does it have the mandate to do so?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is the fact that the group seeks to apply the \"grand bargain\" even to the inter-Korean relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group is far-fetchedly insisting that it is a \"main party concerned for the nuclear issue\" and the issue should be dealt with within the framework of the inter-Korean relations because the \"DPRK's nukes\" are threats to the south but it only brings to light the group's shameful true colors as servants for the U.S. in its nuclear war and the sinister aim sought by the group in driving the inter-Korean relations into catastrophe.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet conservative group would be well advised to cogitate about to whom it is obliged for having averted a war to enable it to survive and thank the DPRK. It should stop peddling such foolish offer as \"grand bargain\" which can convince no one."

guerra \"Chonan\" con un tonelaje de mil 400 de las fuerzas navales surcoreanas en las aguas maritimas entre las islas Paekryong y Taechong en el Mar Oeste de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\tAl respecto, la banda de los traidores surcoreanos esta difundiendo un rumor, segun el cual la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea (RPDC) esta involucrada en ese accidente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUn comentarista de asuntos militares publico este sabado su articulo para revelar la falsedad de ese rumor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAunque el naufragado buque de guerra de gran tamano es de la parte surcoreana, hasta ahora, la RPDC considero ese accidente como una desgracia lamentable, que no debio suceder, tomando en cuenta que la mayoria de muchos marineros desaparecidos y rescatados son los integrantes de la nacion coreana que se vieron obligados a servir en el ejercito titere surcoreano, comienza el comentario y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, impotentes de esclarecer la causa de hundimiento, los belicistas de la capa militar, los politiqueros conservadores derechistas y otros traidores pretenden neciamente estos dias vincular el siniestro con la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl principio del caso, ellos hablaban de que no se ha detectado ninguna senal de la penetracion del submarino de la RPDC en su \"perfecta\" red de vigilancia maritima y sistema de radar y de sondeo acustico que funcionan sin parar ni por un momento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pero, cambiando de repente la posicion de que no se debe sacar una conclusion precipitada, comenzaron a hablar del \"rumor de la RPDC involucrada en el caso\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hasta el traidor Lee Myung Bak, quien exigia al principio no hablar a la ligera sobre la participacion del Norte en el caso, comenzo desde hace poco a pronunciar unos chismes, que apuntan implicitamente a la RPDC, como que \"hay que dejar abierta la posibilidad de la participacion del Norte y esclarecerla hasta el final\", \"se debe hacer frente a los movimientos del Norte\" y \"tomaria resueltas contramedidas\" cuando fuera confirmada definitivamente la causa del accidente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos compinches de \"Chongwadae\", que antes insistian en que \"es tenue la posibilidad de ataque del Norte\", adoptan tambien la actitud de no descartar ese rumor diciendo que si se toma en cuenta las declaraciones de los supervivientes y el estado del barco hundido, es muy probable que este haya recibido un golpe externo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos belicistas del circulo militar surcoreano tratan mas abiertamente de vincular con la RPDC ese accidente ocurrido por la culpa de si mismos con el fin de salir de la irremediable crisis de gobernacion, en que estan empantanados los titeres

plenamente su causa, la banda de traidores surcoreanos no podra evitar la gran derrota en las inminentes \"elecciones locales del 2 de junio\" siendo responsables directos de ello.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor consiguiente, tendra que caerse en el atolladero sin salida sufriendo la division del campo de conservadores como el \"Gran Partido Nacional\" y el debilitamiento del poder de dominio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl rumor en cuestion esta relacionado tambien con otra necia intencion de justificar su anacronica politica sobre el Norte y liberarse de la responsabilidad de haber llevado las relaciones intercoreanas al peor estado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodo el mundo sabe que desde el principio de su mandato, la camarilla de traidores persiguio obstinadamente la confrontacion fratricida entre ambas partes coreanas insistiendo en la \"renuncia nuclear, primero\".  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora, en distintos sectores del Sur de Corea crece cada dia mas el rechazo a la erronea politica sobre la RPDC de la banda traidora que desafia frontalmente a la demanda de la epoca y a la aspiracion nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe ahi que la banda traidora difunde el polemico rumor para eludir la responsabilidad del empeoramiento de las relaciones entre ambas partes coreanas y justificar su vil politica sobre la RPDC pretextando el hundimiento del barco.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDetras de la circulacion de tal rumor, hay ademas la intencion de presionar a la RPDC en varios sentidos prolongando la atmosfera internacional de sancionarla.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda traidora toma parte activa en las maniobras de su amo encaminadas a aplastar el regimen de la RPDC hablando con bombo y platillo como si estuviera resultando efectiva la sancion anti-RPDC dirigida por EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, actua desesperadamente para detener el gran avance de la RPDC hacia el horizonte de la gran potencia prospera.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs el metodo rutinario de esos tontos inventar algun complot cada vez que se vean en aprietos y cometer estupideces tomandolo por pretexto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa
