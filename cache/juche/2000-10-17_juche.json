But this will be easily settled in such a peaceful way as dialogue and negotiation, if each side doesn't impose its idea and system on the other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the Korean nation desires is not reunification by a war but the peaceful reunification based on national reconciliation and unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reunification based on fratricidal war will only bring misfortunes and disasters rather than interests to the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The national reunification itself is to realize the national reconciliation and unity and a national cause for prosperity of the nation and happiness of posterity.\r\n To peacefully reunify the country is a major condition for independent life of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The adoption of the historic June 15 north-south joint declaration is of speculative significance in deepening understandings and developing relations between the two sides and realizing peaceful reunification.    \r\n\r\n"

It can be taken by the country which is ready to provide conditions for the UN to act according to its charter and which is enjoying trust from the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Failure to conduct the UN reform on the right principles and direction may make troubles in the way of the UN. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The UN reform should be made thoroughly on the right principles.    \r\n\r\n"
