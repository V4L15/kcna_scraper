It accused the U.S. of staging military exercises for aggression in wanton violation of international law and the un charter, while watching for a chance to make a military preemptive attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Calling on the un and the international community to take a prompt action to make the U.S. forces withdraw from South Korea and ensure peace and security on the Korean peninsula, the statement demanded the U.S. drop its hostile policy toward the DPRK, stop hamstringing the Korean people's efforts to achieve the reunification of the country and immediately lift all sanctions against the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"

They should own the political and moral responsibility, penal responsibility and material responsibility for their mass killings of Korean people, the responsibilities stipulated by international law, in view of their criminal nature, content and gravity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whoever violates international law should be punished by international law. There is no prescription in the case of crimes against humanity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists should be brought to the international court to stand trial. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people have the legitimate right to take the penal responsibility of the U.S. imperialists to task according to the DPRK law any time. The Korean people will exercise this right generation after generation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those countries and nations that ignited wars and committed the massacres in the past have already made or are making repentance, apology and compensation for their wrongdoings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis is an international trend and practice. The U.S. had better face up to the reality, swim with this trend and follow the practice.    \r\n\r\n"

When he called at a ceramic factory in Kyongsong county, North Hamgyong Province he indicated ways of mechanizing its workers' manual labor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  While inspecting an iron works and chemical factories, he conversed with workers for hours and took measures for labor safety. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Whenever he was in an inspection tour, he used to look round dinning rooms, dormitories and dwelling houses of workers and acquainted himself with the management of the sanatoriums and rest homes newly built in hot spring areas and scenic spots. in those days, he completed articles of the Labor Law one by one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  On the basis of this, the \"Labor Law for the Workers and Office Employees in North Korea\" was promulgated at the 9th session of the Provisional People's Committee of North Korea in June 1946. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  With the law put into effect as an important step of democratic reforms, the remnants of the harsh colonial forced labor and exploitation by the Japanese imperialists were liquidated, a radical improvement was made in the working and living conditions of the workers and office employees. The social insurance and security system was carried into effect at the expense of the state and sanatoriums and rest homes were built in different parts of the country. As a result, great changes took place in their material and cultural life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  After the establishment of the socialist system, the \"Socialist Labor Law of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea\" was instituted and promulgated in April 1978 as required by the changed situation. It guarantees the working life of the people by law.    \r\n\r\n"

Dismissing these outbursts as an open declaration of a war against the DPRK, Minju Joson today in a signed commentary says:\r\n The situation on the Korean peninsula is growing tenser as the days go by due to the Bush group's undisguised moves to stifle the DPRK by force and the acute confrontation between the DPRK and the U.S. may lead to a war anytime. This situation compels the DPRK to do whatever it deems necessary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has not only the legitimate right to take self-defensive measures but the will and capability enough to exercise it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the U.S. is invariably seeking to stifle the DPRK by force, the latter is left with no option but to take all measures as scheduled. Under the present circumstances and conditions the DPRK is compelled not only to increase its nuclear deterrent force but build up something more powerful than that for self-defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should ruminate about what consequences its acts of rattling the DPRK's nerves and escalating the military stand-off with the DPRK will entail.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
