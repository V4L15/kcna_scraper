            "content": "KCNA on U.S.-Japan military nexus \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 11 (KCNA) -- U.S. State Secretary Powell at a meeting held on Sept. 8 to mark the 50th anniversary of the \"Japan-U.S. security pact\" said that powerful U.S.-Japan military alliance is essential for pursuance of the U.S. East Asia policy concerning China and North Korea. \r\n Earlier, high-ranking officers of the U.S. military flew Japan and underscored the importance of military tie-up between the U.S. and Japan and the Japanese authorities hailed it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Why are the U.S. and the Japanese authorities clamouring for the strengthening of military alliance all of a sudden? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the \"security pact\" turned out to be a serious point at issue. The U.S. attempt to convert Japan, its junior, into a military power and use it in establishing its military domination over the East Asian region fell in line with Japan's intention to become a leader of the region with the backing of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. strategy for world domination is, in general, to blockade and collapse those independent countries disobedient to its domination and militarize its satellite countries to use them as a means of domination and interference. Typical of it is the U.S.-Japan relations, their military nexus in particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan, a war criminal state, was not allowed internationally to rearm itself after its defeat in the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But it has been rapidly rearmed under the \"Japan-U.S. security pact\" and U.S. \"care.\" and it has played the role of a \"shock brigade\" in implementing the U.S. strategy for domination over East Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities are now so actively welcoming the U.S. attempt in a bid to use the U.S. patronage and support as an opportunity for its \"second rearming\" to become a perfect military giant. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Never should it go unnoticed that Powell underscored the need to \"find a way of coping with north Korea's possible challenges,\" while clamouring for strengthened bilateral military tie-up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is little short of openly calling for defining the DPRK as the \"no. 1 enemy\" and isolating and stifling the DPRK with Japan as a \"shock brigade.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the purpose pursued by the U.S. and Japan in strengthening military nexus has become clear, the DPRK can not but take a strong measure for self-defence and surrounding countries are also compelled to take a corresponding countermeasure.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan urged to redress crimes \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 11 (KCNA) -- Japan is attempting to take the road of re-invasion, refusing to redress its past, an act that adds to its shocking crimes, says Rodong Sinmun today.\r\n The news analyst says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only Japan, one of the countries that committed crimes of aggression in the 20th century, still refuses to redress the past of aggression even in the 21st century, the past of aggression that should have been redressed in the 20th century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For Japan to make an apology and compensate for its crimes of aggression is an unavoidable legal and moral obligation and the urgent requirement of the era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese ruling quarters prompted by the ambition to restore the order of the imperial domination over colonies are openly pursuing the policy of re-invasion. That is the serious mistake in terms of policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The day when Japan becomes the \"leader\" of Asia will never come and the attempt to realise the ambition by force of arms will lead Japan to irrevocable self-destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The way out for Japan to live in comfort is to redress its past crimes, get confidence from its neighboring countries and live in harmony with them and not turn to war with the backing of a big country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In particular, Japan should redress at an early date its past crimes against Korea, the nearest neighboring country and victim of the worst scourge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK-Japan relations will never be improved without settling the issue of redress for the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's refusal to redress its crimes and persistent pursuance of hostile policy toward Korea will not be in favor of Japan.    \r\n\r\n"
