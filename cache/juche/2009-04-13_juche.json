In the course of this, he created a brilliant example of true comradeship.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Association for the Restoration of the Fatherland, the anti-Japanese national united front body, was founded in May, Juche 25 (1936) as the first of its kind in Korea in accordance with the President's profound magnanimity and idea on the great national unity to rally close all the people loving the nation as one, transcending the differences in idea, political opinion and religious belief, and the Korean revolution emerged victorious with the strength of unity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean people accomplished the cause of the national liberation through the positive nation-wide anti-Japanese national united front movement, and under the banner of the President's idea on united front after the liberation of the country, too, they built the Workers' Party of Korea as a popular party and wrought epoch-making miracles in the Fatherland Liberation War against the U.S. imperialists and the complex social revolutions of two stages.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe tradition of the single-minded unity created in the flames of the anti-Japanese struggle is brilliantly carried forward and the unity of the DPRK finds itself on a new higher phase as it has in its van General Secretary Kim Jong Il who is identical with the President in idea, leadership and virtues.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The whole Party has been imbued with the Songun idea, the entire army has shared the idea, will and destiny with the Supreme Commander and all the army and people have achieved the perfect identity in ideology and working method on the basis of the spirit of defending the leader with their very lives.
