D. Shabdolov, chairman of the Communist Party of Tajikistan, in his lecture titled \"Songun Idea-Invincible Weapon\" said Songun idea is an idea which Kim Jong Il propounded by developing in depth President Kim Il Sung's idea of attaching importance to arms in conformity with the conditions of the present times. Kim Jong Il's Songun idea makes it possible to triumphantly promote the cause of socialism by correct strategy and tactics, the chairman noted, adding: Songun idea is a strategic banner that should be constantly upheld by the parties hoping to build socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Wilfred Saens Vigo, chairman of the Peru National Association for the Juche Idea, in his lecture gave detailed accounts of Kim Jong Il's brief biography and Songun politics, and the part of national reunification in the joint New Year editorial. He said the Korean people are today achieving world-startling results in the building of a great prosperous powerful socialist nation, the nuclear standoff with the United States and the accomplishment of the cause of national reunification with superhuman will and tireless efforts despite unspeakable trials and difficulties, true to original Songun politics of Kim Jong Il. \r\n K. David Mafabi, director of the Political Department of the Secretariat of the Pan-African Movement, in his lecture titled \"Korean people trust Songun politics\" said the unique Songun politics pursued by Kim Jong Il, chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK, is drawing the attention of the international community for its extraordinary power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Korean socialism will make a long drive under the banner of Songun politics enjoying absolute support and trust of the people, he said.    \r\n\r\n"

Scores of such greenhouses were constructed by units of the Korean People's Army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Ministry of the People's Armed Forces rebuilt its greenhouse on an expansion basis in a peculiar style on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of leader Kim Jong Il's assumption of the supreme commandership of the KPA. It has been most successful in raising, propagating and displaying immortal Kimilsungia and Kimjongilia. Many pots of those flowers in full bloom will be contributed to the 8th Kimjongilia Festival. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Il Sung Higher Party School, the Ministry of People's Security, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the Ministry of Fisheries and many other ministries and national institutions have built modern greenhouses to bring into bloom the flowers going by the august names of the peerlessly great men. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kimilsungia-Kimjongilia greenhouses are also found at the Secret Camp on Mt. Paektu, in Kaesong, a city adjacent to the Military Demarcation Line and other areas where a brisk work is going on to widely propagate and display the flowers.    \r\n\r\n"

This is an anti-national, anti-reunification act of swimming against the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP is displaying feverish activities as a marionette executing the U.S. policy of dominating the Korean peninsula, banking on its threat of war and moves to stifle the north with the outcries for \"south Koreas-U.S. alliance\" without directing efforts to national cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP had better not waste time and money in the forthcoming election to dazzle the people.

It provides for \"right to criminal jurisdiction\" of the U.S. troops, \"use of land and facilities\", \"tax business,\" \"immigration control,\" etc. for the U.S. forces in south Korea, all of which are disgraceful, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the treacherous agreement took effect, nearly 40,000 cases of crimes of U.S. soldiers were reported until 1987. But the south Korean authorities exercised first-stage jurisdiction only in 234 cases of them. The SOFA is a slavery document of modern version as it codifies the relations between south Korea and the U.S. as extremely unequal one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today is the era of independence. It is an intolerable shame and tragedy of the nation that south Korea, still bound hand and foot by it, cannot utter a complaint to the U.S. and utterly unable to take any action against GIs' crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such aggressive and treacherous agreement, a left-over of the old era which hurts the self-respect of the nation, must be scrapped right away. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National dignity and sovereignty can be won and defended only through a united struggle of the nation. The present situation in which the U.S. is becoming all the more crazy in its arrogance and arbitrariness proves how it is judicious for all the compatriots at home and abroad to turn out in the showdown between the Korean nation and the United States under the banner of Korean nation-first spirit.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It said:\"It is good to have a variety of negotiating cards. It is the card to be used when north Korea deteriorates the situation and it may deal immeasurable economic and psychological blow at north Korea and it would use the card as a leverage at the six-way talks slated to open on Feb.25\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Government of the DPRK has explicitly stated more than once that it would consider any sanctions or blockade against it as a declaration of a war and take legitimate self-defence measures to cope with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our people will never overlook Japan's revised \"law on foreign exchange.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should know well that its persistent pursuance of the hostile policy towards the DPRK at a time when the situation remains tense on the Korean peninsula due to the nuclear issue will seriously affect peace and security not only in its own country but in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK-Japan Friendship Association requests the Government of the DPRK not to have any bilateral contact with Japan nor allow Japan to participate in the six-way talks as it is doggedly pursuing its hostile policy towards the DPRK despite its sincerity and magnanimity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan will be wholly accountable for all the consequences to be entailed by its reckless behaviour.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Why? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Iraqi war, the United States started allegedly to \"defend liberty\", has been viewed in the international community as a war of aggression and plunder and public criticism of the war is growing stronger in the United States. Under this situation, the Bush administration is desperately trying to dull the criticism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to unleash the Iraqi war, Bush cited the reason that Iraq was threatening the international community by developing weapons of mass destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the former chief of the U.S.-led searching team of mass destruction weapon in Iraq, Key, told Reuters on January 23 that the Bush administration's intelligence was entirely false. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe Bush administration unilaterally ignited the Iraqi war for the purpose of monopolizing Iraq's oil and placing the Middle East under its domination. With the purpose brought into bold relief, the U.S. intelligence bodies have spread a rumor that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction had been spirited to Syria. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Syria categorically refuted the rumor and other nations criticized the United States for its lies and plots. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With the situation getting worse, Rice and other U.S. high-ranking officials held press conferences one after another in a bid to prove the \"justness\" of the invasion of Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On January 20, Bush in a \"state address\" described the invasion as his political success, alleging that the United States had brought freedom to Iraq and that the world had become safer. Even U.S. media, however, branded his address as base propaganda aimed to improve his image before the next presidential election. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. Democrats accused Bush of beautifying the unilateral and extreme war of aggression, saying \"it is Bush that should be dismissed from his job before anyone else in the United States\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is why the Bush administration could not but ask help from the United Nations and the international community, which it disregarded in starting the Iraqi war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration should know clearly that with no amount of misinformation and plot, can it veil its true colors as aggressor and plunderer.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
