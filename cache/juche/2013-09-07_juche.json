Korea \r\n Pyongyang, September 7 (KCNA) -- These days the south Korean conservative group is kicking up a whirlwind of campaign for arresting pro-reunification progressive forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t The fascist group including the \"Saenuri Party\", the puppet Intelligence Service and prosecution has become frantic with the campaign for suppressing the Unified Progressive Party and other progressive forces, under the pretexts of plotted rebellion and investigation into \"forces seeking to bring down the social system\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is more intolerable is that they crack down upon those forces by deliberately linking them to the north. This is reminiscent of the repressive campaign under the pretext of security in the period of military fascist dictatorship. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This campaign kicked off by the group with \"the security law\" and the Intelligence Service, means for escalating confrontation and pursuing dictatorial politics, cannot be construed otherwise than a horrible politically-motivated gambling aimed to weather its crisis. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a new politically-motivated plot to intensify fascist dictatorship and spoil the atmosphere of the north-south dialogue as it is a modern brand witch hunt launched by those tight-cornered. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already known to the world, it is the trite method employed by the preceding dictators of south Korea to cook up shocking political cases to get rid of their crises. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whenever south Korea found itself in a political crisis its ruling quarters fabricated conspiratorial cases stunning the international community including the case of Kim Dae Jung's plotted rebellion in the period of the military dictatorship. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But, all the plots to bury opposition forces politically and physically faced judgment of history without exception, sending the dictators to their graves. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recently cooked up case will be no exception. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent disclosure of the truth behind the Intelligent Service's illegal interference in the election drove the present authorities of south Korea into a bottomless quagmire. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Popular actions are gaining in scope and strength under the slogans \"Election is invalid\", \"Dissolve IS\" and \"No revival of yusin dictatorship.\" And there are growing voices calling for improving the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The political landscape in south Korea has been completely paralyzed due to the strong protest actions of the people including opposition forces to disclose the farce of the \"Saenuri Party\" and the IS. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The public has become more vocal pushing for momentum to north-south dialogue and cooperation as the atmosphere of dialogue mounted thanks to the north's strong will and efforts to achieve peace and actions have been grew stronger to call for early restarting the operation in the Kaesong Industrial Zone. These developments cannot but be a challenge to the confrontation forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The daily growing anti-\"government\" tendency prompted the conservative group to create a new terror-ridden atmosphere under the pretext of security in a bid to settle its crisis. To this end it kicked up a repressive campaign by invoking the SL and setting the IS in motion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through the on-going  suppression racket the fascist group seeks to stamp out political opponents including the pro-reunification progressive forces one by one and secure a pretext for maintaining  the SL and the IS which it considers as means for their existence and last strongpoint. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It also seeks to secure a pretext for shifting the blame for the deteriorated north-south relations and the tension onto the north if necessary.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean conservative group had better bear in mind that all Koreans and the world community are closely following the north's sincere efforts for detente on the Korean Peninsula and in the region and watching with vigilance its acts to scuttle them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No anachronistic plots and methods of the group can ever weather the present political crisis in south Korea, a product of confrontation and dictatorial politics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Will for national reconciliation, unity, peace and prosperity and practical actions are the best way of settling the south Korean political crisis. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative group's act of forgetting the lesson taught by history will only precipitate its doom."

Korea\r\n Pyongyang, September 7 (KCNA) -- 68 years have passed since the U.S. occupied south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. occupation of south Korea became the starting point of the tragic division of the Korean nation, a nation that has lived as a homogenous nation sharing the same blood for centuries. This has dampened the desire and wishes of the nation for the unified development.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To look around the world, no country and the nation has been exposed to such big misfortune and sufferings with its unified development curbed by the foreign occupiers for such a long time as the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. forces presence in south Korea turned the Korean Peninsula into the world's biggest hotspot and posed grave threats to the world peace and stability, to say nothing of those in Northeast Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This notwithstanding, the U.S. misleads the public opinion as if the \"UN Command\" and the U.S. forces' presence in south Korea are essential for the peace and security on the Korean Peninsula although 38 years have passed since the adoption of the UN General Assembly resolution on withdrawing all the foreign forces from the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The former U.S. forces' commanders in south Korea blustered that the \"UN Command\" now plays a buffer role and that it has played a big role in keeping the stability and peace on the Korean Peninsula along with the U.S.-south Korea \"Combined Command\" and the U.S. forces present in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is brigandish sophism aimed to cover up the U.S. crime as the chieftain who harassed peace and stability on the peninsula, and to seek the U.S. forces' permanent presence in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. forces' presence in south Korea was a crime committed by the U.S. by abusing its position as a state which won a victory in the Second World War. It was not at the request of the Korean nation nor according to an international convention.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. forces' presence in south Korea was a production of the U.S. aggressive ambition to separate Korea, occupy whole of Korea and, furthermore, dominate Asia and the rest of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. occupation of south Korea by force was not aimed to \"protect\" civilians nor to ensure peace on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. forces in south Korea going under the guise of \"UN Command\" is to blame for the serious situation on the Korean Peninsula which is at the crossroads of war or peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. seeks to keep its forces in south Korea for an indefinite period. According to the new national defence strategy envisaging the arms beef-up in Asia-Pacific region, the U.S. is claiming that its role is not just for \"protection\" but for the \"maintenance of regional peace\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. forces in south Korea is taking up new nature and role as the forces in the foremost area and \"strategic mobile forces\" for realizing the U.S. strategy for containing China and Russia and holding military hegemony in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to enhance the maneuverability and offensive capabilities of the U.S. forces in south Korea, the U.S. has steadily increased the frequency and scope of the military exercises under various codenames on the pretexts of coping with so-called \"provocations\" and \"nuclear threats\", pushing the situation to the state of war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. forces in south Korea are a detached force and an advance unit for the invasion of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. intention is to use its forces in south Korea as an offensive forces on the first line in case of \"emergency\" on the peninsula and rapidly hurl its aggression troops in the Asia-Pacific region including those in Japan and on Okinawa into the Korean front so as to fight a blitz warfare.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to the \"2012 base structure report\" published by the U.S. Defense Department, the U.S. has 11 000 more troops in south Korea now, compared with that in September 2009.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Defying this fact, the U.S. is claiming that its forces in south Korea is aimed at peace and stability on the peninsula and the region but this can convince no one.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ruling mode in colonies has become an anachronistic one, today when all the countries and nations have opted for the road of independent progress.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Still running deep in the memories of the Koreans are grudge and hatred for the U.S. occupation forces who have inflicted the whole gamut of misfortune and pains on the Koreans, putting south Korea under their control for so many years.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the requirements of the times and the people aspiring after lasting peace and prosperity on the peninsula and the rest of the Northeast Asia to see the withdrawal of the U.S. forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whether the U.S. withdraws its forces from south Korea or not is a touchstone showing whether it truly wants peace and stability on the peninsula or not.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. is truly interested in peace and stability on the peninsula, it should take a bold decision of pulling its troops, the biggest hurdle in way of achieving peace, out of south Korea."

            "content": "ACNC comenta juego politico del Sur de Corea\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, 7 de septiembre (ACNC) -- En estos dias, la banda de conservadores surcoreanos desata la ola de arresto a las fuerzas progresistas por la reunificacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t El \"Partido Saenuri\", el Servicio Nacional de Inteligencia, la fiscalia y otras hordas fascistas reprimen con frenesi a las fuerzas progresistas incluyendo el Partido Progresista Unido acusandolas del caso de conspiracion para una rebelion y hablando de la investigacion sobre \"las fuerzas para derribar el regimen\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lo problematico es que lo hacen relacionandolo  tercamente con la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La presente represion hace recordar la epoca de dictadura fascista militar. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El presente incidente siendo la caza de bruja de version moderna deviene una nueva artimana politica de los arrinconados tendente a intensificar la dictadura fascista y  congelar el ambiente de dialogo entre el Norte y el Sur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Como es conocido por todo el mundo, la invencion del sorprendente caso intrigante politico es el metodo predilecto de los dictadores surcoreanos para evitar sus crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Cuando se creaba en el territorio surcoreano la crisis politica ocurrieron los casos intrigantes que consternaban la sociedad internacional, entre otros, el caso de arresto de Kim Dae Jung.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pero, tales casos para enterrar politica y fisicamente a los opositores fueron sentenciados por la historia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ahora, las autoridades surcoreanas estan en aprietos una vez que fue descubierto el verdadero aspecto del caso de la ilegal intervencion del Servicio Nacional de Inteligencia en las elecciones presidenciales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Se amplia rapidamente la lucha masiva bajo las consignas \"invalidez del resultado de las elecciones\", \"Disolver el SIN\" y \"Oposicion a resucitacion de la dictadura de renovacion\" y se aumenta la voz de demanda a la mejora de las relaciones intercoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Por la fuerte resistencia de las fuerzas de partidos opositores y distintos estratos para descubrir el complot del \"Partido Saenuri\" y el SNI, la situacion del pais esta totalmente paralizada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Para las fuerzas conflictivas es una carga el hecho de que se eleva el clima de dialogo gracias a la voluntad y los esfuerzos de la RPDC por la paz y la opinion publica demanda activar el dialogo y las cooperaciones entre el Norte y el Sur de Corea inclusive la reanudacion previa de la Zona Industrial de Kaesong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ante el cada dia mas furioso clima anti-\"gubernamental\" la banda conservadora necesita movilizar las fuerzas publicas para salvar la situacion, asi que levanto una ola de represion en virtud de la \"ley de seguridad\" e incitando al SNI.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A traves del presente caso la banda fascista intenta coger dos pajaros de un tiro, o sea  persigue eliminar una tras otra las fuerzas politicas de oposicion inclusive las fuerzas progresistas pro-reunificacion, en tanto trata de mantener la ley de seguridad y el SNI, medios de existencia y el sosten final de las fuerzas conversadoras.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En el caso necesario, intenta preparar de antemano el pretexto para imputar a la RPDC la responsabilidad del empeoramiento de las relaciones intercoreanas y exacerbacion de la situacion de la region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A decir verdad, esto es un peligrosisimo juego politico y provocacion imperdonable contra el clima de la paz y el dialogo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La banda conservadora del Sur de Corea debe tener presente que toda la nacion coreana y la sociedad internacional observan atentamente tanto los sinceros esfuerzos de la RPDC por el alivio de la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana y la region y sus resultados como los actos que contravienen a este ambiente favorable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Con este aparato y metodo anacronicos no se puede salvar la actual crisis politica del Sur de Corea creada por la confrontacion y la politica dictatorial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Solo la reconciliacion y la unidad nacional, la voluntad de la paz y prosperidad y las acciones practicas son el remedio mejor para salvar la actual politica del Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La accion que olvida las lecciones de la historia acelerara la autodestruccion."
