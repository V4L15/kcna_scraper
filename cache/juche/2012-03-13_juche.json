Korea's Racket of \"North Korean Defectors\"\r\n Pyongyang, March 13 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK gave the following answer to a question raised by KCNA Tuesday as regards the row of \"north Korean defectors\" kicked up by the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors:\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group is now busying itself referring what it called the \"defectors\" issue even to the international arena including the UN Security Council in its foolish bid to internationalize national showdown.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The enemies abducted citizens of the DPRK who traveled to neighboring countries for their personal reasons or crossed the border for economic reasons. Calling them \"evacuees\" who \"defected from the north\" for a political reason, the group carried out psychological campaign against the DPRK only to be forsaken by history for its sordid nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group, which plunged the north-south ties to complete deadlock by pursuing unprecedented confrontation policy, and screwed up the tensions on the Korean Peninsula to the extremes, has again kicked up the worn-out racket of \"defectors to the south\" to divert strong public curse and denunciation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the \"contingency\" and \"instability\" much touted by it proved futile in the face of the firm resolve of the DPRK army and people dynamically advancing toward the bright future, united behind their leader in single mind, the group has made last-ditch efforts just like a drowning man catching at a straw.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through the racket of \"north Korean defectors\", the group of traitors seeks to fault even its master as well as the neighboring countries, curb the atmosphere for friendship, cooperation, dialogue and improvement of relations from being created on the Korean Peninsula and the region, and make the evil cycle of confrontation and conflicts repeat.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts prove that the DPRK was quite just when it drew a final conclusion that it would be impossible to mend the north-south ties, to say nothing of ensuring peace and stability on the Peninsula and the region as long as the Lee group is left intact.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group's desperate racket can catch no one's interest as Lee is more dead than alive."
