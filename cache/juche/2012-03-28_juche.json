But he sympathized with the anti-DPRK policy of hostile forces including the U.S. and Japan. This is, from every angle, an act of besmirching the face of the UN whose life and soul is impartiality. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is that he asserted the DPRK's satellite launch is a violation of the UNSC \"resolution.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t UNSC \"resolution 1874\" is a product of a despicable plot hatched as a result of the illegal high-handed action of the U.S. which denied the legitimate right of the sovereign DPRK to launch satellites and the UNSC which followed it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This lacks any ground in view of international law and is based on enmity, inveterate rejection of a country having a social system different from theirs and high-handed and arrogant thought that a small country must obey a big power. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He must know this and if he is not aware of this, his qualifications are doubtful. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Had the DPRK done as claimed by him, it would have never been able to get any chance to exercise the right to launch a satellite and use space though other countries are free to do so. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Precisely for this reason the DPRK categorically rejected the UNSC \"resolutions\" after the UNSC adopted them in wanton violation of the sovereignty of the DPRK in the past. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The anti-DPRK \"resolutions\", which the U.S. and other hostile forces use as cards for pressurizing the DPRK, were adopted at the UN in violation of international law. Ban Ki-moon is also to blame for them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was the application of double standards in the development and use of space that the UN adopted a \"resolution\" over the issue of the DPRK's satellite launch. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Many countries of the world have put different kinds of satellites into space since mankind embarked upon the road of conquering space. But none of them was criticized at the UN. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For example, the U.S., which is terming the DPRK's projected satellite launch a \"grave provocation,\" put all kinds of satellites including military ones into space, threatening peace and security of the world. But none of them was brought up for discussion. The same can be said of satellite launches by Japan, south Korea and other allies of the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the UN secretary general is to properly perform his mission and role, he is required, above all, to take an impartial approach and accurately confirm, to begin with, what is true, instead of taking a biased attitude, listening to one side's assertion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's launch of working satellite is an exercise of independent and legitimate right in line with the universally accepted international law on the peaceful use of space including the Outer Space Treaty reflecting the unanimous will of the international community which stands higher than the UNSC resolution. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will as ever never allow any action to infringe upon its dignity and sovereignty in the international arena."
