This was sufficient enough for it to understand the matter. But Tokyo failed to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such being the case, Japan is still persisting in the \"suspected abduction\" issue and now peddling it to European countries. It is dirty and foolish of Japan to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, Japan is very annoyed at the opening of diplomatic ties between the DPRK and EU and the relations of friendship and cooperation developing between the DPRK and European countries. It must be perplexed and disgraceful because as a geographically closest country, it stood before other nations in having negotiations with the DPRK for improved relations but it is now lagging behind others. It is entirely to blame for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan can get nothing from its peddling such issue, which will only further cool down the DPRK-Japan relations.     \r\n\r\n"

Accordingly, the U.S. imperialists had neither time nor ability to set foot in any part of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That was why they imminently had a confab to occupy any region of Korea, ordered by U.S. President Truman. At the confab the U.S. troops were unilaterally entrusted to disarm the Japanese army in the area south of the 38th parallel of north latitude.      And the written proposal was unilaterally communicated to other allied powers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On this basis the U.S imperialists landed in South Korea on September 8, nearly one month after the defeat of the Japanese imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists renamed the Korean government-general of the Japanese imperialists the \"U.S. military government\" and enforced a \"military rule\" in South Korea. Under the U.S. \"military government\" the people's committees organized on the initiative of the people were forcibly dissolved and transport and communications between the north and south were cut by the boundary of the 38th parallel. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They illegally brought the Korean issue to the U.N. and forced a \"separate election\" upon South Korea to set up a pro-American \"separate government\" there under the signboard of the U.N. and divide Korea artificially.    \r\n\r\n"

The tomb is believed to belong to the period of Koguryo.\r\n This is named \"Tomb No.3 in Thaesong-ri\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tomb is a typical tomb built with stone and covered with earth belonging to the period of Koguryo (277 B.C.- 668 A.D.) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tomb is square at its bottom and round from it to its top. One side of its bottom is 32 m long. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An entrance to the tomb is on its south side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tomb divided into several rooms covers 38.68 square meters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Walls of a room where there is an entrance are made up of layers of plain rocks that are plastered several times while those of other rooms are made up of huge granite. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Murals are painted on the right and left walls of the first room, on its ceiling and on stone walls in other rooms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Foreign aggressors robbed the tomb of its valuables several times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their walls and ceilings were severely destroyed in particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a result, only an image of a person and patterns on the mural painting on the western wall of the first room remain slightly recognizable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unearthed in the tomb were gold ornaments, jewelry, bronze bracelet, glazed pottery and many pieces of pottery, coffin nails and other relics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to archeologists, structure, building materials and relics inside the tomb prove that it is a king-level tomb belonging to the period from early to the middle of the 4th century. \r\n The tomb is drawing a keen interest of historians.    \r\n\r\n"
