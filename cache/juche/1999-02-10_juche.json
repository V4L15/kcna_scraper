Definitude was almost decided by experience and expertness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   To overcome such defect, the researchers made much effort to systematize and prove the four constitutions medicine on a scientific and theoretical basis. Shape and size of tens of thousands of people's eyes, noses, mouths and ears and their physical structures and types were measured and analysed in a comprehensive way. And  a comparative study of constitutional character, mental faculty, difference and feature was made, with the result that they found out indices by which to classify the human constitution on a scientific basis and manufactured modern equipment for diagnosis based on constitutional types.\r\n   New Koryo medicines were also produced after their function and effect on different constitutional types were verified by advanced means of functional checkup.\r\n   They are now giving rapid and right constitutional diagnosis and prescription with the help of latest computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In particular, their measurement of mental state and psychology such as character, feeling, intelligence and volition,  judgement of function of the internal organs and classification of characteristics of hereditary constitution are well received by medical workers.\r\n   \"World people's interest and expectations for the four constitutions medicine are growing with each passing day,\" Dr. Kwon Yong Jae, director of the institute, said, adding:\r\n   \"This curious medical art will be completed in near future to greatly contribute to the promotion of people's health.\" \r\n\r\n   \r\n"

            "content": "Anti-north intrigues will lead to self-destruction\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 10 (KCNA) -- The South Korean Intelligence Service which was called \"Agency for National Security Planning\" (ANSP) before has at last revealed its despicable nature as the headquarters of anti-communist, anti-north intrigues.\r\n   On February 7, it let radio No. 1 broadcast a very provocative and preposterous report that the north is \"operating a mobile strike force to put down a military coup .\"\r\n   This false report is not worth consideration. However, it is unpardonable that the Intelligence Service orchestrated such a preposterous campaign in a bid to impair the high dignity of our revolutionary armed forces.\r\n   Our People's Army the whole of which is replete with the spirit of devoted defence of the leader is a sacred revolutionary army which defends the socialist homeland and people, its idea and ideal with rifles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As was shown by the \"May 16 military coup\" and the \"December 12 army purge coup\" in South Korea, a military coup can occur only among herbs of undisciplined soldiers such as the South Korean army, the colonial mercenary of the U.S.\r\n   In South Korea in the grip of a serious political and economic crisis, dogfights between the ruling and opposition parties are getting fierce day by day and stories about possible military coups are being told almost every day.\r\n   No sooner had  \"ANSP\" was renamed \"Intelligence Service\" than it slandered even our revolutionary armed forces which the former \"ANSP\" dared not do.\r\n   We cannot remain a passive onlooker to this. \r\n   This false propaganda far surpasses that of the former \"ANSP\" in its intensity and nature of provocation.\r\n   This shows that the anti-communist, anti-north and anti-national character of the Intelligence Service has become more vicious than at the time of the former \"ANSP.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At the same time, this clearly proves that if national reconciliation and unity are to be achieved, it is imperative to dissolve the intelligence and trick-plotting institution.\r\n   It is all the more serious that such an outrageous anti-north smear campaign was launched soon after a joint meeting of the government, political parties and organisations of the DPRK held on February 3  set this year as a year of national independence and great unity and adopted an important proposal to open up a new phase in national reunification.\r\n   The Intelligence Service took its first step toward an abyss of self-destruction.\r\n   Our revolutionary armed forces will never pardon the smear campaign of the  Intelligence Service which behaves like a puppy knowing no fear of the tiger but force it to drink a bitter cup. \r\n\r\n  \r\n"
