It is unimaginable that the tax is spent for the munitions capital of the U.S., not for independence and peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. insists on its hostile policy toward the north and policy for domination over the Korean peninsula in defiance of the demand of all the Koreans for independence and peace, the anti-U.S. struggle will be further intensified, the statement warned.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Therefore, the Koreans regard their system and regime as their life and soul and are ready to defend them at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. will never be able to understand the system and political regime in the DPRK as long as it insists on its wrong view on value and biased standards concerning human rights and democracy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is that such behavior of the U.S. is little short of upsetting the common understanding reached by the countries concerned at the last six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The basic spirit of the joint statement of the talks is mutual respect and peaceful co-existence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The pressure campaign launched by the U.S. under the groundless pretexts of \"human rights abuse\" and \"illegal trafficking\" defying this spirit is little short of annulling the statement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such practice on the part of the U.S. on the eve of the 5th six-party talks self-proves that its hostile policy toward the DPRK and its ambition to stifle it remain unchanged and this has become pronounced with the passage of time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. escalated moves to pressurize the DPRK would only push the showdown between the DPRK and the U.S. to an extreme pitch of tension and hamstring the process for denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had better understand the serious consequences to be entailed by its breach of the spirit of the joint statement and behave itself.    \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
