This only self-exposes that Hangichong is a phony religious body kowtowing to the regime, indifferent to the north-south relations and the destiny of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hangichong must stop its shameful act of joining in the above-despicable psychological warfare of the regime and halt at once the building of the Aegibong Light Tower and cancel the above-said ceremony.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If it presses ahead with the building of the light tower and the ceremony at any cost in defiance of strong opposition of all Koreans in the north and the south and overseas, it will be held wholly responsible for the ensuing consequences.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All religious bodies and religionists in south Korea should decisively check and frustrate the above-said moves which will escalate the confrontation and bring only disaster to the nation."
