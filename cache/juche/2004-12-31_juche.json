            "content": "U.S. Plan to Deploy New Type Missiles in S. Korea Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 30 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Korean National Peace Committee issued a statement Thursday denouncing the Bush administration for having recently worked out a criminal plan to deploy new type missiles Bunker Burst in south Korea next year in a bid to destroy underground facilities in the DPRK.\r\n The plan discloses once again the U.S. criminal attempt to strike underground military facilities in the DPRK through preemptive attack, neutralize its war deterrent force and materialize with ease its scenario for a war of aggression against the DPRK, the statement says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Already in July last the U.S. announced that it succeeded in developing new type missiles warhead capable of destroying underground facilities with bigger penetrating capability than that of the existing ones. It disclosed that it would deploy 6 missiles in U.S. forces bases in south Korea and contemplate their additional deployment depending on the judgement to be made by the U.S. Forces Command in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has so far openly cried out that it would seek a peaceful and diplomatic solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula within the framework of the six-party talks and that it does not pursue a regime change in the north and has no willingness to attack it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the reality irrefutably proves that the peaceful solution to the nuclear issue and the resumption of the six-party talks much touted by the U.S. were nothing but a charade to conceal its attempt at aggression of the DPRK. This indicates how desperately the Bush administration is working to contain the DPRK by force, while paying lip-service to the \"peaceful solution\" to the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has massively deployed in and around south Korea weapons of mass destruction including up-to-date military hardware which it tested in the Afghan and Iraqi wars in a bid to put into practice its anti-DPRK war scenarios such as \"OPLAN 5030\" and \"OPLAN 5027-04.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. intention to deploy the above-said missiles in south Korea after the introduction of PAC-3 in Kwangju of south Korea has pushed the situation on the Korean Peninsula to an extremely grave phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If a war is started by the U.S. on the Korean Peninsula it will be hard for the Koreans in the north and the south to survive its disaster. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nothing is more foolish than expecting peace from those hell-bent on aggression and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will increase its war deterrent force, a shield for defending the nation and a treasured sword to champion peace, with redoubled efforts now that the U.S. only pursues a policy to stifle the DPRK, far from showing any willingness to co-exist with it.\r\n All the Koreans in the north and the south and abroad should turn out to foil the U.S. moves to introduce new type missiles and force the U.S. imperialists to pull back their aggression troops, the root cause of aggression and war, from south Korea through a nationwide anti-U.S. and anti-war struggle.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
