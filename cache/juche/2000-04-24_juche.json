The revolutionary army of Korea gave the Japanese imperialists the shivers everywhere with its unique tactics and eventually defeated them and liberated the country on august 15, Juche 34 (1945). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Soon after the liberation of Korea, it grew into the Korean People's Army with all arms and services in a short time.
