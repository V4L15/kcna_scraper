Absolute is the authority of Kim Il Sung representing and symbolizing our state and nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He liberated and defended the country, risking his life in the bloody struggle against the imperialists. His legendary feats are shining in the history of the anti-imperialist struggle. Embarking upon the road of the revolution in his teens, he declared the all-out confrontation with the imperialists, defeated the Japanese imperialists who tried to become a \"leader\" in Asia in his thirties and defeated the U.S. imperialists who boasted of being the \"strongest\" in the world in his forties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He did everything he could for the future of the country and happiness of all generations to come. He built in a far-sighted way the Workers' Party of Korea, the guiding force for the building of a rich and powerful country, consolidated the single-minded unity, the all-powerful treasured sword of the victory of revolution, and laid the foundation of the independent economy with which the Korean people can stand on their feet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the feat particularly noteworthy in national history that he brought up our revolutionary armed forces into a strong army in the world, giving priority to the arms in his early years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the world people are highly praising him as the eternal sun of Juche, symbol of justice and victory and lodestar of the movement for human emancipation irrespective of differences in idea, political view and national identity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our country which has recorded a heroic epic of proud victory under his guidance has greeted a new era in which it is building a great prosperous powerful nation under the leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He is now leading to victory the gigantic patriotic cause for the eternal prosperity of the socialist country, the largest heritage of the President, holding high the banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our country which was liberated and built by the President is unswervingly advancing along the road of independence under the Songun revolutionary leadership of Kim Jong Il, demonstrating its might as a strong country of single-minded unity and dynamically moving ahead to attain a high goal of building a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is thanks to Kim Jong Il that there is socialist Korea replete with the idea and august name of the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Party members, servicepersons and people should more dynamically push ahead with the general march for the Songun revolution to exalt the glorious history and feats of the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson calls for holding him in high esteem as the sun of Juche for all ages.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
