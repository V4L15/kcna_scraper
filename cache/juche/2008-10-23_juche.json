This cannot be construed otherwise than a desperate bid of those bereft of reason.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already reported, the U.S. recently announced a decision to cross the DPRK off the list of \"state sponsors of terrorism\". Japan, however, very much displeased with it, is trying hard to disturb the process for the settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To make everything clear as regards the \"abduction issue\" so much touted by Japan, the DPRK has so far made every possible effort for its settlement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the Shenyang talks in August it was agreed to take specific actions to settle the inglorious past and the pending issues between the DPRK and Japan. Both sides confirmed the plan to conduct reinvestigation into the \"abduction issue\" on the basis of the agreement and detailed matters including its modality, methods and period.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe \"abduction issue\" much touted by Japan does not stand comparison with such crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists against humanity in the past as the forcible drafting of more than 8.4 million Koreans, massacre of more than one million Koreans and forcing 200,000 Korean women into sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army, the crimes it has left unsettled. That is why the world considers the measure taken by the DPRK as a magnanimous bold decision made out of broad perspective.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan, however, has responded to the DPRK's sincerity with systematic perfidy and is only doing something obstructive to the settlement of issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a matter of fact, Japan has never cooperated with the DPRK in the settlement of the \"abduction issue\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has always broken its promises. To cite just a few examples, it refused to send back those who had gone to Japan to visit home quite contrary to its earlier promise and escalated sanctions against the DPRK although it promised to lift part of them. It even savagely cracked down upon Koreans in Japan, reneging on its promise to protect their rights. Japan responded to the DPRK's repeated magnanimous steps by whipping up the bitterness toward the DPRK and chauvinism against Koreans and escalating the sanctions against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's attitude remained unchanged even after the Shenyang talks. In a bid to convince the world that the talks handled the \"abduction issue\" only Japan hyped the agreed point concerning the \"abduction issue\" only among several points agreed while ignoring or downplaying other issues for the purpose of fanning up hostility toward the DPRK, when conveying their accounts. It thus craftily evaded the obligation to take practical measures for creating atmosphere favorable to the improvement of the bilateral relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The course in which the \"abduction issue\" was discussed and handled between the DPRK and Japan helps the former clearly understand that political forces in Japan have used the issue as a mere lever for meeting such sinister purposes as stay in power or seizure of power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What merits attention is that after its emergence in Japan the Aso regime only staged a charade to give impression that it respects the agreement reached between the DPRK and Japan during the Fukuda regime and, in fact, it has stuck to the hostile policy pursued by the Abe Cabinet towards the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's refusal to abide by the principle of \"action for action\" while linking the \"abduction issue\" with the six-party talks is aimed to scuttle the talks and justify its hostile moves toward the DPRK and its serious human rights abuses against Koreans in Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is as clear as noonday that if Japan is allowed to participate in the talks it would create only complexities in their way as it lets loose sheer sophism that the process of the denuclearization should not be allowed to make any progress unless the \"abduction issue\" is settled while standing in the way of its settlement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is compelled to raise a question as to whether there is any need to have the six-party talks attended by Japan as it is challenging the agreement reached at the talks. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan had better drop its foolish attempt to use the talks aimed at the denuclearization as a platform for achieving the aim sought by it through the \"abduction issue,\" cogitating about the consequences to be entailed by its mean behavior."

            "content": "Japan Accused of Disturbing Six-Party Talks\r\nPyongyang, October 22 (KCNA) -- Recently Japan dastardly decided to extend its sanctions against the DPRK for another six months. It is now behaving so shamelessly as to insist that it would not fulfil its commitment to make economic compensation on which an agreement was reached among the six parties unless progress is made in the solution of the \"abduction issue\". This demeanor of Japan comes under fire by a signed commentary of Rodong Sinmun Wednesday. \n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's dastardly behavior is nothing but a silly fuss made by the above-said disturber of the six-party talks ostracized there, the commentary notes, and goes on: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said talks are not a platform for discussing the \"abduction issue\" but are aimed at finding a solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan has so far persistently raised the \"abduction issue\" at the talks, the issue which has nothing to do with the discussion of the agenda of the talks, creating complexities and obstacles in their way. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan has never tried to implement the issues discussed and agreed upon by the six parties under the pretence of solving the \"abduction issue\" and conducted hectic diplomacy to persuade the U.S. not to cross the DPRK off the list of \"state sponsors of terrorism.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan was disgruntled and displeased with the U.S. measure to delist the DPRK as \"a state sponsor of terrorism\".  This is little short of putting a brake on the implementation of the Oct. 3 agreement and standing up against the above-said talks. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is useless and an act of wasting time to try to discuss and solve pending issues with such state as Japan which reneges on everything,  changing its attitude and going this or that way whenever a regime changes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey are misleading the public opinion by creating impression that there is no progress in the settlement of the pending issues between the DPRK and Japan due to the lack of sincerity on the part of the former. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan's claim that the above-said measure taken by the U.S. is a sort of \"concession\" and \"betrayal\" is little short of tarnishing its image itself. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's attempt to use the six-party talks as a platform for realizing its selfish ambition is nothing but a behavior of a short-sighted political pigmy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To make economic compensation to the DPRK is the commitments the other five parties to the talks are obliged to fulfill under the Oct. 3 agreement. How to approach this agreement may advance the above-said talks or put them at a stalemate. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan's insistence that it will not participate in the above-said economic compensation means deliberately neglecting and disturbing the implementation of the Oct. 3 agreement. This is intended to torpedo the talks, in the final analysis. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is the ulterior intention of Japan to create hurdles and complexities in the way of the talks at any cost in a bid to block the solution of the issue and steadily strain the situation on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan had better come to its senses, though belatedly, and stop such foolish an act as lifting an axe to drop it on its own foot."

            "content": "ATCC comenta virulento proceder de Japon\r\nPyongyang, 22 de octubre (ATCC) -- Ultimamente, las acciones de Japon, que envenenan el ambiente de las conversaciones a 6 bandas, devienen uno de los topicos de la sociedad internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\tSo pretexto de que no fue resuelto el \"problema del secuestro\", Japon dio prorroga a las medidas de sancion contra la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea e insiste en que no puede ofrecer a ella la asistencia energetica acordada en las conversaciones a 6 bandas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl \"problema del secuestro\" es un asunto bilateral que fue abordado hasta ahora entre Corea y Japon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor lo tanto, no debe ser tratado por algun otro pais ni mucho menos en la cita a 6 partes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, Japon lo vincula con las conversaciones a 6 partes y niega la ejecucion de todos sus compromisos correspondientes al principio de \"accion vs. accion\", lo cual no es mas que una chapuceria de los que perdieron el juicio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun ya trascendidos, Estados Unidos anuncio recientemente que dejaria de definir a la RPDC como \"pais que apoya el terrorismo\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMuy disgustado de esto, Japon trata de estorbar a toda costa la solucion del problema nuclear de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA decir la verdad en cuanto al \"problema de secuestro\" de que acusa porfiadamente Japon a la RPDC, hasta la fecha, esta  hizo todo lo posible para resolverlo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn las conversaciones de Shenyang efectuadas en agosto, se logro un acuerdo de pasar a las acciones concretas para liquidar el desgraciado pasado y resolver los articulos pendientes entre Corea y Japon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA base de ese documento, se comprometieron a realizar la reinvestigacion del \"problema del secuestro\" y concordaron sus puntos detallados de ella como forma, metodos, plazo, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl mundo reconoce cuan magnanima y valiente es esta decision de la RPDC cuando se toma en cuenta que ese \"problema del secuestro\" no es nada en comparacion con los crimenes anti-eticos cometidos por los imperialistas japoneses en el siglo pasado, que todavia no fueron liquidados, tales como el arresto forzado de mas de 8 millones 400 mil coreanos, la matanza de mas de un millon, la conversion de 200 mil coreanas en las \"consoladoras sexuales\" de las tropas japonesas, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, Japon respondio con sus sistematicos actos traidores a la sinceridad de la RPDC y siempre hace cosas que obstaculizan la solucion del problema.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRealmente, no hay nada que Japon coopero con la RPDC para resolver el \"problema del secuestro\". Lo unico que hizo el pais isleno fue revocar siempre sus compromisos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRetuvo a las personas que habia prometido devolver, prolongo las medidas de sancion que habia jurado levantar aun en lo parcial y reprimio mas brutalmente los derechos humanos de los coreanos residentes en Japon lejos de protegerlos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMas generosidad de la RPDC produjo mas hostilidad anti-RPDC, mas xenofobia a los coreanos y mas medidas de sancion en Japon. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Despues de las conversaciones en Shenyang, las cosas no cambiaron.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Al dar enfasis al articulo del acuerdo sobre el \"problema del secuestro\" y menospreciar o restar los detalles de los demas articulos en direccion a inculcar la hostilidad a la RPDC, Japon engano a la opinion publica mundial como si la cita de Shenyang hubiera tratado solamente el \"problema del secuestro\" y evadio asi astutamente su deber de tomar medidas practicas para la creacion del ambiente a favor del mejoramiento de las relaciones bilaterales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA traves del proceso de discusion y manejo del \"problema del secuestro\" entre ambos paises, se conocio perfectamente que este tema no pasa de ser en Japon un aparato para alcanzar los malsanos objetivos como el mantenimiento y la conquista del poder de algunas fuerzas politicas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, el nuevo poder de Aso repite la brutal politica hostil a Corea del regimen de Abe actuando hipocritamente como si respetara el acuerdo alcanzado con la RPDC durante el mandato de Fukuda. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapon vincula el \"problema del secuestro\" con las conversaciones a 6 bandas y niega el cumplimiento del principio de \"accion vs. accion\" con el fin de llevar al fracaso las conversaciones y justificar sus maniobras hostiles a la RPDC y sus cruentas violaciones de DDHH de los coreanos residentes en su pais. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs indudable que seran complicadas las conversaciones a 6 bandas cuando participe este pais que obstaculiza la solucion del \"problema del secuestro\" insistiendo en la absurda y paradojica teoria de que no debe haber avances en el proceso de desnuclearizacion antes de que fuera resuelto este problema.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC se ve obligada a reflexionar de nuevo en la necesidad de la presencia de Japon en las conversaciones a 6 bandas dado que este pais isleno desafia lo acordado en la cita a 6 partes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapon debe reflexionar de las consecuencias que emanen de sus viles actos y abandonar tal intento absurdo de tomar la desnuclearizacion como rehen del \"problema del secuestro\"."

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun cuestiona presencia de Japon en conversaciones\r\nPyongyang, 22 de octubre (ATCC) -- En estos momentos Japon volvio a decidir la prolongacion de un semestre de las medidas de sancion contra la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea e insiste en que mientras no se ve algun avance en la solucion del problema del secuestro no cumplira su obligacion de compensacion economica, acordada en las conversaciones a 6 bandas. \n\t\t\t\t\tRevela asi el diario Rodong Sinmun en un comentario individual difundido en su edicion de este miercoles y continua: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa cita a 6 bandas no es para discutir el problema del secuestro, sino para resolver el problema nuclear de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, siempre que se sentaba a la mesa de de conversaciones Japon creo complicaciones y puso obstaculos recurriendo obstinadamente al problema del secuestro que no tiene nada que ver con la discusion del tema principal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSo pretexto del problema del secuestro, el pais isleno no cumplio nada de lo acordado en la cita a 6 bandas y se desespero tenazmente por persuadir a EE.UU. para que no tache a la RPDC de la lista de \"paises que apoyan el terrorismo\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapon esta disgustado con la eliminacion de la RPDC de la lista de \"paises que apoyan el terrorismo\", de modo que frena la ejecucion del acuerdo del 3 de Octubre y se opone a las conversaciones a 6 bandas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCada vez que se sustituye el poder estatal, este pais isleno cambia su posicion y deja lo todo que hacia. Pues, discutir y solucionar los problemas pendientes con este sera un malgasto de tiempo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapon conduce en error a la opinion publica como si no se alcanzara avance en la solucion de los asuntos pendientes Corea-Japon por falta de sinceridad de la primera. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCalifica la reciente medida de EE.UU. de una \"concesion\" y \"traicion\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs una tonteria de enano politico el proceder de Japon de aprovechar la cita a 6 bandas como una escena para realizar su ambicion egoista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa compensacion economica a la RPDC es la obligacion segun el acuerdo del 3 de octubre. El avance de las conversaciones a 6 bandas depende de la ejecucion de este acuerdo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa negacion de esta obligacion significa el impedimento abierto al acuerdo del 3 de Octubre  para  llevar al fracaso las conversaciones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa intencion de Japon es crear dificultad y complicaciones ante las negociaciones de 6 paises, frenar la solucion de los problemas y mantener de continuo la situacion tensa en la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAunque sea desde ahora, Japon debe abandonar los actos imprudentes."
