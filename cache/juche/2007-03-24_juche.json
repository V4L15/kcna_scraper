And they, at the same time, massively introduced there the latest war hardware to be used in the above-said war maneuvers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Timed to coincide with these moves, south Korean military ports are crowded with a U.S. landing craft with a U.S. marine expeditionary group aboard, a dock landing craft, a dock landing transport ship and \"Blue Ridge,\" a flag ship of the 7th Fleet of the U.S. imperialist forces of aggression, and vehicle transport ships. Meanwhile, the task force of nuclear-powered super- large carrier \"Ronald Reagan\" is busy with its maneuver in the waters off the southern coast of Pusan to create a war atmosphere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In another development, 12 \"F-22A\" (raptor) Stealth fighter-bombers and over 250 troops deployed in the air force base of the U.S. imperialist forces of aggression in Kadena, Okinawa, from the U.S. mainland in February are ready to participate in the war exercises and Guam-based B-52s are also ready to go into action.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In this spirit did they change the \"Arduous March\" into a cheerful march and open a broad avenue for the building of a great prosperous powerful nation, overcoming a thousand and one trials. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the greatest honor of the Korean people to vigorously push forward the revolution and construction generation after generation with a tight hold on the baton of the revolution, blessed with illustrious leaders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history of the continuity of the Korean revolution should be glorified through generations in single-mindedly upholding Kim Jong Il's Songun policy and devotedly defending the headquarters of the revolution.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

These war exercises will be expected to be of more provocative nature than any previous ones as main emphasis will be put on offensive exercises including landing, river-crossing and striking targets in the depth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. and south Korean bellicose forces stage such provocative large-scale joint military maneuvers, they will saliently reveal their hostility towards the DPRK and attempt to invade it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dialogue and war exercises can never go together. It is hard to expect any success at a dialogue under the situation where people are disturbed by gunfire during DPRK-targeted war maneuvers. This is clearly evidenced by what they experienced in the past. The projected reckless anti-DPRK joint military exercises would only result in disturbing the peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, driving again the inter-Korean relations to a crisis and fanning up the atmosphere of war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And he energetically pushed ahead with its preparation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Basing himself on the preparations, he formed the Korean National Association, an anti-Japanese underground revolutionary organization, in Pyongyang on March 23, Juche 6 (1917). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KNA was a secret organization with the aim of achieving national independence and establishing a truly civilized country through the concerted efforts of the Korean nation.  It was the largest anti-Japanese underground revolutionary organization of Korean patriots at home and abroad around the March First Popular Uprising. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With the formation of the KNA with the most transparent independent stand against imperialism the anti-Japanese national liberation movement in Korea came to have the pivotal organization to rally broad segments of the people with a correct purpose of struggle and a new phase was opened up for achieving the unity of the anti-Japanese revolutionary forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the guidance of Kim Hyong Jik the KNA waged various forms of struggle including the revolutionary armed activities and united broad sections of the people to vigorously arouse them to the anti-Japanese struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KNA made a great contribution to developing the anti-Japanese national liberation movement in Korea to a proletarian revolution from the nationalist movement and achieving the unity for the anti-Japanese independence movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The immortal exploits Kim Hyong Jik performed to make a history of national independence and unity at the dawn of the Korean revolution were carried forward by President Kim Il Sung and have been carried into a brilliant reality by Kim Jong Il who has the idea of loving the country, nation and people on the highest level.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

As a result, some of glacier and tundra have been melted away and the ice covering rivers and lakes reduced, thus causing a great danger to the eco-system in the areas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Therefore, it is very important for each country to exert more efforts for the research into the polar meteorology, which has a great effect on the Earth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The case is the same with our country badly hit by the global warming. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In recent years, the temperature rise in our country is two or three times the average temperature rise on the globe in the 20th century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It compels the institute to intensify the research into the polar areas in the field of the climate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The institute plans to observe the El Nino effect on the polar areas.  It is also going to observe the relations between the El Nino and the meteorological conditions in the Polar zones and the relations between the meteorological conditions of the polar areas and the formation and development of high atmospheric pressure in the Sea of Okhotsk this year as the high atmospheric pressure formed in the Sea of Okhotsk brought cold to the east coast of Korea in recent years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through the media the state is working hard to help the people have a good understanding of the influence of the global warming, reduction of ice acreage in the Arctic Regions and the hole of the ozone layer on the earth.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
