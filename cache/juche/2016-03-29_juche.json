            "content": "DPRK Foreign Minister Interviewed by TASS Foreign News Editor\r\nPyongyang, March 29 (KCNA) -- DPRK Foreign Minister Ri Su Yong gave the following answers to the questions put by the foreign news editor of TASS Tuesday as regards the DPRK's stand to cope with the situation prevailing on the Korean peninsula:\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. extremely hostile policy and nuclear threat to the DPRK have been the root cause of escalating tensions on the peninsula and compelling the latter to bolster up its nuclear deterrence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has posed a nuclear threat to the DPRK since long before the latter's access to nuclear weapons and adopted it as its policy to mount a preemptive nuclear attack and staged ceaseless nuclear war drills to put it into practice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It attempted to mount a nuclear attack on the DPRK already in the past Korean war. Since the 1950s, it has threatened and blackmailed the DPRK by shipping huge nuclear weapons into south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Bush administration listed the DPRK as \"part of the axis of evil\" and target of its preemptive nuclear attack. This policy remains unchanged till now.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is clearly evidenced by the fact that the Obama administration excluded the DPRK from the list of the countries for non-use of nuclear weapons in April, 2010 and declared a preemptive attack on the DPRK while staging joint military drills with huge nuclear strike means involved in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is now staging nuclear attack drills against the DPRK by amassing all its strategic nuclear strike means in south Korea and in its vicinity. No country in the world has been exposed to such serious and potential nuclear threat as what Pyongyang is now experiencing. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural for the DPRK to counter the U.S. nuclear weapons in kind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the U.S. has worked hard to stifle the DPRK with nuclear weapons, the latter was compelled to have access to nukes to protect the sovereignty and vital right of the nation to cope with it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is the arch criminal who pushed the DPRK to have access to nuclear weapons. The decades-long U.S. nuclear threat and blackmail have prompted the DPRK to do so.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The only way to cope with the constant nuclear threat and war provocations of the U.S., the world's only user of nuclear weapons and biggest nuclear weapons state, is to achieve the equilibrium of strength by bolstering up nuclear armed force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has tremendous military muscle capable of fighting any type of war desired by the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It opened to public real miniaturized and light nuclear warheads to be mounted on ballistic rockets and showed the capability of the atmospheric re-entry of inter-continental ballistic rocket.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will further strengthen the state defence capacity with the nuclear force as its pivot to cope with the reckless hostile moves of the U.S. and its undisguised nuclear threat.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the future, the development speed of the DPRK's nuclear force will depend on how the U.S. will behave and how its viewpoint on the former will change.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is now busy with madcap largest-ever Key Resolve and Foal Eagle 16 joint military maneuvers targeting the DPRK across south Korea despite its repeated warnings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The war rehearsals in which hundreds of thousands of armed forces and various nuclear strategic means are involved are now under way under the simulated conditions involving nuclear preemptive attack on the DPRK and \"beheading operation\" aiming at a the supreme headquarters and \"regime change,\" in particular.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. unhesitatingly declared that the joint military drills were aimed to finally examine the feasibility of a war of aggression against the north, thus completely discarding the deceptive and shameless cloak of \"annual and defensive ones\" though they have been billed outwardly so far.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation of the Korean peninsula is driven to the brink of war as the U.S. is making a preemptive attack an established fact while staging actual maneuvers under the simulated conditions of all kinds of surprise attack against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has become quite obvious that the DPRK can never remain a passive onlooker to the imminent U.S. threat of aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has shifted all the military counteraction modes to preemptive attack ones to cope with the U.S. nuclear war hysteria and declared the will to mount a decisive preemptive nuclear attack.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In a word, the Korean peninsula is standing at the crossroads of a thermonuclear war and peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The extremely tense situation prevailing on the Korean peninsula is something unprecedented and the whole world including your country is closely watching it with great concern and uneasiness.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to prevent the vicious cycle of ever-escalating tension on the peninsula, defuse the danger of war and ensure peace and security, one should not just watch phenomena in sight but properly judge their root cause and take measures for rooting out them, to begin with.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the countries desirous of peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and in the region should watch with vigilance the moves of the U.S. regarding the DPRK as its primary target of attack after shifting the strategic pivot for world domination to the Asia-Pacific region and make due efforts to prevent them."

A \"lawsuit meeting\" was set up to file a suit with local courts across Japan against unconstitutional legislation. Opposition parties' demand for the abolition of the legislation reflects the people's wishes to live in peace free from a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Despite such unanimous rebuff and denunciation of the public inside and outside Japan, Abe strongly chided the anti-war forces, asserting the justice of the \"legislation\" under the pretext of \"tightened Japan-U.S. alliance\". This clearly indicates what phase his wild ambition for militarism and hegemony has reached.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By origin, the \"legislation\" is a product of despicable collusion between the U.S. and Japan. The former is keen to carry out its strategy for dominating Asia and the rest of the world, using Japan as a shock force, and the latter is working hard to implement its scenario to invade other countries with the backing of the former.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Militarist Japan is mulling creating politico-military and legal conditions for launching overseas aggression any moment without any legal hurdles, pursuant to the U.S. scenario for dominating the world, and, on this basis, kicking off operation for reinvasion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is why the Japanese authorities are vociferating about full performance of the function of Japan-U.S. alliance, increase of deterrence and firmer guarantee for Japan's security by the force of the \"security legislation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan has built up its military muscle for overseas aggression under the patronage of the U.S. for the past several decades since its defeat. The \"Self-Defense Forces\", the second largest aggression forces after the U.S. forces in the West, are set to conduct military operations everywhere in the world and be deployed overseas any time under the pretext of assisting the U.S. troops, pursuant to the war law. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan has not yet shaken off the ill-fame as an enemy state after committing hideous crimes against humanity and war crimes though seven decades have passed since its defeat. Yet it is enforcing the \"security legislation\" while talking abut \"Japan's security\" and \"its contribution to global peace and stability\" with the backing of the U.S., chieftain of aggression. Its advocacy of such law is the height of impudence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"legislation\" is an inevitable product of the extremely conservative politics of the present chief executive who regards militarism as his political idea and philosophy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's moves for aggression threatening peace and security of mankind are an unpardonable war crime as it brought unspeakable misfortune and pain to the Korean and other Asian people in the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t War and peace can never go together. With no rhetoric can the Japanese authorities justify their militarism and war policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's justification of the \"legislation\" is undoubtedly an extremely dangerous act of jeopardizing global peace and security as well as the destiny of Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present Japanese chief executive had better behave prudently, well aware that Japan's reckless militarization and overseas aggression would bring destruction to it in the end."

The present situation requires all the party members and other working people to live and work in the Kunja-ri spirit created in the 1950s like the scientists and technicians of defence industry and workers in the field of munitions industry.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Kunja-ri revolutionary spirit created in the 1950s is the inheritance of the Yanji bomb spirit created in the forest of Mt. Paektu and the eternal mental wealth of Songun Korea. The core of the Kunja-ri spirit is to defend the leader, the motherland and the revolution and it is associated with self-reliance and fortitude. The Kunja-ri spirit left a distinguished mark on the history of the Korean revolution which performed heroic feats in the arduous annals. The Korean People's Army wrought the military miracle of winning the war victory on July 27, humbling the pride of the arrogant U.S. imperialists who boasted of being the \"strongest\" in the world and the DPRK demonstrated the indomitable spirit for building a socialist power independent in politics, self-supporting in the economy and self-reliant in defence on this land. All this would be unthinkable without the Kunja-ri spirit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The basic idea of our revolution can never change though the revolution has made a long stride forward and generations have been replaced by new ones and it is necessary to steadfastly carry forward the indomitable revolutionary spirit until the day of the final victory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The editorial calls upon all the people to proudly greet the Seventh Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea with the diary of the 70-day campaign recorded with the heroic struggle and brilliant feats  in the same spirit and with the same work style as the workers of Kunja-ri displayed, establishing the precious tradition of Songun Korea."

            "content": "Ri Su Yong da respuesta a jefe de redaccion de TASS\r\nPyongyang, 29 de marzo (ACNC) -- A la pregunta del director de redaccion de la agencia noticiera rusa TASS formulada en relacion con la posicion de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea frente a la situacion actual dada en la Peninsula Coreana el canciller coreano Ri Su Yong respondio el dia 29 como lo siguiente: \n\t\t\t\t\tLa extremada politica hostil y la amenaza nuclear de Estados Unidos contra la RPDC son origenes del empeoramiento de la situacion en la Peninsula Coreana y del fortalecimiento del disuasivo nuclear de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde hace mucho tiempo anterior a la posesion de las armas nucleares de la RPDC, Estados Unidos le dio a ella la incesante amenaza nuclear, fijo como su politica el ataque preventivo nuclear y ha venido desarrollando sin cesar los ejercicios de guerra nuclear destinados a ponerlo en practica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa, durante el periodo de la pasada guerra coreana, EE.UU. planteo el ataque nuclear contra la RPDC y desde la decada de 1950 le dio a esta la amenaza y el chantaje nucleares introduciendo la enorme cantidad de armas nucleares en el Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa Administracion de Bush definio a la RPDC como \"eje de mal\" y objeto de ataque preventivo nuclear que se perdura invariablemente hasta la fecha.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo comprueban evidentemente los hechos de que la Administracion de Obama excluyo en abril de 2010 la RPDC de la lista de los objetos de no uso de armas nucleares y que ahora habla abiertamente del ataque preventivo contra ella realizando en el territorio surcoreano los simulacros militares conjuntos en que se movilizan muchos armamentos de ataque nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. despliega los ejercicios de ataque nuclear contra la RPDC concentrando todos sus medios estrategicos de ataque nuclear en la region de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNingun pais de este planeta habria experimentado en ningun tiempo tal amenaza nuclear seria y real.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs muy natural la medida de enfrentarse con armas nucleares a EE.UU. que nos amenaza con los artefactos nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDado que el imperio norteamericano trato de aplastar con armas nucleares la RPDC, esta se vio obligada a tomar el camino de poseer los armamentos nucleares para defender su soberania y su derecho a existencia de la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. es precisamente el autor que nos empujo a la posesion de las armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY su incesante amenaza y chantaje nucleares que se perpetran casi cada dia durante varios decenios pasados, es tambien el motivo fundamental que convirtio la RPDC en la poseedora de armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLograr el equilibrio de la fuerza basado en el fortalecimiento de fuerzas armadas nucleares deviene el unico remedio para hacer frente a la duradera amenaza nuclear y las tentativas de provocacion de guerra de EE.UU., unico pais que uso las armas nucleares y poseedor de maxima cantidad de esos artefactos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tContamos con el fuerte poderio militar capaz de responder a cualquier modo de guerra deseado por EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDimos a la publicidad la ojiva nuclear real minimizada y aligerada a ser cargada en el cohete balistico y demostro tambien la capacidad de reentrada en el espacio atmosferico del cohete balistico intercontinental.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFrente a la imprudente hostilidad y abierta amenaza nuclear de EE.UU., intensificaremos mas la capacidad de defensa nacional basada en las fuerzas armadas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa velocidad de desarrollo de nuestras fuerzas armadas nucleares dependera de las acciones posteriores de EE.UU. y del cambio de su vista a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora el imperio yanqui libra con frenesi los ejercicios militares conjuntos Key Resolve y Foal Eagle 16 de mayor envergadura en la historia, contra la RPDC en todo el territorio surcoreano pese a nuestras advertencias reiteradas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos presentes ejercicios belicos con la movilizacion de cientos mil efectivos y bienes estrategicos nucleares de varios generos, se desarrollan a modo de cumplimiento de guerra real que persigue el ataque preventivo nuclear contra la RPDC y hasta la \"operacion de decapitacion\" apuntando a la Direccion Suprema y el \"derrumbe de regimen\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. dio a la publicidad que el simulacro es para examinar de manera definitiva la realidad de la guerra anti-RPDC y asi echo siquiera la pancarta enganosa y cinica con la cual lo justificaba hasta ahora como simulacro \"anual\" y \"defensivo\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPuesto que en el presente entrenamiento EE.UU. toma como hecho consumado el ataque preventivo suponiendo el golpe sorpresivo militar de todos tipos contra la RPDC, la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana esta a punto de estallar la guerra ahora mismo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs muy evidente que no podemos estar con brazos cruzados ante la amenaza agresiva de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFrente a la locura de guerra nuclear de EE.UU., hemos cambiado el modo de enfrentamiento militar del Ejercito Popular de Corea en el de ataque preventivo y declarado la rotunda voluntad de asestar el ataque preventivo nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn una palabra, la Peninsula Coreana se encuentra en un dilema: la guerra termonuclear o la paz.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la actualidad, la situacion creada en la Peninsula Coreana es extremadamente delicada y todo el mundo incluso Rusia, la observa con gran preocupacion e inquietud.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara frenar el circulo vicioso de agravacion de tension que se hace mas delicada en la Peninsula Coreana, eliminar la peligrosidad de guerra y garantizar la paz y seguridad, hay que ver no el fenomeno aparecido sino su causa raigal y tomar primero las medidas concernientes para extirparlo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los paises aspirantes a la paz y la estabilidad de la Peninsula Coreana y la region periferica deberan observar con alta vigilancia las maniobras de EE.UU. que vuelve a la region de Asia-Pacifico el centro estrategico para el dominio mundial y toma la RPDC como primer blanco de ataque, y brindar los merecidos esfuerzos para prevenirlas."

Tal pais establecio a fuerza la \"ley de seguridad\" abogando por la \"seguridad de Japon\" y la \"contribucion a la paz y estabilidad internacional\" llevando a cuestas a EE.UU., caudillo de agresion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto es el climax del cinismo propio de Japon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa \"ley de seguridad\" es el producto indispensable de la extremada politica conservadora del actual gobernador japones que toma el militarismo como ideal politico y filosofia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTomando el poder, Abe puso al desnudo su ambicion de ser el \"caudillo del Oriente\" cantando la cancion \"Kimigayo\" y dijo abiertamente que la meta de lucha de toda su vida es  precisamente la enmienda de la \"Constitucion de Paz\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe debe a tal politica agresiva de Abe el que promueve a fuerza la ley en cuestion abogando por su justicia en contrapelo de todas las criticas y condenaciones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs muy ridicula la conducta grosera de Abe, sirviente de guerra que reprime las voces de protesta de los habitantes japoneses y del mundo entero que demandan fuertemente la abolicion de la ley arriba mencionada, hablando ruidosamente del supuesto \"fortalecimiento de la alianza Japon-EE.UU.\" y la \"paz y la seguridad\" y siendo brigada de choque en el cumplimento de la guerra agresiva de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapon acarreo en el pasado las innumerables desgracias y sufrimientos al pueblo coreano y los demas asiaticos y ahora pretende tomar otra vez el camino de agresion que amenaza la paz y la seguridad de la humanidad abrigando la ambicion militarista.  Esto es el intolerable crimen de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa guerra y la paz no pueden coexistir nunca ni las autoridades japonesas pueden justificar con cualquier explicacion su militarismo y politica de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas maniobras de Japon por justificar la \"ley de seguridad\" es el mas atroz acto de guerra que pone en el peligro tanto la paz y seguridad del mundo como el destino de su pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl gobernador japones debe actuar con juicio teniendo presente que las imprudentes maniobras tendentes a convertir su pais en el militarista y agredir a ultramar, generaran al fin su autodestruccion."
