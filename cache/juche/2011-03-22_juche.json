It finally perpetrated indiscriminate armed intervention in the country, going beyond the limits of the resolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK strongly denounces this as a wanton violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of an independent state and a hideous crime against humanity in gross breach of the dignity of the Libyan people and their right to existence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such war action can never be justified and should be halted at once.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world is witnessing almost everyday the miserable death of a great many peaceable citizens and unspeakable disasters caused by two wars launched by the U.S. in the new century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not content with this, the U.S. sparked a fresh war disaster in order to bring about a regime change in the country incurring its displeasure under the spurious signboard of \"protecting civilians\" and put the natural resources of Libya under its control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. does not hesitate to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and launch armed invasion by abusing the UN name in disregard of the sovereignty of independent states. Such high-handed and arbitrary practices of the U.S. have become a root cause of harassing world peace and stability at present.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present Libyan crisis teaches the international community a serious lesson.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was fully exposed before the world that \"Libya's nuclear dismantlement\" much touted by the U.S. in the past turned out to be a mode of aggression whereby the latter coaxed the former with such sweet words as \"guarantee of security\" and \"improvement of relations\" to disarm itself and then swallowed it up by force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It proved once again the truth of history that peace can be preserved only when one builds up one's own strength as long as high-handed and arbitrary practices go on in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK was quite just when it took the path of Songun and the military capacity for self-defence built up in this course serves as a very valuable deterrent for averting a war and defending peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula."

Korea Military Exercises\r\n Pyongyang, March 22 (KCNA) -- The U.S.-south Korea joint military maneuvers, Foal Eagle, are assuming protracted nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t Foal Eagle, large field mobile exercises aimed at invading the DPRK, was reported to go on till late in April though Key Resolve was over. This is arousing serious concern among the members of the international community. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already known to the public, Foal Eagle is a comprehensive drill for a preemptive nuclear attack to realize the ambition for invading the DPRK after igniting an all-out war through surprise attacks on strategic targets in its depth and its main bases. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This protracted nature of the on-going saber-rattling proves its bellicose nature, above all. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the past U.S.-south Korea joint military exercises were staged according to OPLAN 5027 under the pretence of coping with someone's \"invasion of the south.\" But, this year's saber-rattling is underway according to OPLAN 5029 mainly under the pretext of coping with \"contingency\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t OPLAN 5029 is a very dangerous war scenario as it classifies somebody's \"contingency\" into six categories and calls on the U.S. and south Korean warmongers \"to go over to a military intervention\" in case of \"contingency.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The on-going saber-rattling cannot be interpreted otherwise than very dangerous war maneuvers for mounting a three-dimensional surprise attack on the DPRK with all means including nukes involved under the pretext of coping with \"contingency\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said protracted war maneuvers are aimed, to all intents and purposes, to steadily escalate the pressure upon the DPRK and the military tension to realize the scenario of the U.S. and south Korean puppet forces to start a war of aggression against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation remains so tense on the Korean Peninsula that a war may break out anytime due to the arrogant aggressors who respond to the positive efforts of the DPRK for dialogue and peace with war maneuvers. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the south Korean authorities will never evade the responsibility for this grave situation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The war maniacs should never miscalculate.
