In the work Kim Jong Il clarified the position and role of the intellectuals in the revolution and construction, original policy of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) towards intellectuals and issue of further strengthening the work among intellectuals.\r\n   Rodong Sinmun says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The work serves as a guideline which put the position and role of the intellectuals in the revolution and construction on a new stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The intellectuals represent a component of the driving force of revolution and a powerful force of the revolutionary struggle and social development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Without revolutionary intellectuals it is impossible to build up revolutionary ranks by awakening broad segments of people and push ahead with the noble work of building a prosperous country through dynamic economic and cultural construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Only when the intellectuals share the destiny and purpose with their leader, can they make great contributions to the development of society as the independent driving force of revolution, the paper notes, stressing: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   An intellectual can not carve out his destiny and discharge his mission on behalf of the times and history, if he is not united with the leader in ideology, purpose, morality and obligation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Minju Joson calls on all the intellectuals to display their wisdom and energies and reliably support the building of a powerful nation of Juche with science and technology. \r\n\r\n"

Instead, Japan must do what it should do above anything else, knowing where it stands.\r\n   Rodong Sinmun today stresses this, commenting on the Japanese Foreign Minister's speech at the UN General Assembly session. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese Foreign Minister said Japan is going to fully discharge its duty as befits a permanent UNSC member, making an effective use of its capability and experience in various fields such as disarmament and guarantee for human security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This shows that Japan, forgetful of its position, is impudently behaving itself as a permanent memeber of the UNSC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan contends that it has fully discharged its duty and role in the international arena. but its assertion is a lie. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Capability of performance of international duty and role and standard of its appraisal are not decided by the amount of \"contribution\" to the UN or by economic potentials and military power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan is not eligible to occupy a permanent seat on the UNSC. It has made neither an apology nor compensation for the crimes it committed against the Korean people in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the height of sarcasm and shamelessness that Japan is behaving itself as a permanent UNSC member though it failed to do its past settlement, a top-priority issue, and get out of the disgraceful \"enemy state.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such behaviour will further bring down the international confidence in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan should clearly know where it stands and behave itself, squarely seeing the present situation.    \r\n\r\n"
