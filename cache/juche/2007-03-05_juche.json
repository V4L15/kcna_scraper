This is a wanton violation of international law and an open challenge to the just demand of the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' call for \"evasion from the post-war system\" is little short of a declaration that they will totally drop their obligation on the part of international law and turn Japan into a war state with the legitimate war system, the right of belligerency and the right to participate in war so as to openly embark upon the road of overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a well-known fact that the Japanese militarists have not abandoned their revenge and ambition for overseas aggression for decades after being defeated in World War II. They have frantically stepped up the military preparations for reinvasion in this period. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries have already enacted war-related laws going against the \"pacifist constitution\". In recent ten years alone they instituted and promulgated the \"law on cooperation for UN peace-keeping operation\", the \"law on emergency in the surrounding areas\", the \"special law on measures against terrorism\", the \"emergency legislation\", etc., providing the legal framework for the establishment of the war system and legalizing overseas advance and operation of the \"Self-Defense Forces\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While talking about \"evasion from the post-war system\", they vociferate that they would turn Japan into a \"beautiful country\". This is no more than a crafty trick to deceive the world public opinion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They would be advised to bear in mind that such reckless moves for realizing their ambition for overseas aggression will only accelerate their own destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Not content with this, they traveled to the U.S. to beg for the permanent presence of those forces in south Korea.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One of the aims sought by these traitors may be to please their masters and come to power backed by them and their real aim is to quell the fellow countrymen's desire for independent reunification and do harm to them with the help of foreign forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If this group of traitors is allowed to go reckless, they will throw serious obstacles and difficulties in the way of achieving peace on the Korean Peninsula and the independent reunification of the Korean nation and reduce the June 15 joint declaration to a dead paper. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If this is allowed to happen, it would be impossible to realize the desire of the Korean people to live in a new independent democratic society, free from foreign forces and fascist suppression, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Humiliating SOFA under Fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 3 (KCNA) -- The south Korea-U.S. \"Status of Forces Agreement\"(SOFA) is nothing but a disgraceful document jointly produced by the aggressors and the traitors as it grants the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces in south Korea extraterritorial privilege in wanton violation of the dignity and sovereignty of the south Korean people. Rodong Sinmun Saturday notes this in a signed article carried four decades since the treaty formally took effect. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are a lot of agreements in the world, but no agreement gives the occupation forces, the aggressors, such unlimited extraterritorial privilege as the above-said SOFA does, the article deplores, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists concluded with the Syngman Rhee clique on July 12, 1950 the \"Taejon agreement\" stipulating the status and rights of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces in south Korea. This agreement stipulated that the \"criminal jurisdiction\" over the crimes committed by the U.S. forces should not belong to the south Korean authorities but to the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialist aggressor troops in south Korea infringed upon south Korean people's lives and properties everywhere they went, triggering off bitter anti-American sentiment. Feeling very uneasy and upset at this development, the U.S. imperialists conspired with the \"Yusin\" military fascist clique to replace the \"Taejon agreement\" by the SOFA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Criminal jurisdiction,\" \"civil case trial and claim to reparation,\"  \"immigration control,\" \"exemption of customs\" and \"use of facilities and land,\" etc. by the U.S. forces in south Korea stipulated by the SOFA are just part of the provisions in the agreement that prove the treacherous nature of this agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aggressive and humiliating nature of the SOFA has been clearly testified to by what has happened over the last four decades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The number of the crimes committed by GIs in south Korea for four decades has not decreased but has steadily increased, the means and methods involved in perpetrating such crimes baffling human imagination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even according to the official data released in south Korea, the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces have committed all sorts of crimes such as murder, violence and plunder over the last four decades since the conclusion of the SOFA or five or more cases on a daily average and nearly 2,000 cases on an annual average. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The inviolable land of Korea is now being devastated and its beautiful natural and ecological environment seriously destroyed due to the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops' monstrous killings, destruction and war exercises targeted against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All this is the catastrophic product of the SOFA. The south Korean people from all walks of life are called upon to turn out in brave popular actions for the repeal of the SOFA.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Raps Japan's Stand on Issue of \"Comfort Women\"\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 3 (KCNA) -- Japan is much upset after congressional hearing was held recently on the issue of the \"comfort women\" for the Imperial Japanese Army and a resolution on this issue was presented to U.S. Congress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thrown into an awkward situation by what victims of the \"comfort women\" whom the international community described as clear evidence proving abuses of women testified at the hearing, Japan is resorting to a desperate lobbying operation to stonewall the congressional passage of the resolution come what may. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is evidenced by the fact that Japan sent a message to U.S. Congress, asserting that it is inappropriate to adopt such resolution, and dispatched officials concerned to the U.S. to meet media and legislators and Dietmen from the Liberal Democratic Party made statements denying the forcible drafting of \"comfort women\" for the Imperial Japanese Army and modifying the statement made by the then Chief Cabinet Secretary apologizing for the past wrongs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these acts glaringly reveal before the world that Japan having a crime-woven history remains unchanged in its political and moral image in this century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a matter of fact, the Japanese imperialists' overseas aggression in the past century brought only untold hardships and misfortune to many countries and nations. Their harsh colonial rule over Korea for nearly half a century deprived it of a precious period of development and prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They took away 200,000 Korean women as \"comfort women\" for the Imperial Japanese Army, forcing them to provide sex for its servicemen and killing most of them. This was the most hideous crime against humanity. These sexual slaves, their chastity mercilessly violated, were denied the right to get married with their beloved ones and have undergone unbearable sufferings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world history of wars does not know such precedent as the organized sexual slavery system enforced by Japan whereby it forcibly drafted, lured and abducted foreign women and took them to battle fields to satisfy the carnal desire of its servicemen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was only Japan that perpetrated such hideous crimes related to the \"comfort women\" for the army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is that Japan is trying hardest to evade its responsibility, refusing to admit its crime-woven history even today when there remain only a small number of survivors of the sexual slavery, their scars unhealed and their towering grudge unsettled despite the flow of so long period of time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japanese politicians are, however, brazen-faced enough to busy themselves with shuttle diplomacy to cover up their despicable true colors, shelving the issue of \"comfort women.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no reason for Japan to be upset by any hearing or the adoption of any resolution if it is willing to honestly settle its inglorious past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is obliged to honestly settle its crime-woven past for its own sake. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any sleight of hand played by Japan to cover up its past wrongs would only strip bare its ugly picture and would never help it gain a responsible post in the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It can win confidence only through its good conduct.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
