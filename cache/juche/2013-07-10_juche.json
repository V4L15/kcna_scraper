Korean Unification Ministry Anti-DPRK Remarks under Fire: KCNA\r\n Pyongyang, July 10 (KCNA) -- Shortly ago, the south Korean Unification Ministry spokesman talked a load of rubbish about the DPRK which decried the remarks of rattling its nerves made by the present chief executive of south Korea during her foreign trip.\n\t\t\t\t\t Uttering such words as \"inappropriate expressions and remarks\" and \"a regretful thing\", the spokesman again talked about \"sincere dialogue\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those who made remarks provoking the DPRK even abroad are now shamelessly taking issue with it over its language.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their sophism aimed to evade the responsibility for the frayed inter-Korean ties only shows their plight of being driven into a tight corner inside and outside.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already reported, the south Korean regime's smear campaign against the line of the DPRK on simultaneously pushing forward economic construction and the building of nuclear force was a vicious provocation to hurt the dignity and social system of the DPRK. This only reveals their ignorance of politics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is by no means fortuitous that the international community, when touching to the reckless remarks by the chief executive of south Korea, called her watchword of \"confidence-building process\" an empty word and commented that the prospect of de-escalating the tensions on the Korean Peninsula and warming the inter-Korean relations remains dim.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should know that their continued repetition of their master's assertions inciting confrontation will bring them only shame and contempt.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The issue of the \"confidence-building\" and \"sincerity\" for dialogue should be raised by the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent revelation of the south Korean puppet Intelligence Service's interference in the \"presidential election\" is casting doubt about the legality of the present chief executive of south Korea as \"president.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Koreans from all walks of life are describing \"the election of Park Geun Hye as president\" as a \"coup\" that lacks confidence and sincerity, demanding her resignation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With the revelation of the plot to rise to power that came under fire by the broad segments of south Koreans, the regime forced the IS (Intelligence Service) to open to public the minutes of the inter-Korean summit, claiming \"the necessity to probe the truth about the political disputes\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, this action resulted in the sharp fall of the supporting rate for Park and \"the Saenuri Party\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This serious development threw Park and her party into extreme uneasiness.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This casts doubt as to whether there truly can be a confidence-based dialogue with the present south Korean regime which has hardly won any trust from its people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Worse still, the regime made no scruple of opening to public the minutes, which must be respected to the maximum, in order to attain its sinister political aim. Here can one think it was sincere when it claimed the \"summit diplomacy\"?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A saying goes that out of the mouth comes evil.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The more recklessly the south Korean regime resorts to the smear campaign against the dignity and social system of the DPRK, the more miserable fate it will meet."
