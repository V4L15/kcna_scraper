Whenever he visited a farm, he consulted with farmers about farming. Whenever he visited a factory, he shook workers' hands stained with oil and whenever he called on houses of workers, he opened cooking pots to know what food was being prepared.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Il Sung deemed it his primary obligation and greatest pleasure to serve the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Ukrainian Branch of the All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks of Russia posted on its homepage an article titled the \"Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It said: The great Fatherland Liberation War fought against the U.S. imperialists fully demonstrated the spirit and the mettle of the Korean people who were devotedly struggling for the freedom and the independence of the country, united close around the party and the leader.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK under the leadership of President Kim Il Sung defeated the U.S. imperialists who were superior in numerical strength and technical equipment."

He thus humbled the pride of the U.S. imperialists on July 27, 1953 and won a great victory in the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un, who is identical to Kim Il Sung, is leading the Korean people in the struggle for smashing the U.S. and other hostile forces' moves to stifle the DPRK and defending the sovereignty of the country with his outstanding political caliber."
