            "content": "Total Retraction of Definition of \"Principal Enemy\" Demanded \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 6 (KCNA) -- The Ministry of Defense of south Korea changed the phraseology defining the north as the \"principal enemy\" into that of \"the biggest threat\". This is an intolerable mockery of the dialogue partner and a challenge to the June 15 joint declaration. A spokesman for the National Democratic Front of south Korea said this in a statement on Dec. 30, according to Kuguk Jonson Internet site.\r\n The measure taken by the south Korean military authorities clearly proves that \"peace and prosperity\" and \"reconciliation and cooperation\" much touted by the present government are nothing but a fig-leaf to cover up the moves for confrontation with the north, the statement noted, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean government and military authorities should clearly understand the trend of the times and will of the people, immediately delete the new phraseology of the \"biggest threat\" and stop all practices such as defining the north as an \"enemy\" and stoking distrust and hostility between fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is the principal enemy as it wrecks stability and peace on the Korean Peninsula at present. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people from all walks of life should closely unite as one and turn out in a massive struggle against the U.S. and war in order to put an end to the U.S. domination and presence in south Korea and dynamically pave the way for peace and reunification on the peninsula through national cooperation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Challenging the unanimous desire of the Korean nation for reconciliation, peace and reunification, the United States is persistently pursuing the hostile policy to stifle the DPRK. It is massively beefing up its aggression armed forces in south Korea and going berserk in adventurous war exercises against the north, thereby spoiling the climate of reconciliation and reunification in the Korean Peninsula and screwing up the war danger to the utmost pitch. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another problem is that the pro-U.S. forces of south Korea are pushing for pro-U.S. \"cooperation,\" shunning national cooperation urgent for the solution of the national issue, going against the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Difficulties caused by pro-U.S. \"cooperation\" should be pushed aside by national cooperation. Pro-U.S. \"cooperation\" is \"cooperation\" for a war and division. National cooperation is the main recipe for achieving independence and peace and opening a turning phase for national reunification. Security and economic stability in south Korea also can be achieved by national cooperation between ourselves, not by \"cooperation\" with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The slogan in the joint New Year editorial calling for three-point cooperation is a realistic one reflecting the unanimous desire and will of the whole nation for national independence, peace against war, and reunification and patriotism.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is a monstrous crime impairing the dignity of the nation and its life and soul to be involved in the Iraqi war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean ruling Uri Party saw eye to eye with the GNP coteries in passing the motion, far from abolishing the \"National Security Law\". This is a perfidy to the south Koreans demanding independence against the U.S. and progressive reforms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By passing the motion the NA of south Korea added to the crime it has already committed by hurling thousands of young Koreans on to the Iraqi war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThrough this it has glaringly revealed its true colors as a group of pro-U.S. sycophantic traitors who value outsiders more than their fellow countrymen and who do not hesitate to offer their lives to outsiders, bereft of shame, if they are to satisfy the master. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an intolerable challenge to the trend of the times and the people�fs mindset to extend the service term of the south Korean troops in Iraq at a time when those countries which have sent their troops to Iraq are withdrawing them, taking up the cudgel against the unjustifiable war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite clear what consequences such a decision taken by the NA will entail. The motion will expose south Korean land to indiscriminate terrorism by anti-U.S. armed forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then the south Korean authorities and NA will find themselves accountable for that.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japanese Reactionaries' Unabated Anti-DPRK Racket under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 6 (KCNA) -- The Japanese ultra-right forces keep kicking up the racket against the DPRK as evidenced by their announcement of \"results of thorough investigation\" into materials on dead abductees.\r\n  Papers Thursday say: The Japanese reactionaries have followed a hostile policy towards the DPRK for the last several decades. But they have never pursued such an extremely hostile policy towards it as now, gritting their teeth with bitterness towards it. The Japanese government is crying out for \"strong counter-action\" and the like against the DPRK, joining the ultra-right forces. This is an open political provocation against the DPRK as it is intended to hurt its dignity and sovereignty and an act of putting the bilateral relations to the lowest ebb. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A news analyst of Rodong Sinmun recalls that after illegally occupying Korea Japan abducted and took away more than 8.4 million Koreans, killed at least one million of them and reduced 200,000 Korean women to \"comfort women\" for imperial Japanese army in the past. He continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not enough for Japan to kneel down to the Korean people and apologize to them a hundred times. Yet, it is now raising a hue and cry over \"the issue of false remains,\" its fabrication, and talking about \"protest\" and \"strong counter-action.\" This ridiculous behaviour reminds one of a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a matter of fact, the issue of abduction had already been settled during the Japanese prime minister's visit to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the DPRK-Japan contact showed, the former's sincere treatment of its dialogue partner has been misused by the latter for its political plots and hostile moves against the former. Now that it has become clear the Japanese government is joining the ultra-right forces in their evermore undisguised campaign against the DPRK, it feels no need to attach any significance to further inter-governmental contact between the two countries. No one can vouch that any explosive event would not take place between the two countries in case the militarist forces of Japan deliberately bedevil the bilateral relations and push the situation to an extreme phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK are closely following the anti-DPRK row of the Japanese ultra-right forces. Should those forces infringe upon the sovereignty of the DPRK even a bit, it will react to it with a tough physical measure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A news analyst of Minju Joson urges the Japanese government to return all the materials including the remains of Yokota without delay and thoroughly probe the truth about the recent fabrication and apologize to the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
