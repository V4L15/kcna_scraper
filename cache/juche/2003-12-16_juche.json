Its delaying tactics would only result in compelling the DPRK to steadily increase its nuclear deterrent force.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

All the Koreans should thoroughly bar the U.S. imperialists from poking their nose into the internal affairs of the Korean nation and should not tolerate their bellicose scheme of aggression.
