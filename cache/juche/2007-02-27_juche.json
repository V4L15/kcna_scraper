But the scope of naval operation set by it shows that it is aimed at seizing control over the seas around Asia and conducting offensive military operations anywhere in the region as it pleases in case of \"emergency.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a long time ago that Japan expanded the scope of its military operations to the areas of the Indian Ocean from its surroundings under the pretext of \"defending sea routes.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries paved the way for overseas dispatches under the cloak of \"cooperation in UN peace-keeping operations\" and are hurling their \"Self-defense Forces\" into dispute-torn regions for military operations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has hastened in real earnest the enactment of all sorts of war laws including a draft amendment to the law on \"Self-defense Forces\" and arms buildup. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Taking advantage of the escalated disputes in the hot spots, Japan is getting the SDF ready for plunging into overseas aggression any moment under the label of \"contribution to peace.\" It is also rounding off necessary legal mechanisms one by one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' dispatch of helicopters and warships to the Strait of Malacca far from Japan proper for the joint exercises against this background vividly shows how feverish they have become in their war preparations for overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind all the military measures taken by Japan is its sinister criminal intention to thrust its militarist sword into the soil of Asia again.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
