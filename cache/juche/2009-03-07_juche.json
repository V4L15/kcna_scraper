The World and Korea Today\" and \"2. The Brilliant Commander of Mt. Paektu and the Invincible Army\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe book in its preface notes that the author was greatly fascinated by the noble personality of President Kim Il Sung and General Secretary Kim Jong Il while deeply studying the Juche idea and keenly felt the originality and vitality of the Songun politics. And it stresses that people should follow the Songun politics if they want to live in peace in the new century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn \"1. The World and Korea Today\" the book impressively tells about the fact that the author found the path of his party in the great Juche idea after wandering about to seek after the truth and the days when he was honored with the audience of Kim Il Sung during the stay in the DPRK and received the precious teachings from the President that serve as his maxim of life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt also cites concrete facts to introduce the origin and historical roots of the Workers' Party of Korea's Songun idea and its truth and great vitality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn \"2. The Brilliant Commander of Mt. Paektu and the Invincible Army\" the book profoundly explains about the fact that Kim Jong Il has further strengthened the Korean People's Army into an invincible revolutionary army and the DPRK into an impregnable socialist bulwark with his unique Songun politics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt tells about the fact that Kim Jong Suk, an anti-Japanese heroine, gave birth to Kim Jong Il and brought up him as the brilliant sun of the future, and introduces the anecdotes showing his personality as the peerlessly brilliant commander of Songun."
