They are dominationist and imperialist forces of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists today take issue with the steps taken by independent countries to increase their defence capabilities as \"possession of weapons of mass destruction\" and fostering of \"terrorism\". But this is a sort of pressure not to allow those countries to build up military power obstructive to their war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people who value the sovereignty of the country and love peace should deal with the false propaganda and pressure of the imperialists aimed to disarm them with heightened vigilance and push forward energetically the work of increasing defence capabilities to meet the specific conditions of the countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEspecially, those countries that are largely exposed to the imperialists' threat of aggression should concentrate particular efforts on increasing defence potential. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If defence capabilities are to be increased and sovereignty be defended, it is essential to pursue the Songun policy. Only when one puts it forward as the state affairs of top priority to attach importance to military affairs and dynamically push ahead with the work of increasing defence capabilities can the sovereignty and security of the country be guaranteed so much reliably and the building of economy and improvement of the people's living be carried on with success. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is thanks to the Songun politics that the Korean people are now stepping up the construction of a great prosperous powerful nation of Juche, holding invariably high the banner of socialism, despite the ever-more vicious military pressure of the United States. Songun politics is, indeed, the banner of struggle and the treasured sword of victory in revolution which the people of those countries struggling for sovereignty should hold high. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When all the countries and peoples attach importance to the military affairs and consolidate the defences of the country, the imperialists will not act rashly and a peaceful environment be created.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Great National Unity Called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 27 (KCNA) -- All Koreans, whether they are in the north and the south and overseas, should unite close under the banner of patriotism, the banner of national reunification, irrespective of ideology, religious belief, political view, class and social strata and intensify the patriotic struggle for reunification, keenly aware that the great unity of the Korean nation is the lifeline for national reunification, says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the issue of national reunification is the one of achieving the permanent reunion of the divided Korean nation and maintaining its homogeneity, national reunification presupposes the great unity of the Korean nation and this unity would precisely mean the reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is none other than the Koreans who have undergone sufferings and pain due to the division of the country and who will enjoy happiness in the reunified country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is, therefore, a decisive guarantee for the independent and peaceful reunification of the country for all the Korean people in the north and the south and overseas to fulfill their responsibility and role as a driving force for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is essential for achieving national reunification is to achieve the great unity of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Despite the persistent challenges of the forces at home and abroad to the movement for reunification in the new century including their moves to stifle the DPRK by force of arms and incite the north-south confrontation, the Korean nation's cause of reunification is making progress and bringing about signal successes. This is because the Korean nation is powerfully driving the engine of reunification by its concerted efforts with the pride and self-confidence of having greeted the era of independent reunification ushered in by the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. The lesson teaches us that the Korean nation is a main force for accomplishing the cause of national reunification and the great national unity is the best and if the whole nation unites close in the struggle with one mind and will in the spirit of \"By our nation itself\", it can weather out any difficulties and ordeals to accomplish the cause of national reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 27 (KCNA) -- Unconverted long-term prisoners in south Korea together with those concerned of the Catholic Society for Supporting Reunification applied for their tour of Mt Kumgang in mid-November through the \"Committee for the Promotion of the Repatriation of Unconverted Long-term Prisoners\".\r\n But the south Korean authorities turned down it under the absurd pretext that \"the period of protection and observation of them under the Law on Observation for Public Peace is not over\" and \"there is an enemy-benefiting charge\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They disallowed the tour of Mt. Kumgang by the above-said people only though they do not put any restriction on any others. This is an action in violation of the spirit of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and an unpardonable human rights abuse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the cherished desire of the south Korean people to tour Mt. Kumgang, a world famous mountain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Considerate of this desire, the north took an exceptional broad-minded measure to enable any compatriot at home and abroad to tour the mountain and has conducted various undertakings to this end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the last five years since the start of the tour hundreds of thousands of south Koreans from all walks of life who love the country and the nation and desire reunification have visited there. They included politicians, businessmen and government officials. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tour of Mt. Kumgang offers a good occasion not only to enjoy the beautiful scenery of the country but get a better understanding of the nation and pool the will of compatriots in the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unconverted long-term prisoners spent most of their life behind bars with grudge, longing to see the north, awake or asleep. Yet, the south Korean authorities did not allow them even to enjoy the scenic beauty of the mountain by the force of the above-mentioned law, a leftover of the past era of confrontation, going against the desire of the nation. This is really surprising. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This inhumanitarian action clearly proves that south Korea is a graveyard of freedom and human rights as it savagely violates even the elementary freedom and right of everybody. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By nature the issue of the repatriation of unconverted long-term prisoners is clearly stipulated in the joint declaration as it is pending an urgent solution between the north and the south. So, they should have already been repatriated to the north as desired by them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the south Korean authorities are still persecuting them under that law, virtually detaining them in invisible prisons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should stop suppressing the free activities of the unconverted long-term prisoners and send them back to the north without delay as demanded by them in the spirit of the joint declaration.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"

If south Korea sent troops to Iraq under this condition, they would get it in the neck as the \"inspection group of the National Assembly\" did. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe members of the inspection group could save their lives as the Iraqi resistance force only fired a warning shot at them, sounding an alarm bell to south Korean troop dispatch. But if cannon fodder for the U.S. were practically carried to Iraq they would suffer wholesale deaths. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The conclusion drawn from these facts is that south Korean troops must never be sent to Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the grave consequences to be entailed by additional troop dispatch to Iraq have loomed with added clarity, there is no need for the south Korean authorities to agonize over the matter or read somebody's face. They should unconditionally drop the anti-national troop dispatch to Iraq that would sacrifice young people submitting to the pressure of the U.S.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
