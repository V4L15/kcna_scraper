The above-said outbursts let loose by the confrontation-minded maniacs ignorant of this only reveal the treacherous scenario to realize the ambition for \"unification through invasion against the north\", far from working to attain independent reunification through the inter-Korean reconciliation and unity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the final analysis, \"preparations for achieving unification\" touted by Hyon are aimed to disarm the DPRK, lead it to reforms and opening in a bid to realize the ambition for \"unification under liberal democracy.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such wicked confrontation-minded maniac as Hyon should be eliminated if the inter-Korean relations are to be saved from a collapse and the independent and peaceful reunification of the country is to be achieved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities would be well advised to drop their foolish daydream.
