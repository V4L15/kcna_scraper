Seen everywhere are people, men and women, old and young, dancing and singing.\r\n   They are willing to steadfastly defend the people's government, which always provides them with a happy and worthwhile life.\r\n   The South Korean puppets, however, are persistently resorting to the anti-north smear campaign, afraid of the South Korean people becoming aware of the happy life of those in the north and invincibility of its socialism.\r\n   Finding it difficult to lull the escalating anti-\"government\" demonstrations in South Korea, the puppets have attempted to diverse public attention to the north.\r\n   As for protests and demonstrations, they have become a daily occurrence in South Korea.\r\n   Unemployed and other people of various social strata have staged anti-\"government\" demonstrations in front of the Seoul city hall and in all other parts of South Korea.\r\n   The puppets, instead of resorting to anti-north smear campaign and spreading rumours about \"purge of cadres,\" had better solve South Korea's unemployment problem and promptly stop the fascist suppression of workers and other people and man-hunting. \r\n\r\n"
