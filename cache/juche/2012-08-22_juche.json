It went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the past the Japanese imperialists illegally occupied Korea and inflicted unspeakable misfortune and pain on the Koreans, typically forcible drafting, sexual slavery and forcing Koreans to change their names to Japanese ones. They plundered Korea of its cultural treasures and underground natural resources and committed huge atrocities to obliterate the soul of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Far from making an apology and reparation for the past crimes the Japanese imperialists committed against the Koreans, Japan has distorted history and openly laid a territorial claim to Tok Islets in a bid to realize the ambition for invading Korea. It now has gone the lengths of seeking the conclusion of the GSOMIA with south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Emboldened by the political and military tie-up with south Korea that has escalated since the Lee Myung Bak regime's taking office, Japan is openly opting for becoming a military power and launching militarist reinvasion. The formation of triangular military alliance among the U.S., Japan and south Korea that has now reached a dangerous phase also stems from the close nexus between south Korea and Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The joint statement evinced the firm pledge of Buddhists in the north and the south to turn out in practical actions to reject and foil military nexus between the Lee Myung Bak regime and the Japanese reactionaries which increases the danger of a new war on the Korean Peninsula and gravely threatens peace and security in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world."

It is a huge project that has to overcome the most unfavorable natural and geographical conditions in the DPRK's history of building hydro-electric power stations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Leader Kim Jong Il let the youth league take charge of the project. The young people completed the construction of Power Station No. 1 earlier than schedule, creating a new youth speed. They have already finished the building of the basic dam of Power Station No. 2 and are pushing forward the expansion of waterway tunnel in its final phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In July 2004, the youth held a meeting to vow to push forward the construction and then laid several kilometer-long road and railways in just 10 days with the same stamina and spirit as displayed by the preceding generation in the projects of laying Haeju-Hasong railway section and building the Youth Hero Motorway.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A plan was worked out to hasten the project of the first cofferdam for the construction of the dam of Power Station No. 1. This constituted the first phase in the whole project. The builders tackled a temporary drainage setup in keeping with the topographical conditions of the area which is over 1 000 meters above the sea level, thus completing the cofferdam project 15 days earlier than plan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This was followed by the successive blasting for the excavation of earth for laying the foundation of the dam and the second cofferdam project.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The youth introduced new construction method in the second cofferdam project, thus economizing lots of cement and bringing the completion of the project earlier.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They finished in a matter of six months the creation of gravel and sand dumping ground, assorting ground, mixing ground, nine- conveyer belt project and transport and assembling of a crane for building dam. This would take 2-3 years at an ordinary pace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The youth shock brigade started concrete tamping for the dam. They introduced advanced construction method and innovation proposals to lower the inside heat of dam, thus giving great benefits to the state and hastening the speed of construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During 150-day and 100-day campaigns in 2009 they built up scores of meters of dam.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The water tunnel project of Power Station No. 1, key part in the construction of the power station, was a do-or-die battle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The members of the youth shock brigade sometimes stayed under water for more than 70 hours, fighting water pouring from the ceiling.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They carved words of song \"Where Are You, Dear General\" on the wall of the tunnel, one line every 100 meters, looking forward to the day when Kim Jong Il would visit the completed power station.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They dug the maximum of 9.7 meters a day. The distance covered by each person pushing a wagon for hundreds of days till the completion of tunnel amounted to some 12 000 kilometers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The waterway was tunneled through for Power Station No. 1 in February 2006. For more than 300 days afterwards, the builders finished the most demanding expansion project and then conducted coating project, thus completing the water tunnel in August 2010.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This led to the earlier completion of Power Station No. 1 in December 2010.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The construction of pebbles dam and water tunnel of Power Station No. 2 has also made so big headway that the construction of the basic dam is to be completed on the occasion of the Youth Day this year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The expansion project is now under way after the waterway was tunneled through and the construction of Power Station No. 3 is making progress as planned.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ideological and moral world of the young people has been upgraded during the period.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The members of the youth shock brigade paved \"Paektu youth road\" out of their yearnings for Kim Jong Il and their loyalty for the dear respected Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They have established the way of life of the anti-Japanese guerillas at lodgings, worksites and all other places. Their ranks and order remind one of the revolutionary traits of the People's Army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They brought hundreds of hectares under cultivation, producing various kinds of vegetables on Paekam. They also rear thousands of domestic animals, laying firm supply service bases.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There were those who readily shoved falling stone to save comrades. When trapped inside crumbled pit, they held rock-drills for tunneling before opening road for their lives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An ordinary girl shock brigade member laid down her life to save comrades under unexpected dangerous situation. Written on her diary were letters \"Let us rise up first when the country undergoes difficulty!\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lots of commanders and members of the shock brigades finished correspondence courses of colleges and became dependable pillars of the country during the construction period.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Officials of youth league organizations at all levels went to the relevant factories and enterprises where they meticulously organized the work to step up the youth shock brigade activities for increased production, thus bringing about remarkable innovations in the production of electric generators and other equipment and raw materials needed for the construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The manufacture of \"Songun Youth Vanguard\" electric locomotive and dozens of freight cars helped relieve the strain on the transport. This was a result of a do-good-thing movement including the collection of idle materials conducted by the youth league organizations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Young people of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan rendered sincere help to the construction of the Paektusan Songun Youth Power Station, keeping pace with the patriotic devotion of those in the homeland.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The big trust and loving care shown by Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un, peerlessly great men, have become the source of the undying feats at the construction site.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In May 2010 Kim Jong Il visited the construction site despite his fatigue from foreign visit. He encouraged the members of the youth shock brigade, saying that they have done many things beyond imagination.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Marshal Kim Jong Un read a letter presented by commanders and members of the Paektusan Songun Youth Shock Brigade in January this year and sent his handwritings and learned about problems arising in the project and life down to the details.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The day of the completion of the power station is drawing near thanks to the profound loyalty of young people of Mt. Paektu to uphold Kim Jong Un."

More than 100 young people of South Phyongan Province proceeded to the Jisa Co-op Farm, Nampho City in 2006. The number of those youngsters has increased year by year since then. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After graduating from Pyongyang Agricultural College of Kim Il Sung University, Jong Su Rim volunteered to work on the Rihyon Vegetable Farm in Sadong District.

Kim Hyok Youth Shock Brigade and Cha Kwang Su Youth Shock Brigade are taking the lead in the drive for socialist construction including the Hwanghae Iron and Steel Complex, Unryul Mine, Sochang Youth Coal Mine, Namdok Coal Mine and Ripsok Coal Mine. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Members of the Paektusan Songun Youth Shock Brigade have displayed matchless devotion despite difficulties, bringing earlier the day of completion of the power station. Innovations are being effected every day by members of the youth shock brigade through their high-pitched drive in the project for rebuilding and repairing the northern railways. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Young people of power basses in Huichon, Pyongyang and Pukchang, coals mines in Sunchon and Anju areas and Songgang and Hwanghae iron and steel production bases and in the field of railway transport are effecting a great surge in production.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the rural areas the number of youth sub-workteams and workteams increased to thousands.

This year, too, young scientists, technicians and inventors presented thousands of valuable computer programs and technological innovation proposals conducive to technological updating of different sectors of the national economy and modernization of production processes, holding high the banner of the industrial revolution in the new century."

This has naturally triggered off what Lee considered most undesirable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean Council of Churches in a statement opposed the reappointment, saying that since his taking office in 2009 Hyon has been blamed as a coattail rider for his ignorance of human rights issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the Unified Democratic Party denounced Lee's decision of designating Hyon to the post again as an \"insult to the south Koreans and a declaration of renouncement of human rights\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reappointment of Hyon to the post is aimed to turn the \"Human Rights Committee\" into a waiting maid subservient to the regime and an organization breeding plots against human rights in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t While holding the post of human rights chairman, Hyon hushed up the massacre of evacuees in Ryongsan, crackdown on candle-light demonstrators against the import of American beef, suppression of Ssangryong Motors Trade Unions, illegal surveillance of civilians and other human rights abuses by the puppet regime. It was Hyon's clan that deleted words of repealing the \"National Security Law\" from the \"draft suggestion for the basic human rights plan\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Besides its human rights abuses, Hyon committed the whole gamut of grafts including speculation in real estate and his son's evasion of military service.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Three years ago, nearly 60 members of the human rights institution clarified their stand in group to resign on account of Hyon, touching off a big furor. This fact alone is enough to know what sort of man he is.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Irony is that he has kicked up anti-DPRK campaign, crying out for drawing up a \"human rights improvement plan\" and instituting \"north Korean human rights law\" under the pretext of its human rights performance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For all his earlier acts, Hyon was voted down at a confirmation hearing of the \"National Assembly,\" and even the ruling party opposed his reappointment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, traitor Lee Myung Bak let Hyon hold the post, a blatant challenge to human rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is aimed to cover up human rights abuses Lee committed during office and continue anti-DPRK human rights campaign till the last day of his office.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is little short of going against the people's mindset.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Imbeciles have limited thinking power."
