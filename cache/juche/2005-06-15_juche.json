Their ultimate goal is, first of all, to isolate and stifle the DPRK by neutralizing its self-defensive capabilities and gain predominance in strategic offensive weapons by destroying the barely maintained strategic balance in East Asia  and eventually grab military supremacy in this region.\r\n The DPRK can never tolerate the scheme of the U.S. and Japan to neutralize the self-defensive capabilities of the DPRK, seriously threatening its security, in cahoots with each other, and stage another tragedy of Cold War in East Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will tirelessly increase its war deterrent to defend its security and East Asian peace.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a very serious and dangerous development as it is part of Japan's moves to step up its nuclear weaponization in real earnest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's plutonium reprocessing is closely linked with its ambition to go nuclear, an oft-repeated call made by its militarist forces in recent years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis is a blatant challenge to the nuclear non-proliferation regime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is serious is that the U.S. styling itself a \"fair judge of nuclear non-proliferation\" keeps mum about Japan's ambition for nuclear weaponization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As disclosed recently, the U.S. has a \"conception\" of allowing only Japan and four other non-nuclear states to enrich uranium for the production of nuclear fuel and permitting only Japan to extract plutonium from the spent nuclear fuel. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is faulting the measure taken by the DPRK to bolster its nuclear deterrent for just self-defence and seeking to disarm it, while supporting and encouraging its allied forces in nuclear weaponization. This is a clear proof of the application of its unfair double standards in dealing with the nuclear issue and its ambition to stifle the DPRK.\r\n It is preposterous and ridiculous, indeed, for Japan to talk about the \"nuclear threat\" from someone although it is beset with such a serious nuclear problem.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA on Japan's Foolish Attempt at \"Regional Sanctions\" against DPRK\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 14 (KCNA) -- There is a growing tendency in Japan to intensify economic sanctions against the DPRK.\r\n \"Measures to Tighten Control over Export at Home and Abroad\" released under the pretext of preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and missiles in Asia can be viewed as part of the moves to escalate the sanctions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the Fourth Asia Security Conference in Singapore the Japan Defence Agency chief underlined the need of sanctions, saying that the DPRK's withdrawal from the NPT, its access to nukes and the development and deployment of missiles and their spread constitute factors of instability in the region and that of the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This once again betrays the Japanese reactionaries' strategic attempt at \"economic sanctions\" against the DPRK whose aim is to isolate and strangle it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan adopted the \"law on economic sanctions against north Korea\" and \"law on the special measure to ban portcalls of specified ships\" and retrogressively revised \"law on foreign currency\", thus adopting the economic sanctions against the DPRK as its state policy. It even asserted the need to apply sanctions against the DPRK even single-handedly to cope with the \"threat\" from it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has favored the U.S. and other Western countries' steps for sanctions under the pretext of \"international cooperation\". Tokyo is now wooing Asian countries to get involved in the issue of the DPRK-Japan relations of confrontation in a bid to expand and tighten economic sanctions against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality goes to prove that Japan has become evermore undisguised and entered a reckless phase in its hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"regional economic sanctions\" are a wanton violation of the UN Charter and a serious infringement upon the sovereignty of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The charter does not allow sanctions and blockade against other countries in any case.\r\n Japan should therefore refrain from deliberately posing any threat and laying any obstacle to the DPRK's economic activities, to say nothing of imposing economic pressure and blockade upon it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's nukes and missiles are not meant to threaten others but to defend itself, to all intents and purposes. \r\n The \"nuclear and missile threats\" from the DPRK are nothing but sheer sophism made by the U.S. and its leverage for pressurizing Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan must be aware of this. However, it seeks a sinister aim through its moves to tighten the economic sanctions against the DPRK under the pretext of \"nuclear and missile threats\" from it. It is keen to go nuclear by joining the U.S. in its moves to stifle the DPRK and strain the regional situation in a bid to create an atmosphere favorable for staging a comeback to Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to stop going reckless. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its moves to escalate the tensions under the pretext of \"threat\" from the DPRK would only invite stronger rebuff at the debate on the regional issues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries would be gravely mistaken if they think their sanctions could frighten the DPRK or bring it to its knees.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

All the Koreans will surely punish the United States and the anti-reunification forces serving their master with the might of the strong unity under the banner of national independence, peace against war and reunification and patriotism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Yang Hyong Sop in a congratulatory speech said that the grand festival is the biggest-ever national assembly since the division of the country because broad strata of personages and compatriots representing different circles in the north, the south and overseas have gathered there to share the will for reunification and patriotism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation succeeded in finding out its way out at the historic turning point where a new millennium had begun, he said, adding that the June 15 joint declaration warmed the relations between the north and the south which had long kept away from each other and put the inter-Korean relations characterized by antagonism and confrontation on the orbit of reconciliation, cooperation and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He expressed the belief that the festival would achieve shining success and thus bring greater hope to all the fellow countrymen aspiring after national reunification and decorate this significant year as a year of opening a new phase in the movement for independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rev. Popjang, honorary representative of the south side's preparatory committee in his speech said that the spirit of reconciliation enshrined in the joint declaration has served as a cornerstone of confidence and unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBut for the June 15 joint declaration, it would have been quite impossible for Koreans in the south, the north and overseas and representatives of the south and north authorities to have such a grand assembly as today.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
