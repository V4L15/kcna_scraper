The Korean people's shining victory in the war was thanks to the outstanding leadership of Kim Il Sung, the invincible and iron-willed commander, he stressed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A congratulatory message to Kim Jong Il was adopted at the meeting held in Britain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Appreciated at the film shows were Korean films showing the invincible might of the heroic Korean People's Army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, Saber Ballul, head of a department of the Political Faculty of the University of Damascus, issued a statement on July 25 to celebrate July 27, the day of the Korean people's victory in the war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
