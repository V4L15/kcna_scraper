That is no more than a temporary, unusual  phenomenon in view of the developing human history.\r\n   For its great attraction, the Pyongyang Declaration which calls for defending and advancing socialism is rapidly sweeping the whole world. More than 230 political parties have so far signed the declaration since its publication.\r\n   Political parties in Asia, Africa and Latin America and even those in West Europe regard the declaration as a joint action program and work hard to increase international solidarity in the struggle for socialism on the basis of the declaration.\r\n   Only socialism is the way for the developing countries to do away with the aftereffects of the imperialist colonial rule and achieve the prosperity of the nation in the building of a new society.\r\n   Mindful that it is the best way for them to take the road of socialism in the teeth of obstructions of the imperialists, the peoples in those countries are now advocating socialism and fighting for carrying its noble idea into practice.    \r\n\r\n"

Command\" in South Korea.\r\n   The \"U.N. Command\" is, in essence, the U.S. Forces Command. That is why the U.S. is obliged to dismantle it.\r\n   The United States must carry out its obligation and the U.N. resolution calling for the dissolution of the \"U.N. Command\".\r\n   The Korean armistice system should be replaced with a peace-keeping system, which is an important way for putting an end to the cold war system in the Peninsula.\r\n   Only when this outdated system, which has been reduced to a mere name due to the U.S. irresponsible deed, is replaced by a peace-keeping mechanism, is it possible to remove the state of armistice between the DPRK and the U.S. and prevent recurrence of war.\r\n   There are a lot of things for the U.S. to do in removing the present cold war system in the Korean Peninsula.\r\n   The U.S. should sincerely do what it has to do. \r\n   Then, confidence in it in relations with the DPRK will be built and a prospect will be opened for improvement of the DPRK-U.S. relations and for the settlement of the Korean issue.    \r\n\r\n"
