Worse still, it has neither taken issue with the U.S. over its nuclear threat to other country and missile attack on a non-nuclear state nor faulted its frequent ICBM test-launches.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is, indeed, preposterous for the U.S. and its vassal forces to urge the DPRK to \"cogitate\" while condemning the step taken by the DPRK to bolster its nuclear deterrent for \"self-defence\" as a \"threat\" and sidestepping the root cause of the critical situation on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No one in the world welcomes a gangster blackmailing the owner with a dagger.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is an entirely legitimate right to self-defence for the DPRK to further increase its war deterrent to cope with the prevailing grave situation on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present reality clearly proves that the DPRK was so right when it made a crucial decision to strengthen its nuclear force in quality and quantity under the uplifted banner of simultaneously developing the two fronts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nuclear force of the DPRK is a treasure sword of justice and reliable war deterrent to defend the sovereignty and dignity of the country and global peace from the nuclear war threat posed by the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In case a war breaks out on the peninsula, the U.S. will be held wholly accountable for it, no matter who made preemptive attack. It is because the U.S. has caused troubles by bringing a lot of nuclear strategic assets and special warfare means to strike the DPRK, not content with steady escalation of its hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nonsensical and absurd is the policy of \"maximum pressure and engagement\" worked out by the Trump administration without any elementary sense about reality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Trump administration had better not forget the fact that the reason of the failure of all DPRK policies of its predecessors, notably the hard-line hostile policy, lie in their misjudgment of the DPRK, and that what they faced for the wrong policies were bitter defeats only.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. sustained the first defeat since its foundation for igniting a war in the 1950s, being ignorant of its opponent. It was made to sign a written apology for the first time in its history. They were all natural outcome of the DPRK-U.S. standoff.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t How can one call the U.S. a normal country as it desperately persists in hostile policy toward the DPRK despite bitter defeats?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The more desperately the U.S. resorts to its moves hostile to the DPRK, the stronger the latter becomes. The U.S. ever-increasing military threat makes the latter's fortitude and retaliatory capability get stronger.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. persists in playing chicken to test the will and perseverance of the DPRK, it will be made to actually experience what a real war is like."
