            "content": "Portavoz de MINREX rechaza insistencia norteamericana en sanciones anti-RPDC\r\nPyongyang, primero de septiembre (ACNC) -- A la pregunta de un reportero de la ACNC formulada en relacion con que Estados Unidos volvio a soltar las viejas insistencias en sanciones y presion, el portavoz del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea respondio el dia primero como lo siguiente:\n\t\t\t\t\tEn una entrevista sostenida el 29 de agosto, el subayudante de Seguridad Nacional de la Casa Blanca censuro las justas medidas de la RPDC por fortalecer el disuasivo nuclear, inclusive el lanzamiento de prueba del misil balistico del submarino estrategico, y peroro que ejecutara las sanciones y se necesita dar mas presiones a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tParece que EE.UU. considera como una \"receta universal\" la sancion y la presion, lo cual deviene la expresion de que el no esta liberado todavia de la ignorancia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPese a las severas sanciones sin precedentes de varios decenios, podemos tener dignamente la posicion de la potencia nuclear como hoy. Esto se debe enteramente a que hemos venido materializando invariablemente el espiritu de autofortalecimiento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl hecho de que el funcionario de alto nivel del Consejo de Seguridad Nacional de la Casa Blanca habla todavia de la desnuclearizacion demuestra que EE.UU. esta invariablemente en el sueno.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestra linea de desarrollo paralelo no es una contramedida para hacer frente a la situacion en brusco cambio, sino la linea estrategica que debemos mantener permanentemente mientras que siguen las amenazas y arbitrariedades nucleares de los imperialistas. No nos retiraremos jamas de este camino.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa es el tiempo en que EE.UU. debe hacer con seriedad sus acciones y pronunciaciones viendo correctamente la posicion de la RPDC entrada en la primera fila de las potencias nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi ese pais americano no se libera de la caduca actitud y actua imprudentemente soltando de continuo sus sofisterias de \"sancion\", seran mas catastroficas sus consecuencias."
