            "content": "U.S. loudmouthed dialogue flailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 28 (KCNA) -- Shortly ago, U.S. President Bush said that the U.S. has a willingness to negotiate with North Korea. And he was followed by the state secretary and a spokesman for the White House who paid lip-service to a dialogue with North Korea. They said that North Korea would receive such benefits as energy support and food aid only if it dismantled its \"nuclear weapons program\".\r\n This only indicates that there is no change in the U.S. stand that the U.S. will have a dialogue with the DPRK only after it scraps its \"nuclear weapons program\", says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. much ballyhooed energy support and food aid are nothing but bait to force the DPRK to disarm itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a nuclear war against the DPRK is made a fait accompli in the U.S. it is now loudly talking about a dialogue with the DPRK in a bid to cover up its criminal aim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This compels the DPRK to be highly vigilant against the U.S. cynical call for dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK already clarified that it has an idea to settle the nuclear issue through direct negotiations with the U.S. on condition that it recognizes the DPRK's sovereignty, assures the DPRK of non-aggression and does not stand in the way of its economic development. The DPRK's principled stand that the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula should be settled through bilateral negotiations between the DPRK and the U.S. remains unchanged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should stop paying lip-service to dialogue and its anachronistic offensive to stifle the DPRK by nukes and do what it should do for a fair and peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Japan is totally to blame for the non-compliance with the declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan linked the already settled issue and unimportant issues which carry no great significance in improving the bilateral relations to the issue of compensating for its past crimes, thus deliberately hamstringing the process of establishing diplomatic relations between the two countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is persistent in its moves to isolate the DPRK, taking advantage of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula is not an issue which admits of Japan's meddling. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue can be settled satisfactorily only if the U.S. totally drops its hostile policy toward the DPRK and respects its sovereignty and vital rights.
