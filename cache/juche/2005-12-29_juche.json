            "content": "GNP's Traitorous \"Human Rights\" Racket under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 28 (KCNA) -- The \"human rights\" racket kicked up by the south Korean ultra-right conservative forces including the \"Grand National Party\" against the north is an unpardonable treacherous criminal act to incite antagonism and confrontation between the south and the north and do harm to the fellow countrymen in the north according to the U.S. script to isolate and stifle it. Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary.\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The pro-U.S. forces of south Korea including the GNP kicked up a row over the non-existent \"human rights issue\" in the north at the instigation of the U.S. Not content with this, they have become desperate in their smear campaign by staging what they called \"international conference.\" It is really deplorable and ridiculous for them to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a more serious attention is that their \"human rights\" racket is timed to coincide with the U.S. recent frantic \"human rights\" offensive against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is disgusting and resentful for these forces to dance to the tune of foreign forces, not knowing what human rights are like, bereft of the consciousness of being Koreans and sensitivity to the times. This despicable action can be taken only by the group of traitors who seek a way out in slandering and doing harm to fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are completely steeped in the American-style view on the value of \"human rights,\" while serving the U.S., having neither proper opinion nor political principle. It is imprudent and ridiculous for these elements to dare impose this view on the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no need to argue that the \"human rights\" offensive launched by them with the backing of the U.S. is aimed at \"overthrowing the system\" in the north. But they are seriously mistaken. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean ultra-right conservative forces had better cool their heads overheated with their \"human rights\" racket against the north and behave prudently.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The work is an immortal one of historic significance in firmly preserving the tradition of the Korean revolution and achieving its victorious advance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Il Sung's idea on eliminating dogmatism and formalism and strictly establishing Juche in the ideological work has been successfully carried forward and its validity and vitality are being fully proved day by day under the wise guidance of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Establishing Juche in the ideological work under socialism presents itself as a very important issue related to the cause of socialism and the destiny of humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il has led the cause of the Korean revolution to a proud victory by successfully carrying forward and developing in depth the tradition of establishing Juche provided by Kim Il Sung and exploits performed by him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The struggle to establish Juche has reached a new stage in the Songun era when the great Songun idea is being applied to all fields. It is thanks to this idea that the Korean people have been the great people having high national pride and strong revolutionary confidence generation after generation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
