It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Steadfast are the patriotic faith and will enshrined by the Korean people who have fully enjoyed an independent and creative life as the true masters of the power of the DPRK for scores of years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The current elections will provide an occasion of consolidating the Supreme People's Assembly and people's power organs at other levels with true revolutionaries who are devoting themselves to the progress and prosperity of the country with the ardent patriotic enthusiasm, true to the WPK's cause of Songun that is why the elections will mark an important milestone in consolidating the DPRK government as firm as a rock to meet the requirements of the Songun era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through the elections we should powerfully demonstrate the invincible might of the DPRK government and thus instill great national pride and self-confidence into the south Korean people and all the overseas compatriots in their struggle for true democratic freedom and rights and national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The elections will powerfully demonstrate the heroic spirit of the DPRK holding aloft the red flag of socialism on the forefront  of the anti-imperialist, anti-U.S. struggle and greatly encourage the world's revolutionary people in their struggle for the independent development of their countries and nations and socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson says that the consolidation of the revolutionary power would help consolidate and develop our socialist system, enable our people to continue to lead an independent and creative life as the genuine masters of the power and bring earlier better future.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Denounces Japanese Reactionaries' Political Terrorism \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 2 (KCNA) -- A bullet was fired at the building of the Niigata Prefectural Headquarters of Chongryon (General Association of Korean Residents in Japan) on July 29.\r\n A criminal fired at the headquarters to threaten the life of its employee and telephoned that he installed explosive at the building of the Niigata branch of the Hana Credit Association, a national financial organ of Koreans in Japan, causing more than a hundred of persons to take refugee. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We bitterly denounce the incident as it was a political plot hatched as part of the ceaseless hostile policy pursued by the Japanese right-wing reactionary forces toward the DPRK and another base terrorist act committed against the Chongryon organization and patriotic compatriots. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any terrorism against a Chongryon organization precisely means state terrorism against the DPRK as Chongryon is a legitimate organization of its overseas citizens. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard we cannot but take a serious note of the fact that Japan has resorted to the evermore undisguised moves against the DPRK and encouraged Japanese right-wing forces to incite enmity toward Koreans at home, far from honestly implementing the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration since its publication on September 17 last year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already known, the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang meeting provided a precious opportunity to put an end to the vicious cycle of mistrust and misunderstanding between the DPRK and Japan and build bilateral confidence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But hostile acts against the DPRK and Chongryon by the Japanese reactionary forces displeased with the positive process of improving the relations between the DPRK and Japan are going beyond the tolerance limit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to information available, arson, stone-hurling and damage done to Chongryon local headquarters and their related facilities numbered about 20 cases from October last year to June this year. Innumerable are cases of disruptive activities against Chongryon organs at all levels and assault and threat to Koreans in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent incident is intolerable as it was another planned criminal act that took place at a time when slanders against the DPRK, Chongryon and violence against Koreans in Japan have become unabated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits attention is that the incident took place in Niigata, which DPRK freight-passenger ship \"Mangyongbong-92\" entered in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries have recently barred the ship from calling at the port on groundless charges of \"unreasonable remittance\" and \"spy operation\". In order to hold in check the service of the DPRK ship, Japan created an atmosphere of a national chauvinism in Niigata after placing it under a \"martial law.\"  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is clear that such moves are a product of plots of the Japanese right-wing reactionary forces to create prejudice and antipathy towards Chongryon and Koreans in Japan and fan up hostility towards the DPRK in the Japanese society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are now enraged by Japan which is acting a shock brigade in executing the U.S. policy to stifle the DPRK, far from liquidating its past crimes, and resorting to more undisguised terrorism and suppression of Chongryon and Koreans in Japan. They are fully determined to take revenge on the Japanese reactionaries a thousand times    \r\n\r\n"

It is now keen to lay an international siege to the DPRK with the help of even international organizations. this policy is intolerable in view of the purpose and principle of the un charter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With nothing can the U.S. justify its wrong attempt to refer the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula to the UN in a bid to invent a pretext for a military attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the nuclear issue on the peninsula is partially handled at the un under the pressure of the U.S., the DPRK will take a strong self-defensive measure to cope with it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Channel particular efforts into creating nuclear war phobia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe \"Caribbean Crisis\" and the plan of \"Shining Pebbles,\" a version of the \"Star Wars\" plan, convinced the U.S. that it can stifle and topple progressive countries and socialist countries with ease without gun-fire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is against this backdrop that it is paying great attention to the policy of nuclear blackmail. The U.S. imperialists' vicious nuclear blackmail against the DPRK is aimed to execute that policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is futile as it is anachronistic. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and the people of the DPRK will never be daunted by the U.S. blackmail nor yield to it.

A clear proof of this is that they are planning to launch a large-scale joint military drill \"Ulji Focus Lens\" in the wake of the special unit's exercise. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a miscalculation that they try to threaten the people and army of the DPRK with precision weapons.

If he is allowed any longer to speak for the u.s. policy on the nuclear issue, this would adversely affect not only the fate of the policy but that of the administration itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bolton's reckless remarks cast a doubt as to whether the U.S. truly wants to negotiate with the DPRK or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no change in our stand on holding the six-party talks including the bilateral talks between the DPRK and the U.S. for the peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A caravan is bound to go ahead though dogs bark. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such human scum and bloodsucker is not entitled to take part in the talks in view of either the importance of the talks aimed to decide on peace and stability in Northeast Asia or human dignity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the basis of a serious analysis of Bolton's outcries in the light of his political vulgarity and psychopathological condition as they are quite different from the recent remarks of the U.S. president, we have decided not to consider him as an official of the u.s. administration any longer nor to deal with him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We may exercise self-restraint as regards other matters but will never allow anyone to slander the top leader of the DPRK whoever he is and wherever he is on earth.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
