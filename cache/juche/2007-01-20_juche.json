The anti-reunification forces within and without, however, are desperately clinging to anti-reunification moves, feeling uneasiness about this. The United States is putting pressure upon the south Korean authorities in an effort to throw a snag on the process of inter-Korean reconciliation while maliciously pursuing a hostile policy towards the DPRK with the sinister intention to block up the progress of the June 15 reunification era. With the south Korean anti-reunification forces following the U.S. in this, the peace of the country is endangered and dark clouds are hanging over the movement of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans should lift high the banner of attaching importance to the nation, defending peace and achieving unity, if they are to open the way of security and prosperity of the nation, repulsing the challenges of the anti-reunification forces at home and abroad. Only when the Koreans keep a tight hold on the above three tasks can they defend and promote the interests of the nation, smashing the outrageous interference and pressure of outside forces and the moves of the anti-reunification forces of south Korea for confrontation and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Minju Joson analyst calls upon all the Koreans to accelerate the reunification movement in response to the patriotic appeal to make this year \"a year of attaching importance to the nation, defending peace and achieving unity\" and turn out in the endeavors to fulfil these three tasks, full of conviction of victory.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This indicates that their military integration has reached a grave phase. This is a blatant challenge to the humankind aspiring after peace against war. Rodong Sinmun Friday says this in a signed article. It goes on:\r\n Shortly ago, a U.S.-Japan joint military exercise took place in the U.S. naval base in Sasebo of Nagasaki in the land of Japs for five days and a ceremony of inaugurating a PAC-3 unit, the first of its kind to be deployed in Japan, was held in the U.S. air force base in Kadena of Okinawa at the end of last year. The Japanese reactionaries test-fired in the U.S. new type land to air interceptor missile \"Ts-SAM\" manufactured in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries have systematically supplemented and rounded off their joint military operation plan and order of action since the end of the Cold War. They are now becoming undisguised in their moves to spread their operation theatre worldwide, while tightening their military alliance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The military alliance and cooperation being tightened by the U.S. and Japan with increased zeal are aimed at rounding off the U.S.-Japan offensive system targeted against the whole of Asia including Northeast Asia and igniting a new war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a more serious attention is that their reinforced military alliance is not targeted against Northeast Asia only. The \"joint strategic goal\" set by the U.S. and Japan was a prelude to the emergence of the U.S.-Japan alliance for invading the whole world as it meant their shared strategic goals in the military and security fields to cope with what they called \"new threats\" in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and Japan pin particular hope on the collusion and tie-up in the field of missile defense, while reinforcing their military alliance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They agreed to deploy the already improved new type interceptor missiles in a U.S. military base in Okinawa and, accordingly, bring additional U.S. troops to it. They concluded an agreement on the expansion of the ballistic missile defense plan which calls for jointly producing interceptor missiles and requires Japan to offer technology of ballistic missile defense to the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Frequent is the drill for getting ready in advance for using the joint missile defense system in an actual war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What draws a particular attention in the tightened military alliance is that the DPRK is made its primary target. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article calls on the world peace-loving people to heighten vigilance against the evermore undisguised moves of the U.S. and Japan to tighten their military nexus and launch a dynamic joint struggle to frustrate it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Kim Jong Il Gives Field Guidance to Industrial Establishments in Huichon City\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 19 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il gave field guidance to industrial establishments in Huichon City.\r\n The first leg of his guidance was the Huichon Machine-Tool Factory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went round the room devoted to the history of the factory, guided by senior officials of the factory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went round different production processes to learn in detail about the progress made in the technological updating and modernization of the factory and production there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Watching the automated production processes and newly manufactured modern machine-tools, he expressed great satisfaction over the fact that the factory has improved its technical equipment and mass-produced efficient machine-tools in a brief span of time and ensured a high level of cultured practice in the production at the factory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the spot he met with Merited Designers Yun Yong Sam and Son Kwang Won and praised them for having greatly contributed to the manufacture of precision and high-speed machine-tools by making persevering inquiry and sincere efforts. He also highly praised the feats performed by the technicians who have devoted themselves to the building of the socialist country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said the stirring reality of the factory is a precious fruition of the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude and a clear proof of the justice and vitality of the WPK's idea of attaching importance to science. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If one wages a tenacious struggle, paying primary attention to the development of science and technology just as the workers of the Huichon Machine-Tool Factory did, it is possible to put the national economy on a Juche-based, modern and scientific basis, he noted, underscoring the need for all domains and units to thoroughly establish a production system based on a high level of science and technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Huichon Machine-Tool Factory, the mother factory of the nation's machine-building industry, occupies an important place in putting the national economy on a Juche-based, modern and scientific basis, he said, underlining the need for it to manufacture and supply more modern machine-tools to different fields and thus make a positive contribution to reinforcing the material and technical foundation of the independent national economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that it is necessary to make sustained efforts to put the production on a high-speed, precision and scientific basis in order to boost the production of efficient modern machine-tools, he stressed the need to wage a brisk mass technical innovation movement to this end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said the factory should attain a higher goal of manufacturing ultra-modern machines now that its technological updating and modernization process have been wound up in the main and indicated the orientation and ways to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to mass-produce modern machinery as required by the new century it is necessary to intensify the drive for developing the technological updating in depth and, at the same time, applying new advanced technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The second leg of his guidance was the Youth Electrical Complex. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He appreciated the feats performed by the party members and other working people of the complex, expressing great satisfaction over the fact that they are mass-producing quality electrical appliances by successfully pushing forward the technological updating at the complex and have spruced up their work sites in a cultural and sanitary manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The last leg of his guidance was the Huichon Ceramic Factory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said it is necessary to give fullest play to the factory's production capacity in order to increase the supply of quality porcelain ware to people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The most important task facing the factory is to decisively improve the quality of products, he said, adding in order to successfully settle this problem it is necessary to steadily elevate the level of technical skill of the workers and technicians and, at the same time, widely apply advanced technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He highly praised the strong patriotic zeal of the workers in Huichon, noting that they are now dynamically advancing towards the eminence of a great prosperous powerful nation with the same vim and vigor with which they took the lead in the \"Arduous March,\" forced march full of confidence and optimism holding aloft the slogan \"Let's always be cheerful although our path is thorny.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by Pak To Chun, chief secretary of the Jagang Provincial Committee of the WPK, Pak Nam Gi, department director of the C.C., WPK, and Ri Jae Il, first vice department director of the same.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
