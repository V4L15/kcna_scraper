The anti-reunification forces within and without, however, are desperately clinging to anti-reunification moves, feeling uneasiness about this. The United States is putting pressure upon the south Korean authorities in an effort to throw a snag on the process of inter-Korean reconciliation while maliciously pursuing a hostile policy towards the DPRK with the sinister intention to block up the progress of the June 15 reunification era. With the south Korean anti-reunification forces following the U.S. in this, the peace of the country is endangered and dark clouds are hanging over the movement of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans should lift high the banner of attaching importance to the nation, defending peace and achieving unity, if they are to open the way of security and prosperity of the nation, repulsing the challenges of the anti-reunification forces at home and abroad. Only when the Koreans keep a tight hold on the above three tasks can they defend and promote the interests of the nation, smashing the outrageous interference and pressure of outside forces and the moves of the anti-reunification forces of south Korea for confrontation and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Minju Joson analyst calls upon all the Koreans to accelerate the reunification movement in response to the patriotic appeal to make this year \"a year of attaching importance to the nation, defending peace and achieving unity\" and turn out in the endeavors to fulfil these three tasks, full of conviction of victory.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This indicates that their military integration has reached a grave phase. This is a blatant challenge to the humankind aspiring after peace against war. Rodong Sinmun Friday says this in a signed article. It goes on:\r\n Shortly ago, a U.S.-Japan joint military exercise took place in the U.S. naval base in Sasebo of Nagasaki in the land of Japs for five days and a ceremony of inaugurating a PAC-3 unit, the first of its kind to be deployed in Japan, was held in the U.S. air force base in Kadena of Okinawa at the end of last year. The Japanese reactionaries test-fired in the U.S. new type land to air interceptor missile \"Ts-SAM\" manufactured in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries have systematically supplemented and rounded off their joint military operation plan and order of action since the end of the Cold War. They are now becoming undisguised in their moves to spread their operation theatre worldwide, while tightening their military alliance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The military alliance and cooperation being tightened by the U.S. and Japan with increased zeal are aimed at rounding off the U.S.-Japan offensive system targeted against the whole of Asia including Northeast Asia and igniting a new war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a more serious attention is that their reinforced military alliance is not targeted against Northeast Asia only. The \"joint strategic goal\" set by the U.S. and Japan was a prelude to the emergence of the U.S.-Japan alliance for invading the whole world as it meant their shared strategic goals in the military and security fields to cope with what they called \"new threats\" in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and Japan pin particular hope on the collusion and tie-up in the field of missile defense, while reinforcing their military alliance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They agreed to deploy the already improved new type interceptor missiles in a U.S. military base in Okinawa and, accordingly, bring additional U.S. troops to it. They concluded an agreement on the expansion of the ballistic missile defense plan which calls for jointly producing interceptor missiles and requires Japan to offer technology of ballistic missile defense to the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Frequent is the drill for getting ready in advance for using the joint missile defense system in an actual war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What draws a particular attention in the tightened military alliance is that the DPRK is made its primary target. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article calls on the world peace-loving people to heighten vigilance against the evermore undisguised moves of the U.S. and Japan to tighten their military nexus and launch a dynamic joint struggle to frustrate it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
