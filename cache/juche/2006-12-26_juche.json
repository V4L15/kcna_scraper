This is the main review and assessment of the situation this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The New Year 2007 is an important year which will witness the 17th \"presidential election.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The AINDF which has always shared the destiny with all the people in the just cause of independence, democracy and reunification has the pleasure to put up the following slogans, reflecting the steadfast will to make the New Year 2007 a year of the struggle against the GNP: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Let all people turn out in the all-out struggle for throwing overboard the GNP. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Let us decisively shatter the moves of the pro-U.S. conservative forces for confrontation with fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Let us wage a dynamic struggle for peace against war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Let us achieve the great unity of the forces for progressive reforms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Let us actively support and follow the Songun policy of the north, the pride of the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Paektu, at the highest post of the armed forces for defending the nation and this provided a surer guarantee for accomplishing by force of arms down through generations the revolutionary cause of Juche started and led to victory by President Kim Il Sung with arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Having Kim Jong Il at the highest post of the revolutionary armed forces, the north has won victory after victory in the struggle to defend socialism and in the confrontation with the United States, honorably protecting the sovereignty of the nation and the peace of the country and ushering in a new era when a great prosperous powerful nation is on the horizon despite grim ordeals and difficulties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A particular mention should be made of the fact that this year witnessed the emergence of the north as a nuclear weapon state. This is a great victory of Kim Jong Il's Songun policy as it was the greatest event of special mention in the national history spanning 5000 years, a history-making event in which the centuries-old desire of the fellow countrymen to see a powerful nation has come true. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As led by Kim Jong Il, the north is now confidently advancing toward a high eminence of a reunified strong power after declaring a total bankruptcy of the moves of the U.S.-led imperialist allied forces to isolate and stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The dawn of national reunification breaking in this land is a brilliant fruition of the outstanding leadership of Kim Jong Il who ushered in the historic June 15 era of independent reunification, the era of \"By our nation itself\" with arms of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The whole life of Kim Jong Suk was a glorious revolutionary history of a great revolutionary and woman commander of Mt. Paektu who performed the undying feats to shine long in history by devoting her all to the struggle to accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche, holding Kim Il Sung in high esteem as the sun of the nation, the letter stressed.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
