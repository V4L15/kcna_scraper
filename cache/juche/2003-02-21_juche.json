            "content": "KCNA on U.S. hostile policy toward DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 20 (KCNA) -- The situation on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia is so alarming that a nuclear war may break out any moment. This is attributable to the U.S. extremely reckless hostile policy to stifle the DPRK.\r\n The Bush administration fabricated the fiction of the DPRK's \"nuclear weapons development\" and peddled it to the international community in a bid to internationalize the \"nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula\", the issue which should have long been settled between the DPRK and the U.S. It also instigated some members of the international atomic energy agency, a political waiting maid of the U.S., to refer the issue to the un security council while crying out for a \"military counteraction\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then why is the U.S. styling itself the world's \"only superpower\" resorting to such a mean farce unbecoming for its status so desperately? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind this is a strategic aim sought by the bush administration to woo the international community to put political and diplomatic pressure upon the DPRK till it is disarmed and place the whole Korean Peninsula under its domination and, furthermore, establish its political and military supremacy over Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The heritage foundation in the U.S. already worked out an official report to the effect that success of the U.S. world strategy in the 21st century would depend on its policy toward the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It said that the U.S. absolute interests in Northeast Asia cannot be guaranteed nor can a new international order and the U.S. leading position and role be ensured in the world unless the Korean issue is settled. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The foundation's assertion about the establishment of a new international order represents the Bush administration's universal view aimed to put its strategic rivals in Northeast Asia under its political and military domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the demise of the Cold War, the U.S. shifted the focus of its world political and military strategy from Europe to the Asia-Pacific. This was based on the calculation that it can put the world under its domination only when it keeps a firm hold on the Asia-Pacific, Northeast Asia in particular, a region of strategic importance and rich in natural resources. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the view of the U.S. that Russia's military muscle has been remarkably weakened since the collapse of the former soviet union. So, it calculated that it can accomplish with ease its ambition for hegemony in the region only if it puts the Korean Peninsula, a strategic vantage in Northeast Asia, under its control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean Peninsula is a very important forward strategic base for the U.S. whose world strategy in the 21st century is to put Northeast Asia under its control and establish an unchallenged domination over the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the balance of forces was upset and there occurred on the international arena such disturbing developments as the collapse of socialism in several countries and the break-up of the soviet union, the U.S. sparked a nuclear crisis on the Korean  Peninsula early in the 1990s and worked out a plan for a \"military attack,\" calculating that the DPRK would collapse sooner or later. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, socialist Korea has been converted into a politically and militarily powerful country which no formidable enemy dares attack under the banner of the army-based policy. The U.S. had no option but to view a war with the DPRK as a \"horror story\" and agree on adopting the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework (AF), in the long-run. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was really a magnanimous measure taken by the DPRK to adopt the AF at the negotiations with the U.S. under which both sides made political, moral and legal commitments to remove the root cause of long-standing mistrust, confrontation and misunderstanding between the two countries and normalize bilateral relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If American politicians were wise enough, they should have not missed that rare historic opportunity for the sake of the future of the U.S. but opted for fully normalizing its relations with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, no sooner had the Bush administration taken office than it went so arrogant as reviving the Cold War doctrine principally aimed at \"setting right its territorial and social position unfavorable for the U.S. interests.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What upset the hard-line hawks of the Bush administration was landmark political changes in the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to active measures taken by the DPRK, its relations with several countries in the region witnessed rapid progress and a firm foundation was laid for peace, reconciliation and cooperation in the inter-Korean relations and such bold plans for reconnecting the inter-Korean railways and linking them with the Trans-Siberian railroad entered the phase of practical implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the meantime, the U.S. keen on political and military hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region found itself in the danger of being completely eliminated from the political arena in Northeast Asia due to its hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was against this backdrop that the U.S. felt an urgent need to hatch a plot to set back the positive development in Northeast Asia. The fiction of the DPRK's \"nuclear development\" was to serve this purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That was why the U.S. projected \"threat from North Korea\" and its \"nuclear development\" and worked hard to internationalize them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To this end, the bush group was busy dispatching so-called \"special envoys\" to Northeast Asian and European countries and set in motion the IAEA. It totally scrapped the AF and even went the lengths of urging Japan and South Korea not to improve relations with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration's Korea policy was a defective product as it went amiss from the outset. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is proven through decades-long confrontation between the DPRK and the U.S. that if the U.S. takes hostile attitude toward the DPRK and seeks to dominate the whole Korean Peninsula by means of war the U.S. itself will not escape catastrophe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another purpose sought by the U.S. in peddling \"threat\" from the DPRK and its \"nuclear development\" and pushing forward the establishment of \"Missile Defense System\" (MD) and preparations for a war of aggression is to put its war industry in  full-capacity operation in a bid to save the U.S. economy from depression and drive its strategic rivals to an arms race till their strength is neutralized. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Much upset by a serious crisis as evidenced by recession, a slowdown in export and increase in unemployment, the bush administration is keen to help the munition monopolies rake up huge profits through ridiculous military spending and the establishment of md in a bid to consolidate its political foundation and reenergize the economy and, at the same time, draw its strategic rivals into the arms race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is open secret that the declaration of the East-West Cold War, the Korean War, the Vietnam War and all other wars waged by the U.S. against humanity were to meet the interests of the U.S. military-industrial complexes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The national security strategy shaped by the Truman regime was to implement this plan and it has since served as a foundation of the foreign policy pursued by the successive U.S. administrations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. needs a new flashpoint for a war in order to save its economy from a crisis through escalated tensions and arms buildup. The U.S. views oil-rich Iraq and Korea, a strategic vantage, as those flashpoints. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The administration's anachronistic Korea policy went amiss this time, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any U.S. provocation to the DPRK may put its interests in the Asia-Pacific in serious jeopardy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This may lead the U.S. economy to catastrophe and, moreover, put its position as a \"superpower\" in a peril. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. had dropped its hostile policy toward the DPRK and established friendly relations with the latter, the issue of transport route, the most important issue in its efforts to develop Northeast Asia, would have already been settled, doing those countries in the region and the U.S. good. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Given that genuine economic prosperity is guaranteed by peace and free and fair world economic order, the Present Bush administration's recovery of war industry will only bring benefits to a handful of munition monopolies, while putting the majority of working people in destitution. this would make the prospect of the U.S. economy gloomier. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is by no means fortuitous that many people of the world assert that \"a rogue state is the U.S., not the DPRK and the country which should undergo a change is none other than the U.S.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the DPRK has already clarified, it has willingness to clear the U.S. of its security concern if it assures the DPRK of non-aggression including non-use of nukes by concluding a legally binding non-aggression treaty and does not stand in the way of the DPRK's economic development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. will get nothing from talking about \"military counteraction\" against the DPRK and maintaining a hard-line stand toward it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has never fired even a single shell at the territory of the U.S. if the U.S. dares start a war against the DPRK despite its warning, it will react to it with the toughest self-defensive measure.    \r\n\r\n"

The north and the south of Korea are called upon to wage a nationwide joint struggle to this end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chairman of the south side's preparatory committee Kang Man Gil, president of Sangji University, said in his opening address that if south and North Korean historians frequently meet and cooperate in the academic field  and teach the present and future generations on the basis of one and the same history book, this will be greatly conducive to accelerating the country's reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Won Ung and Kim Hui Son, South Korean assemblymen, in their speeches said that Japan is talking about the legitimacy of the war of aggression and the forcible drafting committed by it, far from making an apology and compensation  to Asian victimized nations including the south and the north of Korea, while attempting to distort history. They called on the Korean nation to pool strength to solve the issue of Japan's past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the end of the ceremony the participants looked round the materials on display. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In another development, survivors of the Japanese forcible drafting in the DPRK were interviewed by media persons on the same day.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
