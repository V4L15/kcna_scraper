This immortal exploit is recounted by the spring meeting at Mingyuegou held in the days of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe situation was grim, indeed, in the early 1930s.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe white terrorism of the Japanese imperialists triggered off by the May 30 Uprising, started by the sectarian-flunkeys without any detailed plan or organizational measures, and the August 1 Uprising swept Manchuria with greater intensity from the beginning of 1931. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Japanese imperialists went on a rampage in a repressive racket everywhere to uproot the revolutionary organizations built by the Korean revolutionaries and patriots with much effort for years.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNot only hardcore revolutionaries but also people who had followed the uprisings were all arrested or executed so that nearly all the revolutionary organizations in Jiandao were destroyed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGrave were the consequences of the May 30 Uprising.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTo cope with the situation the President moved the theater of activity to east Manchuria, where he launched into a gallant work to rally the people high in revolutionary spirit while giving guidance to various revolutionary organizations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter grasping the situation down to details while restoring and putting in order the wrecked revolutionary organizations, the President convened a meeting of Party and Young Communist League cadres at Mingyuegou in mid-May, Juche 20 (1931).\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt the meeting he made the historic speech \"Let Us Repudiate the 'Left' Adventurist Line and Follow the Revolutionary Organizational Line.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe in the speech gave a deep-going analysis to and reviewed the essence of the May 30 Uprising and put forth a revolutionary organizational line on closing the whole nation into one political force by firmly rallying the basic masses of the revolution and closely uniting the anti-Japanese forces of all strata around them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe line was fully supported by the participants in the meeting as it was the most correct line for saving the Korean revolution from the crisis and closely uniting broad masses on the side of the revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter the meeting the revolutionary organizations in Antu, not to speak of Mingyuegou, began to operate in a short time and local organizations in many areas became active one by one.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt provided favorable conditions for bringing an upswing in the revolution in east Manchuria and, furthermore, in the overall areas of the homeland and developing the anti-Japanese struggle for national liberation into an organized armed struggle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe spring meeting at Mingyuegou was, indeed, a historic meeting that brought about a fresh turn in wining over the masses on which depended the victory or failure of the revolution."

And at the meeting of the Budgetary Committee of the House of Representatives on May 7 he jabbered that \"the six-party talks are the most realistic means for settling the issue\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His remarks are, indeed, impudent and shameless.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Explicitly speaking, the Japanese chief executive has neither face nor justification to talk about the six-party talks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Aso seriously defiled the sovereignty of the DPRK, a basis on which any talks should be held, over its satellite launch for peaceful purposes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Before the launch he declared \"interception\" as a state policy, issued an order to the \"Self-Defense Forces\" to shoot down the satellite and after the launch he termed it a \"provocative act\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Everything he has done is a base behavior quite contrary to the spirit of respect for sovereignty and sovereignty equality, the life and soul of the six-party talks, in every respect. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t One cannot but ask Aso so talkative about the resumption of the talks if he has a normal thinking faculty. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He is becoming so vociferous about the talks after violating and defiling the sovereignty of the DPRK, not prompted by his wish to see the talks prove successful and the Korean Peninsula denuclearized.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan has made desperate efforts to throw hurdles in the process of the talks throughout their history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It raised the \"abduction issue\" irrelevant to the agenda of the talks, throwing a hurdle in their way and totally refusing to fulfil its obligation under the agreement of the talks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lurking behind Japan's talk about the resumption of the talks is a foolish aim to include the \"nuclear, missile and abduction issues\" in the agenda of the six-party talks under the pretext of the DPRK's satellite launch in a bid to secure a justification to turn it into a military power, realize its old dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\" it failed to do in the past and evade the responsibility for liquidating its past. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present Japanese chief executive is a descendant of the family of a wicked militarist maniac who was steeped in the ambition for aggression against the DPRK to the marrow of his bones, regarding militarism as a mode of existence generation after generation. His great grandfather forcibly walked away Koreans to Japan and forced them to do slave labor at coal mines. His maternal grandfather, a top-class anti-communist conservative, insisted that Korea should not be given the status of victor after World War II.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Born into such family, Aso asserted that Koreans \"changed their names into Japanese ones\" according to \"their hope\" though the Japanese imperialists forced them to do so and termed the Pacific war a \"greater East Asia war\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  It is now clear why Aso is trumpeting about the resumption of the talks though he is a boss of militarists in whose vein runs their blood.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What he seeks is nothing but a sinister aim to bring the issues irrelevant to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula to the negotiating table in an effort to becloud the nature of the talks and use them as a platform for realizing militarization and evading the responsibility for redressing Japan's past. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Availing ourselves of this opportunity, we would like to tell something to Aso.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has already made it clear that there is no more need to have the six-party talks now that they have been reduced to a platform for encroaching upon the sovereignty of the DPRK and disarming it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  For the Japanese chief executive to keep peddling the issue of resuming the talks and \"fulfillment of commitment\" under this situation amounts to encroaching upon the sovereignty of the DPRK and interfering in its internal affairs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If he persistently clings to the hostile policy toward the DPRK, unaware of what is happening in the world, he will suffer only bitter disgrace and ruin."

Korean Society Called for\r\nPyongyang, May 20 (KCNA) -- The Lee Myung Bak group is frantically resorting to the fascist suppression of the progressive organizations for the reunification movement and patriotic people by enforcing dictatorship under the signboard of \"pragmatism.\" This reality clearly indicates that it is impossible to achieve national reconciliation and unity and the reunification of the country unless the south Korean society is democratized.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says this in a signed article.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The people in south Korea can neither have free discussion and activities for national reunification nor can the fellow countrymen in the north and the south have contact, exchange and pool their minds and will as long as a fascist rule is enforced and dictatorship is rampant in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the law governing the development of history that the new is sure to win and the old bound to go ruin. The history of the struggle of the south Korean people for democracy against dictatorship goes to prove that the era of fascist dictatorship can never last long.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The doom of the Lee Myung Bak regime is a matter of time as it is prolonging its remaining days by dint of dictatorship and suppression, forsaken by the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is nothing to be expected from the fascist regime veiled with the word of \"pragmatism\" and there is no need to follow its attitude any longer. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean people should hold higher the banner of the anti-\"government\" struggle and wage an indomitable struggle to put an end to the Lee group's fascist dictatorial rule.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the only way of achieving national independence and the reunification of the country."

El 7 de mayo, en la Comision del Presupuesto de la camara de representantes hablo de que \"el proyecto mas realista en la solucion del problema es las conversaciones a 6 bandas\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  De veras, tal conducta es insolente y descarada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  A decir evidentemente, Aso no tiene ninguna obligacion de hablar de susodicha cita.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t    En cuanto al lanzamiento del satelite pacifico de la RPDC, Aso insulto gravemente la soberania de la RPDC, base de las conversaciones en cuestion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Antes de lanzarlo, el promulgo la \"interceptacion\" contra dicho satelite como politica estatal del Japon y dio a las \"Fuerzas de Autodenfesiva\" la \"orden de destruirlo\" y despues de lanzarlo, lo califico de \"accion provocativa\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Todos los actos de Aso son viles que contravienen al espiritu del respeto a la soberania y su igualdad, que son estrictamente la vida de las conversaciones a 6 bandas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   No podemos menos de preguntar si tal tipejo, que habla tanto de la reanulacion de las conversaciones, es o no el ser humano con la facultad de pensar normal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Aso habla mucho de la reanudacion de dicha cita, pero, no quiere la realizacion de la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana mediante las conversaciones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En el pasado, Japon vino maniobrando perversamente para estorbar todas las conversaciones a seis bandas. Presentando alli el \"problema de secuestro\" que no tiene nada que ver con el punto de la agenda de la cita, impidio la marcha de esta y nego totalmente la ejecucion de su deber relativo al acuerdo de 6 partes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La razon por la cual el pais isleno insiste en la reanudacion de conversaciones reside en incluir el \"problema de las armas nucleares, misiles y el secuestro\" en la agenda de las conversaciones a 6 bandas en relacion con el lanzamiento de nuestro satelite, adquirir el pretexto de su conversion en la potencia militar, realizar el antiguo sueno de la \"esfera de coprosperidad de la gran Asia Oriental\" no logrado y eludir  la liquidacion del pasado criminal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Aso es el descendiente de la familia del monstruoso militarista, acostumbrado del militarismo y ambicionado de la agresion a Corea de generacion en generacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Su bisabuelo arresto forzosamente a los  coreanos para imponerles duros trabajos de esclavitud en las minas de de carbon de Japon, mientras tanto, su abuelo materno, conservador anticomunista de categoria especial hablo de que no debe dar a Corea la posicion del pais victorioso despues del cese de la Segunda Guerra Mundial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Por esta razon, Aso describio el \"cambio de apellido de coreanos con el japones\" impuesto por  los imperialistas japoneses como si \"lo desearan los coreanos\" y califico la Guerra Pacifica de la \"guerra para la gran Asia Oriental\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Es muy evidente el intento de Aso de reanudar las conversaciones a 6 partes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El trata de hacer intransparente el caracter de las conversaciones al presentar los problemas que no tienen que ver nada con la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana y de aprovecharlas en realizar la militarizacion y eludir la liquidacion del pasado criminal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En esta ocasion, le aclaramos a Aso que habiamos declarado que para la RPDC no son necesarias por mas tiempo las conversaciones a 6 bandas, ya que estas se convirtieron en un lugar para violar la soberania de la RPDC y desarmar a esta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Sin embargo, si el gobernador japones sigue hablando de la reanudacion de las conversaciones y la supuesta \"ejecucion de la obligacion\", tal conducta sera violacion a la soberania de Corea e injerencia en sus asuntos internos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Si Aso recurre a la politica hostil a la RPDC sin darse cuenta de la situacion del mundo,  no evitara jamas la amarga verguenza y ruina."
