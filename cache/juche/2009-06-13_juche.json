It makes no difference to the DPRK whether its nuclear status is recognized or not. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Upon authorization, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the DPRK strongly condemns and rejects the UNSC \"resolution 1874\" and declares that it will take the following countermeasures at this early phase of all-out confrontation with the U.S. in order to defend the national dignity and the country's sovereignty. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t First: The whole amount of the newly extracted plutonium will be weaponized.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t More than one third of the spent fuel rods has been reprocessed to date. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Second: The process of uranium enrichment will be commenced.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pursuant to the decision to build its own light-water reactor, enough success has been made in developing uranium enrichment technology to provide nuclear fuel to allow the experimental procedure. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Third: An attempted blockade of any kind by the U.S. and its followers will be regarded as an act of war and met with a decisive military response. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No mater how hard the U.S.-led hostile forces may try all sorts of isolation and blockade, the DPRK, a proud nuclear power, will not flinch from them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the Songun idea-based mode of counter-action for the DPRK to decisively counter \"sanctions\" with retaliation and \"confrontation\" with all-out confrontation."
