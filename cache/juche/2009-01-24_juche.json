As if it were not enough with this, they floated the cock-and-bull story that the army’s combat capability and its loyalty to the government are waning.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This has lashed the army and people in the DPRK into great fury as it is malignant vituperation which can be spelled out only by those keen to hurt the inviolable socialist system and the single-minded unity of the DPRK, considering them as a thorn in the flesh.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is an open secret that the ill-famed intelligence and plot-breeding institutions of the U.S. including the CIA are hell-bent on releasing false reports about its hostile countries. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This time, too, they let loose sheer sophism that “those who died of chronic diseases account for 40 percent of the mortality in north Korea” and “tuberculosis, scarlet fever and measles are the most serious medical problems”, a serious distortion of the health condition of the people in the DPRK. This can not but be sophism making profound confusion of right and wrong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Anyone who has even an iota of common sense about medicine and the public healthcare system in the DPRK may know well that what they claimed is nothing but a whopping lie.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the DPRK where everything serves the people, medicine precisely means preventive medicine. Everybody benefits from the free medical care under the most popular and advanced healthcare system. Such things which the plot-breeders claim to be established facts are inconceivable in our society.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even during the '\"Arduous March,” the forced march, the Korean people firmly defended the socialist healthcare system, a legacy bequeathed by President Kim Il Sung to them out of patriotism, not yielding to the increased pressure of the hostile forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the unpopular healthcare system in the U.S. which should be overhauled or replaced by a new one. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the U.S. where money is everything preventive medicine is not in force because more medicine can be sold only when more people get sick.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to data available, the U.S. is said to have highest doctor's fee. If one wants to go to hospital in the U.S. one should be medically insured. But a great many poor people cannot afford to pay insurance. The number of such people reached 45.8 million in 2004 and 47 million in 2007.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The same is the case with those who are medically insured because the insurance keeps soaring along with doctor's fee. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The insurance accounted for 27.4 percent in the wage of a worker in 2000 but it swelled to 30.2 percent in 2008, making the people's living harder. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The “medical insurance”, therefore, is nothing but a noose to strangle people and, as a result, the mortality due to diseases is on the steady increase in the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No wonder VOA, referring to the corrupt healthcare system in the U.S. in last November, deplored that those countries opposed to the U.S. often refer to the vulnerable medical system in the country whenever they jeer it because this country is infamous for the poor health condition of people and its poor medical system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. intelligence institutions must know this. However, they released the false report, finding fault with the advantageous healthcare system in the DPRK in a bid to hurt the prestige and dignity of the DPRK in the international arena and stir up \"ill feelings\" in the society. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The more ridiculously the dishonest forces of the U.S. behave, talking about “medical problem”, the more firmly the army and people of the DPRK will defend Korean-style socialism, closely united around the party and the leader."

It is also a matter which assumes more serious nature as the Japanese reactionaries have pursued a hostile policy towards the DPRK, thus spreading contempt and bitterness towards the Koreans and fostering social prejudice in the Japanese society.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nowhere in the world is plagued with such harsh chauvinism and open terrorism against other nationalities as Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan is ill-famed for its savage suppression of Koreans in Japan and human rights abuses and the arch advocate of national chauvinism.

Bajo el sistema sanitario mas popular y avanzado, todos los habitantes viven sanos con una larga esperanza de vida beneficiandose de la asistencia medica gratuita.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn nuestra sociedad resultan inimaginables esos rumores que los conspiradores estadounidenses inventan y difunden como si fueran hechos consumados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn los periodos tan dificiles como la \"Marcha penosa\" y la forzada, nuestro pueblo defendio firmemente su sistema socialista de salud publica, herencia del Presidente Kim Il Sung, signada de calido amor por la patria y por el pueblo, resistiendo la creciente presion de las fuerzas hostiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo que hay que arreglar o erradicar es precisamente el anti-popular sistema de salud publica de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn esta sociedad capitalista, donde lo todopoderoso es el oro, no se practica la medicina preventiva porque es posible vender mas medicamentos si las personas se enferman.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun datos disponibles, EE.UU. es el pais donde actualmente es mas costoso a escala mundial el tratamiento medico. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, para recibir una consulta en el hospital, hay que contratar el \"seguro medico\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos estadounidenses pobres impotentes de asegurarse se totalizaron en 45 millones 800 mil en 2004 y en 47 millones en 2007.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa situacion de los asegurados es tambien dificil debido al incesante crecimiento de la prima y los gastos del tratamiento medico. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, la vida de los obreros se torna cada vez mas depauperada por la prima que crecio el ano pasado al 30.2 % del salario desde el 27.4 % del ano 2000. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn fin de cuentas, el sistema del \"seguro medico\" no pasa de ser una horca para asfixiar a las personas y crece la mortalidad por las enfermedades. Esto es la realidad de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDeplorando tal corrupto sistema sanitario, la propia VOA reporto que los \"paises oponentes a EE.UU. se refieren a menudo al imperfecto sistema sanitario norteamericano cuando se burlan de el\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo sabran tambien los servicios de inteligencia de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, ellos divulgaron las referidas versiones fraudulentas acusando el ventajoso sistema de salud publica de nuestro pais porque abrigan la mala intencion de enturbiar la autoridad y el prestigio de la RPDC en la escena internacional y sembrar en el interior de esta algun \"resentimiento\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA pesar de las ridiculas acciones de las fuerzas malvadas de EE.UU. como la acusacion a la RPDC del \"problema de asistencia medica\" y otros, nuestro ejercito y pueblo defenderan firmemente el socialismo al estilo coreano uniendose compactamente en torno al partido y al lider."
