            "content": "Chollima movement \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, June 8 (KCNA) -- The Worker's Party of Korea vigorously conducted the Chollima movement during the period of lying the foundations of socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It was a nationwide popular movement that called upon the masses to eradicate everything obsolete and bring about innovations in all spheres of economy, culture, ideology, and morality so as to keep socialist construction going ahead at the highest possible speed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   After the fulfillment of the three-year plan right after the war, the WPK set forth the five-year plan for national economy (1957-1961) in order to complete the work to lay foundations of socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At that time there were not a few difficulties and bottlenecks in the country. Everything including equipment, materials, manpower and funds were short of needs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The WPK called the December Juche 45 (1956) plenary meeting of the party central committee at which it put forth the policy to overcome difficulties and bring about a great turn in the building of socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The President Kim Il Sung personally visited the Kangson Steel Plant at that time and explained in detail to the workers there the difficult situation of the country and said that if they produced 10,000 more tons of structural steel it would help the country greatly, calling upon them to struggle for increased production. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In hearty response to the President's call, the workers of the plant produced miraculous 120,000 tons of steel billets in a blooming mill which had been regarded as absolutely incapable of turning out more than 60,000 tons, shattering passivism, conservatism and mysticism of technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As a result, the torch of Chollima advance flared up over Kangson and spread across the land like a prairie fire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Workers at the Kim Chaek Iron Works at that time produced 270,000 tons of pig iron with equipment whose maximum capacity had been rated at 190,000 tons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The workers at the Hwanghae Iron Works at that time built a big furnace in less than a year by their own efforts and with their own technique. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Thanks to this revolutionary enthusiasm the 1957 plan for national economy was fulfilled at 127 per cent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   During the period of the five-year plan the Korean workers produced tractors, trucks, bulldozers, large-sized water pumps, 3,000-ton press and electric locomotives in the crucible of the Chollima movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Chollima movement conducted under the wise leadership of the WPK was very instrumental in turning the DPRK into a socialist industrial-agricultural state from an agrarian country in a short period of 6-7 years after the war. \r\n\r\n"

Due to a long spell of drought and heat paddy fields are parched and rice-transplantation is suspended in some areas. Maize and other crops in dry fields are also hard hit by them.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Drought has persisted in the country for the last several months of the year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Rainfall in the granaries on the west coast including north and south Hwanghae provinces and South Phyongan Province was only 20 to 30 percent of the average record. In consequence, much less water than average years is stored in reservoirs and some of them are completely dried up and no water is to be seen in rivers and streams. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Due to this drought crops planted in spring could not sprout and crops are not doing well in this season. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As of the end of may drought hit a large area of paddy and non-paddy fields throughout the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A measure has been taken to plant non-paddy crops in paddy fields due to shortage of water. With pasture dried up, there is an acute shortage of fodder for domestic animals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Drought and heat are also adversely affecting land management and city administration and other sectors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   According to weather forecast, drought and heat are expected to persist in the days ahead. \r\n\r\n"

CBS of the U.S. is said to have reported the news on June 5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This fact was disclosed in the memo written by the then U.S. Air Force colonel Turner Rogers.

Korea branded as cause of Korean War \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 8 (KCNA) -- The U.S.'s occupation of South Korea began with landing of the 24th U.S. Army corps at Inchon port on Sept. 8, 1945, which served as the cause of the war of aggression on Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. issued \"military government ordinance\" no. 28 in November 1945 to set up a \"defense command\" and in December established a \"military English school\", the predecessor of the \"Military Academy\" of South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Saturday evening post of the U.S. March 1946 reported that the U.S. Army general staff office asserted,  attaching importance to the \"military strategical value\" of the Korean peninsula, that \"Korea is part of U.S. border at present.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The rigging up of Syngman Rhee's \"government\" gave a momentum to the preparations in South Korea for invasion of the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Coincidentally, a war slogan \"northern expedition\" appeared officially in South Korea. In late November 1948 the \"law on organizing 'ROK' Army\" was proclaimed and, under this \"law,\" the \"ROK\" Army was built into a regular army equipped with arms and services in a short span of time. In may 1949 all its brigades were reformed into divisions able to deal with modern warfare. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In order to encourage the Syngman Rhee's \"government\" to the war against the DPRK, the U.S. provided more than 105,000 rifles of various latest types, over 2,000 heavy and light machine guns, more than 50 million bullets, a large number of artillery of various types and shells, 5,000 military vehicles, 79 warships and 20 war planes in 1949 alone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. rounded off the war preparations in 1949 to invade the north and set 1950 as the year of provoking the war. \r\n\r\n"
