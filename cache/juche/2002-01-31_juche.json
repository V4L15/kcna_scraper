            "content": "Spokesman for DPRK Foreign Ministry slams Bush's accusations \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 31 (KCNA) - A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK released a statement today denouncing U.S. President Bush for revealing a reckless attempt to stifle the DPRK by force of arms.\r\n The full text of the statement reads: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. President Bush in a \"State of Union Address\" made at the joint session of the congress on Wednesday groundlessly linked those countries that go against the grain with the U.S. with terrorism, openly revealing his dangerous attempt to stifle them by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Groundlessly pulling up the DPRK over the development and possession of weapons of mass destruction, Bush let loose a string of such vituperation as terming the DPRK and some other countries as \"countries threatening the U.S. and world peace\" and an \"axis of evil\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And he blustered that the United States of America will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten the U.S. with the world's most destructive weapons.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He has been free to make anti-DPRK remarks since he came to power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But his recent remarks explicitly seek an ulterior political aim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is well known that since he came to power, U.S. friction with other countries has become frequent and international relations have got more turbulent than ever before. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is in the grip of a serious economic recession that could hardly be seen in the days of the Democratic Party administration, there were large-scale attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the U.S. Department of Defence building in Washington and large scandals related to the administration have been brought to light. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is entirely attributable to the unilateral and self-opinionated foreign policy, political immaturity and moral leprosy of the Bush administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Herein lie answers to questions as to why the modern terrorism is focussed on the U.S. alone and why it has become serious while Bush is in office. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality goes to clearly prove that the root cause of all misfortune is the reckless strong-arm policy of the Bush administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such being a hard fact, Bush, making a profound confusing of right and wrong, foolishly attempts to ascribe all accusations made against it at home and abroad due to his reactionary and chauvinist policy to \"terrorism\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a serious attention is that Bush disclosed his reckless attempt to stifle the DPRK by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There has been no precedent in the modern history of DPRK-U.S. relations that in his policy speech the U.S. President made undisguised threatening remarks on aggression and threat against the DPRK, an independent and sovereign state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is, in fact, little short of declaring a war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nice words for nice words. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We cannot but take a serious view of the dangerous remarks made by Bush from the outset of the year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His remarks clearly show what a real aim the U.S. sought when it proposed to resume the talks with the DPRK recently and why did the present U.S. administration rule out even the possibility of seeking a negotiated settlement of the nuclear and missile issues created in the period of the preceding administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The prevailing situation where the U.S. openly disclosed its intention to stifle the DPRK by force of arms makes us keenly realize once again what a just stand the DPRK took when it has followed the U.S. with vigilance and what a far-sighted policy it has pursued to equip itself with powerful offensive and defensive means, tightening its belt. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We are sharply watching the disturbing moves of the United States that has pushed the situation of the brink of war after throwing away even the mask of \"dialogue\" and \"negotiations.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The option to \"strike\" impudently advocated by the U.S. is not its monopoly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The heroic Korean people's Army and people will never tolerate the U.S. reckless attempt to stifle the DPRK by force of arms but mercilessly wipe out the aggressors.\r\n\r\n"

Kumgang tourism slammed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 31 (KCNA) -- A gang of the \"Grand National Party\" (GNP) in South Korea is pulling up the DPRK over Mt. Kumgang tourism in a bid to strain the inter-Korean relations. Commentaries on it were released reportedly by the south headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification (Pomminryon) and the reunification solidarity for the implementation of the June 15 South-North Joint Declaration and peace of the Korean peninsula.\r\n \"GNP\" president Ri Hoe Chang asserted that \"it is undesirable for the government to give financial support to the north as there is no change there\". Meanwhile, a spokesman for this \"party\" argued \"what matters is the use of the inter-Korean cooperation fund to cover the loss of a private business group\" and that \"now is the time to reshape the policy toward the north.\"\r\n The south headquarters of Pomminryon in a commentary on Jan. 22 held that Mt. Kumgang tourism is not a mere undertaking to bring profits to a business group but a symbolic work for national prosperity which reflects the desire of the nation for reunification and brings benefits to both the north and the south of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It further said: However, Ri Hoe Chang and his \"GNP\" are putting the brake on this work, clamouring about \"business theory and the principle of market economy.\" This is nothing but an anti-national act of those seeking only political interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reunification solidarity said in its Jan. 25 commentary said: The \"GNP\" group has made such silly argument as \"market economy\", applying the view on the \"value of commodities\" into Mt. Kumgang tourism, in a bid to obstruct this work. It fully reveals that they are depraved guys indifferent to morality and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"GNP\" is making desperate efforts to lay obstacles in the way of the south-north exchange and cooperation, talking about \"nationwide consensus and transparency\".      But, it will only reveal its true colors more clearly, it said.    \r\n\r\n"

He thus achieved the territorial unification and opened the way for unified development of the nation for the first time in the Korean history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His mausoleum was splendidly rebuilt on January 31, Juche 83 (1994) on the occasion of his 1117th birthday to hand down his feats to posterity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is situated at the foot of Mt. Songak of Kaephung county, Kaesong city. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Around the mausoleum there are a house for memorial service, stone statues, a monument to its reconstruction, a park, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The mausoleum covers a total area of 55,000 square meters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was built in a three-tier architectural style. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The mausoleum is railed off. There are also statues of four Korean tigers, eight civil and military officials, stone lanterns and a pair of stone posts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Exquisitely carved stone screen and other granite statues bear witness to a high level of stone workmanship in the period of Koryo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are murals on the four walls and ceiling inside the mausoleum. All the murals retain their original colors though over 1,000 years have passed since they were painted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bamboo, pine tree, blue dragon, white tiger, plum blossom and others depicted on the murals are symbolic of the firm principle, wisdom and strong spirit of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Displayed in the house for memorial service are a portrait of Wang Kon and six art works on his activities.    \r\n\r\n"
