            "content": "KPA to Take Necessary Measure against U.S. Unilateral Action \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 25 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Panmunjom Mission of the Korean People's Army released the following statement Sunday:\r\n On April 13 the south Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff formally announced that the south Korean army would take over the guard duty in the Joint Security Area (JSA) in Panmunjom so far performed by the U.S. forces and even the Oryonggye post, the last U.S. forces' post in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) handed over to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On April 11 the commander of the U.S. forces in south Korea made a similar statement at a hearing of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA side and the U.S. forces side have ensured the security in the JSA in Panmunjom for the last more than 50 years since the ceasefire in accordance with the Armistice Agreement and the agreement made in the subsequent period. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. forces side, however, announced all of a sudden that it would completely withdraw its forces from the JSA and DMZ and deploy there soldiers of the south Korean army, which is neither a signatory to the AA nor a member of the \"allied forces\", in disregard of the AA and points agreed upon between the two sides. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is massively shipping ultra-modern arms and equipment into south Korea and staging war exercises against the DPRK one after another, while putting all sorts of unreasonable pressure upon it under the pretext of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, the issue of its own making. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe U.S. decision to take even its small force out of the JSA in Panmunjom and DMZ against this backdrop indicates that the U.S. preparations for a preemptive attack upon the DPRK are under way at a final phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As facts tell, the gravity of the unilateral measure taken by the U.S. forces side without any consultation with the KPA side, a signatory to the AA, lies not in taking the small force out of the JSA and DMZ but in giving up its status as a signatory to the AA through this action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By deliberately backing off the implementation of the agreement on security in the JSA and the headquarters' area in Panmunjom the U.S. side made it impossible to ensure telephone communication and contact between the liaison officers, the last means of contact between the two sides, and the security for talks between the two sides. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By replacing the U.S. troops in Panmunjom by south Korean troops, the U.S. side seeks to give up the implementation of the AA related to the maintenance and management of DMZ set up as a buffer zone to prevent the recurrence of a war and the agreement on repair and reconstruction and security of the JSA. This clearly reminds one of the criminal act the U.S. side committed by appointing a general of the south Korean army, which is neither a signatory to the AA nor part of \"UN forces\", as a senior member of the U.S. side to the Military Armistice Commission ten years back and paralyzing all functions of the bodies to supervise the implementation of the AA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The disturbance of the order and security in the JSA in Panmunjom and the suspension of the contact and communication between the two sides in this area due to the U.S. side's unilateral step would have a serious impact on the preservation of the armistice in Korea and this would push the situation to a very grave phase of tension. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. side, however, is set to totally give up its obligation in disregard of the AA and the agreed points which have been implemented over the last more than half a century and even the practice long observed by the two sides. This situation prompts the KPA side not to allow such a thing as failure to fulfill what it wants to do, bound to the AA and the agreements between the two sides, and compels it to take whatever strong measure to protect its own security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the U.S. side is expected to give up its status as a signatory to the AA to achieve its aim, the KPA side will comprehensively examine the issue of security in the headquarters' area in the DMZ and in the joint security area, all the provisions of the AA related to security necessary for ensuring telephone communication between the two sides, contact between liaison officers and talks between the two sides in the area and the points agreed upon between the two sides and go into prompt action when necessary to take measures for protecting the security and interests in this area. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. side should not forget that both the DPRK and the U.S. are technically at war in an unstable state of armistice as they have not yet settled the belligerent relationship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is seriously mistaken if it thinks things will go on in Korea as it wishes as it is apt to expect from other countries.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The inhabitants in Maehyang-ri have suffered serious damage by noise.\r\n Terming it a victory won by the inhabitants, the All-People Measure Committee for the Closure of the U.S. Military Bombing Ground in Maehyang-ri and other related organizations and south Koreans from all walks of life who waged an undaunted struggle demanding the closure of the firing range, a signed commentary of Minju Joson today says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. military firing range in Maehyang-ri was set up in 1951 when the Korean war was raging and it has since been officially operated according to the south Korea-U.S. \"Status of Forces Agreement.\" Therefore, its inhabitants have waged a staunch struggle to get rid of the sufferings and disaster caused by war exercises staged by the U.S. imperialist aggressors there and win reparations for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Shortly ago, inhabitants in Maehyang-ri filed a law suit in a court against the authorities in order to force them to pay reparations for the damage done by noise in areas around the firing range. The court passed a final decision demanding them pay consolation money to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. military bases in south Korea are a hotbed of crimes, environmental pollution and a base from which to start a war of aggression against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The controversial firing range is expected to close off next year thanks to the staunch struggle waged by the south Koreans including Maehyang-ri inhabitants. But the U.S. is demanding south Korea provide another firing range. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities and the U.S. should dismantle all the U.S. military bases in all parts of south Korea including Kunsan, Tongduchon, Taegu, Ryongsan and Phyongthaek and withdraw the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops from south Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

He set it forth as the primary task of the revolution to train the People's Army as an invincible revolutionary army and has wisely led the struggle to carry it out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He advanced the theory of modeling the whole army on the Juche idea, a theory of building army centering on the leader, providing an immortal programme for building the revolutionary armed forces in our era as it comprehensively indicates the general goal, duty, fundamental principle and ways of building the revolutionary army in the service of the cause of socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He has pursued the unique Songun politics in the 1990s, bringing about a new drastic turn in increasing the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean People's Army has grown to be a matchless fortress and shield defending the sovereignty of the country and socialism, the reporter said, adding that it has turned into matchless combat ranks possessed of strategy and tactics peculiar to the country and equipped with offensive and defensive means powerful enough to wipe out any formidable enemy at a single stroke backed by the independent and modern national defence industry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We have exerted utmost efforts to increase the military force under the banner of Songun and thus built up a war deterrent force strong enough to destroy any new type weapon and operational means and immediately beat back any surprise aggression by imperialists. We feel highly proud of this, the reporter declared. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He called for implementing the Songun idea and the Songun revolutionary line of the WPK to augment the combat ability and might of the KPA in every way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He underscored the need to firmly establish revolutionary commanding system and military trait whereby all the servicepersons move as one by the order of the supreme commander and convert the KPA into the strongest army in the world in terms of political and ideological preparedness and military muscle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to Kim Jong Il's recent unofficial visit to China which helped strengthen the international solidarity with the Korean revolution, the reporter said that the army and the people of the DPRK would firmly preserve and glorify the shining successes and exploits he performed with his farsightedness through his energetic external activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation on the Korean peninsula has reached a serious phase due to the hostile policy of the U.S. imperialists and the moves of the Japanese reactionaries against the DPRK, the reporter said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the servicepersons and people of the DPRK are following the U.S. hypocritical talk about dialogue with vigilance and getting fully ready to effectively counter the enemy provocations in any circumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. warhawks and the Japanese reactionaries finally ignite a war of aggression despite our repeated warnings, the army and the people of the DPRK will give vent to the wrath of the nation that had been pent up century after century and use the military deterrent force it has built for decades to deal merciless and inescapable crushing blows at them and thus emerge victorious in the confrontation with the U.S. and Japan.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
