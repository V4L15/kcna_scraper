It should be done on the basis of mutual respect and trust among countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is urgent to convene an international meeting to seek ways of removing nuclear danger and take an effective action for universal disarmament including nuclear disarmament. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of the Korean Peninsula is a focal point in ensuring world peace and security. Peace and security in the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia can be expected only when the United States gives up its hostile policy toward the DPRK, respects its system and sovereignty and develops relationship on the principles of equality and mutual benefit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the stand of the DPRK to newly formulate and develop DPRK-U.S. relations in the new century.

The western reactionary circles contend that \"states including the U.S. should have the rights to interfere in those countries\" and \"they should be accustomed to the double standards.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their \"neo-imperialism\" doctrine means the doctrine of modern brand colonialism intended to revive the bankrupt imperialist colonial ruling system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The crafty nature of neo-colonialism is mainly characterized by the fact that it describes shameless aggression against a colony as \"liberation\" and economic plunder as \"aid\" and military subjugation and occupation as \"alliance\" and \"actions for ensuring security.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"new colonial policy\" is bound to go busted as it goes against the historical development and the desire of humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the law of the development of human history that nothing can stop the process of global independence which enables all the countries and nations to fully exercise their sovereignty, free from aggression, war, domination and subjugation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the daydream of the reactionaries of history to bring back the era of colonial rule, concludes the article.    \r\n\r\n"

For the DPRK, it was a good occasion to correctly understand the U.S. intention. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But what matters is the fact that he made very arrogant and threatening remarks that if North Korea did not take any action first to solve the concerns about security there would be neither dialogue nor improved relations and the DPRK-Japan relations and inter-Korean relations would collapse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The special envoy's visit to Pyongyang confirmed the fact that the U.S. administration keeps pursuing a hardline hostile policy aimed to bring the DPRK to its knees by force and high-handed practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This policy only causes the people's army and people of the DPRK to be more vigilant against the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It compels the DPRK to take every necessary counter-measure, pursuant to the army-based policy whose validity has been proved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The prospect of the DPRK-U.S. relations depends on the U.S. attitude.    \r\n\r\n"
