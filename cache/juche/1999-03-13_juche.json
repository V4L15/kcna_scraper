Jihye area\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 13 (KCNA) - General Secretary Kim Jong Il inspected a unit of the Korean People's Army (KPA) that defends the area around Mt. Jihye in the eastern sector of the front.   At the unit on the forefront he went round the Pultanggol Revolutionary Site. On September 23, 1951 in the period of the Fatherland Liberation War, the President Kim Il Sung  climbed up Mt. Jihye, the forefront, to organize and command the battle on Height 1,211 to a victory and, descending the mountain, he dropped in at a peasant's home in Pultanggol and showed great loving care.    After making round of the site Kim Jong Il said the President had endured all hardships for the freedom and liberation of the people all his life, adding that his undying exploits would shine long with the eternal prosperity of the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He went to a women's A.A.-machine gun battery under the unit.   He looked round the monument to the on-site guidance of the President.     He said that thanks to the rare wisdom, warfare method and wise guidance of the President the Korean people could defeat the formidable imperialist enemy and win a great victory.   He went round entertainment and educational and supply service facilities of the battery and told all the commanding officers of the unit to regard it as their primary duty to pay deep attention to the supply service for soldiers and always rack their wits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He looked at the combat training in firearms of women soldiers.    He underlined the importance of building up the sky, land and seas of the country into impregnable fortresses to repulse aggression on the part of the enemy.   He gave the battery servicepersons a pair of binoculars and an automatic rifle as gifts and posed for a photograph with them.   After the inspection he together with KPA officers and men  enjoyed a performance given by the art propaganda squad of combined unit no. 313 of the KPA.\r\n   He was accompanied by vice marshal Jon Jae Son, general Hyon Chol Hae and colonel general Ri Myong Su of the KPA.   He was also accompanied by vice-chairman Ri Yong Mu of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK, Kim Kuk Thae and Kim Ki Nam, secretaries, and Pak Song Bong and Ri Yong Chol, first vice department directors, of the Worker's Party of Korea Central Committee. \r\n\r\n"

Their recent senseless anti-DPRK diatribe cannot be tolerated at all.   It is the U.S. and Japan that are opposed to worldwide nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament and try to put into practice an unwarranted nuclear weapon program.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. was the first to develop nuclear weapons  and use them against humanity. It spends a colossal amount of fund as military spending for constant acceleration of \"sub-critical nuclear test\" and other nuclear weapon program.   Japan's nuclear arming has already gone beyond danger mark.   Japan has stockpiled a huge amount of fissile materials needed for nuclear arming and a nuclear power since the 1950's. It has secured means of nuclear weapon delivery, launching \"H 2\"-type carrier rocket.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Recently it was brought to light that the two countries reached a \"secret nuclear agreement,\" which acknowledges a right to introduction and transit of nuclear weapons, at the time of the \"return\" of Okinawa. This eloquently proves that they are the very ones responsible for worldwide nuclear proliferation.   However, they hatch an ill-intentioned plot against the DPRK that is defending the sovereignty from constant nuclear threats and attempt of the U.S. and Japan and work hard to mislead world public opinion with a shameless deception. This is a challenge to human peace and an insult to sound reason. \r\n\r\n"

They are now further intensifying their moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK, taking the fiction of \"the DPRK's possession of biological and chemical weapons\" as a \"second nuclear card.\"  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A news analyst of Rodong Sinmun says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their allegation is nothing but a smokescreen to cover up their true colors of the criminal who has turned South Korea into the biggest arsenal of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons in the far east and ceaselessly staged war provocation moves against the DPRK.   The United States and the South Korean rulers have created the danger of a thermos-nuclear war, a biochemical war, on the Korean peninsula.   No matter how zealously they may try, they cannot evade or shift their blame for having turned South Korea into a forward base for a thermos-nuclear, biochemical warfare onto the other side.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A signed commentary of Minju Joson says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DPRK has neither biochemical weapons nor facilities needed for their production. Moreover, there is no need for it to produce these weapons.   If the United States and the South Korean rulers persist in their anti-DPRK smear campaign in disregard of warnings of the DPRK government, they will have to pay dearly for it. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

In reference to the fact that Japanese Prime Minister Obuchi voiced Japan's hope for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council at a recent meeting with the president of the UN General Assembly, the daily describes the shameless act as behavior of those who do not mind their P's and Q's.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan is not eligible to even talk about permanent membership of the UN Security Council, the daily says, and continues:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is reasonable for an offender to make an apology and compensation to the victim.   However, Japan has not admitted all the crimes it committed against Korea and other Asian nations, let alone honest atonement.   Materials on the crimes have been made public one after another in many countries.   Japan's intention to buy a permanent seat on the UN Security Council is an insult to and mockery of the international community.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It would be something unprecedented in history if an enemy state took an important seat on the UN. Such a thing should not happen in the future, either.   Japan should honestly admit its crime-woven past and completely settle it as early as possible. Doing so is necessary for itself. \r\n \r\n"

Commenting on this, a news analyst of Minju Joson Friday says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States has no qualification nor face to judge situation of human rights in other countries. This is because human rights are being violated most ruthlessly in the United States.   Tens of millions of American people are excluded from politics, economy, culture and other domains of social life for the mere reason that their skin is different in color. Besides, a large number of poverty-stricken people are wandering about streets, looking for jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Nevertheless, the U.S. is going to \"advise\" others by means of preposterous sophistry, making a random review of their human rights situation as if it were a \"judge of human rights.\" underlying this  is an ulterior intention.   The U.S. invariable ambition is to dominate the world. So, it has ceaselessly interfered in the internal affairs of other nations to place them under its domination.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It regards \"human rights issue\" as a \"cure for all\" to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and change their political systems as it pleases.

According to the communique, the meeting discussed \"on greeting the 30th anniversary of the foundation of the NDFSK with a new leap in the revolutionary movement\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Recalling that the NDFSK has entered into a historic phase in which the great Juche idea was accepted as the guiding idea for the South Korean revolutionary movement, the tasks for independence, democracy and reunification have  become a common fighting program for the patriotic people of all social standings and the revolutionary movement has been vigorously conducted through the struggle for democratization of society and national reunification with main stress on independence from the United States, the meeting hailed this as a signal success.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It discussed and confirmed the fighting orientation and tactical policies to make a new leap in the South Korean revolutionary movement.   It examined and published the calls marking 30 years of the NDFSK.   The calls appealed to the people to hold in high esteem and follow the great sun, deeply revere Marshal Kim Jong Il, a peerlessly great man of Mt.
