            "content": "U.S. assailed for hamstringing inter-Korean exchange and cooperation\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 2 (KCNA) -- The head of the north side's delegation to the panel for reconnecting the north-south rail and road links issued a statement yesterday assailing the United States for laying a serious obstacle in the way of north-south exchange and cooperation.\r\n He said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On November 26 the deputy chief of the staff of the U.S. Forces command in South Korea, who represents the U.S. Forces side at the DPRK-U.S. general-level talks in Panmunjom, argued that if the rail and road links are reconnected between the north and south, they may be used for invasion of the south by the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Addressing round-table talks on Nov. 28, he raised the issue of crossing the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) in line with the armistice agreement. In disregard of the implementation of the points of the north-south agreement, he insisted that not only overland tour of Mt. Kumgang but also the north-south exchange and cooperation can not be allowed without a prior consent of the \"U.N. Forces.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the inter-Korean rail and road links are reconnected it will be a symbol of peace on the Korean Peninsula and promote the common prosperity and interests of the Korean nation and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Yet, the U.S. made such a far-fetched assertion that the inter-Korean rail and road may be used for invasion of the south. This is sheer nonsense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK bitterly denounces his remarks as they are a U.S. blatant challenge to the unanimous desire and will of the fellow countrymen to rejoin the severed ties of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement called on all the Koreans in the north and the south to counter with nationwide sacred resistance the U.S. unjust moves to interfere with and hamper inter-Korean exchange and cooperation including the projects of reconnecting the rail and road links.    \r\n\r\n"

Nuclear policy of the U.S. has served the political and military purpose of gaining the upperhand as the mainstay of its strategy to dominate the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is attributable to this policy that humankind experienced the danger of a nuclear war several times in the last century and the American people had to pay huge taxes for the stockpiling of nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. failed to prevent such tragedies as the September 11 incident although it is spending one billion U.S. dollars a day for development of nuclear weapons and other military purposes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis is a clear proof of the deceptive nature of the U.S. anti-peace and unpopular domestic and foreign policies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., thoughtless of its unilateralism, is demanding the DPRK scrap its \"nuclear program\" first. This is the height of arrogance and shamelessness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is practically increasing the nuclear threat to the DPRK after listing it as part of an \"axis of evil\" and a target of its preemptive nuclear attack in wanton violation of the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework and the basic spirit of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement. It is, therefore, a legitimate sovereign right for the DPRK to keep itself fully ready to cope with the enemy's threat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. has true willingness to peacefully settle the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, it should accept the DPRK's principled proposal for concluding a non-aggression treaty as early as possible.    \r\n\r\n"

In this regard Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK cannot but take a serious note of the fact that the Japanese reactionaries are chiming in with the U.S. anti-DPRK war clamours timed to coincide with the outbursts let loose by Japan's ultra-right forces that \"Japan may fight a war against North Korea\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their talk about \"deterring North Korean aggression\" is nothing but sophism to cover up their moves to stage a comeback to Korea and means a scenario for aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is intended to hamstring the implementation of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang declaration, pursue confrontation and set out on reinvasion at the instigation of the U.S. imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their reckless moves compel the DPRK to reconsider its stand on Japan's security concern. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK expressed its willingness to extend moratorium on the missile launch in the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang declaration despite the fact that its sovereignty and right to existence are seriously jeopardized by the U.S. escalated moves to stifle the DPRK and mount a preemptive attack on it. This was the most generous gesture made by the DPRK taking the ardent request of Japan into consideration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Japanese right-wing reactionaries zealously follow the U.S. policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK, persistently antagonizing it, there is no need for Pyongyang to be so lenient as to cooperate in the efforts to alley Japan's security concerns including the issue of missile testfire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are well advised to ponder over the gravity of the situation and its ensuing consequences.    \r\n\r\n"
