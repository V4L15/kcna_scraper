This drew world attention.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On Jan. 18 an Asian medium viewed the DPRK's proposal for concluding a peace treaty as a reasonable and positive one, adding that everything can be fundamentally settled only when the Armistice Agreement is replaced by a peace treaty and confidence is built between the DPRK and the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This goes to prove that whoever has reasonable thinking about the issue of ensuring peace and security in the peninsula agrees with the necessity and urgency to put an end to the hostile relations between the DPRK and the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a top priority task for preserving peace and security in the peninsula and the rest of the world to put an end to such relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK and the U.S. are in the de facto relations of belligerency due to the latter's vicious hostile policy toward the former and its moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK in order to bring down its social system. They are not simply at war technically, pursuant to the Armistice Agreement concluded in 1953. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t U.S. President Obama is openly trumpeting about \"collapse\" of the DPRK, regarding it as an enemy. Various strategies and operational scenarios for stifling it are being steadily modified and supplemented by the U.S. and its followers and its plans for political, economic and military blackmail are getting undisguised with each passing day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Consequently, the peninsula has turned into the hottest spot in the world and a hotbed of a nuclear war where an evil cycle of confrontation and tension is ceaseless and even a trifling accidental case may spark off a thermonuclear war all of a sudden.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is as clear as a pikestaff that in case a nuclear war breaks out in the Korean Peninsula, the center of Northeast Asia beset with a lot of social, historic, political and military issues, it will spill over into a regional and global nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The fundamental and best way for preventing such grave situation is for the U.S. to put a definite end to its hostile policy toward the DPRK and build a lasting peace-keeping mechanism in the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the U.S. is persistently crying out for the DPRK's dismantlement of its nuclear weapons, paying no heed to such unanimous demand of the international community. The U.S. is raising the DPRK's dismantlement of its nuclear weapons as a precondition for building the above-said mechanism. This is just like a guilty party filing the suit first.   Its scenario is to keep instability in the peninsula and threaten the DPRK by force of arms and make a military strike at it anytime and occupy it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But it is nothing but a daydream.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. desperate pursuance of its anachronistic policy for stifling the DPRK would only increase the danger of a nuclear war in the peninsula and touch off the world's bitterer criticism of it and adversely affect its security.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. would be well advised to respond to resolving this urgent matter as desired by the world, bearing in mind that putting an end to the hostile relations between the DPRK and the U.S. is directly linked with the issue of ensuring not only peace and security on the peninsula but also security in its mainland."
