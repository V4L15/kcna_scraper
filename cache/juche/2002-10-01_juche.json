Great national unity should be achieved to realize this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Achieving this unity is the best way of putting an end to the tragedy of national division and reunifying Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The territorial partition and the national split have spelled unspeakable national disasters to the fellow countrymen and blocked the uniform development of the country. it is only foreign forces that fish in troubled waters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when the country is reunified can the Korean nation pool its wisdom and efforts and enlist and use the resources and economic potentials in the north and the south in a uniform manner to turn Korea into a prosperous country. Reunified Korea would emerge the world's strongest country both in name and reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans in the north, the south and overseas should make more energetic efforts to build a reunified and prosperous powerful country on this land under the banner of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Then, why should we make joint ventures with other countries, he asked.\r\n The delegates were deeply moved by the leader putting the interests of the nation above anything else. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another anecdote about him is related to cosmetics produced at the Sinuiju cosmetics factory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is a certificate at a sample room of the factory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the certificate of a gold medal the Nowana-branded cosmetics won at the international cosmetics festival. It was a pride of the factory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il visited the factory a few years ago. Looking at the certificate he said nothing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He just took measures to modernize the factory to produce and supply high quality cosmetics to the people although it was a very difficult time when the country had to tighten its belt. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After his visit, the brand was renamed spring fragrance, widely accepted by the people, and the products have been fully supplied to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il visited the factory again afterwards. Factory officials gave him something to read. It was a letter sent by a woman living in a mountainous county in Ryanggang Province to thank the factory for face cream and powder of the spring fragrance brand it produced. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Greatly satisfied to read the letter, he said the letter was just a certificate the factory should receive.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
