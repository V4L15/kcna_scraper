Therefore, this is the criminal act fundamentally detrimental to peremptory norm.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Article 53 of the \"Vienna Convention on Treaties\" which stipulates the legal acts of states and international organizations says that \"a treaty is void if, at the time of its conclusion, it conflicts with a peremptory norm of general international law\".

Por tanto, esa locura traera solo el terrible desastre sin precedente de la guerra nuclear al Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas deben tomar la clara opcion entre las dos: la guerra segun el \"fortalecimiento de la alianza Sudcorea-EE.UU.\" o la paz segun la lucha antiyanqui.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas no podran evitar el castigo durisimo sin precedente en la historia si siguen recurriendo a la humillante sumision a EE.UU. dando espalda a la demanda de todos los sectores surcoreanos y el resto de la nacion."
