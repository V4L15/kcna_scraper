The sagacity of his leadership over the struggle to embody the Songun politics lies in that he has further strengthened and developed the military and political forces and political system built in the historic course of the Korean revolution to meet the requirements of the Songun revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Proceeding from the basic interests of the Korean revolution he gave priority to the development of the national defence industry and powerfully aroused the whole party and the army and all the people to do so despite ordeals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He has effected a new turn in the work to achieve the great unity of the nation under the banner of Songun. It is thanks to his Songun politics consistent with the principle of national independence and the WPK's policy of national reunification based on it that the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration reflecting the noble idea of \"by our nation itself\" was made public and a turning phase was opened in converting the inter-Korean relations of confrontation into those of reconciliation and cooperation and achieving national reunification by the concerted efforts of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il with his skillful and superb Songun diplomatic tactics has strengthened the international solidarity with the Korean revolution and demonstrated international prestige and dignity of the Republic. He has firmly defended the sovereignty of the country and ensured peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and in the region by always reacting to the U.S. hard-line policy with the toughest stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK, army and people of the DPRK should hold Kim Il Sung in high esteem as the sun of the nation and humankind for all ages and wage a death-defying struggle to accomplish his cause under the slogan of faith \"The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung will always be with us\" true to Kim Jong Il's Songun revolutionary leadership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should wage a revolutionary offensive to attain the higher goal of building a great prosperous powerful nation on the three fronts - politics and ideology, anti-imperialism and military affairs and economy and science -- on the basis of the political, military and economic potentials built up under the banner of modeling the whole Party, army and society on the Juche idea and consolidated in the course of the Songun revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter called on all the Koreans to invariably uphold the joint declaration and resolutely foil the moves of the U.S. and the flunkeyist and traitorous forces in south Korea, its followers, against peace and reunification by their concerted efforts and thus achieve the historic cause of independent national reunification at any cost on the principle of independence, peaceful reunification and the great national unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation on the Korean peninsula has reached a very grave phase due to the Bush administration's hostile policy toward the DPRK, the reporter said, stating that if the U.S. launches a war of aggression at any cost, persisting in its moves to destroy the DPRK with nukes while ignoring the DPRK's above-board and sincere efforts for the peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, the army and people of the DPRK led by the peerless illustrious commander of Songun will mercilessly destroy the aggressors and its stronghold with crushing blows.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Delegation\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 14 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA on Feb. 14 as regards the DPRK visit by a delegation of the Japanese Foreign Ministry:\r\n The delegation of the Japanese Foreign Ministry led by Deputy Foreign Minister Hitoshi Tanaka visited the DPRK from February 11 to 14, 2004 at the request of the Japanese side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During its stay the delegation paid a courtesy call on Kang Sok Ju, first vice minister of Foreign Affairs of the DPRK, and had talks with the DPRK side's delegation led by Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Kim Yong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of the DPRK-Japan relations, the nuclear issue and the issue of abduction were discussed at the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As regards the bilateral issue the DPRK side demanded the Japanese side clarify its willingness to implement the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration and strongly accused it of persistently resorting to its moves to stifle the DPRK by legislating on applying sanctions against the DPRK. It reclarified its stand to react to the hard-line policy with the toughest stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As regards the nuclear issue, the DPRK side said that the realization of its proposal for a reward for the freeze of its nuclear activities, the first-phase measure for a simultaneous package solution, would be beneficial to the Japanese side, too. It said if the Japanese side raises again the \"abduction issue\" at the next round of the six-way talks the DPRK side will resolutely shut out Japan's participation in the talks as requested by the army and the people of the DPRK and this will bring everything to a collapse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As regards the abduction issue, the DPRK side branded the detention of five Japanese abductees in Japan by the Japanese side in breach of the promise it had made to the DPRK as the other form of abduction. It clarified its stand that the issue of the dead admits of no further argument as it had already been probed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK side strongly urged Japan to fully apologize and compensate for its crimes such as forcibly drafting more than 8.4 million Koreans during its colonial rule and military occupation over it in the past and other hideous human rights abuses. It also strongly demanded the Japanese side immediately return to the DPRK over 20 Koreans abducted by a Japanese plot-breeding organization in the DPRK-China border areas recently at tacit connivance of the authorities.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
