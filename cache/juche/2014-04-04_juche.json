Korea\r\n Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Friday dedicates an article to the 66th anniversary of the heroic April 3 popular uprising of south Koreans on Jeju Island.\n\t\t\t\t\t Jeju islanders rose up in a popular uprising in Yonbong of Mt. Halla at the dawn of April 3, 1948 in protest against the U.S. imperialists' plot to set up a \"separate government\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The uprising was a righteous anti-U.S. and anti-fascist popular uprising to end the outsiders' domination and subjugation, and a patriotic deed that demonstrated the indomitable will and spirit of the south Koreans to achieve the country's reunification, the article says.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Calling for putting an end to the shameful history of sycophancy toward the U.S. in south Korea in order to realize the desire of the uprisers, the article goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A stumbling block lying in the way of the nation's independence and reunification is the U.S. military presence in south Korea. Only when the U.S. imperialist aggression troops are driven out of south Korea and an end is put to the U.S. colonial domination, is it possible to pave a wide avenue for independently carving out the destiny of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The struggle for independence against the U.S. is a just cause of ending the outsiders' domination and interference for aggression. The people in south Korea should categorically reject flunkeyism toward the U.S. and dependence on outsiders and wage a patriotic struggle to drive out of it the U.S. imperialist aggression troops, a root cause of all sorts of sufferings and pain inflicted on the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The article calls on the south Koreans from all walks of life to wage a more dynamic just struggle to put an end to the U.S. moves for domination and interference and to achieve the independent reunification and peace and prosperity by pooling the efforts of the Koreans in the same indomitable fighting spirit and with the same patriotic will as were displayed by the heroic resistance fighters on Jeju Island."
