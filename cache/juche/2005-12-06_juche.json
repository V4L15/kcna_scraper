We indict the U.S. as the world's greatest terrorist state and the worst human rights abuser. We appeal to all lawyers of the world with conscience, human rights organizations and international organizations that value justice and truth to decisively reject the U.S. anti-DPRK \"human rights\" campaign and send support and solidarity to the DPRK government and people in their just cause to defend the state sovereignty, a fundamental guarantee for human rights. \r\n A spokesman for the Korean Lawyers Committee said this in a statement issued on Dec. 5 in protest against the anti-DPRK \"resolution on human rights performance\" based on misinformation railroaded by the U.S. and its allies through the third committee of the 60th U.N. General Assembly. \r\n Citing the monstrous crimes against humanity committed by the U.S. in Iraq, Afghanistan and other countries, the statement continued: The U.S. is so brazen-faced as to say this or that about \"human rights performance\" in other countries, styling itself \"a human rights judge\" whom nobody recognizes. This is something preposterous which humankind cannot but deplore. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ultimate goal of the anti-DPRK \"human rights\" campaign the U.S. has staged with the mobilization of its followers even on the U.N. forum is to destroy Korean-style socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Having found it hard to force the DPRK to scrap its nuclear program first in a bid to disarm it, the present U.S. administration steeped in the inveterate rejection of the system in the DPRK puts up a \"human rights\" signboard and leaves no means untried to label the DPRK a \"lawless state.\" The present disturbing reality that a crime committed by the strong is treated as a good conduct while the week's good conduct is regarded as an evil deed deeply convinces the Korean people of the truth that human rights precisely mean national sovereignty and this sovereignty can be guaranteed only by strong deterrent, the statement concluded.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japanese Reactionaries' Reckless Campaign against Chongryon under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 5 (KCNA) -- The Japanese reactionaries \"brought an action\" against the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon). This is intended to do harm to and slander Chongryon so as to tarnish the authority and dignity of the DPRK, incite bitterness toward Chongryon and the DPRK among Japanese and create a social atmosphere favorable for reviving militarism.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday observes this in a signed commentary in connection with the fact that the Resolution and Collection Corporation of   Japan filed a suit in the Tokyo Metropolitan Court against Chongryon over the \"issue of bad bond\" of the Credit Association of Korean Bank. It goes on:\r\n What matters is that the authorities are directly involved in the anti-Chongryon campaign. For example, Chief Cabinet Secretary Abe supported the above-said action as if he had waited for this to happen, asserting that it was a \"proper counteraction\". This clearly suggests that the recent action was a plot hatched under the direct manipulation of the Japanese authorities and at their instructions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a more serious attention is that Abe, spearheading the anti-Chongryon campaign, blared that \"it would not directly affect\" the inter-governmental talks between Japan and the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has brought the DPRK-Japan relations to an extreme phase while blindly toeing the U.S. line and persistently pursuing the hostile policy toward the DPRK in contravention of the spirit of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration. It persistently raised the abduction issue which had already been settled through the declaration in an attempt to politicize and internationalize it and thus tarnish the dignity and image of the DPRK. Not content with this, it has further intensified its anti-DPRK campaign over its \"nuclear and missile issues.\" It is Japan which has taken the lead in laying an \"international siege\" to the DPRK, pursuant to the U.S. policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Should Japan persist in such acts, it will only bring the DPRK-Japan relations to a dangerous phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities had better behave themselves with cool heads.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
