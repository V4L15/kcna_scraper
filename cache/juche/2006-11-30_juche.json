            "content": "It's time to Put Period to U.S. Arbitrary and High-handed Practices\r\n                         --KCNA Analyst--\r\n \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, November 29 (KCNA) -- It is the prevailing trend of the world situation that voices critical of the U.S. bellicose foreign policy and the \"anti-terror war\" are growing stronger worldwide.\r\n The results of the midterm Congressional election in the United States in which the Democratic Party came to dominate both houses are a proper judgement meted out to the foreign policy of the present U.S. administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the wake of the Republican defeat in the midterm election, Rumsfeld, the main player in executing the war policy of the Bush administration, was compelled to resign as secretary of Defense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Prior to the midterm election, U.S. media unanimously called for the ouster of Rumsfeld. This was prompted by their disillusion with the Republican forces which have pursued domestic and foreign policies of aggressive, unpopular and reactionary nature which are characterized by arbitrary and high-handed practices. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Americans feel tied of bellicose Bush forces' anti-terror war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the opinion poll conducted by News Week throughout the country, the overwhelming majority of the respondents described the Iraqi war as a completely wrong war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bush, finding himself in a weak position politically in the wake of the Republican setback in the midterm election, kicked off his untimely world trip in a bid to improve the U.S. international image. This is well illustrated by his participation in the APEC Summit and his junket to Asian countries including Indonesia.  But all this went against his intention. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n. Bush suffered an unprecedented diplomatic failure in the wake of his defeat in the midterm election due to his hard-line and hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Before and after the APEC Summit and his junket to Asian countries, protest against the U.S. foreign policy and \"anti-terror war\" further mounted in this region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bush was so cold-shouldered in Vietnam that he could not come out of the bullet-proof car but had no option but to remain seated there. People in some ten cities in Indonesia including Jakarta strongly demanded that Bush be treated as a war criminal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the facts reflect the towering indignation of the international community against the U.S. unprecedentedly high-handed and arbitrary practices and its open state terrorism, infringement upon other countries' sovereignty and human rights abuses. And they indicate that it is time to put an end to the U.S. behaviors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a historical lesson that a policy running counter to the desire of humankind is bound to meet a fiasco.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, November 29 (KCNA) -- The anti-U.S. struggle mounting to an ever greater crescendo among the south Korean people today proceeds from the historical lesson that they cannot think of human life and dignity, to say nothing of the country's reunification and prosperity, without terminating the U.S. policy of occupation and domination which has lasted for more than 60 years, declares Rodong Sinmun Wednesday.\r\n Noting that many areas of south Korea are scenes of furious rallies, protests and general strikes against the signing of the \"Free Trade Agreement\" with the U.S. and sanctions and blockade against the DPRK and new war provocation moves of the U.S. imperialists that gravely threaten peace of the Korean Peninsula, the author of the article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-U.S. struggle of the south Korean people is a patriotic struggle of justice for defending the nation's dignity, independence and vital rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a link in the whole chain of the righteous patriotic struggle to pave the way for independent reunification through the nation's unity and cooperation under the banner of \"By our nation itself,\" the main spirit of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people are waging the struggle to implement the joint declaration in close combination with the struggle against the U.S. and war, holding that the declaration is, immediately, the banner of independence against the U.S. and herein lies the peace and reunification of the country. Their intensive struggle demonstrates firm resolution and will to shatter the anti-peace, anti-reunification policy of the U.S imperialists hell bent on a war of aggression against the DPRK and permanent division of the Korean Peninsula and bring about a new society of national independence and a new day of reunification at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-U.S. struggle in south Korea is a confrontation between progress and conservatism, patriotism and treachery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Victory in the anti-U.S. and anti-war struggle is in store for the south Korean people fighting in close unity for peace and independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-U.S. organizations and people of all social strata in south Korea should thwart and smash the U.S. imperialists' moves to provoke a new war and hinder the implementation of the June 15 joint declaration with united strength by tightening unity and solidarity. And they should wage more gallantly the just patriotic struggle to drive the U.S. imperialist aggression forces out of south Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The payment has been pushed forward from 2000.\r\n In this regard, Minju Joson Wednesday runs a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should have made up its mind to liquidate its past earlier than Germany, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has not yet made a bold decision to compensate for its inhumane crimes till Germany finishes its liquidation of the past crimes. Far from making compensation, Japan has not even admitted them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This clearly shows the narrow-minded view of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan seemed very \"brave\" when it committed such hideous crimes against humanity as unimaginable crimes related to \"comfort women\" for the Imperial Japanese Army. However, it is so coward in handling the issue of settling its past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan looks so shabby when compared with what Germany has done so far. Nevertheless, Japan is ridiculously coveting a responsible post at the UNSC. Such an act can be done only by a political dwarf. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should clearly know this. Germany is by no means inferior to Japan when it has begun redressing its past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With such narrow-mindedness Japan can hardly become full-fledged member of the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This means that unless Japan makes up its mind it will be isolated from the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to have a right choice.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is an undisguised act of supporting and defending Israel's brutal killings and an application of unfair double standards in dealing with the human rights issue.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Wednesday observes this in a signed commentary. This once again fully disclosed the despicable nature of the U.S. as the worst human rights abuser, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. behavior indicates that though the U.S. claims it stands for the peace and stability in the Middle East it, in actuality, has only encouraged Israel in the moves to expand its territory and abuse the rights of the Arab people, while aggravating the situation in the Mideast and seeking its despicable strategic interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people in the region are responsible for the settlement of the Mideast issue. The justifiable efforts of the Arab countries to find a fair and comprehensive solution to the Mideast issue are supported by the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Israel should immediately stop its military strikes at Palestine and massacre of civilians and withdraw its aggressor armed forces from all the occupied Arab territories as early as possible as unanimously demanded by the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should halt defending and encouraging Israel in its criminal acts against the Arab world including Palestine.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
