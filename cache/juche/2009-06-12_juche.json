It is letting media use such misinformation as \"the north's preparations for a missile launch\", \"restarting nuclear facilities\" and \"stockpile of ammunition\".  It is also making phone calls to \"legislators\" to let them know about the above-said misinformation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The unprecedented much fuss made by the Lee group about \"information about the north\" was prompted by its wicked and foolish attempt to calm down the anti-Lee Myung Bak resentment of people from all walks of life which has reached the point of eruption in the wake of the death of the former \"president\" in south Korea, get rid of a tight corner and justify the fascist suppression of the forces supporting the June 15 joint declaration under the pretext of \"security,\" the information bulletin notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The secretariat vehemently denounces the Lee group's opening of \"information about the north\" as another vicious anti-DPRK racket to incite the consciousness of confrontation with the DPRK in south Korea, build up public opinion on \"security crisis\" in a bid to weather the ruling crisis and justify its moves for confrontation and war against fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group is sadly mistaken if it thinks it can get rid of the abyss of ruin through false propaganda aimed at inciting the confrontation with fellow countrymen and red herring.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group had better make an apology before the nation for its crimes against the nation, people and reunification and immediately step down without delay instead of working hard to prolong its despicable remaining days through such mean and nefarious anti-DPRK ruckus."

But when the story turned out to be a plot of the CIA it became a laughing stock of the world and the U.S. stopped talking about it any longer as it was nothing but a poor scenario with neither plausibility nor evidence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As widely known to the world, it is south Korea and the U.S. where counterfeit money is openly circulated and all sorts of irregularities and swindles are rampant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This being a hard reality, the puppets, in league with the U.S., revived the outdated anti-DPRK scenario which had been thrown into the dumping ground after its true nature was brought to light. This only reveals the deplorable position of those forces hostile to the DPRK in which they find themselves, much upset by their failure to seek a pretext for imposing additional \"sanctions\" against the DPRK over its just measure for bolstering up its nuclear deterrent for self-defence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak group would be well advised to stop peddling the U.S. hackneyed scenario that can convince no one so that it may not suffer bitter shame and confess to all cases of irregularities and corruption."
