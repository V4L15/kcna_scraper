On Feb. 12, 1957 the U.S. was closeted with the south Korean puppet forces over the deployment of nukes in south Korea and unilaterally declared the abrogation of paragraph d of article 13 of the Armistice Agreement banning the shipment of new weapons at the 75th meeting of the Military Armistice Commission held in June that year. In July it declared its forces present in south Korea would \"start arming themselves with nukes\". On January 29, 1958 the U.S. officially announced that nukes were introduced into units of the U.S. forces in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt has systematically shipped nukes into south Korea and, at the same time, built and expanded nuclear arsenals in its different parts and introduced even units in charge of stockpiling nuclear bombs and distributing equipment to get fully prepared to ignite a nuclear war any time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. has long attempted to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK. It deployed nukes in south Korea for the first time in August 1950, the early period of the Korean war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe successive ruling quarters of south Korea not only allowed the U.S. to introduce nukes but worked with bloodshot eyes to do harm to fellow countrymen with nukes in league with foreign forces for aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA nuclear war has not yet broken out on the Korean Peninsula even amid the ever-mounting nuclear threat of the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppet warmongers entirely thanks to the DPRK's nuclear deterrent for self-defense.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNow that the UN Security Council whose mission is to safeguard the independent rights and security of its member nations has been reduced to a defunct marionette international body which is playing into the hands of the U.S., it has become clearer than ever before that the sovereignty of the country and the nation should be defended by one's own powerful strength, not by words and appeal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK will never abandon its right and position gained by it at the cost of blood but bolster up its nuclear deterrent for self-defence in every way to safeguard the dignity and sovereignty of the nation as firm as a rock."

Y en la 75a reunion de la Comision Militar de Armisticio, realizada en junio del mismo ano, declaro unilateralmente la cancelacion de la clausula D del articulo 13 del Acuerdo de Armisticio que prohibe la introduccion de armas modernas. En julio, anuncio que las tropas norteamericanas ocupantes del Sur de Corea \"comenzaran el armamento nuclear\" y el 29 de enero de 1958, confirmo oficialmente el despliegue de armas nucleares en sus unidades distribuidas en el Sur de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl mismo tiempo, EE.UU. construyo y amplio los depositos nucleares por doquier del territorio surcoreano y desplego hasta las unidades encargadas de la conservacion y suministro de bombas atomicas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe esta manera, ultimo todos los preparativos para desatar la guerra nuclear en cualquier momento. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa intencion de EE.UU. de atacar preventivamente con armas nucleares a la RPDC se remonta a agosto de 1950, periodo inicial de la pasada guerra coreana, cuando emplazo por primera vez esos artefactos en suelo surcoreano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos sucesivos gobernantes surcoreanos permitieron la entrada de esas armas de destruccion masiva y actuaron con frenesi para atacar con ellas a la parte connacional en contubernio con las fuerzas agresoras extranjeras. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la Peninsula Coreana no se ha desatado todavia la guerra nuclear gracias al disuasivo nuclear de autodefensa de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPuesto que el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU, que toma por su mision garantizar los derechos soberanos y la seguridad de los paises miembros de la ONU, se ha hecho como herramienta de EE.UU., se hizo evidente que la soberania de cada pais y nacion no se defiende con llamamientos o palabras sino con fuerzas propias. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC no renunciara jamas sus derechos y posicion conquistados a costa de sangre y consolidara por todos los medios su disuasivo nuclear de autodefensa para defender la dignidad y la soberania de la nacion."
