All sorts of false propaganda conducted by them against the DPRK are aimed at serving this purpose. It is an operation to be carried out by them prior to invading it by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, they are staging large-scale military exercises one after another after massively bringing aggression forces and modern military hardware into south Korea and its vicinity under the pretext of the non-existent \"threat from north Korea\" and the like. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are planning to conduct \"Ulji Focus Lens\" joint military exercises in the wake of \"RIMPAC-2006\" joint war maneuvers. These reckless moves against the DPRK have created such a tense situation on the Korean Peninsula that a war may break out there any moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Progressive mankind is called upon to heighten the vigilance against the U.S. imperialists' sheer false propaganda, aware that it is bound to be followed by military aggression.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He expressed great satisfaction over the fact that they have produced and supplied a huge quantity of hare meat to the servicepersons every year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He visited the house of Yun Ho Jung, manager of the farm who has worked there for years. There he was told about the experience gained by his family in breeding rabbits. He praised the family for having set a good example in rabbit raising through the efforts of all its members. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il said that Yun has worked hard, single-mindedly determined to carry out the WPK's policy of stock-breeding to the letter, and thus made a great contribution to the development of the nation's stock-breeding. He highly appreciated Yun's ardent patriotic spirit, saying that Yun is a genuine patriot as he has devoted all his wisdom and energies to the prosperity of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The farm has clearly proved in practice the advantages of the rabbit raising, he noted, underscoring the need for all units to earnestly follow its example. The next leg of his inspection was a goat farm of the unit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went round the production processes where all kinds of work from milking to milk processing is done by modern machines and cultural and public service facilities kept neat and tidy. He highly praised the feats performed by servicepersons of the unit, expressing great satisfaction over the fact that they are mass-producing a variety of processed milk products on the modern farm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He set forth tasks to be tackled to manage and operate the farm, underscoring the need to improve the goat raising and ensuring full-capacity operation of the equipment to increase the supply of goat milk and processed milk products to the servicepersons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Looking round the new pasture created by the unit, he said it is important for stock-breeding to create grazing land and underlined the need for the goat and rabbit farms to pay deep attention to this matter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As our country has many mountains, it is possible to raise goats and rabbits and other grass-eating animals in every part of it, he noted, calling for more dynamically conducting this work in a mass movement to bring about a signal leap forward in turning out livestock products. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by KPA Generals Ri Myong Su, Hyon Chol Hae and Pak Jae Gyong and Ri Je Gang and Ri Jae Il, first vice department directors of the C.C., WPK, and Hwang Pyong So, vice department director of the same.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
