All sorts of false propaganda conducted by them against the DPRK are aimed at serving this purpose. It is an operation to be carried out by them prior to invading it by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, they are staging large-scale military exercises one after another after massively bringing aggression forces and modern military hardware into south Korea and its vicinity under the pretext of the non-existent \"threat from north Korea\" and the like. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are planning to conduct \"Ulji Focus Lens\" joint military exercises in the wake of \"RIMPAC-2006\" joint war maneuvers. These reckless moves against the DPRK have created such a tense situation on the Korean Peninsula that a war may break out there any moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Progressive mankind is called upon to heighten the vigilance against the U.S. imperialists' sheer false propaganda, aware that it is bound to be followed by military aggression.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At that time the U.S. forces side hushed up the case by asserting that the plane wrongly killed the fishermen by mistaking fishing boats for rocks and had made desperate efforts to keep the truth about the case buried into oblivion for more than half a century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This time a civic organization on Ullung Island found out specific evidence such as shrapnel and unexploded bombs proving mass killing of civilians committed by the U.S. forces on Tok Islet, depriving the U.S. of any excuse to evade the responsibility for the massacre. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The case substantially proves that the U.S. occupation of south Korea was not to protect the south Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people can never be free from any misfortune and disasters so long as the U.S. troops remain in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an act of treachery to ask the beast-like U.S. imperialists to protect the \"security\" of south Korea because they indiscriminately kill civilians even in peacetime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should take a step to force the U.S. troops to withdraw from south Korea as demanded by the people.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
