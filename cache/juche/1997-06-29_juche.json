And the puppet police issued an order to arrest 147 leading members of \"Hanchongryon\" including its Chairman Kang Wi Won and scattered 200,000 leaflets related to it across south Korea.\r\n   Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun Sunday says this shows that the reckless white terrorism of the puppets to stifle \"Hanchongryon\" and patriotic student movement is reaching the climax. \r\n   The daily notes: \"Hanchongryon\" will neither be daunted nor disorganized by the intrigues and fascist sword-brandishing of the Kim Young Sam group. It is foolish to try to dissolve this organisation.\r\n   Kim Young Sam must stop suppression of the students' righteous activities and step down at once. \r\n\r\n"
