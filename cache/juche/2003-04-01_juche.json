            "content": "Japanese reactionaries' moves under fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- The Japan Defense Agency set up the \"headquarters for emergency measure\" right after the U.S. start of the Iraqi war in a bid to support the U.S. military forces participating in the attacks on Iraq and intensify alert and watch on the DPRK, Nihon Keizai Shimbun said.\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are stepping up their preparations for reinvasion of the DPRK on the occasion of the U.S. war against Iraq, Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarist forces dispatched aegis to the East Sea of Korea and launched an intelligence satellite, aiming at reinvading Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are building up military strength to realize their ambition for overseas expansion with the backing of the U.S. and taking the DPRK as the first target of their attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAccordingly, their military strategy is focused on aggression on Korea. Their reckless moves, prompted by hostile hysteria against the DPRK, are a realistic danger. Bellicose remarks are made in Japan that a preemptive attack should be made on North Korea. We can not remain a passive onlooker to the reckless moves of the Japanese militarist forces, buoyed up by zeal for reinvasion as regards the U.S. war against Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan continues to run amuck in the preparations for reinvasion with the backing of the U.S., it will pay a very high price.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA refutes Japan's sheer sophism \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- A Japanese delegate addressing the 59th UN meeting on human rights held in Geneva on March 19 let loose the sheer sophism that the Japanese government has done its utmost to settle the issue of abduction  of Japanese, but the DPRK has refused to \"cooperate\" with it, arguing that North Korea's kidnapping of Japanese was a serious human rights abuse.\r\n This was a maladroit trick to internationalize the DPRK's \"issue of human rights\", tarnish its image and thus shirk its political and moral responsibility for having evaded its responsibility to redress its past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already clarified by the DPRK more than once, the issue of abduction of Japanese has been already settled. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan did enormous human and material, spiritual and moral damage to the Korean people in the last century. But the DPRK, prompted by its bold decision to eliminate the leftover of its past relations with Japan in the new century, fully probed the truth behind the abduction of Japanese accidentally perpetrated by individuals and met the request of Japan to send five Japanese survivors home for the time being. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At that time the Japanese authorities promised to create an atmosphere for those survivors to make together with their families an independent decision on their future after their return to the DPRK from their 10-day hometown visit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the Japanese authorities reneged on their promise. They unilaterally decided on the permanent residence of the survivors and have not yet allowed them to reunite with their families. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If there is something unsettled as regards the issue of kidnapping, it was caused by the perfidy on the part of the Japanese authorities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After backtracking from the internationally recognized agreement and faith between the two states, Japan is making a clumsy excuse that it has done its utmost. This only brings its political and moral vulgarity and shamelessness into bolder relief. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan tops the world list of kidnappers. It kidnapped and drafted more than 8.4 million young and middle-aged Koreans to hurl them into battle fields or force them to do slave labor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThey forced at least 200,000 Korean women into sexual slavery for the Japanese army, killing most of them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was disclosed recently that some agents of the bogus organization called the \"fund for rescuing North Korean refugees,\" a non-governmental organization of Japan, made their way into the area of the DPRK-China border and kidnapped at least 20 Japanese spouses and Korean returnees from Japan in the DPRK and took them to Japan. This incident is creating a furore. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities should punish those responsible for kidnapping and taking DPRK citizens to Japan and open to the public the truth behind the above-said incident before talking about the issue of the kidnapping of Japanese. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan can neither hold up its head nor have its say on the international arena unless it redresses its biggest crimes committed against the Korean people in the last century and probes and opens to the public the truth behind the recently disclosed case of kidnapping. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities should make a political decision on whether Japan will honestly redress its past in the spirit of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration or continue beautifying its crime-woven past to remain recorded as a criminal state.    \r\n\r\n"

The drill is obviously part of war preparations for stifling the DPRK by force of arms, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists, he noted, seek to heighten the tension on the Korean Peninsula and \"punish\" the DPRK as a \"nuclear culprit\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean army is fully prepared to counter their war preparations, keeping a close eye on their reckless moves to stifle the DPRK, he said. It is the unswerving stand of the Korean People's Army to answer good faith with good intention and counter a tough policy with a tougher stance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Jong Nam Won, an officer of the KPA, said the U.S. imperialists' aggressive nature and their plan to invade the DPRK have remained unchanged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States, under the pretext of the \"nuclear issue\", intends to launch an invasion of the DPRK and stamp out its socialist society centred on the masses of the people, he said, adding: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We accuse Bush of seeking an invasion of the DPRK, while giving a lip service to \"dialogue\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Hae Yon, a KPA officer, said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Iraqi war and the U.S.-South Korea military exercises make us clearly know of what we should do more, while making full preparations to defend ourselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Once it has become apparent that the U.S. choice is to unleash a war against the DPRK, the Korean army is keeping itself fully prepared to cope with their new war preparations.    \r\n\r\n"
