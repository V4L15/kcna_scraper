The U.S. command should have taken those commanding officers concerned to task under the law, the paper said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Describing this paper as \"very noteworthy\", a spokesman for the committee said: its assertion that the U.S. army officers should have been brought to task is very just and objective. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Reporting about the facts, the newspaper said the paper is expected to cause a great sensation though it was made public belatedly as it has totally refuted the conclusion made by the South-Korea-U.S. joint fact-finding group in January last year that \"Rogun-ri incident was accidental.\"    \r\n\r\n"

It clarifies the way of reunification by federal formula on the basis of recognizing and tolerating different ideologies and systems in the north and south and on the principle of co-existence, co-prosperity and common interest, thus providing a solid cornerstone for the north and south to advance toward reunification with confidence with a common design for national reunification.\r\n The joint declaration also reflects the principle of great national unity, one of the three principles. When the whole nation unites to form one driving force, it means reunification.    \r\n\r\n"

They massively killed Koreans by indiscriminately using germ and toxic chemical weapons in violation of the international law in the whole period of the Korean War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The barbaric germ warfare carried out by the U.S. forces was premeditated and organized killings committed under the instruction given by the U.S. joint chiefs of staff and by order of the U.S. far eastern headquarters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This notwithstanding, the united states has not yet admitted these crimes though five decades have passed since then but is threatening humankind with massively stockpiled biological and chemical weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is now pulling up the DPRK over the non-existent \"issue of biological and chemical weapons\" like a thief crying \"stop the thief\". This is aimed to divert to the DPRK the international community's watchful eyes focused on Washington and further step up preparations for a biological and chemical war behind that smokescreen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Also lurking here is a sinister intention to invent a pretext for putting increased pressure upon the DPRK in pursuance of its hostile policy towards it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With no artifice can the united states ever evade the chief responsibility for perpetrating the barbaric germ warfare and hide its true colours as the arch criminal threatening humankind with biological and chemical weapons.    \r\n\r\n"
