The economic and military growth of Russia and China is posing threats to the U.S. hegemonic position. Fierce armed conflicts in the Near East are sapping the strength of the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As all this was an inevitable product of the U.S. brigandish moves for aggression and world domination, it should have drawn a due lesson from this. But the U.S. worked out a more dangerous military strategy and has resorted to military actions, pursuant to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the above-said report the U.S. scenario for world domination has gone the lengths of openly defining armed forces of the DPRK, Iran, Russia and China as \"those of enemies\". A particular mention should be made of the fact that in the said report the U.S. defined China as a \"country posing greatest threats to the U.S.\", a country with the biggest possibility to clash with the U.S. forces. It is expressing strong caution against China's growth of military capability and military modernization, openly calling for substantial counteraction against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Experts in the U.S. were unanimous in asserting that the report underscored notably the possibility of armed conflict between China and the U.S. It proves that the new military strategy is related to containing China in many aspects.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A high-ranking official of the U.S. military said that the new military strategy included the operations for deploying armed forces now under way. The U.S. is deploying armed forces in the Asia-Pacific region in a bid to finally aim to contain China. These two facts clearly indicate what the final goal of this strategy is.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In fact, the U.S. is busy deploying in south Korea THAAD which has China within the radius of its operation. Those concerned of the U.S. Department of Defense are openly saying that the development of ultra modern supersonic missile is aimed to cope with China's development of supersonic weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality proves that the U.S. is mulling finally attaining its criminal goal for world hegemony by totally containing a \"state posing greatest threat\" to the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is by no means fortuitous that military experts are commenting that the U.S. new military strategy making military conflict with China a fait accompli is an \"operation plan simulating the third world war\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is the arch criminal disturbing world peace and security and the most shameless empire of evils.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The new military strategy is driving military confrontation and contradiction between the U.S. and China into the worst phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The human history branded all attempts to become the emperor of the world as a futile act of inviting a ruin.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Many countries and regions of the world are strongly countering the U.S. moves for hegemony.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should properly face up to history and reality and stop acting rashly."

Ademas, presento una nueva concepcion de operacion basada en el plan de adaptacion y cambio de tropas norteamericanas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn virtud de la nueva estrategia nombrada como \"victoria en el mundo complicado\", se ubicaran en ultramar las 7 de las 10 comandancias norteamericanas a nivel de division y se aumentaran en gran cantidad los pertrechos de infanteria como helicopteros de transporte, en lugar de reduccion de armas pesadas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste plan aventurero tendente a mantener a rayas a los paises, que no le agradan, y realizar a toda costa la ambicion de hegemonia mundial provoca gran repudio de la sociedad internacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora EE.UU. tropieza con graves desafios en las relaciones exteriores. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa resuelta lucha antiyanqui de la RPDC por la defensa de la soberania impide el cumplimiento de la estrategia norteamericana de hegemonia sobre la region de Asia-Pacifico.

La meta final de la ubicacion de las fuerzas armadas norteamericanas en la region de Asia-Pacifico es mantener a rayas a China. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn efecto, EE.UU. acelera el emplazamiento del sistema THAAD en el Sur de Corea cuyo radio operacional abarca hasta China y los relacionados del Departamento de Defensa norteamericano dicen que el desarrollo de misil ultrasonico es para hacer frente al desarrollo de armas supersonicas de China. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa realidad comprueba que EE.UU. pretende alcanzar finalmente su meta criminal de hegemonia mundial al doblegar por completo al \"pais mas amenazante\" del mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos especialistas militares califican la nueva estrategia militar de EE.UU., que toma como hecho consumado el choque armado con China, de \"plan operacional que supone la tercera guerra mundial\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. es el perturbador de la paz y seguridad del mundo y el mas cinico imperio del mal. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido al establecimiento de la estrategia en cuestion, se agravaran mas el antagonismo y el enfrentamiento militares entre EE.UU. y China.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa historia de humanidad estigmatizo todos los intentos de hacerse el Zeus del mundo como  actos imprudentes que buscan el arruinamiento. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora muchos paises y regiones del mundo hacen frente rotundo a las maniobras hegemonicas de EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste pais debe actuar con prudencia viendo correctamente la historia y la realidad."
