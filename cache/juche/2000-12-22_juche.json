The same can be said of the planned deployment of \"F-2\" fighters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are capable of making sorties into the Korean peninsula from the west coastal area of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The projected creation of the ground SDF divisions is a link in the chain of the premeditated and systematic moves for reconquest of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their plot to organize special forces also draws attention as the DPRK will be made the main target of the operation of those forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As seen above, the new plan signifies a green light to Japan's reinvasion of Korea.    \r\n\r\n"

The issue of Korean reunification should be solved under any circumstances by the efforts of the Korean nation possessed of the spirit of national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National character serves as an important cornerstone of the great national unity as the nation was split by foreign forces and differing ideologies and systems exist in the north and the south.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
