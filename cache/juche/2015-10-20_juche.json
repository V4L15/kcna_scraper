This is a clear proof of the sincere efforts made by the DPRK government to avert a war and defend regional peace and stability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But these efforts have not yielded desired fruits due to the U.S. vicious hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In November 1953, the U.S. set it as its final goal on Korea to maintain the armistice system until the \"pro-U.S. unification\" and turn south Korea into \"military ally\" and thus hold back \"communization\" of the whole of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is for this reason that the U.S. has denied all peace-loving proposals made by the DPRK, posed constant military threats and perpetrated provocations for war and even posed threat of a nuclear war to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently the U.S. staged joint operational drill including guerrilla battle, city regional battle, occupying of positions and shelling drills simulating a military operation within the DPRK in the northern area of Kyonggi Province, close to the MDL, together with the military warmongers of south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts go to prove that the main reason for a touch-and-go situation prevailing on the Korean Peninsula is attributable to the U.S. inveterate repugnancy and hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is the chief criminal escalating tension on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The more frequently the U.S. and the south Korean authorities stage military exercises under various codenames and the more persistently they keep the fragile armistice mechanism, the further they will speed up the repetition of the  evil cycle of escalating tension and the more dangerously they will push the situation to the brink of a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A fundamental way of preventing this serious state is for the DPRK and the U.S. to scrap the old armistice agreement and adopt a new peace treaty to establish durable peace-keeping mechanism on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. truly hopes for peace and stability on the peninsula, there would be no reason for it to reject the DPRK's proposal for concluding a peace treaty."
