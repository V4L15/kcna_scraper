Korea's Servile Diplomacy Will Invite Disgrace: KCNA Commentary\r\n Pyongyang, May 21 (KCNA) -- The aftermath of the U.S. trip by the south Korean chief executive is increasingly getting serious.\n\t\t\t\t\t She applauded the visit, claiming \"package strategic alliance\", \"core axis\" and \"tightening of ties sealed in blood\" but the fact is quite contrary to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She personally called on her staff to take follow-up measures as regards \"agreements\", a clear indication of serious problems that occurred during the visit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Problem is that there is no clear proposal to any matter even though she set about to implement those agreements at Washington's beck and call. Even though \"agreements\" were made on lots of issues, there were no substantial results.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On top of that, the sex scandal in which her suite member was involved was accused as an unprecedented happening in the international history of diplomacy which plunged Chongwadae into havoc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an unavoidable result of her acts of sycophantic treachery.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As well known, the U.S. trip by her was, in a word, a mendicant trip reflective of her servile diplomacy. During her visit she won assurances for her five years' stay in power and protection for existence in return for her virulent rhetoric against the DPRK and commitment to cooperate for confrontation with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Throughout her trip, she trumpeted confrontation policy called \"trust process\" little different from traitor Lee Myung Bak's watchwords of \"no nukes, opening and 3 000 dollars\" and made such nonsensical remarks as \"north's dismantlement of nuclear program\" and \"provocation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Serious is that she talked about \"unattainable goal\" apparently referring to the DPRK's line on simultaneously pushing forward economic construction and the nuclear force up-building. She made no scruple of making rubbish, crying out for \"change\" more often than not. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the master's attitude was generally cold despite her virulent remarks. It was because she went to meet her master without any proposals for helping his DPRK policy get out of labyrinth despite his hints on several occasions in the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This was clearly proved by disrespectful treatment accorded to her from humble reception at the airport to the departure and different statement of stand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A typical example is the gun salute during her visit to the Arlington National Cemetery.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The participants were the U.S. ambassador to south Korea and a few Americans. The gun salute was, in fact, for the dead in the Korean war and other aggression wars rather than for the visitor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But she courted the U.S. favor, calling the U.S. forces in south Korea \"good friends\" and an American family that has lived in south Korea for three generations since the Korean war a \"living witness of the six decades of south Korea-U.S. alliance\" and praising their \"dedication\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The same is the case with her speech at U.S. Congress.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even though the U.S. ruler said it was an honor bestowed upon only close friends, it was, in actuality, a shame on her.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As reported by the puppet media, such a floor was given only to Lee Myung Bak, die-hard sycophantic traitor. The south Korean chief executive was made to take the floor in a place little different from a confirmation hearing which even nominees for high-ranking posts of the U.S. administration are reluctant to. It was aimed to review her policy proposals and to have general idea of her.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The joint press conference, in particular, was a theatre that revealed the master-servant relationship between the U.S. and south Korea and the servile nature of the trip, as was commented by foreign media and experts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the press conference, the U.S. president complimented the stand specified by her to tighten cooperation for confrontation with the north but as for other issues he only made brief comments as such that it was an issue which he had already thought of and that he has similar idea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But when it turned to south Korea's disagreement on the participation in the U.S.-led missile defense system, the U.S. president said that they will make joint investment of capabilities and technology in missile defense and thus conduct joint operations with success. This pushed the stooge into predicament.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When she was embarrassed, he coaxed her like a little girl, saying that she has understood the realistic situation even though conflict was unavoidable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on this, media and the public said it was a \"courtesy\" and \"pressure\" at the same time, reflecting U.S.-style arrogance of pressing others to accept its demand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Toward the end of the trip, the master fed the media the sex scandal by a high-ranking official of Chongwadae, thus attaching a disgraceful tag to south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean chief executive deserved such a treatment for her mendicant trip.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The international public, describing the trip, remarked \"an ambiguous part in the U.S.-south Korea summit\", \"impossible 'Seoul process' initiative\" and \"'Northeast Asia peace initiative' that can hardly elicit U.S. support\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts prove that she can gain nothing from collusion with the U.S. and confrontation with fellow countrymen but only denunciation from the nation and contempt from her master.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the south Korean chief executive herself who is standing at the crossroads of outsiders or the nation and confrontation or reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She should clearly understand that she can not evade a tragic end as her predecessors if she presses ahead with her master's hostile and war policy toward the DPRK, oblivious of the lesson taught by history."
