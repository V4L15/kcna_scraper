They also worked such a miracle as carrying out the historic task of socialist industrialization in a matter of 14 years.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They successfully made the Arduous March, forced march, which might cause others to fall a hundred times and laid down a firm springboard for building a thriving nation.

They are not human beings. What they uttered is a criminal act of insulting once again the above-said victims. The recent reckless remarks made by the Japanese reactionaries are nothing but disgraceful behaviors of those worse than beasts and mentally deranged guys.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The issue of the sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army is a crucial political task to be settled by the Japanese government in a responsible manner as it is a hideous crime committed against humanity in wanton breach of the women's dignity."

However, such agreements were reduced to the dead papers due to the U.S. and its followers. A particular mention should be made of the fact that the U.S. listed the DPRK as part of the \"axis of evil\" and designated the latter as a target of its preemptive nuclear strike and has gotten more frantic with its moves to stifle the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Had the DPRK failed to have access to nuclear weapons, it would not have defended itself from the U.S. aggression but would have faced the same fate as Iraq's.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The permanent members of the UNSC have massively stockpiled nuclear weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK had access to the nuclear deterrent by itself."
