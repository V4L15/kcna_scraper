            "content": "KCNA Blasts U.S. Fiction of \"Counterfeit Notes\" \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 15 (KCNA) -- The United States is now going very busy with its moves to make its much publicized story about \"counterfeit notes\" of the DPRK sound plausible.\r\n The U.S. conservative hardliners are now pressurizing officials of a number of regional governments including Macao and Hong Kong and bank officials there to control \"counterfeit notes\" from the DPRK, blustering that the U.S. would not allow north Korea to go on issuing \"counterfeit notes\" as its state policy and it would  take necessary steps to protect itself  and the international financial system till north Korea has discontinued its criminal financial activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was against this background the Los Angeles Times on Dec. 12 reported that the DPRK government is involved in the issue of \"counterfeit notes\" allegedly on the basis of a testimony made by a \"deserter from north Korea\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We do not feel any need to rebuff this misinformation because this is a continuation of the U.S. smear campaign over the issue of \"counterfeit notes\" and its replica. If there be something different from its earlier propaganda, this time they cited what it called testimony allegedly made by the deserter in an effort to make it sound plausible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Explicitly speaking, there are no \"deserters from north Korea\" claimed by the U.S. If there be any, they are only illegal border crossers or human scum who fled after committing crimes against the country and the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Not content with mud-slinging at the DPRK, the U.S. is peddling even what unidentified deserters allegedly uttered. This goes to prove that the U.S. oft-repeated fiction of \"counterfeit notes\" is a sheer lie. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is deplorable for the U.S. to be left with no option but to depend on such human scum as \"deserters from north Korea\" and riffraff to intensify its anti-DPRK smear campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On Dec. 13, the following day, the south Korean KBS quoted a high-ranking official concerned of the \"government\" as saying it was confirmed that a \"north Korean\" whom the Los Angeles Times had cited never served at a mint organ when residing in north Korea. The U.S.-spread misinformation has become again the laughing stock of the public. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This goes to clearly prove that the Bush administration is made up of master hands at lies and fabrications. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has never issued counterfeit notes nor had ever been engaged in any illegal dealings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such illegal activities are unimaginable in the DPRK in the light of its nature and mission. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The desperate efforts made by the U.S. to label the DPRK a \"rogue state\" and a \"criminal state\" on the basis of information lacking credibility are an intolerable insult to the inviolable and dignified DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These moves are nothing but a foolish artifice to get rid of the miserable position into which the U.S. has been driven due to the countless misdeeds perpetrated by it at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is now repudiated and condemned internally and externally for having massacred innocent civilians of a sovereign state by using even ghastly weapons called white phosphorus, depleted uranium bombs and other types of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) after occupying it by force in broad daylight to incite terrorism and operating secret prisons in different parts of the world and committing monstrous crimes, the first of their kinds since the days of the Hitler fascist junta. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the U.S. policy towards the DPRK is concerned, Washington completely pulled out of the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework and is overturning the basic principles of the joint statement adopted at the six-party talks one by one. This has touched off strong criticism and derision among the world public. \r\n AP, AFP and other Western media commented that with the support rating for Bush dropping because it is rebuffed not only at home and abroad but by Republicans, he has opted for pursuing a hard-line policy towards north Korea as part of his stopgap measures to put the situation under control. \r\n It is a trite method of the U.S. to find a way out of its crisis at home and abroad in launching aggression and war against small and weak countries. \r\n Hence, the U.S. is escalating its psychological warfare intended to label the DPRK a \"rogue state.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Part of this warfare is the financial sanctions it is applying against the DPRK in a bid to pressurize it to abandon its nuclear program first. \r\n The U.S. is, however, sadly mistaken. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is not such a country that would yield to the U.S. hard-line policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter how often American political imbeciles may orchestrate farces of every form at their back parlor, it will only reveal the moral vulgarity of the Bush group and further deteriorate the stand-off over the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The only way for the Bush group to get rid of its present deplorable position is to lift its financial sanctions against the DPRK and sincerely work to find a solution to the problem at the six-party talks. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They thus deliberately bedeviled the north-south relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is, therefore, necessary to thoroughly probe all the anti-communist cases forged by those fascist dictators in order to improve the inter-Korean relations and bring earlier the day of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The shortest cut to probing the truth behind all anti-communist cases is to force the clans of the Grand National Party of south Korea to confess to their crimes themselves. All of those cases were cooked up by predecessors of the GNP without exception. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the GNP, a group of killers and their descendants who faked up a lot of cases against the north, while staying in power in the past, does not make any apology for its crimes before the nation even now when the truth about the above-said cases has been probed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The truth of history can never be kept into oblivion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP clans should apologize to the nation for having faked up anti-communist cases to kill people, bedevil the inter-Korean relations and bar national reunification and quit the political arena, before it is too late to do so.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

At the meeting the President put forward a slogan \"Oppose armed force with armed force and counterrevolutionary violence with revolutionary violence!\" and made public the theory on people's guerrilla warfare. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The theory that the people are precisely the state, rear and regular army was ascribable to the Songun idea of the President that the entire people should frustrate the counterrevolutionary violence with arms in their hands so as to retake the sovereignty of the nation and defend it forever in reliance upon arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since then the Korean revolution has covered the only way of victory under the banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President founded the Anti-Japanese People's Guerrilla Army, the first revolutionary armed force in Korea, on April 25, 1932 and defeated the Japanese imperialists to achieve national liberation on August 15, 1945. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the liberation he gave priority to the military affairs, too. And he defended the freedom and the sovereignty of the country with credit in the Fatherland Liberation War (June 1950-July 1953) against the U.S. imperialists and built the DPRK as a powerful socialist nation independent in politics, self-supporting in the economy and self-reliant in national defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK successfully withstood the unprecedented \"Arduous March\" and the forced march in the past by dint of the Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world community closely watched the political situation of the DPRK with deep apprehensions after the demise of the President. Then Kim Jong Il inspected a company of the Korean People's Army on a hill covered with young pine trees on January 1, 1995. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For ten years since then, he has inspected one unit of the KPA after another. He, with the army as the pillar of the revolution, has led the socialist cause to victory as a whole, turning misfortune into blessing, adversity into favorable conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bright future is in store for the Korean people who are advancing forward under the banner of Songun.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
