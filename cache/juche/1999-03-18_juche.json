            "content": "4th DPRK-U.S. underground facility negotiations\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 18 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK, answering a question put by KCNA in the wake of the recent 4th underground facility negotiations between the DPRK and the U.S. in New York, said as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DPRK and the U.S. had the 4th round of the underground facility negotiations in New York from February 27 to March 16 at which both sides reached an agreement on a series of issues.   The negotiations came in response to the U.S. \"suspicion\" that the construction of an underground nuclear facility might be in progress in Kumchang-ri, Taegwan county, North Phyongan Province of Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already known, ever since the adoption of the framework agreement between the two countries the DPRK has sincerely discharged its obligation of nuclear freezing under the agreement.   We do not bother to conceal the fact that in the light of the acute military situation prevailing in our country which is technically at war with the U.S. we build all sensitive important objects underground in different parts of the country.   The underground facility whose construction is now in progress in Kumchang-ri is one of them. It is a non-nuclear facility from A to Z.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   However, the U.S. is engaged in groundless anti-DPRK diatribe, saying that there is \"information\" on the building of an underground nuclear facility and so it is necessary to \"inspect\" the facility. It goes so far as to claim that the DPRK is secretly violating the agreement.   Its slander is a dirty propaganda ploy to flee from the responsibility for failure to discharge its obligation under the agreement and incriminate the DPRK. So, it is a grave insult to the dignity of the DPRK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is calling for \"inspection\" of the underground facility of the DPRK, its belligerent party, just as it did against other countries. The loudmouthed \"inspection\" cannot be allowed at all because it is a wanton violation of the sovereignty and security of the DPRK and if the U.S. really wants to have the \"suspicion\" cleared it should make due political and economic compensation for having tarnished the image of the DPRK under the eyes of the world through dirty anti-DPRK diatribe. It is the stand of principle consistently maintained by the DPRK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At the recent negotiations the U.S. side acknowledged the validity of the stand and promised to meet the demands of the DPRK.   In this regard the DPRK side decided to permit an on-site visit to the object under construction in  Kumchang-ri by a U.S. delegation, which is not in response to its demand for \"inspection,\" but at the invitation of the DPRK.   There was a sufficient debate on and agreement on the  payment of the \"inspection fee.\"   The U.S., though belatedly, admitted that its behaviour was wrong and decided to adopt politico-economic measures as demanded by the DPRK. For the U.S. it is a good thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK made it clear that it will take a determined countermeasure if the U.S. raises \"suspicion\" of any other object.   What has been agreed upon at the recent negotiations still remains on a sheet of paper.   Whether it is put into practice or not depends entirely upon whether the U.S. side keeps its promise or not. \r\n\r\n"

Korea\r\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 18 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today comes out with a signed commentary on the recent formation of a women's riot police in South Korea.   The news analyst of the paper says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The South Korean authorities formed a women's riot police to put methods and devices of man-hunting on a more intellectual basis.   They plan to hurl policewomen in traffic officer's uniform into venues of demonstrations so as to give people the impression that their mission is to maintain \"traffic order\", not cracking down upon demonstrations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is an ample evidence that they are utterly hell-bent on man-hunting.   In the last one year alone, the self-proclaimed \"government for the people\" fired barrages of tear gas bombs at the people, or almost 40 times that launched in the similar period of the former \"civilian\"-veiled dictatorship. Worse still, in this period, many people have been thrown behind bars as prisoners of conscience. Their number is 4.6 times as many as those detained in the one year after the \"civilian\"-veiled regime appeared. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  While brutally suppressing people almost every day, the present South Korean rulers felt acute shortage of policemen although their number is huge. So, they went the length of setting up a policewomen's unit.   On March 6, they called out a large number of policewomen to crack down upon an inaugural ceremony of an emergency measure committee of the Trade Union of the Dae Woo Electronics Co. Ltd. held at Jongmyo Park in Seoul.   They are now employing all conceivable repressive means to block the people from turning out in struggles for democracy and vital rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In forming the women's riot police, the South Korean authorities seek to hurl policewomen in traffic officer's uniform into venues of demonstrations so as to give impressions that the intensity of crackdown upon demonstrations is worn down. They also seek to commit an indiscriminate suppressive campaign against demonstrators all at once with a large number of riot policemen awaiting for an order for action in nearby areas. \r\n\r\n"

Recalling that the Kim Dae Jung group recently got Hwang Jang Yop, who defected to the south from the north to rig up an organisation dubbed \"fellowship society of defectors from the north,\" the commentary said:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The South Korean people from all walks of life have already strongly denounced the ill-intentioned plot of the authorities to frame up a venal organisation with defectors from the north for the purpose of using it for their sinister anti-north smear campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Nevertheless, the Kim Dae Jung group finally cooked up the \"fellowship society of defectors from the north.\"    This is one more unpardonable anti-north, anti-national crime of challenging the aspirations of the South Korean people and all other Koreans for reconciliation between the north and the south and the reunification of the country.   The organization with the traitor Hwang Jang Yop, the common enemy of the north and the south, as its \"Honorary Chairman\" is nothing but a waiting maid and authority of the government authorities, which is composed of traitors to the nation and criminals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The organization is intended to use defectors for vicious anti-north, anti-reunification confrontation moves and, at the same time, mitigate complaint, discontent and protest which are growing stronger among defectors from the north.   As soon as they set their foot on this land, defectors are taken to the central joint investigation office, the \"National Intelligence Service\" (NIS) and other repressive institutions where they are treated like animals and put to all sorts of torture including the beating by clubs, thus becoming mental and physical cripples. They are also placed under constant shadowing and watch. Besides, unable to eke out their existence with a meager amount of money for settlement, they attempt to flee to other countries only to be captured and jailed again or commit suicide.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Worse still, they are reduced to robbers, thieves and murderers while living a degenerate life, snubbed by people as \"traitors to the country\" and \"scum who ran away, leaving their family members behind.   An increasing number of defectors from the north lodge lawsuits or protests with the authorities against inhuman treatment and contempt they receive upon setting their foot on South Korea after being allured or kidnapped by intelligence agents.   In the last-ditch effort to bring such movements of defectors, a new troublesome problem, under control and tame them, the Kim Dae Jung group cooked up the fellowship society with the traitor Hwang and other defectors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   With the formation of such an organization, however, it cannot placate extreme anti-government feelings of defectors nor conceal the fact that South Korea is a veritable hell where people cannot live.   Its anti-north confrontation move aimed at using defectors for its sinister political purpose will only worsen the deadlocked inter-Korean relations and aggravate tensions.   By rigging up the \"fellowship society of defectors from the north\" which no preceding dictators dared to do, the Kim Dae Jung group glaringly revealed its anti-national, anti-reunification nature again to the whole world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the Kim Dae Jung regime persists in anti-north plots and confrontation rackets by using defectors from the north as venal trumpeters, it will be branded as anti-reunification fanatics worse than the preceding dictators and be thrown into the dustbin of history.   The defectors should daringly fight against Chongwadae and the NIS, groups of trick plotters who have driven them into such a miserable plight today.   At the same time, they should finish off the traitor Hwang, who is pushing them to commit more serious crimes against the country as dirty stooges of the government authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Our NDFSK, together with the patriotic people from all walks of life, will certainly shatter provocative anti-north smear campaign of the Kim Dae Jung group going against inter-Korean reconciliation, unity and reunification. \r\n\r\n"
