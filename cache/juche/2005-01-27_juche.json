Paektu as the backbone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now in the DPRK the People's Army is the core of unity in one mind, the army which has been strengthened into an army strong in idea and faith, a matchless powerful army, under the energetic leadership of Kim Jong Il. Our unity has been strengthened immensely and is displaying its great might as the powerful revolutionary army is faithfully upholding the idea and leadership of the headquarters of the revolution in the van, the army which finds its physical quality in and highly displays the spirit of devotedly defending the leader, the spirit of devotedly carrying through his instructions and the spirit of heroic sacrifice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unity in the Songun revolution is also an integral whole of the entire Party, and army and all the people united in idea and purpose on the basis of the great Songun idea and a moral crystal based on comradeship and sense of obligation of those holding arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK are now proud of being unquestioned followers, resolute defenders and steadfast implementers of the Songun idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe ideological viewpoint, fighting morale and mode of life of the people have   changed beyond recognition and the integration of the army and people in idea and spirit and in fighting morale have been achieved in the course of carrying through the Songun idea with it as their creed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A big army of revolutionary soldiers, who, charmed by the fervent comradeship of Kim Jong Il, fight in defense of their faith and sense of obligation to the leader even on an isolated island, have grown and the whole country is overflowing with the noble traits of laying down one's own life for society, collective and comrades without hesitation and breaking through ordeals, helping and leading each other forward.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
