Paektu as the backbone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now in the DPRK the People's Army is the core of unity in one mind, the army which has been strengthened into an army strong in idea and faith, a matchless powerful army, under the energetic leadership of Kim Jong Il. Our unity has been strengthened immensely and is displaying its great might as the powerful revolutionary army is faithfully upholding the idea and leadership of the headquarters of the revolution in the van, the army which finds its physical quality in and highly displays the spirit of devotedly defending the leader, the spirit of devotedly carrying through his instructions and the spirit of heroic sacrifice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unity in the Songun revolution is also an integral whole of the entire Party, and army and all the people united in idea and purpose on the basis of the great Songun idea and a moral crystal based on comradeship and sense of obligation of those holding arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK are now proud of being unquestioned followers, resolute defenders and steadfast implementers of the Songun idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe ideological viewpoint, fighting morale and mode of life of the people have   changed beyond recognition and the integration of the army and people in idea and spirit and in fighting morale have been achieved in the course of carrying through the Songun idea with it as their creed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A big army of revolutionary soldiers, who, charmed by the fervent comradeship of Kim Jong Il, fight in defense of their faith and sense of obligation to the leader even on an isolated island, have grown and the whole country is overflowing with the noble traits of laying down one's own life for society, collective and comrades without hesitation and breaking through ordeals, helping and leading each other forward.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Foundation of Songun Politics Provided by President Kim Il Sung \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 26 (KCNA) -- It is thanks to the foundation of the Songun politics laid by President Kim Il Sung that the Korean revolution has emerged victorious, going through all manner of difficulties and trials.\r\n The President had consistently held fast to the idea and policy of attaching importance to arms and the military affairs, the origin of the Songun politics, during his leadership of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He made a scientific penetration into the position and role of arms in the revolutionary struggle he had to wage against the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule without the Party, power, army and the rear, the historical lesson of the anti-Japanese national liberation movement and the demand of the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Basing himself on this, he expounded the Juche-oriented idea of Songun in the Kalun Meeting in Juche 19 (1930), the Mingyuegou meeting in December 1931 and various other meetings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun idea resulted in the founding of the Anti-Japanese People's Guerrilla Army (AJPGA) on April 25, 1932, which marked the start of the President's Songun revolutionary leadership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He developed the AJPGA into the Korean People's Revolutionary Army in March 1934 and prepared the guerrillas to be fighters steadfast in ideology and faith so that they could discharge the mission and duty of the revolutionary army. And he established the Party Committee of the KPRA, the unified leadership body of the Party in the unit, in May 1934, making it possible to ensure the monolithic Songun revolutionary leadership over the overall Korean revolution including the armed struggle, preparations for founding the Party and the anti-Japanese united national front movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since he accomplished the cause of national liberation under the banner of Songun, the President had always paid a primary attention to the military affairs to guarantee the victorious advance of the revolution and construction with arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to strengthen the revolutionary armed forces, he set forth a number of policies and lines concerning the military affairs-- the policy of training the whole army into an army of cadres, modernizing the whole army, arming all the people and turning the whole country into a fortress and the strategic line of simultaneously building up the economy and defense. For 60-odd years he made some 182,600-km-long tours to inspect more than 3,120 units of the Korean People's Army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the sagacious leadership of the President, the KPA had frustrated the U.S. moves to invade and stifle the DPRK in every step and propelled the socialist construction, building such world-famous monumental edifices as the West Sea Barrage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With his Songun politics, leader Kim Jong Il has brilliantly carried forward the President's Songun idea and Songun revolutionary line, creditably guaranteeing the revolutionary cause of Juche.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
