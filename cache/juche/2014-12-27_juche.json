            "content": "U.S. Can Never Justify Screening and Distribution of Reactionary Movie: Policy Department of NDC of DPRK\r\nPyongyang, December 27 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Policy Department of the National Defence Commission (NDC) of the DPRK Saturday issued a statement denouncing the U.S. for screening even dishonest and reactionary movie hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and agitating terrorism while groundlessly linking the unheard-of hacking at the Sony Pictures Entertainment to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement said that much scared at the hacking attack of justice made by the \"guardians of peace\", the Sony Pictures Entertainment hastily suspended the screening of the above-said movie. But at the zealous prodding of the U.S. administration and wicked conservative forces, it again buckled down to distributing the movie, failing to guess a miserable fate to be faced by it in the future, it added:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t U.S. President Obama is the chief culprit who forced the Sony Pictures Entertainment to \"indiscriminately distribute\" the movie and took the lead in appeasing and blackmailing cinema houses and theatres in the U.S. mainland to distribute the movie.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Obama always goes reckless in words and deeds like a monkey in a tropical forest. When the Sony Pictures Entertainment made public a statement that it would give up the distribution of the movie, frightened by the merciless retaliatory strike, Obama urged it to unconditionally screen the movie, claiming that the disgrace suffered by Sony Pictures Entertainment means sorrow of the U.S., why did it issue such a statement as holding a white flag without informing the president of it?,  it is the violation of the freedom of expression and a threat to the security of the U.S. and it is necessary to make symmetric counteraction, considering the hacking attack was made by \"north Korea\", though it is not clear who was behind it, the statement said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Dancing to the tune of Obama's outbursts, Kerry, McCain, Bolton and other wicked conservative politicians zealously prodded the Sony Pictures Entertainment into distributing the movie, blustering who else but \"north Korea\" caused property losses worth hundreds of millions of dollars to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. is to persistently insist that the hacking attack was made by the DPRK, the U.S. should produce evidence without fail, though belatedly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. cannot open to public evidence due to \"protection of sensitive information source\" as expressed by the FBI, the U.S. may conduct a joint investigation with the DPRK in camera.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the U.S. is behaving recklessly, trumpeting about \"symmetric counteraction\", \"combination of invisible sanctions and visible sanctions\" and \"re-designation of sponsor of terrorism\" while linking the hacking attack with the DPRK without clear evidence and sure ground.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In actuality, the U.S., a big country, started disturbing the internet operation of major media of the DPRK, not knowing shame like children playing a tag.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We had already warned the U.S. not act like beating air after being hit hard by others.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Of course, we do not expect the gangsters to pay heed to our warnings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the public is becoming increasingly vocal about the hacking attack on the DPRK media this time, the U.S. feigned ignorance, saying that they should ask \"north Korea\" and the U.S. neither admits nor denies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prevailing situation clearly shows that the U.S. is adding to its crimes by screening the movie \"The Interview.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With no rhetoric can the U.S. justify the screening and distribution of the movie.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is because \"The Interview\" is an illegal, dishonest and reactionary movie quite contrary to the UN Charter, which regards respect for sovereignty, non-interference in internal affairs and protection of human rights as a legal keynote, and international laws.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is also because it is a new politically-motivated provocation made by the U.S., pursuant to its hostile policy toward the DPRK as it is a movie for agitating terrorism produced with high-ranking politicians of the U.S. administration involved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the reason why the world is branding \"The Interview\" as a typical product of the U.S. anachronistic act of challenging not only the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK but also human justice and conscience and encroaching upon peace and security.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The anti-U.S. sacred war at present precisely means protecting justice and peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. persists in American-style arrogant, high-handed and gangster-like arbitrary practices despite the repeated warnings of the DPRK, the U.S. should bear in mind that its failed political affairs will face inescapable deadly blows."

He made nonsensical remarks that to steadily run an old machine is like to step on thin ice and that nobody can know how his car will operate without turning its key.

Politica del Comite de Defensa Nacional de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea hizo publica el dia 27 una declaracion denunciando a Estados Unidos que vinculando injustamente con la RPDC el ataque cibernetico sufrido por Sony Pictures Entertainment, pretende proyectar a toda costa una pelicula reaccionaria que calumnia la maxima dignidad de la RPDC y agita el terrorismo. \n\t\t\t\t\tSony Pictures Entertainment, que habia suspendido precipitadamente tal proyeccion por el justo ataque cibernetico de \"Defensores de la Paz\", vuelve a divulgar la pelicula a instigacion de la administracion estadounidense y las fuerzas conservadoras de peor calana sin prever su destino tragico, revela la nota y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tQuien instiga al frente la divulgacion de la pelicula reaccionaria es el presidente estadounidense Obama, quien obligo a Sony Pictures Entertainment la \"distribucion indiscriminada\" y ejercio el chantaje y adormecimiento a los cines y teatros de EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tObama con la cara de un mono que habita en las selvas tropicales es indiscreto siempre en palabras y acciones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTan pronto como Sony Pictures Entertainment, aturdida por el despiadado ataque de venganza, publicara la declaracion sobre el cese de divulgacion de la pelicula reaccionaria, Obama le urgio la proyeccion incondicional diciendo que \"es verguenza de Sony Pictures Entertainment y tristeza de Estados Unidos\", \"?por que publico aquella declaracion de arrodillamiento sin avisar al presidente?\", \"es violacion de la libertad de expresion y peligro a la seguridad de EE.UU.\" y \"hay que tomar las contramedidas proporcionales definiendo al Norte de Corea como culpable aunque es incierto el controlador de hacking\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKerry, McCain, Bolton y otros politiqueros conservadores tambien estan acorde con la \"decision\" de Obama insistiendo en que nadie en este mundo, excepto al \"Norte de Corea\", causo a la maxima distribuidora de fabricacion de pelicula los danos de bienes valorados en cien millones de dolares. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi EE.UU. quiere acusar a la RPDC de hacker, debe testimoniarlo aunque sea ahora. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi no puede publicar las pruebas por la \"proteccion de fuente de informaciones sensibles\", como insiste el Buro Federal de Investigacion (FBI en ingles), podria hacer a puertas cerradas la investigacion conjunta con nosotros. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, sin tener pruebas ni motivos evidentes, EE.UU. vincula injustamente con la RPDC el presente hacking lamentable insistiendo en \"tomar las contramedidas proporcionales\", \"combinar la sancion invisible con la otra visible\" y \"redeterminar los paises que apoyan el terrorismo\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRealmente, el pais norteamericano corpulento comenzo a estorbar la operacion via internet de los principales medios de prensa de la RPDC sin sentir la verguenza como los mocosuelos en juego de escondite. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa hemos advertido a EE.UU. a actuar con prudencia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClaro que no esperamos que los gangsteres aceptaran esta advertencia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl ver que se hacen fuertes las criticas de la opinion publica sobre el reciente hacking contra los medios de prensa norcoreanos, EE.UU. dice groseramente que \"pregunten al Norte de Corea\" y que \"no lo reconocemos ni lo negamos\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa situacion demuestra que EE.UU. abulta su expediente criminal con la proyeccion de la pelicula \"The Interview\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. no puede justificar en ningun caso la proyeccion y divulgacion de la pelicula reaccionaria \"The Interview\", porque esta pelicula ilicita contraviene completamente a la Carta de la ONU y la ley internacional que toman por su fundamento legal el respeto a la soberania, la no intervencion en los asuntos internos y la defensa de los derechos humanos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY \"The Interview\", siendo un medio de agitacion terrorista producido bajo la participacion de los politiqueros de alto rango de la administracion norteamericana, resulta una nueva provocacion politica causada por la politica norteamericana de hostilidad a la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe aqui la razon de que el mundo califica \"The Interview\" de producto tipico de anacronismo de EE.UU. que calumnia la maxima dignidad de la RPDC, desafia a la justicia y la conciencia de la humanidad y perturba la paz y la seguridad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa guerra antiyanqui de hoy es la de defensa de la justicia y la paz. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe tener presente que si sigue recurriendo a la arrogancia, el despotismo y las arbitrariedades al estilo norteamericano, la politica en decadencia de su propio pais sufrira el golpe demoledor irreparable."
