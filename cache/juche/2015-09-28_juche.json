He named the boat Mujigae.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe boat with a total floor space of more than 11 390 square meters is 120 meters long and  25 meters wide and has a displacement of 3 500 tons. At least 1 230 guests can cruise in the picturesque Taedong River at a time, being served with Korean and world famous dishes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The four storied boat has such modern service facilities as national food restaurant, coffee room, soft drink room, party room, banquet hall, buffet restaurant, deck restaurant, revolving restaurant and shop, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un looked round the boat to learn in detail about its building and preparations for service. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that its designing  and interior and exterior construction were done at the best level, he said with great satisfaction that everything is impeccable and formative art was applied to it at a high level.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He appreciated the installation of a peculiar round lift and the construction of round stairs, adding that the revolving restaurant on the third floor looks spectacular and it is fantastic to command a bird's-eye view of Pyongyang from it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that it is possible to regularly operate the boat only when effective measures are taken to supply foodstuff and other things to it as it has a huge accommodating capacity, he took a benevolent step for doing so.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The boat will be visited by a lot of the people, he said, adding that thinking of the people who will cheerfully laugh and talk while cruising in the river helps him relieve of the pent-up fatigue and he feels the greatest pleasure when having provided one more treasure to the people like that. He gave an instruction to start its service before October 10.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The building of the combined service boat Mujigae convinces us of the fact  that we can reach the world level in all aspects, he said, underscoring the need to build all service facilities to be constructed in the future at the level of Mujigae so that the people may enjoy a highly civilized and affluent life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Hwang Pyong So, Kim Ki Nam, Kim Yang Gon, O Su Yong, Jo Yong Won, Hong Yong Chil and Kim Yo Jong."
