            "content": "Humanitarian aid with political conditionalities unacceptable \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 16 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry on Monday gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA as regards the evermore undisguised anti-DPRK plot of the U.S. and its followers to misuse humanitarian aid for attaining a sinister political purpose:\r\n As already reported, the UN on Nov. 19 issued a consolidated inter-agency appeal on continuously rendering aid including food to the DPRK in 2003. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WFP and other international organizations and different donor countries have expressed positive attitude towards it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the U.S. has rendered the situation extremely tense by flatly rejecting the DPRK's proposal for concluding a non-aggression treaty aimed at solving the \"nuclear issue\". Not content with this, it is obstructing humanitarian aid by every possible means and method, even politicizing it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No sooner had this UN appeal been made public than the U.S. got desperate in its anti-DPRK false propaganda, floating such lies as the \"diversion of food aid to the army,\" \"exodus of North Korean refugees,\" \"drug trafficking,\" etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has so far claimed that aid to the DPRK had nothing to do with the \"nuclear issue.\" But at a time when its moves to stifle the DPRK have reached their height even government officials are openly asserting that it cannot give aid to the DPRK unless it meets such unreasonable conditions including the \"opening of the whole country\". This clearly tells what is the real intention of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pursuant to the U.S. policy, Japan and other U.S. allies are deliberately linking the humanitarian aid to the DPRK with such political issues as the solution of \"nuclear issue\" and the \"normalization of state relations\" in a bid to put pressure on it and wrest a sort of \"concession.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This can never be justified as it is an attempt of the U.S. to misuse noble humanitarianism for attaining its sinister political aim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has maintained a friendly approach to international humanitarian aid and rendered its utmost cooperation in it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will as always warmly welcome disinterested aid from various international organizations and donor countries but will never accept any aid with political conditionalities.    \r\n\r\n"

The Juche idea was fathered by President Kim Il Sung and has been developed and enriched by leader Kim Jong Il, he stressed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the uniqueness, validity and theoretical and practical significance of the Juche idea, he continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With the embodiment of the Juche idea the DPRK has become strong in politics and ideology and military terms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is because all the people firmly follow the Juche idea that the DPRK is maintaining its independent position and firmly defending socialism despite the U.S. military threat and moves to stifle it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Patrique Bruno, lawyer of the Paris Court, in a speech said that the Korean people are invariably going along the road of socialism chosen by themselves because they are guided by the Juche idea which was founded by the president and has been enriched by Kim Jong Il.    \r\n\r\n"

Now the situation of the Korean Peninsula is on the verge of a war. The only way of preventing a catastrophic crisis of a war on the Korean Peninsula is to conclude a non-aggression treaty between the DPRK and the U.S. at an early date. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Regarding the \"joint military counteraction\" and \"sanctions\" against the DPRK as a practice of the U.S. imperialists' plan to provoke a new war, the DPRK will counter it with a super hardline military counteraction. The army and the people of the DPRK are now very strong in hatred for the U.S. and the spirit of annihilating the enemies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The enemies will never escape from the DPRK strong strike whether they are in South Korea or across the ocean and wherever they may be on the earth. The bellicose group of bush should respond to the DPRK's proposal for concluding a non-aggression treaty as soon as possible, facing up to the gravity and seriousness of the situation.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA urges Japan to behave itself\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 16 (KCNA) -- Some anti-DPRK elements of the Japanese Government have recently become more undisguised in their row over the \"issue of abduction\" while pulling up it over an \"operation ship\" and \"drug smuggling\" in a bid to kick up a fresh anti-DPRK smear campaign.\r\n This is a reckless behavior on the part of Japan to bring the DPRK-Japan relations back to the phase of confrontation at the instigation of the U.S. this can not be construed otherwise than a mean political plot to violate the basic spirit of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang declaration which calls for settling the unpleasant past that existed between the DPRK and Japan from a broad perspective and solving outstanding issues so as to establish productive political, economic and cultural relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's loud-mouthed \"issue of abduction\" does not deserve even a passing note as it has already been settled as the DPRK declared more than once. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is the fact that right-wing conservatives of Japan, not content with vociferating about the issue inside Japan, brought it even to the international arena in a bid to solicit for support and, at the same time, lobbied the un commission on human rights for adopting a resolution on conducting a probe into those abducted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's mean attempt to internationalize the abduction issue and isolate the DPRK through international pressure can never be tolerated as it is a provocative act of rendering the situation more complicated and throwing a serious obstacle in the way of improving the DPRK-Japan relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Intolerable is the call made by pro-U.S. elements in Japan for scrutinizing the passenger liner Mangyongbong after labeling it \"North Korea's operation ship\" under the pretext of its \"abduction issue,\" not content with terming the DPRK the \"biggest international terrorism sponsor\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This clearly proves to what phase their evermore undisguised hostile policy toward the DPRK has gone as it reveals their deliberate and premeditated attempt to obstruct the voyage of the ship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This call cannot be viewed apart from the U.S. anti-DPRK hostile policy as evidenced by its call for mounting a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK after singling it out as part of \"an axis of evil\", its recent decision to stop the supply of heavy oil to the DPRK and its piracy committed against DPRK-flagged trading cargo ship Sosan in high waters off Yemen in broad daylight on Dec. 10, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Anti-DPRK elements of the Japanese Government have got more undisguised in their moves to reduce the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang declaration to a dead document and their anti-DPRK hostile acts, taking advantage of the U.S. strategy for \"international cooperation\", a strategy intended to isolate and stifle the DPRK by forcing it to disarm itself. The prevailing situation compels the DPRK to reconsider good faith and the generous stand it has so far shown toward Japan and take a resolute countermeasure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan had better stop acting rashly, mindful that it can never evade responsibility for its perfidious behavior of dancing to the tune of the U.S.    \r\n\r\n"

This was entirely attributable to the sinister interference by the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To provide an institutional mechanism for the economic cooperation is an undertaking to lay a framework for the developing the national economy on a balanced basis and reenergizing the economic cooperation and exchange between the north and south of Korea. It therefore, admits of no outside interference and the United States has no right to hinder this undertaking. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the hamlet of the \"UN Forces\", the U.S. put the brake on the progress of the project for reconnecting the rail and road links between the north and south of Korea. It blocks the two sides from reaching an agreement on the institutional mechanism for their economic cooperation while escalating its moves to stifle the DPRK under the pretext of the \"nuclear issue\". Clear is what the U.S. is seeking in doing so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is utterly indifferent to the common interests of the north and south of Korea and to the desire of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After unilaterally breaching the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework, the U.S. is now hindering the process of improving the north-south relations and their cooperation and unity and inciting confrontation between Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But, it should clearly know that no force can break the Korean nation's steadfast will to pave the way for its reconciliation, unity and reunification by its concerted efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the fellow countrymen will decisively smash the U.S. outright intervention through a nationwide anti-U.S. struggle. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
