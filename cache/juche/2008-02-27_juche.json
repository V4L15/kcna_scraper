So it was once called \"Sambong Islet\" (three-peak islet). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn So Islet there rises Thanggon Peak, a name which derives from the fact that the peak reminds one of the spirit of a man standing with an imposing air and its clean-cut summit looks like Thanggon (a horsehair skullcap worn by the man under his hat in old days). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nNatural springs gush at several spots, among them springs around Jinnaeam and one from a crack in a rock of an abrasion cave on the Mongdol Coast. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDistributed in Tok Islet are about 70 species of plants including ten-odd species of trees such as Punus thunbergii, Euonymus radicus and camellia.\r\nInhabiting the islet are sea-birds such as green pigeon, rare in the world, black-tailed gull and kestrel and land animals such as wild rabbit and rat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn recent years 22 kinds of birds and 37 kinds of insects have been discovered in the islet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nA large number of seals swarm in the sea around the islet and it is a good habitat for fishes, shell-fishes, Crustacea and water chestnuts, as warm and cold currents cross each other there and it abounds in plankton. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThus, the fauna of Tok Islet is diverse, abundant and specific.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The Japanese reactionaries' utterances distorting the war crimes are an intolerable insult and challenge to the Korean people and other Asians, victims of the war, and a ruse to fool and mock at the public. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ishihara's hysteria reflects the social climate in Japan where the preparations for staging a comeback to Korea are being sped up. His remarks are nothing but an open war agitation and dissemination of militarism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people and other Asians are following with high vigilance the dangerous moves of the Japanese reactionaries as they are aimed at inciting militarism in the Japanese society, while tampering with and justifying Japan's history of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries should clearly understand that their act of keeping to the road of militarism, refusing to make reparation for their past crimes and justifying them will only precipitate their disgraceful self-destruction.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
