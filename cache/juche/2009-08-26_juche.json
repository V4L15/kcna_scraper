This is not for the sake of others but for its own sake. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan lacks the ability to judge the reality that it can never achieve its political purpose unless it earns the international confidence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is evidenced by the fact that far from redeeming its hideous crimes committed in the past Japan is getting talkative about \"international contribution\", while intensifying the moves for militarization and overseas aggression. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world people are becoming more cautious as the days go by about the above-mentioned bid of Japan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The number of the countries which clarified their official stands not to support Japan's bid is on the steady increase. Signature campaigns opposing Japan's bid were widely conducted in different countries including Asian countries. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural that Japan can hardly win international confidence as it is so politically imbecile that it still thinks money is everything and is once again rushing headlong into aggression, far from drawing a lesson from its crime-woven past. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan should settle its past crimes, first of all, if it wants to exercise any right in the international arena."

This strategy is mainly targeted against the DPRK, says Rodong Sinmun Wednesday in a signed article.\n\t\t\t\t\t What merits attention in the U.S. imperialists' preparations for a war of aggression against the DPRK is that they have massively beefed up aggression troops in and around the Korean Peninsula after making the start of a nuclear war a fait accompli and always keep themselves busy with nuclear war exercises targeted against the DPRK with a large number of nuclear means involved, the article notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., attaching great importance to the strategy for invading the DPRK, seeks to escalate the military stand-off on the peninsula and develop it into a war in a bid to realize its wild ambition to put the whole of Korea under its control. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the above-said scenario for a nuclear war is put into practice, this will bring irrevocably serious consequences.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In case a new war breaks out on the peninsula, it will inevitably spill over into vast areas of the world including those countries whose strategic interests in the region are intertwined with each other.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is entirely thanks to the powerful military capability of the DPRK that has emerged an invulnerable fortress under the banner of Songun that a nuclear war has been averted on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. warlike forces had better drop their anachronistic wild dream to implement their policy of aggression against the DPRK by force and immediately stop the reckless anti-DPRK saber rattling."

            "content": "Japon debe ganar primero confianza de la sociedad internacional\r\n Pyongyang, 26 de agosto (ATCC) -- Es una ambicion anejada de Japon ocupar la posicion de miembro permanente del Consejo de Seguridad, cargo importante de la ONU, para convertirse en una potencia politica.\n\t\t\t\t\t  Para este fin, el considera este tema como nucleo de su politica exterior.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Como lo hizo todos los anos, este ano tambien lo planteo como la mas importante tarea diplomatica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Japon anoto oficialmente en el \"libro azul de diplomacia\" de la edicion de 2009 la necesidad de hacerse cuanto antes miembro permanente del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El canciller y otros funcionarios encargados de relaciones exteriores andan enfrascados en la diplomacia pecuniaria y mendigante en los escenarios internacionales expresando abiertamente tal ambicion irracional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Pero, estas pretensiones de Japon le hacen pasar tremenda verguenza en todas partes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Nadie tiene la culpa de que Japon no haya convencido a la sociedad internacional aunque realizo ingentes esfuerzos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Pues, Japon no esta preparado en lo politico y moral para ser miembro permanente del Consejo de Seguridad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En una palabra, es desconfiado hoy por la sociedad internacional por no haber liquidado todavia el expediente de sus crimenes del pasado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Aunque pasaron mas de 60 anos desde el fin de la Segunda Guerra Mundial que causo grandes perdidas a la humanidad, Japon se resiste todavia a cumplir esa obligacion legal y moral que corresponde al pais criminal de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Es imposible que tal pais isleno haga el uso de la palabra en el trato de los importantes asuntos politicos internacionales en calidad de miembro permanente del Consejo de Seguridad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En este sentido, tomar reflexiones sinceras de su pasado bochornoso beneficiara mas a Japon que a otros paises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ahora, le falta a Japon la facultad de enjuiciar la realidad. Es decir, no entiende que nunca podra alcanzar su meta politica si no gana la confianza internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Lo demuestra el hecho de que Japon intensifica sus acciones en pro de la militarizacion y la agresion a ultramar hablando tanto de la \"contribucion internacional\", lejos de liquidar sus enormes crimenes del pasado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ahora, crece en la sociedad internacional el rechazo a tal proposito de Japon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Se incrementa el numero de los paises que expusieron su posicion oficial contra el intento de Japon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn varios paises, incluyendo los asiaticos, se libra ampliamente la recogida de firmas para expresar la oposicion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Es muy natural que Japon fuera desconfiado en la arena internacional porque este pais imbecil en lo politico anda con fanfarroneria creyendo que con el dinero se resuelve lo todo y emprende de nuevo el camino de agresion, en lugar de sacar lecciones de su pasado lleno de crimenes.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi Japon quiere ejercer algun derecho en el escenario internacional, debera liquidar primero sus crimenes del pasado."
