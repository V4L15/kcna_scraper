Now that it is obvious that their talk is no more than a deception, the South Korean workers will never be taken in by their crafty trick.\r\n   The authorities preaching is prompted by a criminal attempt to deceive the workers, calm down their protest and continue introducing the lay-off system on which they agreed with the international financial circles.    \r\n\r\n"
