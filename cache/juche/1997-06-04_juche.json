But, it is, in essence, the \"emergency on the Korean Peninsula.\"\r\n   The U.S. and Japan lay emphasis on establishment of a theatre missile defence system in the re-examination of the \"defence cooperation guidelines\" and the modernisation of armed forces for the \"emergency around Japan.\"\r\n   Japan is trying to further modernise combat equipment and increase its production through the introduction of the high military technology from the U.S. for the theatre missile defence system. The point at issue is that establishment of this system is directly linked with Japan's wild ambition for oversease expansion and in partiuclar it \r\nis a DPRK-targeted system.\r\n   While talking about the \"emergency on the Korean Peninsula\", the south Korean puppets are massively introducing uptodate combat equipment from the U.S. and other countries and staging frantic military manoeuvres of various kinds, taking advantage of the war preparations stepped up by the U.S. and Japan.\r\n   All this clearly shows that the crying for coping with \"the emergency on the Korean Peninsula\" is not for providing against \"possible provocations\" and \"threat\" from the DPRK, but for justifying war preparations of the U.S., Japan and south Korean puppets, stepping up arms buildup and making a surprise attack on the DPRK. war provokers are doomed to ruin. The crying for \"coping with the emergency on the Korean Peninsula\" will certainly prove false, condemned by the progressives of the world who are fighting for justice, truth, peace and stability. \r\n \r\n"

Paektu.\r\n   Korea today is a country strong in ideology and faith, which lives and fights in the spirit of Mt. Paektu. World-startling spirit of Korea is precisely the faith and will of Secretary Kim Jong Il.\r\n   Any reactionary ideological offensive does not affect the Korean people who have the same spirit of Mt. Paektu that Secretary Kim Jong Il has.\r\n   The Korean people, therefore, have become a people with a firm willingness to pull through any difficulty and a heroic people who have done what was determined under any circumstances.\r\n   Korea today is a powerful country which displays the might in the spirit of singlehearted unity.\r\n   Korea owes its existence to the singlehearted unity around Secretary Kim Jong Il as a single socio-political organism.\r\n   We should not lay down the torchlight of revolution held up by President Kim Il Sung all his life, but keep holding higher the red flag forever.\r\n   The difficulties with which the country and the nation are faced will surely be overcome and the day of victory is sure to come. This is the faith in sure victory that the Pochonbo Battle implanted in the mind of the Korean people. \r\n \r\n"
