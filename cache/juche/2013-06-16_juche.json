We state to the world once again that it is none other than the U.S. which has steadily strained the situation on the Korean Peninsula century after century and decade after decade.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was the U.S. which provoked the war of aggression on the Korean Peninsula in the 1950s and it is again the U.S. which has systematically scrapped the Korean Armistice Agreement for the past six decades after the end of the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Entering into the first decade of the new century, the U.S. has persistently tried to ignite a war against the DPRK again.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From December last year, the U.S. has pulled up the DPRK, describing its legitimate and just satellite launch as a long-range missile launch and its military measures for self-defence to cope with the U.S. open aggression moves as sort of \"provocation\". This fully discloses its nature as the worst provoker and aggressor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The gangster-like resolution on \"sanctions\" which the U.S. masterminded and all the hostile acts that have been intensified following the adoption of the resolution were an intolerable and serious provocation against the army and people of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is a limit to patience. The U.S. should no longer cling to acts of misleading the public opinion and deceiving the world while vociferating about the non-existent \"provocation\" and \"threats\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It will be a foolish calculation for the U.S. to think that its arbitrary practices reminding one of a thief crying \"stop the thief\" will work on the bright world today. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. We state to the world once again that the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is an invariable will and resolve of the army and people of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was behests of President Kim Il Sung and General Secretary Kim Jong Il and a policy task which the party, state, army and people of the DPRK have to carry out without fail.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula does not only mean \"dismantling the nuclear weapons of the north\". It is the complete one that calls for denuclearizing the whole peninsula including south Korea and aims at totally ending the U.S. nuclear threats to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As for the possession of nuclear weapons by the DPRK, it is the strategic option taken by the DPRK for self-defence to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The legitimate status of the DPRK as a nuclear weapons state will go on and on without vacillation whether others recognize it or not until the whole Korean Peninsula is denuclearized and the nuclear threats from outside are put to a final end.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Therefore, the U.S. should stop nuclear threats and blackmail and all forms of provocations including \"sanctions\" against the DPRK, before urging it to show first its sincerity regarding the will for denuclearization to open the phase for dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. We propose senior-level talks between the authorities of the DPRK and the U.S. to defuse tensions on the Korean Peninsula and ensure peace and security in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. has true intent on defusing tensions on the Korean Peninsula and ensuring peace and security in the U.S. mainland and the region, it should not raise precondition for dialogue and contact.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The talks can have broad and in-depth discussions on defusing military tensions, replacing the armistice system with peace mechanism and other issues of mutual concern including the building of a \"world without nuclear weapons\" proposed by the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. can set the venue and date of the talks to its convenience.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Consistent is the stand of the DPRK to defuse tensions on the Korean Peninsula and ensure peace and security of the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. truly wants to realize a \"world without nuclear weapons\" and bring detente, it should positively respond to the DPRK's bold decision and good intention, not missing the opportunity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the future developments entirely depend on the responsible option of the U.S., which has strained the situation on the Korean Peninsula."

Damos a conocer claramente otra vez que Estados Unidos es precisamente el autor que ha venido exacerbando de siglo en siglo y de decada en decada la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  EE.UU. desato la guerra de agresion en esta peninsula en la decada de los 50 del siglo pasado y destruyo sistematicamente el Acuerdo de Armisticio de Corea durante 60 anos posbelicos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl entrar en la decada de los 10 del nuevo siglo, vuelve a maniobrar obstinadamente para desencadenar otra guerra de agresion contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde diciembre del ano expirado califico nuestro legitimo y justo lanzamiento de satelite como el disparo de misil de largo alcance, y nuestras medidas militares de autodefensa tomadas frente a sus abiertas maniobras agresivas, como una \"provocacion\". De esta manera, puso al desnudo su naturaleza de provocador mas cinico y agresor mas bandidesco.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas resoluciones de \"sancion\" inventadas a instigacion de EE.UU. y todos sus actos hostiles mas siniestros anti-RPDC constituyen grave provocacion intolerable contra nuestro ejercito y pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay limite en la paciencia, razon por la cual EE.UU. no debe aferrarse al engano a la opinion publica y al mundo hablando tanto de la inexistente \"provocacion\" y \"amenaza\" de alguien.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSera muy absurdo si EE.UU. piensa en que tales atrocidades podrian convencer a las personas en este mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Volvemos a aclarar al interior y exterior del pais que nuestro ejercito y pueblo tienen la invariable voluntad y decision de desnuclearizar la Peninsula Coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana es el legado del Presidente Kim Il Sung y del Dirigente Kim Jong Il y la tarea politica a ser cumplida sin falta por nuestro partido, Estado, militares y civiles. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana  no es la desnuclearizacion para la \"renuncia nuclear del Norte\" sino la de toda la extension de la Peninsula Coreana inclusive el Sur de Corea y tiene la meta de acabar completamente con la amenaza nuclear anti-RPDC de EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn cuanto a la posesion de armas nucleare de la RPDC, esto es la opcion autodefensiva y estrategica para realizar la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa digna posicion de la RPDC como pais con armas nucleares se mantendra con firmeza hasta cuando se alcance la desnuclearizacion de toda la Peninsula Coreana y desaparezca por completo la amenaza nuclear de las fuerzas extranjeras, independientemente de que alguien lo reconozca o no. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPues, para abrir la coyuntura de dialogo, EE.UU. debe dejar, primero, la amenaza y chantaje nucleares anti-RPDC y las provocaciones de toda indole incluso la \"sancion\", antes de demandarnos demostrar la sinceridad en la voluntad de desnuclearizacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Proponemos sostener las conversaciones de alto nivel entre las autoridades de EE.UU. y RPDC para eliminar la tension de la Peninsula Coreana y preservar la paz y la seguridad de la region. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi EE.UU. tiene de veras algun interes en aliviar la tension de la Peninsula Coreana y garantizar la paz y la seguridad de su territorio principal y el resto de la region, no debe hablar del dialogo y contacto anteponiendo la premisa. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn esta cita podrian discutirse con sinceridad y profundamente varios temas deseados por ambas partes, entre otros, el alivio de la tension militar, la sustitucion del sistema de armisticio por el de paz y la \"construccion del mundo libre de armas nucleares\" presentada por EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl lugar y el tiempo de dialogo,  podra fijarlos EE.UU. segun su conveniencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs invariable nuestra posicion de aliviar la tension de la Peninsula Coreana y preservar la paz y seguridad de la region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi EE.UU. desea de veras el \"mundo libre de armas nucleares\" y el alivio de la tension, debe responder a nuestra decision magnanima y buena bondad sin perder esta oportunidad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa evolucion de la situacion depiende de la opcion responsable de EE.UU. que hasta ahora ha venido agravando la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana."
