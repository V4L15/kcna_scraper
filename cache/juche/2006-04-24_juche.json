Thanks to the invincible military power provided by him, the Korean army and people could work such miracles as reliably defending socialism even in the worst trials and winning victory after victory in the standoff with the United States, the chairman said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n V.K. Chopra, chairman of the Indian Intellectuals' Society for the Study of the Juche Idea, said that Kim Il Sung devoted his all to the freedom and happiness of the people and the human cause of independence until the last moments of his life. His great exploits will remain long with the century, the chairman added.\r\n N. Bold, chief of Mongol Chinggis Khaan College Centre for the Study of the Juche Idea, said that Kim Jong Il, chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission who is successfully carrying forward Kim Il Sung's cause, has smashed the moves of the U.S. and other imperialists for isolating and stifling the DPRK with his unique Songun policy to defend the security of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, a meeting, a lecture, a seminar, a reading session, a photo exhibition, a film show and a Taekwon-Do demonstration performance were held by the Party for Unity and Progress, the Kim Il Sung Institute of Agricultural Science and the Koba Farm in Guinea and in Malabo of Equatorial Guinea between April 6 and 14.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This clearly shows that the will and action of the south Korean people are filled with anti-Americanism. The south Korean people should get united under the banner of independence against the U.S. irrespective of idea and political view, property, religious belief and isms to fight the U.S. imperialists with the stronger might of unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The June 15 era of reunification is a stirring era in which the Korean nation will emerge victorious in the idea of national independence against outside forces.\r\n The nuclear weapons of the U.S. imperialists will do harm not only to the north but also to the south. Unpardonable are the U.S. imperialists' new war preparations to block the progress of the June 15 era of the reunification and destroy the Korean nation.\r\n Peace should be achieved through the struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The might of the Korean nation should be strong to check the danger of war on the Korean Peninsula and provide an atmosphere favorable for the independent reunification.
