            "content": "Kim Jong Un Visits Kwisong Saltern\r\n Pyongyang, May 24 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Un, chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea, first chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, visited the Kwisong Saltern to learn about the salt production from underground ultra-saline water by the KPA.\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that he could hardly go to sleep after receiving a report that the People's Army turns out a large quantity of salt on a small field by introducing the method of salt production with underground ultra-saline water, he expressed pleasure over the fact that a bright prospect was opened up for fully meeting the national economy's growing demand for salt.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He acquainted himself in detail with the economic effectiveness of the new salt production method, comparing it with the previous method based on seawater.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to obtain salt from seawater, there should be reservoir, preliminary evaporating pond, evaporating pond and crystallization pond, but only evaporating pond and crystallization pond are needed to produce salt from underground ultra-saline water, several times higher in concentration than seawater. So, half of the present area of salt fields can be used for aquaculture, he noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that salt from underground ultra-saline water is tasty as it has less brine than that from seawater and it is of very high utility value in promoting the people's health and producing foodstuff, cosmetics and other basic necessities as it contains much potassium and iodine and less heavy metal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There are rich underground ultra-saline water resources of great economic value in the west coastal area of our country, he said, adding: The relevant sector should vigorously prospect the promising fields of underground ultra-saline water and the salterns across the country should positively introduce the method of producing salt with underground ultra-saline water to radically boost the production of salt essential to the people's livelihood and the economic development.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that the Party's policy should be implemented the way the People's Army does, he asked with great satisfaction for conveying his high appreciation and greetings to the soldiers who made a turning point in the country's history of salt industry.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The salt production from underground ultra-saline water is now at the start, but its prospect is rosy and it is an important way of solving the salt problem, he said, adding: The People's Army should continue to take the lead in piling salt and generalize its success and experience widely.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed that the salt production sector should conduct a dynamic drive for producing salt in a larger quantity and thus supply enough salt urgently needed by various sectors of the national economy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Hwang Pyong So, Pak Yong Sik, O Su Yong and Jo Yong Won."

They are evoking a lively response at home and abroad as they are just and fair and reflect his warm love for the country and nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t Ri Jong Hyok, director of the National Reunification Institute, said this in a statement on Tuesday.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that supreme leader Kim Jong Un laid down a new line and policies for national reunification to weather the prevailing ordeals and indicated the ways for implementing them at the Seventh Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea, he fully supported them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The history of the inter-Korean relations and reality clearly prove that it is possible to pull down the barrier of division and open up a wide avenue to independent reunification when all Koreans unite close as one irrespective of ideology, ism, political view and religious belief, cherishing great ambition for national reunification. But national reunification can never be achieved and the Korean people would only meet miserable disaster of war when the south Korean authorities resort to the moves for confrontation with the fellow countrymen in the north, seeking \"unification of social systems,\" pursuant to the outsiders' moves to split and alienate Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whether to put the earliest possible end to the nation's distress-torn  history in which it has undergone pain and misfortunes resulting from the division for more than seven decades due to outside forces and fling the door open for independent reunification or not depends on how to implement the fresh line and policies for national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There are still big obstacles and ordeals in the way of national reunification, but the entire Korean nation's patriotic drive for reunification to build a dignified, prosperous and reunified power on this land is sure to emerge victorious."

The writer in the book asserted that the foreign policy of the U.S., which involved itself in the disputes all over the world after the demise of the Cold War to impose upon all countries of the world the political system to its liking is now on the verge of bankruptcy. The writer made a final analysis that the U.S. recklessly interfered in the internal affairs of the countries in Africa, South America and East Europe in a bid to keep the world order favorable to it, styling itself \"a world gendarme\" but has repeated setbacks which were attributable to its imposition of the American-style political system upon them.\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on this, Minju Joson Tuesday says this was a right view.

Y divulgando a la opinion publica su insistencia absurda en que la propuesta de dialogo de la RPDC persigue el objeto de debilitar la colaboracion internacional en la \"sancion anti-Norte de Corea\" y fomentar la \"discordia entre surcoreanos\", sueltan las palabras provocativas tales como \"hay que anteponer la desnuclearizacion\".

Y en 2016, cuando la RPDC realizo la primera prueba de bomba de hidrogeno, aprobo la \"resolucion No.2270\" (S/RES/2270). \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo problematico es que el articulo 9 del prologo y el primer articulo del texto de la \"resolucion No. 1718\", el articulo 8 del prologo de la \"resolucion No. 1874\", el articulo 7 del prologo de la \"resolucion No. 2094\" y el articulo 11 del prologo de la \"resolucion No.2270\" definen como \"amenaza a la paz y seguridad internacionales\" las pruebas nucleares y el lanzamiento de satelites de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl respecto, presento las siguientes preguntas:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPrimero, ?cual es el fundamento juridico de las insistencias de las \"resoluciones de sancion\" que definen como \"amenaza a la paz y seguridad internacionales\" las pruebas nucleares, el lanzamiento de satelites y el lanzamiento de cohetes balisticos de la RPDC?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa Carta de la ONU, las resoluciones de la Asamblea General de la ONU, el CTBT, el TNP, el Tratado Espacial y otros derechos internacionales no tienen ni un articulo que define las pruebas nucleares como \"amenaza a la paz y seguridad internacionales\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegundo, ?si las pruebas nucleares, el lanzamiento de satelites y de cohetes balisticos se consideran como \"amenaza a la paz y seguridad internacionales\", por que el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU no ha cuestionado ni tomado las medidas de sancion sobre mas de 2 mil pruebas nucleares y lanzamiento de satelites y de cohetes balisticos realizados por EE.UU. y otros paises?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTercero, si no se dan las explicaciones juridicas persuasibles a las citadas preguntas, se considerara que el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU abuso de su autoridad despreciando la demanda del articulo 39 del capitulo 7 de la Carta de la ONU de \"definir la existencia o no de la amenaza a la paz y seguridad internacionales\" antes de tomar las medidas de sancion, y cometio la actitud de doble rasero perdiendo la imparcialidad que es la vida de la organizacion internacional. Por lo tanto, esperamos la respuesta juridica del Secretariado de la ONU."
