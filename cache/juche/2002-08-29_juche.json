This is because it is afraid of disclosing its crime of betraying the people and choosing U.S.-made fighters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, all the contents of the introduction of weapons have already been opened to the public and its secrecy was ineffective. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHowever, the defense ministry refused to comply with people's demand for probe, which is little short of trying to cover the sky with the palm of the hand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement said that they would wage a powerful struggle if the board of audit and inspection yields to the unilateral assertion of the defense ministry and fails to conduct a probe as demanded by the people.    \r\n\r\n"
