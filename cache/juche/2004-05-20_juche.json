This cannot be construed otherwise than an outright challenge to the joint declaration and a perfidy to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Both sides had an earnest discussion on the issue of stopping all actions getting on each other's nerves at the 14th inter-Korean ministerial talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nYet, the south Korean authorities are going to commit a hostile act soon after the return of their negotiators to Seoul.
