It is a flagrant violation and an unbearable insult to the sovereignty of the DPRK.\r\n   The DPRK's missile development and export belongs to the sovereignty of the independent country. So, no one is entitled to poke his nose into the issue. The DPRK is in a military confrontation with the U.S. which boasts of being the only superpower in the world. The U.S. seeks to isolate and stifle the  DPRK  politically, militarily and economically, while intensifying military tie-up with Japan and South Korea. Therefore, no one is allowed to pull the DPRK up over this issue under this situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   However, the U.S. is taking issue with the DPRK, in league with Japan and South Korea, and putting spurs to arms buildup. It is employing this base technique to realise its ambition for military supremacy and monopolistic position in the Asia-pacific region.\r\n   The Korean people and the revolutionary armed forces will increase self-reliant national defense capabilities to foil aggressive scheming of the U.S. and its followers and fight to the end in defence of the nation's sovereignty and dignity. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Moreover, the self-styled \"government for the people\" is brutally cracking down upon pro-reunification democratic forces on the strength of this evil law.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Last year alone, the number of the prisoners of conscience showed an increase of more than 400. \r\nNevertheless, the South Korean rulers plan to exclude pro-reunification patriotic forces from the \"special amnesty.\"\r\n   The \"special amnesty\" is useless if these figures are excluded.\r\n   Lurking behind the loud-mouthed advertisement about the \"release of unconverted long-term prisoners\" is the sinister intention of the South Korean rulers.\r\n   Public opinion at home and abroad is strongly calling for the repeal of the fascist law and for the release of the conscientious prisoners who devoted their all to reunification and patriotic cause.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Accordingly, their announcement about the \"release of the unconverted long-term prisoners at the advanced age of 70\" is nothing but a gesture to deflect strong criticism at home and abroad and mislead public opinion. At the same time, they intend to bring them under stricter watch and control as per the \"security law\" and the \"law on supervision for public peace.\"\r\n   A news analyst of Minju Joson says:   The South Korean rulers' talk  about \"release of unconverted long-term prisoners\" is just a window-dressing as it is intended to create the impression that they are interested in human rights. \r\n\r\n  \r\n"

They should at the same time make a policy switchover  at an early date and go in for national independence and pro-north reconciliation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The NDFSK, as well as broad segments of people, will accelerate a march for independence and reunification and thus greatly help make this year a year of national independence and great unity in hearty response to the three charters of national reunification set forth by the President Kim Il Sung and the five-point policy of great national unity laid down by General Secretary Kim Jong Il. \r\n\r\n"
