            "content": "KCNA Assails Japan for Peddling \"Abduction Issue\" \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 4 (KCNA) -- The ultra-right conservative forces of Japan are still peddling shamelessly the \"abduction issue' which had already found a solution.\r\n This is evidenced by a statement released by the \"Society of Abductees' Families\" and the \"Association for Rescuing Abductees,\" both made up of the above-said forces.\r\n The statement blustered that \"unless the issue of the repatriation of abductees is settled at the dialogue with north Korea, there is no other option but to apply economic sanctions against it to express the will of the state to bring back all the abductees\".\r\n This meant the Japanese ultra-right conservative forces' total denial of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration, a clear indication that they have no political will to normalize the relations with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They made much ado about \"false remains\" and \"accurate examination\" only to become a laughing stock of the world. Yet, they do not bother to resort to such political rowdyism aimed at further deteriorating the bilateral ties, again stoking the atmosphere of confrontation under the present situation. Why? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is prompted by their political and strategic aim to drive their government to sustaining its hostile policy towards the DPRK come what may.\r\n As six decades have already passed since Japan's defeat, the issue of its settlement of past crimes has become the focus of the international community's attention. The international community including Asian countries strongly urge the Japanese government to immediately come out for this settlement, unanimously denouncing Japan's imprudent attempt to evade its commitment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's settlement of its crimes perpetrated against the Korean people in the past is an issue that should be solved without fail for the normalization of the relations between the DPRK and Japan as was stressed by the Pyongyang declaration.\r\n It is as clear as daylight that the issue of Japan's settlement of its past should be discussed in case an inter-governmental contact takes place between the two countries for the normalization of the bilateral relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said ultra-right conservative forces again trumpeted about the worn-out \"abduction issue,\" thus admitting themselves that they are playing the role as a shock brigade in egging the government on to evade the settlement of the past wrongs. Lurking behind this move is a sinister intention to improve their public image and, at the same time, to create at home and abroad a climate favorable for their hostile policy towards the DPRK and their policy of veering to the Right. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is not allowed to behave as it pleases as far as the issue of its settlement of its past is concerned. It is not the issue that allows Japan to cover it up. \r\n Japan kidnapped and forcibly drafted at least 8.4 million Koreans in the last century and even now it is persisting in luring and abducting operations in the DPRK-China border area. However, it is loudmouthed about the issue which had already been settled, while keeping mum about their cases of abduction committed by it for more than a century. This is absolutely unpardonable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is ridiculous of those ultra-right conservative forces to try to apply economic sanctions against the DPRK under pretext of the \"abduction issue\". \r\n The Korean people have strong faith as they have built independent national economy and accomplished everything despite the enemy's vicious and persistent sanctions that have lasted for several decades. The DPRK is strong in its faith as it has made progress on its own. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That is why the DPRK and its people remain unfazed even in face of Japan's threat and provocation such as \"sanctions\" or \"stop to the humanitarian aid.\"\r\n The Japanese government must be well aware of this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Should the Japanese government cling to the hostile policy towards the DPRK, dancing to the tune of the ultra-right forces, it will only result in vitiating the atmosphere of the progress to normalize the relations between the DPRK and Japan and pushing the present confrontation to the point of explosion. The DPRK never says empty words.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Accused of Hamstringing Development of Inter-Korean Relations \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 4 (KCNA) -- Some days ago the \"National Assembly\" of south Korea decided to reorganize the \"special committee for the development of the south-north relations\" tasked to ensure \"transparency\" and \"prior consultation\" while \"reviewing\" the inter-Korean relations.\r\n Commenting on this, papers here Tuesday observe: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"The special committee\" was initiated by the Grand National Party of south Korea which has played only a negative role after poking its nose into the issue of inter-Korean relations and the reunification issue. The committee is, therefore, nothing but a product of the anti-reunification plot of the ultra-right conservative forces of the GNP to arrest the progress of the national history and bring the present inter-Korean ties back to the old era of confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The news analyst of Rodong Sinmun notes: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The NA's \"review\" of the inter-Korean cooperation which has been under way according to the fellow countrymen's will for reconciliation and reunification could not produce anything positive because the NA has undergone  turns and twists due to the intrigues of the GNP. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn actuality, the NA has not yet expressed any support to the June 15 joint declaration though it is five years since it was adopted to be hailed at home and abroad.\r\n The NA should no longer play into the hands of such anti-reunification forces as the GNP as they have been keen to deter the inter-Korean relations from improving and incite anti-north confrontation by reorganizing the \"special committee\". Explicitly speaking, there is no justification whatsoever to create such \"special committee.\" \r\n  The reality goes to prove that neither the aspiration of the south Korean people for independence, democracy and reunification nor the development of the inter-Korean relations can come true as long as the anti-reunification conservative forces including the GNP are allowed to remain in the NA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the NA is to make a genuine contribution to the development of the inter-Korean relations, it should not talk about \"transparency\" in undertakings for cooperation but see through the anti-reunification attempt of the GNP, contain and reject this traitorous group and take a practical action to scrap the \"National Security Law\" extremely harmful to the cause of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A commentary of Minju Joson warns that the NA's decision to reorganize the \"special committee\" is little short of digging its own grave.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But the U.S. invariable ulterior intention to stifle the DPRK and dominate the whole of Korea is evoking the vigilance and apprehension of the Korean people and the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. continued reinforcement of forces of aggression in and around south Korea is to ignite another Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The strike of the DPRK is powerful and invincible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has already declared that it would not need even a nuke if DPRK-U.S. relations are normalized, confidence built and the DPRK feels no longer to fear the U.S. nuclear threat. It is high time that the U.S. got rid of the old Korea policy of the era of Cold War and took a decisive measure for building confidence in the DPRK. \r\n The essence of the settlement of the DPRK-U.S. relations is to build confidence and this is not an exception to the settlement of the nuclear issue.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The cause of party building was pioneered in the unique way of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The pioneering of the anti-Japanese revolution was the origin of the cause of Juche-oriented party building in our country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Party is unshakable in any storm and stress as it took root in the rigorous and bloody long journey of the Songun revolution and has steadily developed with the principle of arms as its nutritious element. Herein lies the unique character and feature of the Party as a Juche-oriented revolutionary party and its everlasting vitality. \r\n The Party is a revolutionary party of a new type guided by the Juche idea and the Songun idea based on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Party was founded and has developed with the firm organizational and ideological foundation laid in the arduous struggle of the anti-Japanese revolution and the revolutionaries of arms as its hard core. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history of party building is that of party building of Songun type which was pioneered and consolidated firm with Songun. For the Party Juche is Songun and Songun is Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Party is an ever-victorious party that has performed great undying exploits in the history of socialist politics under the banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Party is a great guide which has built Korean style socialism centering on the popular masses and led it to a continued prosperity. From the very day of its foundation the Party set up a power representing the will and interests of the people with the army as its mainstay, prepared the political force enough to undertake the tasks of great social revolution and the material guarantee for the establishment of the socialist system in reliance on military power from scratch. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The superior and unique Korean-style socialism where the popular masses emerge as the master of everything and everything serves them is the tower of socialist success which was erected with Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the firm will of the Party to rapidly develop national defence,  economy and culture with great Songun politics, bring the DPRK up to the position of the strongest in the world and put forward the Korean people as the most dignified and happy people in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK is an ever victorious party which has firmly defended the sovereignty of the country and the dignity of the nation with Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to the strong arms the Party has provided a phase of final victory, taking the initiative even at the time of extreme trials and difficulties while closely watching the internal and external situation. The history of the Party's leadership over the \"arduous march\" has been embroidered with the traces of the Songun politics which has helped to cement its powerful self-defensive military muscle in every way in the worst adversity. \r\n The WPK is a glorious party that has laid the foundation for eternal victory of our revolution under the banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the most valuable asset for victory of the Songun revolution that leader Kim Jong Il has systematized and completed the Songun idea and politics as a great strategic programme for the accomplishment of the cause of socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to the Songun politics of the Party the people's army has grown as an invincible revolutionary army which is infinitely loyal to the leadership of the Party and moves as one under the order of the Supreme Commander. The people's army fully equipped with modern offensive and defensive means has been firmly prepared as a creditable shield with strong nuclear deterrent to defend the socialist homeland. The exploits of Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il which has brought the Korean nation, once a ruined nation subjugated by the imperialists in the early 20th century, on to the position of a dignified strongest power today 100 years after are the great patriotic exploits that should be highly praised and glorified generation after generation. \r\n The high dignity and glory of the Party is the absolute prestige of President Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il who founded and led the Party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The cause of the Party advancing under the banner of Songun is invincible forever.  The Songun idea and politics will always be the life and soul and eternal banner of victory of the Party, the article concludes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
