Juche 53 (1964). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Clarified in the theses are the essential content of the rural question under socialism, basic principles and tasks to solve it, position and role of the county in building socialism in the countryside and so on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The WPK adopted the theses as its program to build socialism in the countryside at the eighth plenary meeting of its fourth central committee and mobilized the whole party and all people to implement the theses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Above all, the party pushed ahead with the ideological, technical and cultural revolutions as the main tasks of building socialism in the countryside. At the same time it intensified the working-class leadership of the peasantry, assistance of industry to agriculture, and support of towns to the countryside in every way. In order to consolidate rural position many hardcore workers and discharged soldiers were dispatched to the countryside and investments in the rural areas steadily increased. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Modern farming machines, chemical fertilizers and agricultural chemicals were increasingly supplied and many agro-technicians and experts trained at state expense. The agricultural tax in kind was annually abolished  from Juche 53 (1964) to Juche 55 (1966)  and capital construction in the countryside stepped up at state expense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The party put big efforts to enhancing the role of the county, a regional base in the construction of a socialist countryside. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Therefore, a great change has been brought in the work for the final solution of the rural question. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The ideological, technical and cultural standard of agricultural workers was elevated and the number of agro-technicians and experts increased up to a level of one per ten farmers in 1990. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In more than three decades after the publication of the theses the number of tractors serving the countryside increased six times and trucks five times. The material and technical foundations of agriculture have been firmly laid with the successful promotion of industrialization and modernization of agriculture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Fundamental changes have taken place in the material and cultural lives of the agricultural workers and conditions are ripe for converting cooperative property into all-people property. \r\n\r\n"

He stressed that the KCTU would sustain its struggle in the days ahead. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The KCTU demanded the authorities totally amend the policy of \"restructuring\" based on neo-liberalism, stop the suppression of trade unions, unseat the \"chief of the national police office\" and the \"Minister of Labor\" and arrest the president of Lotte Group and the chief director of the Medical Insurance Public Corporation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Earlier, the Federation of Banking Office Clerks Unions and the Public Transport and Service Trade Union staged rallies in Seoul to denounce the authorities for riot police crackdown. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Compensation for loss of electricity \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 12 (KCNA) -- At a recent executive council meeting of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organisation (KEDO) held in New York a leading official of KEDO caviled at the DPRK's just proposal calling for the compensation for the loss of electricity caused by the delayed provision of light water reactors (LWR). He asserted that \"the concept of compensation cannot be accepted\" and \"there is no idea to compensate.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   An outright challenge to the DPRK's just proposal, this piffle clearly indicates that KEDO does not know where it stands. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The basic mission of KEDO organized by the U.S. under the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework is to perform its technical role of providing LWRs to the DPRK within the time limit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the final analysis, the U.S. is the DPRK's main partner in the work related to the LWR provision. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is chiefly to blame for the indefinitely delayed construction of LWRs which it is committed to provide to the DPRK by 2003 under the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. has dragged out the LWR construction on this or that pretext. In consequence, no one can tell when it will be completed and the DPRK has suffered a huge loss of electricity due to this delay. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S., too, fully admitted this and expressed its willingness to discuss it at future talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As seen above, the issue of compensation for the loss of electricity caused by the delayed provision of LWRs should be solved between the DPRK and the U.S. it does not allow KEDO's interference. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   KEDO had better stop meddling in other's affair and mind its own business. The U.S. should compensate for the loss of electricity caused by the delayed LWR construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the issue of compensation for the loss of electricity fails to find a smooth solution, the DPRK will be left with no option but to restart its independent nuclear power industry. \r\n\r\n"
