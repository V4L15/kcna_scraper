            "content": "Kim Jong Il Inspects Factories in Jagang Province\r\n Pyongyang, July 30 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il provided field guidance to various industrial establishments in Jagang Province making leap forward to push back the frontiers of latest science.\n\t\t\t\t\t The first leg of his guidance was the Kanggye General Tractor Plant, a model plant put on a CNC basis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round different shops and products of the plant, he acquainted himself in detail with technological updating and production there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He highly estimated the revolutionary work style and enterprising work approach of the officials, workers and technicians of the plant making uninterrupted innovations and advances, noting it is laudable that they have changed its appearance as required by the era of knowledge-based economy through a dynamic mass technological innovation movement and are stepping up the vigorous advance to hit the higher goal of latest science.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The plant is now capable of manufacturing machine products requiring high technology, he said, adding that this is a miracle wrought thanks to the indomitable mental power, work style and the Kanggye spirit of the people in Jagang Province who have grown remarkably stronger through the \"Arduous March\", the forced march.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round a duck farm built by the plant, he highly praised the officials of the plant for having provided the workers with good conditions for diet and cultural recreation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The plant set an example not only in modernization but in supply service for the workers and cultured practices in production and life, he said, stressing the need for all units to follow the experience of the plant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He watched a fire-fighting drill conducted by the fire brigade of the plant with fire-fighting equipment manufactured by itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He put forward highly important tasks which would serve as guidelines for managing and operating the plant and boosting its production.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The next leg of his guidance was the Jangjagang Machine Tool Factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Making the rounds of various places of the factory, he got familiar in detail with the performance and principle of mechanism of CNC-based machine tools. He highly estimated the workers of the factory for their merits, expressing great satisfaction over the fact that they are mass-producing good machine products as required by the new century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that the factory is one of the model factories demonstrating the proud appearance of the Juche-based industry. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the country is now successfully manufacturing any latest machines if it has a will, he said with pride that this shining reality eloquently proves that the nation's Juche-based machine-building industry has proudly reached the world level of cutting-edge science and technology. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that in order to manufacture more modern machine products as required by the new century the factory should continue channeling efforts into technological updating based on the latest technology for the purpose of putting production processes on a modern and precision basis and standardizing products on a higher level.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He set again the target to be attained by the factory in the near future, specified tasks and ways to do so and showed such great benevolence as unraveling knotty problems.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had a photo session with the labor innovators of the factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The third leg of his guidance was the September Textile Mill.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Seeing historic mementoes and data displayed in the room devoted to its history, he recalled with deep emotion unforgettable days of history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the mill has turned into the nation's leading textile producer thanks to the wise guidance and meticulous instructions of President Kim Il Sung, he stressed that the Korean people would always remember the profound loving care and benevolence of the President who worked heart and soul for solving the people's problem of clothing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round Spinning Shop No. 3 and various other places of the mill, he acquainted himself in detail with the progress made in updating and production there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Seeing the data on the efforts made by women of meritorious services who have sincerely worked at the mill for years, he estimated their feats. No women have added shine to their fame and existence as the women in the era of the Workers' Party did, he said, adding that this epoch-making change in the position and role of the women of the DPRK is a clear proof that they are a powerful force dynamically pushing forward the revolution and construction as they are strong in revolutionary spirit and militancy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Making the rounds of the canteen newly built by the mill and other supply service facilities, he paid deep attention to the living of the workers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He set forth highly important tasks to be carried out by the mill.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that it is the steadfast resolution and will of the WPK to provide the people with better clothes, he stressed the need to direct bigger efforts to producing textile and bring about a new turn in settling the problem of clothing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Supply service at the mill where women hold a majority is of special importance, he said, calling upon the party organization and officials of the mill to always pay deep attention to providing the women workers with good living conditions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He enjoyed a performance given by members of the workers art group of the mill in the work place.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After enjoying the performance, he expressed great satisfaction over the fact that the revolutionary and militant workers of the DPRK are successfully discharging a vanguard role in creating new culture, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed great expectation and conviction that the workers of the mill would make strenuous efforts to implement the Party's policy on bringing about a radical turn in the light industry and produce and supply more quality clothing materials and thus actively contribute to accomplishing the cause of building a thriving nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A dynamic drive for pushing back the frontiers of science and creating new standard and record is now under way at all factories and enterprises of Jagang Province, he said, calling upon the province to take the lead in carrying out the tasks of the technological revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Pak To Chun, chief secretary of the Jagang Provincial Committee of the WPK, Jang Song Thaek, vice-chairman of the NDC of the DPRK and department director of the WPK Central Committee, Kim Kyong Hui, Hong Sok Hyong and Thae Jong Su, department directors of the WPK Central Committee, and Ju Kyu Chang and Ri Jae Il, first vice department directors of the WPK Central Committee."

            "content": "3rd DPRK-US Military Working Contact Held\r\n Pyongyang, July 30 (KCNA) -- The 3rd round of the DPRK-U.S. senior colonel-level military working contact took place at Panmunjom on Friday to probe the truth about the \"Cheonan\" case.\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK side branded the proposal for creating a \"joint assessment group\" made by the U.S. forces' side at the last round of the contact as a politically motivated provocation as it wantonly infringes upon the sovereignty and dignity of the DPRK in disregard of international law including the United Nations Charter and brigandish sophism running diametrically counter to the provisions of the Armistice Agreement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. forces side came out with an absurd proposal on allowing to inspect the military base of the DPRK to counter its proposal for inspecting objects directly related to the \"Cheonan\" case such as the already disclosed scene of the case and material evidence, the DPRK side said, and continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As far as the inspection of the military bases is concerned, this logic of the U.S. forces side means calling for inspecting before any others not only the U.S. military bases in Ryongsan, Osan, Kunsan and other places in south Korea where large-scale frantic nuclear war exercises are staged against the DPRK before and after the \"Cheonan\" case but also the U.S. Forces Command, a center for fabrications and plots. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In a nutshell, the proposal of the U.S. forces side is nothing but a sinister intention to deliberately link the \"Cheonan\" case with the DPRK, justify its reckless hostile acts under the pretence of it and put brake on probing the truth behind the case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is the most urgent and important matter in settling the case is to give precedence to the field investigation by an inspection group of the DPRK National Defence Commission, the DPRK side stressed, pointing to the following reasons:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Firstly, the DPRK intends to dispatch the inspection group of its National Defence Commission because the U.S. forces side groundlessly links the DPRK with the warship case in collusion with the south Korean puppet group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Should the U.S. forces side talk nonsense, the DPRK side would not have called for the field survey of the inspection group of the NDC from the outset.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Secondly, the \"results of investigation\", a product of conspiracy and tie-up between the U.S. and the south Korean puppet group, are beset with doubts as they are unilateral and unscientific.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thirdly, the demand for investigation by the NDC inspection group fully conforms with the agenda of the DPRK-U.S. military general-level talks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Both sides adopted \"On clarifying the truth about the 'Cheonan' warship case on an objective and scientific basis\" as the agenda of the talks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK side cited detailed facts to condemn the U.S. forces side for kicking up a racket of reckless military confrontation aimed at wrecking  peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity under the pretext of the said case. And it warned that the army and people of the DPRK will take stronger counteraction unless the U.S. forces side stops military provocations against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK side declared that the U.S. forces side's persistent hindrance to the field investigation by the NDC inspection group and its insistence on the DPRK's involvement in the \"Cheonan\" case would harden the steadfast determination of the army and people of the DPRK to probe the truth about the case to the last.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Both sides agreed to hold the fourth round of the DPRK-U.S. senior colonel-level military working contact for probing the truth about the \"Cheonan\" case in Panmunjom around August 9."

After joining the Anti-Japanese People's Guerrilla Army in the spring of 1932 he displayed matchless courage and performed heroic feats in every battle as a squad leader and company political commissar and then as regiment commander and political commissar of an independent brigade. After the liberation of the country, too, he devotedly worked for the founding of the party and the building of regular revolutionary armed forces in hearty response to the line of building a new country set forth by the President. During the hard-fought Fatherland Liberation War he fought heroically for the victory in the war as a divisional commander. He died a heroic death in the battle for the liberation of Andong on July 30, 1950.   \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Choe Thae Bok, alternate member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, said in his memorial address that Choe Chun Guk made a great contribution to the liberation of the country and the defence of the national sovereignty. He was a genuine Juche type revolutionary fighter and an able military and political cadre who displayed his noble ideological and moral traits which everybody should learn from in the intense loyalty to the leader of the revolution, firm faith in the victory of the revolution, high qualifications, devotion to the country and the people and indomitable fighting spirit as a commanding officer, he said, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Though he passed away so early, this land is now witnessing the great heyday of prosperity under the wise leadership of General Secretary Kim Jong Il as desired by the anti-Japanese revolutionary martyrs in their lifetime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to the profound loving care and sense of obligation of the great persons of Mt. Paektu Choe's life and exploits are shining long along with the glorious history of the Songun revolution and his noble revolutionary spirit and feats powerfully encourage the servicepersons and people in their dynamic advance for the victory in the drive for building a thriving nation."
