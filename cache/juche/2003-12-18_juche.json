            "content": "KCNA Flails Corrupt GNP of S. Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 17 (KCNA) -- The Grand National Party of south Korea is censured as a \"party of thieves\" in the wake of the disclosure of more illicit money squeezed from tycoons on the threshold of the \"presidential election\" last year.\r\n It was newly disclosed on December 12 that it received 10 billion won from Hyundai Motor just before the election. This means that the GNP had received a total of over 60 billion won from business groups after putting pressure upon them: 10 billion from SK Group, 15.2 billion from Samsung Group and 15 billion from LG Group. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The prosecution in charge of investigation claims that it would reach hundreds of billions if bribes it received from other enterprises are added to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is well known to the world that the south Korean \"policy\" is a corrupt one swayed by money. But history knows no such precedent in which the GNP pressurized big businesses to provide it with a stupendous amount of money, threatening that it would label them as \"undesirable ones\" when it comes to power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No wonder, even the conservative media that has strongly supported the GNP traitorous group dismissed it as a \"corruption-ridden party\", branding its hideous financial scam as \"an act of organized violence.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP insisted at the outset of the investigation that it had received not a single penny. But it is now driven to such a tight corner as its scandals are irrefutable and the public and other political parties are strongly demanding its immediate dismantlement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Much upset by this, the GNP unilaterally railroaded the \"bill on the special inspection of scandals of president's close associates\" through the \"National Assembly,\" taking advantage of its dominant position there, in a bid to divert elsewhere the focus of the prosecution. And Choe Pyong Ryol, representative of the party, even staged a clumsy farce of attacking other parties, asserting that \"it is not only the GNP that has received illicit money\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A family nearing its end has frequent fights. Former GNP President Ri Hoe Chang staged the burlesque of making an apology full of lame excuses and privately blamed Choe for driving the situation to such a deplorable state while Ri's associates are locked in a fierce free-for-all to shift the blame for it onto others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is that this corrupt party drove the figure who took the lead in the north-south cooperation undertakings to death by brandishing the sword called \"the law on special inspection\" and cried out for a stern punishment of others until recently. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This clearly proves that the GNP coteries are thieves putting even Mafia into shade and human scum that have to be eliminated immediately for the sake of the democratization of the south Korean society, to say nothing of the inter-Korean cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Choe Pyong Ryol must frankly confess the truth behind all cases of corruption of the GNP and quit the political arena before talking about the \"special inspection.\"       \r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Therefore, Japan's dispatch of its SDF may meet attacks by Iraqis and Japan may have to pay the highest price since the end of the Second World War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality urges Japan to discard its pro-U.S. servitude and stop its moves to dispatch the SDF to Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many countries of the world are either opposed or displeased with Japan's dispatch of SDF to Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese chief executive, however, recently made a decision to dispatch SDF to Iraq at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The dispatch of SDF to Iraq is also in the breach of the \"law on the special measure for supporting the rehabilitation of Iraq\" adopted by the Japanese Diet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This notwithstanding, Japan is going to send heavily-armed SDF to combat areas in Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This reveals the sinister intention of the Japanese reactionaries to pave the way for SDF's overseas military operation through their troop dispatch and realize their wild ambition for overseas expansion at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The dispatch of the SDF to Iraq indicates that they can also be dispatched to the Korean peninsula and areas surrounding it fraught with great danger in the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many countries of the world including those in Asia are highly vigilant against Japan's moves to dispatch troops to Iraq. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This throws a revealing light on the reactionary nature and danger of the \"globalization\" advertised by it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The developing countries are suffering enormous damage from the imperialists' \"globalization\" moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The phenomenon of \"the rich get richer, the poor poorer\" is becoming more pronounced worldwide with the world being divided into capitalist countries getting richer and the developing countries poorer. The reactionary nature and injustice of the imperialists' \"globalization\" strategy have been proved by realities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The developing countries should buckle down with a zeal to working out a correct strategy to cope with the imperialists' \"globalization\" scheme negated by history. The main channel to knock the bottom out of this scheme is for each country to apply the principle of independence in keeping with its specific conditions and thereby defend and develop the Juche character and national identity in politics, economy, culture and all other areas and build an independent society, a new world based on independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One of the important matters for the developing countries to free themselves from the clutches of the imperialists' \"globalization\" strategy is to expand and develop south-south cooperation and economic relations on the principle of collective self-reliance and increase their own competitiveness. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
