            "content": "KCNA Slams Disturber of National Cooperation \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 6 (KCNA) --The joint New Year editorial of the newspapers of the Party, the army and the youth league set forth the slogan for the reunification movement for this year \"Let us pave a wide avenue for independent reunification through national cooperation under the banner of our nation-first spirit!\"\r\n The United States is chiefly to blame for hamstringing national cooperation and wrecking peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has left no means untried to drive a wedge between the north and south of Korea, the relations of which have favorably developed since the publication of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. It sparked a new nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula, thus increasing the danger of a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has worked hard to internationalize the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. and use it as a pretext for provoking a new war. It is an unpardonable criminal move to impose the disaster of a nuclear war upon the Korean nation and its land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has actively pushed ahead with its moves to re-locate its forces and military bases in south Korea, according to its re-deployment plan of its forces. They are aimed to launch another Korean war by the method of a \"preemptive attack\" and realize its strategy of military supremacy in East Asia with ease. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a daydream to think that it is possible to avert the danger of a war and achieve economic stability only when depending on the U.S., prompted by an illusion about it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aggressive nature of the Iraqi war, which the U.S. unilaterally launched defying the opposition of the international community including the UN, has been proved with added clarity as the days go by. Yielding to the U.S. pressure for troop dispatch is as foolish an act as escalating the danger of a war and deepening the economic instability, and little short of a suicidal act as it means betraying the fundamental interests of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has persistently stood in the way of the north-south cooperation including tour of Mt. Kumgang and the re-linking of the inter-Korean railways. This clearly proves that the U.S. is, indeed, a disturber of the national cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. does not want the reunification of the Korean peninsula and improved inter-Korean relations. And it does not care whether the Korean nation remains divided into two or suffers a nuclear disaster as it is keen only on its own interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The successive U.S. administrations have fished in troubled waters and justified its military presence in south Korea, its arms build-up and its moves for a war against the north, stoking hostility between the north and the south under the absurd pretext of \"threat\" from somebody. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has deliberately fanned up the confrontation between the two parts of Korea in a bid to perpetuate its division and use the confrontation as a leverage to realize its Asian strategy, the strategy for world supremacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The publication of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, however, provided the Korean nation with a great programme for national reunification reflecting its desire. Through a nation-wide struggle to defend and implement the joint declaration the Koreans could more clearly see through the true colors of the U.S. as the architect of national division. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-U.S. struggle for independence raging in south Korea in the new century clearly testifies to the historical truth that the U.S. is the root cause of all the misfortunes and sufferings of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As clarified in the joint editorial, the north and the south should take practical actions to cope with the nation's confrontation with the U.S. in order to defend the peace of the country and achieve its reunification.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is our consistent claim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK advanced a productive proposal to put into practice measures of the first phase if the U.S. found it hard to accept the package solution all at once. These measures are for the U.S. to delist the DPRK as a sponsor of terrorism, lift political, economic and military sanctions and blockade on it and for the U.S. and neighboring countries of the DPRK to supply heavy oil, power and other energy resources to the DPRK in return for its freeze of nuclear activities. The DPRK is set to refrain from test and production of nuclear weapons and stop even operating nuclear power industry for a peaceful purpose as first-phase measures of the package solution. This can not but be one more bold concession. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. demands Pyongyang completely scrap the nuclear program, not its freeze, dismissing as a new precondition the bold magnanimous measures proposed by the DPRK. This shows that the U.S. is only keen on disarming the DPRK after forcing it to scrap its nuclear program in utter disregard of its sincere efforts for the resumption of the six-way talks while failing to show any intention to make a switchover in the policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such a persistent stand of the U.S. will destroy the foundation of the dialogue and cast a dark shadow on the prospect of the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We must emphasize that the preparations for the six-way talks should be orientated toward reaching an agreement on the measures of the first-phase action along with \"words-for-words\" commitments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no reason for the U.S. to refuse to accept the DPRK-proposed measures, the starting point and the core issue in continuing the six-way talks, if it is truly concerned for solving the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whether the next round of the six-way talks is put on the right track or not entirely depends on the U.S. approach to it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a valuable review of the decade-long history in which we greeted a new era of building a great prosperous powerful nation, turning an adversity into favorable conditions and misfortune into blessing under the Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our army and people should remain true to the revolutionary idea of the President to strengthen the driving force of our revolution and consolidate the front of politics and ideology as firm as a rock. And we should resolutely defend and eternally glorify the exploits the President performed in building the army to remarkably reinforce the front of anti-imperialism and military affairs with the People's Army as the principal mainstay. We should also do everything as instructed by the President in his lifetime to make a great leaping advance on the front of economy and science. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The path of Juche hewed by the President and his exploits serve as a lifeline for the permanent victory of the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Remaining true to the Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il is a sure guarantee for successfully carrying out the President's intention in his lifetime and accomplishing the cause of socialism along the road of Juche indicated by the President. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The chief executive of Japan, however, substituted his visit to the shrine for his \"New Year address\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAfter all, by his practical action he declared at home and abroad what is Japan's general task this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His visit to the shrine on the New Year's day was prompted by a sort of \"pluck\" and \"self-confidence\" that there is no need to read anyone's face in realizing Japan's ambition for overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now the Japanese reactionaries are itching to step into overseas aggression as early as possible by taking advantage of the favorable chance today when the international situation is getting complicated and abnormal developments are taking place in different regions. To this end, they consider it to be most urgent to fan up militarist hysterics among the Japanese. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThat is why they are working hard to incite militarist consciousness and lead the home people to a drive to realize the old dream of \"the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\" which failed in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese chief executive's visit to the shrine is mainly aimed to instill into the hearts of the people the militarist crazy notion that the war criminals were not criminals and what they failed to attain must be achieved at all costs.\r\n The militarist moves will bring nothing but destruction and disgrace to Japan. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
