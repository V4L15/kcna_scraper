The present ruler of South Korea, infected with pro-Japanese flunkeyism and treachery, should be removed as early as possible. \r\n\r\n"

It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The revolutionary economic policy set forth by General Secretary Kim Jong Il is aimed to resolutely defend and further exalt the immortal exploits made by the great leader Kim Il Sung in the fields of the socialist economic construction. It is the most realistic one of Korean style based on a scientific analysis of the aspiration of the Korean people and the country's economic situation and a revolutionary one to firmly defend the socialist principle in economic construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Successful implementation of the revolutionary economic policy of the party would provide a sure guarantee for making another great advance of Chollima this year and an effective way of smashing the economic blockade of the imperialists and firmly defending socialism of Korean style. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the most important for us to hold fast to the revolutionary economic policy of the party and carry it out  in order to make once again a big advance of Chollima in the socialist economic construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The moves of the imperialists to economically suffocate socialism of Korean style have become all the more undisguised. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The revolutionary economic policy of the party is the economic strategy of Korean style that enables us to stand on our own feet under any conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A successful implementation of the revolutionary economic policy of the party alone would make it possible to solve the acute shortage of power and boost agricultural production and solve the food problem in a short period by ourselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The editorial describes the revolutionary economic policy of the party as a guideline in defending socialism of Korean style and guaranteeing an independent life to the last in the confrontation with the imperialists. \r\n\r\n"

Korean authorities \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 19 (KCNA) -- The \"Ministry of National Defence\" of South Korea reportedly announced a plan to deploy this year 100 units of the Israeli-made \"Harpy\", an unmanned attacker capable of destroying missile-tracking radar bases. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is a very grave move for arms buildup as it fully reveals the South Korean bellicose elements' more undisguised psychology of confrontation with the north and their criminal attempt to have a military edge over the north and provoke a war against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At the outset of the year, they held a \"security meeting,\"  at which they cried out for \"intensified counteraction,\" talking about someone's \"provocation.\" While staging various forms of war maneuvers one after another, they announced a plan for military spending amounting to about 5.3 trillion won for this year and also scheme to massively introduce weapons of mass destruction from Israel and other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This very ill-boding military move compels us to heighten vigilance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Given that the \"Harpy\" is to be deployed for action, coupled with the introduction of 20 ultra-modern military equipment including different types of missiles capable of \"attacking major targets in North Korea,\" large submarines, transport ships, the aim sought by them in this arms buildup is very dangerous. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The facts show how hypocritical \"exchange and cooperation\" advertised by the South Korean authorities are, and indicate that they are still resorting to the \"stick strategy.\" The South Korean bellicose elements are escalating the arms  buildup as never before and taking the road of war aggravating confrontation with the fellow countrymen in the north, going against the trend of the times when the ardent desire of the nation for reunification is running high, but this will lead them to self-destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They are well advised to stop at once the reckless arms buildup. \r\n\r\n"
