            "content": "DPRK FM on situation of Korean and democracy in UN activities\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Pyongyang, September 27 (KCNA) -- DPRK Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun in a speech at the 54th session of the UN General Assembly on Sept. 25 made clear our viewpoint and position concerning the present situation of the Korean peninsula which is standing in the center of the international peace and security issue and said that the 21st century should be a century of independence in which the sovereignty of all the states is equally respected. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is becoming almost a reality, not simply an assumption, that the Korean peninsula will be the second Balkan region, he said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the Balkan region, the \"humanitarian crisis\" served as a pretext of war, whereas on the Korean peninsula, the so-called \"missile issue\" is likely to be used as its pretext. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nOur satellite launch is the exercise of equal rights for the use of outer space as recognized by the United Nations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nStrengthening our national defense capabilities is the exercise of the sovereign right for legitimate defense. It does not constitute a violation of any of DPRK obligations under existing international treaties on all accounts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The present-day confrontation on the Korean peninsula is, in essence, a confrontation between those who are masters of their own country trying to defend their own and foreign forces attempting to harm others. This is the main factor of instability continuing on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The way of ensuring lasting peace and security on the Korean peninsula is to remove hostile relations between the DPRK and the U.S. and realize Korea's reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We already made it clear that we would not regard the United States as a permanent enemy. If the United States stops pursuing its hostile policy against the DPRK and moves toward improved relations, we will also respond with good faith. The United States should not attempt to test our military power by means of strength and frighten or subjugate our people through military threats and provocations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe United Nations should fulfil its responsibility for ensuring peace on the Korean peninsula by implementing as early as possible the resolution adopted at the 30th session of the UN General Assembly calling for the dissolution of the \"UN command\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In order to bring about a new century of independence,  durable peace and security, a just international order never tolerating high-handedness and arbitrariness should be established. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   To this end, the principle of respect for sovereignty should be strictly adhered to as the supreme principle in international relations. What is important in establishing a just international order is to ensure fairness in the formulation and application of international treaties relating to disarmament, human rights and so forth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn order for the United Nations to fulfill its responsibilities and role in accordance with its charter, democracy should be practiced in the UN activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRegarding the composition of the Security Council, we oppose, under any circumstances, the permanent membership of a defeated nation which has not liquidated its past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will continue to maintain independence, peace and friendship as the fundamental ideal of its foreign policy.\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "DPRK FM on DPRK-U.S. relations and UN restructuring\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, September 27 (KCNA) -- DPRK Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun referred to improving the DPRK-U.S. relations and restructuring the United Nations to ensure democracy in its activities at the 54th session of the United Nations General Assembly on September 25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Easing tension on the Korean peninsula and eliminating a danger of war are possible when the U.S. discards, among other things, its hostile policy against the DPRK and concludes a peace agreement with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We already made it clear that we would not regard the United States as a permanent enemy. We also showed fully our good faith through sincere implementation of the DPRK-U.S agreed framework during the last 5 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We also clarified that while we would make continued efforts to catch up with the neighboring countries in the field of peaceful space activities, we would be ready for discussions on missile issue at any time if hostile nations are sincere in their intention to dispel our concern. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Now is the U.S. side's turn to show us its good faith with deeds, if it does not harbor an ill intention towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is fortunate that the United States has recently decided to partially lift economic sanctions against the DPRK. However, we look forward to the comprehensive and actual lifting of all economic sanctions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the United States stops pursuing its hostile policy against the DPRK and moves toward improved relations, we will also respond to this with good faith. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States should not attempt to test our military power by means of strength and frighten or subjugate our people through military threats and provocations. Such reckless acts will surely be inviting our strong self-defense measures, causing catastrophic consequences after all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The 21st century should be a century of independence in which domination and high-handedness are eliminated and sovereignty of all states equally respected. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn order for the United Nations to fulfill its responsibilities and role in accordance with its charter, democracy should be practiced in the UN activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Without enhancing the authority of the General Assembly and without early restructuring of the Security Council, the United Nations will be unable to meet the demands of a rapidly changing situation and cope with new challenges. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The authority of the General Assembly where all member states are represented and interact democratically on an equal footing should be enhanced. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIf the General Assembly is empowered to deliberate on crucial issues such as ensuring international peace and security and finally examine important resolutions adopted by the Security Council concerning sanctions and the use of force, this will be conducive to ensuring fairness in the UN activities and preventing high-handedness and arbitrariness by individual countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Security Council should be reformed in such a way as to make all regions equally represented in its composition and ensure full transparency in its activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In this regard, we oppose, under any circumstances, the permanent membership of a defeated nation which has not liquidated its past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We are of the view that the proposal put forward by member countries of the Non-Aligned Movement to first increase no-permanent seats, which is relatively easy to be agreed upon at this stage, deserves sincere consideration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSince the security council is taking its actions on behalf of the general UN membership, its working methods, particularly the decision making processes, should be made more transparent for all member states. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will continue to maintain independence, peace and friendship as the fundamental ideal of its foreign policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We are convinced that attaching importance to independence, peace and friendship in international relations conforms with the purposes and principles of the United Nations and makes a contribution to peace and security on the Korean peninsula, Asia and the rest of the world. \r\n\r\n"

Oxygen plant was reconditioned from a high pressure system to a low pressure system to ensure a more smooth production of oxygen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Many factories and enterprises such as the Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Complex, the Amnokgang Tyre Plant and the Songjin Steel Complex advanced many technical innovation proposals instrumental in revitalizing production. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   \"The April 15 technical innovation shock brigades\" were organized in different industrial establishments across the country in January 1980 with their engineers, highly skilled workers and other workers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Thanks to their devoted services the material and technical foundations of different factories and enterprises are growing stronger and the nation's science and technology are making rapid progress. \r\n\r\n"

Which fully reflect the spiritual world of the Korean people sung by the Merited Chorus are highly praised by the soldiers and the people for their strong appeal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The chorus with over 50-year-long history wonderfully represented songs reflecting the different annals of the Korean revolution with a rich voice and peculiar ensemble. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The chorus powerfully encouraged the soldiers and the people to build a powerful nation by representing over 150 songs including \"We pledge ourselves\", \"Let us hold high the red flag\", \"We'll defend the headquarters of the revolution with our lives\" and \"Song of Comradeship\" in the recent five years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Particularly, the chorus which had raised the curtain of the first performance with the immortal revolutionary paean \"Song of General Kim Il Sung\" created the \"Song of General Kim Jong Il\" in 1997, demonstrating its tradition of worshipping and defending the leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The chorus also represented foreign songs. It wonderfully performed Chinese song \"Without the communist party there would be no new China\", the former Soviet song \"Just Fight\", Cuban song \"July 26 March\" and 30 other foreign songs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe chorus has made great achievements in its art creation activities--perfect harmony with orchestra, the creation of the Juche-oriented orchestra of front-line and national style in which accordion is used along with Ounkum and the completion of the accompaniment of a brass band playing army songs with rich artistic representation. For this it was awarded the title of \"Merited Chorus\" in 1992. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A few days ago, General Secretary Kim Jong Il appreciated the performance of the chorus once again and gave them thanks, saying it is a wonderful performance full of the indomitable revolutionary spirit of the Korean people. \r\n\r\n"
