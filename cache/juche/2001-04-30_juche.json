Korean national defence minister's diatribe against DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 30 (KCNA) -- Kim Tong Sin, minister of national defence of South Korea, at the National Assembly interpellation on April 25, asserted that there should be a clear conception of the principal enemy as \"North Korea is a force posing potential and direct threat.\"\r\n This is an extremely malignant anti-DPRK diatribe aimed to drive the inter-Korean relations to confrontation as it is contrary to the spirit of the north-south joint declaration which calls for settling the issue of national reunification by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the logic of \"principal enemy\" is concerned, there is no reason to talk about this now that the joint declaration is in the process of its implementation because the logic is nothing but a product of the old era when the successive south Korean military authorities including those in the period of military dictatorship incited confrontation with the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some forces in South Korea are persistently clinging to the concept of confrontation, going against the trend of the times and the desire of fellow countrymen. This goes to prove that they are anti-national forces who are displeased with the efforts for inter-Korean reconciliation and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This was proved by the \"reception, staging, onward movement and integration\" exercise staged by the South Korean military authorities together with the U.S. bellicose elements. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is nobody's secret that the recent military exercise was staged under the simulated conditions of a real war to mount a preemptive attack on the DPRK according to the \"operation plan 5027-98\", a scenario of the second Korean war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This logic of \"the principal enemy\" was touted again by the South Korean military quarters, timed to coincide with South Korean troops' participation in such dangerous military exercise. The DPRK can never remain a passive onlooker to this grave anti-national, anti-reunification remark intended to cool down the inter-Korean relations developing in favour of reconciliation, unity and reunification, quite contrary to the spirit of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. \r\n\r\n"

The Bush ruling quarters seek to contain such big countries as China and Russia and put the world under their unchallenged domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bush's true colours as a harasser of peace also found a vivid manifestation in the fact that he supported the reactionary forces contrary to the desire of those people to see the peaceful settlement of regional disputes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration's hawkish, aggressive and belligerent nature was strikingly manifested in its policy towards the DPRK in particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ulterior aim of the administration's hard-line policy towards the DPRK is to cool down the DPRK-U.S. relations, push them to the state of acute confrontation and stifle the DPRK by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its reactionary domestic and foreign policy resulted in harassing peace and security and increasing the danger of war in different parts of the world. Bush's arbitrary practice was a major factor of it. What is dangerous is the fact that his arbitrary practice is fully reflected in his administration's foreign policy and this seriously affects the international relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is due to the U.S. indeed that the world has hardly seen even a single tranquil and peaceful day over the last 100 days.    \r\n\r\n"

It was against this backdrop that there are dangerous developments in Japan= a Japanese university professor said that \"the history of comfort women was a history of toilet\" and scores of dietmen visited the Yasukuni Shrine in groups. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This goes to prove that Japan, far from drawing a lesson and repenting of its crime-woven history, is making reckless efforts to gratify at any cost the ambition to dominate Asia it failed to do in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of history textbooks can never be an internal issue of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With no desperate efforts can Japan twist or erase its shameful crime-woven history. it can never evade its legal and moral responsibility for its past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will never forget the misfortune and sufferings the Japanese imperialists imposed upon them, but certainly make Japan pay a very high price for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities should apologize for their distortion of history in textbooks, which is an insult to the Koreans and other Asian nations, and own responsibility for the ensuing consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We solemnly call upon the Asian people and world conscience to struggle in unity against Japan's undisguised moves to distort history and revive militarism.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
