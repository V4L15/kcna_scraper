They should stop a rash act, mindful of grave consequences of the military provocation.    \r\n\r\n"

This is evidenced by the fact that they brought more aggressor forces to the Korean peninsula under the pretext of their \"fight against terrorism\" and forced the South Korean authorities to sharply increase their share of \"expenses for the upkeep\" of the U.S. forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Plainly speaking, the \"joint land management plan\" published by the U.S. and the South Korean authorities is nothing but a hypocritical farce of \"return of bases\" as it is a dangerous plot to calm down the rising anti-U.S. sentiment of the Korean nation and accelerate the reorganization and deployment of the U.S. forces according to the new strategy to invade the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is clearly proved by the fact the most controversial bases in South Korea including the Ryongsan base and Maehyang-ri firing ground are excluded from the list of the bases to be returned by the U.S. imperialists and they are set to grab new land for increasing the capability to attack the north in return for giving back the useless land.    \r\n\r\n"

The essential nature of imperialism is aggression and plunder and remains unchanged.What is changeable is the crafty method of its practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists resort to the policy of strength according to the situation and objects, or the method of appeasement and deception or different methods, if necessary, toward the same object under the same situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are paying primary attention to creating fear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is their strategic object to stamp out the independent forces of the world and turn the world into a unipolar world under their thumb. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fear of imperialism gives rise to submission and surrender to the imperialists, which deprives a country and nation of independence and leads to death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The East European countries, which were building socialism, collapsed because of their surrender, seized with fear of imperialism. The Iraqi situation proves that the fear of imperialism leads to death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to remove fear of imperialism it is necessary to have resolute anti-imperialist spirit, see its vulnerability and build up military strength and for all the anti-imperialist independent forces of the world to unite firmly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whatever fear the imperialists may create they can never break strength of progressive humankind who unite to struggle with a firm faith in the cause of independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists are most afraid of the unity of the independent forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If all the anti-imperialist independent forces of the world are firmly united to wage a vigorous struggle against the imperialists, they can wring the windpipe of the imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean People's Army and people will firmly struggle against the imperialists' policy of fear and victoriously advance the revolutionary cause of Juche and contribute to the cause of global independence.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
