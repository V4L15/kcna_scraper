Korea\r\nPyongyang, November 2 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland published information bulletin no.748 on Saturday criticising the Kim Young Sam fascist clique's intensified repression of Juche idea followers.\r\n   On October 28 the Kim Young Sam group arrested ten odd hardcore members of the independence ranks of the Chonan branch school of Dankook University including its chairman Yu Jong Song on charges of studying the Juche idea. The arrest is a premeditated act of repression intended to check the movement of patriotic students and people for independence, democracy and reunification, the bulletin says, and goes on:\r\n   Their study and dissemination of the Juche idea are natural in view of the tendency of the times or young students' feature which is characterised by sensibility to new things and strong enterprising spirit.\r\n   This notwithstanding, the Kim Young Sam traitorous clique are frantically cracking down upon those students, claiming that their activities have been conducted under the north's \"line of revolutionizing the south\".\r\n   The repression is nothing but paroxysm of those frightened at the influence and invincible vitality of the Juche idea.\r\n   As it is impossible to block the sunbeam with the palm of a hand, any repressive move can never block the strong rays of the Juche idea from penetrating into the hearts of students and people in south Korea nor break their faith and will to achieve independence, democracy and reunification under its great banner.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Hanchongryon's cause is righteous\r\n  Pyongyang, November 2 (KCNA) -- Less than 30 percent of students took part in a recent vote organised by Yonsei and Choong-Ang University student councils on whether to withdraw from the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils (Hanchongryon). As a result, the withdrawal from Hanchongryon proved abortive.\r\n   Rodong Sinmun today brands this as reflecting the will of the south Korean students to defend Hanchongryon and attain its objective.\r\n   The news analyst says:\r\n   A campaign of seceding from Hanchongryon is being conducted at some universities of south Korea, manipulated by the puppet agency for national security planning to stifle the pro-democracy patriotic forces including Hanchongryon. The campaign is far from reflecting the will of students who cherish justice and truth and fight for independence, democracy and reunification.\r\n   Kim Young Sam proclaimed an \"operation of obliterating Hanchongryon,\" saying it would be the most important task during his term of office. He cracked down on the August 15 pro-reunification event of students, branding it as \"pro-north, enemy-benefiting action.\" The crackdown was reminiscent of the Kwangju bloodbath.\r\n   With no appeasement, threat and bayoneting, however, the puppets can block the advance of Hanchongryon, which fights for the cause of justice.\r\n   Hanchongryon, which inherited the tradition of the patriotic steel-like Jondaehyop as the vanguard in the struggle for independence, democracy and reunification, will valiantly fight to meet the expectation of the nation as ever. \r\n   It is historical truth that justice wins and injustice fails.\r\n   No force on earth can break the iron will of the south Korean students to rally their ranks and win in the final battle against the \"civilian\" fascist dictatorship.\r\n   However harsh the dictators' suppression may be, Hanchongryon will maintain its existence, grow in strength and unreservedly demonstrate its honor as a group of fine sons and daughters of the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
