Accordingly, it is a great sutra for national reunification which all the Buddhists should take as their guideline and apply in their activities.\r\n   Pak Thae Ho called upon all the Buddhists in the north, the south and overseas to hold Buddhist masses for the great unity of the nation and the reunification of the country.\r\n   He also called upon them to resolutely fight to frustrate the vicious moves of the \"civilian\"-veiled Kim Young Sam fascist group to plunge the fellow countrymen into confrontation and holocaust of war, and achieve the reunification of the country, the cherished desire of the nation, at an early date.\r\n   He declared that all the Buddhists in the northern half of Korea would perform their duty as members of the nation in the sacred cause of national reunification, cherishing deep in their mind their great pride and honour of holding General Kim Jong Il in high esteem as the lodestar of national reunification.    \r\n\r\n"

Included in the offensive are military threat and blackmail, aggression, economic blockade, diplomatic isolation, ideological and cultural infiltration, moves for disorganization from within and assistance to reactionaries and buying off. Particularly, the strategy for \"peaceful transition\" has become a primary part of the imperialists' anti-socialist manoeuvres.\r\n   The imperialists have attached great importance to the fulfilment of the long-term strategy devoid of gun report for stifling socialism, and concentrated ideological offensive on the rising generation that has not undergone the ordeals of revolution. \r\n   If the countries that were building socialism in the past had approached the imperialists' strategy for \"peaceful transition\" with vigilance, educated the people, the rising generation in particular, in a revolutionary way and constantly strengthened the ideological position of socialism, the tragic development such as the collapse of socialism would not have occurred.\r\n   The collapse of socialism by the anti-socialist moves of the imperialists and by the betrayers and renegades who have become their henchmen leaves a serious lesson.\r\n   To decisively shatter the anti-socialist plots of the imperialists is an important matter vital to the destiny of socialism. If the plots are allowed, the cause of socialism will suffer a setback.     \r\n\r\n"
