He added that he brought it with him as last time he saw the manager liking it very much. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He told the manager that it would be quite possible to cultivate chilli if the works built a green house depending on waste heat and workers would be very delighted to see green chilli in winter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Deeply moved and feeling remorseful to hear that, this time the manager could not take green chilli as he liked.    \r\n\r\n"
