February 8, Juche 37 (1948) when the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung developed the Korean People's Revolutionary Army into the regular revolutionary armed forces will be marked as the founding anniversary of the KPA. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this regard, April 25, Juche 21 (1932) when he founded the first revolutionary armed forces will be marked as the founding anniversary of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2.

Korean Conservative Forces' Shuddering Hideous Crime against Dignity of DPRK\r\nPyongyang, January 23 (KCNA) -- A spokesman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Country of the DPRK issued the following statement Tuesday:\n\t\t\t\t\t A breakthrough was made in the improvement of the north-south ties and there is a warm wind for reconciliation thanks to the DPRK's sincere efforts, to be warmly welcomed by the whole Korean nation and the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the puppet conservative forces have gone beyond a tolerance limit in their ill intention to chill the atmosphere for the improved north-south ties and ruin the great event of the nation, shocking the public at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A hideous provocative act, openly perpetrated in downtown Seoul in broad daylight on Jan 22, clearly proved that the wild act of the group of traitors challenging the trend of the national history toward the improvement of the north-south ties and reunification has reached the extremes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Timed to coincide with the arrival of our field survey delegation for dispatch of an art troupe in Seoul that day, coteries of the \"Korean Patriotic Party\" flocked to the plaza of Seoul Railways Station where they held a press interview and viciously slandered the DPRK's participation in the Olympics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They went on the rampage, torching a portrait symbolizing the dignity of the DPRK supreme leadership and a DPRK flag, not content with talking hoarse that \"Phyongchang Olympics is about to change into Pyongyang Olympics for promoting the north's social system and making the north's nuclear weapons a fait accompli\" and \"dispatch of the north's cheering group and joint training at the Masikryong Ski Resort are an attempt to bring to naught the sweats and efforts exerted by inhabitants in Kangwon Province and Phyongchang\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a never-to-be-condoned hideous crime as it is an intolerable mockery of the sincerity and efforts being made by the DPRK for the improvement of the north-south relations and a deliberate political provocation to turn the Olympics into a theatre for escalating confrontation between the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Far from making a deep bow to the fellow countrymen for their sincere efforts for the successful Olympics, the conservative group resorted to all sorts of slandering and committed such shuddering acts in the eyes of the delegation of the DPRK. They are a despicable group of gangsters in human form.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative forces who had been pushed into the cesspool of history being severely punished by history for their acts of treachery under the armpit of Lee Myung Bak and Park Geun Hye, are now going on the rampage, making hideous provocations. This is a shame to the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is deplorable that due to a handful of betes noires, our efforts and the desire of all Koreans to make the Olympics a great auspicious event common to the nation are being mocked and dark clouds lay low over the prospect of the Olympics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet conservative forces are human rejects devoid of appearance as human beings, to say nothing of elementary etiquette and manners toward the fellow countrymen, and dregs of history that would do only harm to the nation if they are allowed to go at large.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural that the south Koreans from all walks of life raise their voices calling for throwing overboard those rubbish so that they would not give off stinking smell any more, being concerned that such acts omen new trouble in the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is the south Korean authorities' behavior of conniving at such serious politically-motivated provocation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As we truly hoped for the Olympics becoming a theater for promoting trust and reconciliation between the north and the south, we repeatedly advised and warned them so as to keep any acts that may incite mistrust and confrontation between the fellow countrymen and get on the nerves of the dialogue partner from being occurred.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even though they watched the reckless confrontation moves committed by the conservatives, the south Korean authorities have taken a non-committal stand, reading the faces of those conservatives who are no more than living corpses, while talking about \"freedom of expression\" and only asking them to \"restrain\". No wonder, the situation is turning out to be worse, far from being brought under control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is little short of egging the conservative group on to foster such acts so that they go on the rampage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The criminal acts committed by the conservative forces with no fear of divine punishment have now greatly enraged the people of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will never tolerate hideous acts of the conservative hooligans who insulted the sacred dignity and symbol of the DPRK, and the dishonest behavior of the south Korean authorities who connived at such acts, and we can not but take a serious consideration of our follow-up measures regarding the Winter Olympics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities have to apologize before the nation for the political provocation, severely punish those involved in the crime and take a prompt measure to prevent the recurrence of such acts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the north-south agreement and schedules for the DPRK's participation in the Olympics are cancelled due to the confrontational act of the conservative riff-raffs keen on spouting vituperation and committing provocative acts against the fellow countrymen, the blame will wholly rest with the conservative group and the south Korean authorities. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We value the north-south ties but have no intention to continue to show good faith and magnanimity even while seeing the confrontational fanatics dare challenge the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and its sacred symbol.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will closely follow the future attitude of the south Korean authorities concerning the recent hideous crime."

la Patria (CRPP) de la RPDC hizo publica el dia 23 la siguiente declaracion:\n\t\t\t\t\tGracias a nuestros esfuerzos sinceros, se abre el arremetedero de mejoramiento de las relaciones intercoreanas y se da la atmosfera de reconciliacion nacional, hecho que causa fuertes aplausos de toda la nacion y todo el mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn contraste, dejan consternados a los nacionales y extranjeros las acciones demenciales de los conservadores surcoreanos encaminadas a congelar el ambiente favorable a la mejora de relaciones entre ambas partes coreanas y llevar al fracaso los eventos nacionales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl tremendo caso de provocacion, ocurrido el dia 22 a plena luz del dia en la parte centrica de Seul, muestra a que grado llega el desafio de ellos a la corriente de la historia nacional hacia la mejora de relaciones Norte-Sur y la reunificacion de la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEse dia, coincidiendo con la llegada a Seul de la delegacion de recorrido en el terreno de la parte Norte para el envio del grupo de artistas, los tipejos del Partido Patriotico de Corea sostuvieron en la Plaza de la Estacion de Seul una conferencia de prensa censurando brutalmente la participacion de la RPDC en los Juegos Olimpicos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEllos chismearon en esa ocasion que \"la Olimpiada de Phyongchang se convierte en la de Pyongyang para hacer propaganda del regimen norcoreano y reconocer su posesion de arma nuclear\" y \"el envio del grupo de hinchas del Norte y los ejercicios conjuntos en el Campo de Esqui Masikryong parten del intento de hacer nulos el sudor y los esfuerzos de la poblacion de la provincia de Kangwon y de Phyongchang\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo si esto fuera poco, quemaron hasta la bandera de la RPDC y el retrato considerado como simbolo de la dignidad de nuestra Direccion Suprema.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste crimen resulta una burla intolerable a los esfuerzos sinceros de la RPDC por la mejora de vinculos Norte-Sur y una premeditada provocacion politica para convertir los juegos olimpicos en el escenario de enfrentamiento fratricida. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLejos de agradecer a la parte connacional que hace todo lo posible para la celebracion exitosa del festival deportivo, los gangsteres conservadores surcoreanos dijeron blasfemias de toda indole y cometieron dicho crimen inimaginable y escalofriante en la cara de nuestra delegacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs una verguenza nacional que los remanentes conservadores, condenados por la historia por sus crimenes traidores cometidos bajo el amparo de Lee Myung Bak y Park Geun-hye, anduvieran otra vez con la frente alta volviendo a escenificar tremendos actos provocativos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs muy lamentable que debido a un punado de esos desperdicios biologicos, sean burlados los esfuerzos de la RPDC y el anhelo de toda la nacion de celebrar los juegos olimpicos como una fiesta comun de la nacion y se entenebrezcan las perspectivas de esta cita deportiva. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos conservadores surcoreanos son basuras de la historia que no observan la elemental cortesia ni la moralidad sobre la parte connacional y

que las locuras de estas anuncian nuevo contratiempo de las relaciones N-S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo mas grave del caso es la actitud de las autoridades surcoreanas que dejaron a los conservadores cometer publicamente su grave provocacion politica. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon el deseo de que los Juegos Olimpicos se hagan el escenario para promover la confianza y reconciliacion entre ambas partes coreanas, dimos a las autoridades surcoreanas consejos y advertencias suficientes para que ellas hagan lo que les toca en prevenir todas formas de actos que azucen la desconfianza y confrontacion entre los compatriotas e irriten a la contraparte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAunque conocen bien la oleada de enfrentamiento levantada por los elementos conservadores, las autoridades surcoreanas se portan acorde al estado de humor de esos cadaveres vivos hablando de la \"libertad de expresion\" y limitandose a \"pedirles que se controlen\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs imposible que esa actitud tibia corrija la situacion que se torna cada vez mas fea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTal comportamiento de las autoridades surcoreanas da lo mismo que el acto criminal de alentar la locura de las fuerzas conservadores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos crimenes de esas ultimas montan en colera al pueblo de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo perdonaremos nunca el acto grosero e infame de esos gangsteres, que insultaron la sagrada dignidad y simbolo de la RPDC, y la conducta injusta de las autoridades surcoreanas que lo toleraron.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY nos vemos obligados a considerar en serio las posteriores medidas de accion relativas con los Juegos Olimpicos Invernales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas deberan pedir disculpas a toda la nacion coreana por el presente caso de provocacion politica y tomar las medidas consecuentes para prevenir la repeticion tras castigar duro a los involucrados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi se cancelan los acuerdos intercoreanos y las agendas para la participacion del Norte en los Juegos Olimpicos debido a la chusma conservadora que se dedica a injuriar y provocar a la parte connacional, toda la responsabilidad recaera sobre ella y las autoridades surcoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tApreciamos las relaciones de ambas partes coreanas, pero no queremos seguir dando muestras de buena fe e indulgencia hasta cuando veamos la groseria de los maniacos de enfrentamiento que con sus tremendos actos provocadores, desafiaron a los sagrados simbolos de la dignidad de nuestra  Direccion Suprema y nuestro Estado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tObservamos agudamente la posterior postura de las autoridades surcoreanas sobre el presente caso."
