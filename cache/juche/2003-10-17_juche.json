There are plots to justify the armed crackdown upon Chongryon by defining it as a target of suppression by the \"anti-subversive activities law\" and to destabilize and split Chongryon from within and completely destroy it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The gravity of these moves is that they are going on at the tacit connivance and instigation of the Japanese government authorities and they are directly involved in them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The internal situation in Japan today is reminiscent of that during the great Kanto quake and on the eve of the Korean war in 1950 when Koreans in Japan were brutally suppressed. This is an intolerable insult and grave challenge to the DPRK as it was deliberately created by the Japanese authorities under a prearranged plan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently they pushed the situation to a dangerous phase under the pretext of the \"nuclear issue,\" etc. This is, in essence, a serious anti-DPRK hostile act committed as part of the sanctions and blockade they are imposing against it, pursuant to the U.S. strategy to pressurize Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through this they seek to meet their sinister and selfish aim to step up their moves to turn Japan's domestic politics to the Right and militarize it under the pretext of the \"nuclear issue\" in a bid to save it from depression and achieve the stability of their ruling system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK are blazing with a towering grudge against Japan because of its past history of aggression. They will certainly force the Japanese reactionaries to pay for their moves to suppress and destroy Chongryon, an inviolable organization of overseas citizens of the DPRK.    \r\n.    \r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary terms such assertion a base attempt to shift the blame on to the DPRK.\r\n Recalling that at the six-way talks the DPRK put forward a comprehensive and reasonable proposal for the settlement of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. but the U.S. brought the talks to a rupture while demanding the DPRK \"scrap its nuclear weapons program first\", the commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since the six-way talks the U.S. bellicose forces have been hell-bent on a clumsy and despicable smear campaign to tarnish the image of the DPRK, groundlessly charging the DPRK with \"human traffic\", \"drug smuggling\", \"issues of human rights and terrorism\", etc. in order to isolate and stifle it. They set the International Atomic Energy Agency in motion to escalate their anti-DPRK campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is more serious is that they have frantically increased their military threat to the DPRK. The U.S. does not have any political willingness to drop its hostile policy toward the DPRK but is keen to stifle the DPRK by gaining time at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nUnder this situation the DPRK made a switchover in the use of plutonium produced in the course of reprocessing at least 8,000 spent fuel rods in the direction of increasing its nuclear deterrent force while putting the operation of nuclear facilities on a normal footing to cope with the situation created owing to the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The step taken by the DPRK to cope with such unreasonable hostile policy of the U.S. is a measure for just self-defence from A to Z. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK does not feel regretful at all for having made a switchover in the use of plutonium for a self-defensive purpose but will promptly reprocess spent fuel rods to be churned out by the nuclear facilities in the future if necessary.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The Japanese government authorities are, therefore, under an obligation to protect them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The same is true for Chongryon. As an overseas citizens' organization of the DPRK it has conducted activities to protect national rights, dignity and sovereignty of the Koreans in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nMoreover, it has performed the mission and role as a diplomatic mission for friendship with the Japanese people in the absence of diplomatic relations between the DPRK and Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But Japan is persecuting Koreans in Japan after branding Chongryon as an \"overseas organization of a hostile state.\" This is a gross violation of international law and inhuman fascist terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ulterior aim sought by the Japanese reactionaries in their repressive campaign against Chongryon and Koreans in Japan is to realize their criminal intention to stifle the DPRK through the increased pressure upon it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Japanese government persists in its moves against the DPRK and Chongryon despite their repeated warning, it will be held fully accountable for all the ensuing consequences.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
