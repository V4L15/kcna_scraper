Then he walked up an observation post to see soldiers in training.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was greatly satisfied to see all the soldiers of the unit fully prepared to be one-match-for-a-hundred fighters capable of defeating any formidable enemy at a single blow and firmly protecting the security of the country and people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He set forth highly important tasks to be fulfilled to increase the combat capability of the unit in every way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said the valiant soldiers of the people's army single-heartedly rallied around the party are standing guard over the forefront where a grim class struggle is under way, demonstrating the heroic stamina of socialist Korea by weathering out the raging wind raised by imperialists with a violent revolutionary storm, adding that no force on earth can overpower these great forces firmly determined not to allow any aggressors to dare invade the inviolable territory of our country but wipe them out to the last one at the risk of their lives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He took warm care of the living of the soldiers with paternal love, looking round entertainment and logistic facilities of the unit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He met with commanding officers of a company under the unit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that it is of weighty importance in increasing the combat capability of the whole army to strengthen the company, a main combat unit and a cell of the people's army, he set forth specific tasks to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Much pleased to learn that the unit has built all the logistic facilities needed for the living of the soldiers and created good dietary conditions by meticulously organizing the supply service, he highly praised its successes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He spared time to see an art performance given by soldiers of  the company under the unit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He gave them a pair of binoculars, a machine- gun and an automatic rifle as gifts and had a photograph taken with them. \r\n\r\n"

Kumgang tourism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is an anti-reunification, sycophantic and treacherous act intended to seize power and seek personal comfort, indifferent to the destiny of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His true colors as a national separatist were laid bare through the political background against which his U.S. trip took place and its aims. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. hardline conservatives who seem to be upbeat with the \"war against terrorism\" as a momentum are increasing pressure on the sovereign states advocating independence. Ri flew into Washington to meet his masters with Bush's visit to South Korea at hand. He begged them to keep the U.S. forces in South Korea permanently, clamoring about the \"verification\" of the north and \"reduction of its conventional armed forces\". This fully revealed his unlimited greed for power as a colonial puppet.   He is keen to seize power in the next presidential election with the backing of the U.S. hardline conservatives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He is a top-class traitor who allows himself to serve as a running dog for foreign forces in a bid to satisfy his greed for power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If such a guy, who seeks permanent division and confrontation, not reconciliation and unity between the north and the south, comes to power, it will spark only a fratricidal war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is more intolerable is that Ri, inhuman political prostitute bereft of any elementary ability to judge the interests and aspiration of the nation and the trend of the times, was doggedly opposed to the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint declaration is a landmark of reunification which the north and the south confirmed before the world and history. Opposing it is little short of totally denying the existence of the nation itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will not sit with him unless he makes an apology for his crimes.    \r\n\r\n"

This can never be overlooked nor allowed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His remarks clearly show that the U.S.-proposed \"resumption of dialogue\" with the DPRK is intended not for the improvement of the bilateral relations but for the realization of the U.S. aggressive military strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the steadfast stand and transparent will to counter force with force and confrontation with confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should not misjudge the inexhaustible military strength of the DPRK. It has fully equipped itself with powerful offensive and defensive means, tightening its belt over the past years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is fully capable of fighting a war with the U.S. it should clearly know that the option to \"strike\" is not its monopoly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. ignites a war of aggression at last, the army and people of the DPRK will mercilessly wipe out the aggressors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We are sharply watching the ill-boding moves of the U.S., in full readiness.    \r\n\r\n"

It is aimed at pushing forward its program to beef up its nuclear armed force under the pretext of stopping the \"nuclear program\" in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States should eliminate weapons of mass destruction and drop its bad habit of pointing an accusing finger at others instead of feeling guilty.    \r\n\r\n"
