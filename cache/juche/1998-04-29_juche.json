            "content": "G.S. Kim Jong Il publishes work on reunification\r\nPyongyang, April 29 (KCNA) - General Secretary Kim Jong Il on April 18 sent a letter \"Let Us Reunify the Country Independently and Peacefully Through the Great Unity of the Entire Nation\" to a national symposium marking the 50th anniversary of the historic joint conference of representatives of political parties and public organizations in the north and south of Korea.\r\n   Following is the full text of the letter:\r\n   We have recently commemorated the 5th anniversary of the publication of the Ten-Point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the Reunification of the Country and soon will greet the 50th anniversary of the historic joint conference of representatives of the political parties and social organizations of North and South Korea.\r\n   The North-South Joint Conference, which was held at the personal proposal of the great leader comrade Kim Il Sung and under his guidance in Pyongyang in April Juche 37 (1948), was a historic national conference for saving the destiny of the country and nation, by realizing the great unity of the entire nation under the banner of reunification and patriotism. At a  time when there was the danger of the division of the nation being finalized because of the machinations of the U.S. imperialists and their stooges for a \"separate election and separate government\" in South Korea, the great comrade Kim Il Sung convened the North-South Joint Conference, united different political parties and groups and the patriotic force of different sections of the population in the north and the south and made an imperishable achievement in the noble cause of realizing the sovereignty, independence and reunification of the country.\r\n   In the extremely complex political situation in the years immediately after liberation, the representatives of nearly all the political parties and social organizations and even diehard anti-communist nationalists in South Korea with the exception of a handful of traitors to the nation participated in the broad national conference, reached a unanimous agreement and launched a nationwide patriotic  struggle. This was a brilliant fruition of the great  leader's line of independent national reunification and his idea of great national unity as well as the first historic victory of the patriotic force for reunification. The April North-South Joint Conference clearly showed that the communists, nationalists and various other political forces and different sections of the population would be fully able to unite in the struggle for the common cause of the nation regardless of the difference in ideology, ideals, political views and religious beliefs, and that the independent and peaceful reunification of the country could be realized through north-south harmony and the unity of the entire nation. The north-south joint conference held thanks to the great leader's painstaking efforts and under his guidance will shine for ever down through history as a patriotic conference that demonstrated the great unity of our nation, and now on the occasion of its 50th anniversary the experience and achievement of the conference inspire all the Koreans in the north, south and abroad with a new aspiration for national unity and reunification, enthusiasm, confidence and courage.\r\n   The great leader comrade Kim Il Sung clarified the question of the nation in a fresh light on the basis of the Juche idea in his early years, advanced the original idea of great national unity, brilliantly applied it throughout the historical course of the struggle for national liberation, for the building of a new country and for the reunification of the country, and set a noble example of great national unity.   \r\n   The great leader's idea of great national unity is an idea that encourages all the classes and strata to unite solidly  to safeguard and realize national independence by placing the common desire and interests of the nation above everything else in spite of the difference in ideology and ideals, political views and religious beliefs, property status and social positions.\r\n   The Juche idea scientifically elucidated the law of the development of the nation and basis of national unity for the first time. The country and nation are the home of people  as well as the basic unit for shaping their destiny. \r\n   Since the people live and shape their destiny within the unit of the nation-state, the destiny of the members of the nation is inseparably linked with the destiny of the nation, and the basic question in shaping the nation's destiny boils down to safeguarding and realizing national independence. \r\n   Nobody can live separately from his country and nation, and no class and no section of the nation can shape its destiny properly unless the independence of the nation is ensured. A nation has its traits that have been shaped and consolidated historically as well as its common desire and interests that transcend the difference of classes and strata. The national traits and common interests  constitute the basis of national unity on which to bind different classes and strata of the nation in a broad spectrum. The great leader's idea of great national unity is a thorough idea of national independence, a noble idea of patriotism and an idea of the broadest national unity--an application of the Juche idea to the question of the nation.\r\n   The question of national unity is all the more urgent in view of the unique traits of our nation and characteristics of the historical development of our country. Our nation, as a homogeneous nation with time-honoured history and culture, is highly patriotic and strong in esprit de corps. One time in the past, however, our nation suffered the misfortune of losing its sovereignty because of the struggle for power among the corrupt and incompetent feudal rulers and their sycophant, traitorous acts, and in subsequent years, too, the nationalist movement and the early communist movement failed because of factional strife and sycophancy. The great leader's idea of great national unity is an outstanding idea that shows the absolutely correct way to preserve and highly display the excellency of our national traits, put an end to the shameful history of national suffering and achieve the sovereignty and independence of the country and national prosperity.\r\n   The Juche-orientated idea of great national unity elucidated by the respected comrade Kim Il Sung, who authored the great Juche idea and had noble love for the country and nation as well as broad calibre and magnanimity, provided our nation with a powerful ideological and spiritual weapon for achieving the great unity of the entire nation and for independently shaping the destiny of the country and nation. The Juche-orientated idea of great national unity is an original idea that raised the national question and the question of national unity in a fresh light and comprehensively and profoundly clarified them by reflecting the main trend of our times when all the oppressed nations and the peoples of all countries have achieved liberation and independence and are heading for independence. It is a great idea that has provided the world people with a correct guideline and the banner of struggle for the victory in the cause of anti-imperialist independence. The respected leader's elucidation of the Juche-orientated theory of nation and the idea of the great unity of the entire nation, which gave a new scientific clarification to the question of the nation and the question of national unity constitutes one of his great ideological and theoretical achievements and a pre-eminent contribution to global independence and to humanity's cause of independence.\r\n   The great leader comrade Kim Il Sung not only advanced the idea of great national unity based on the Juche idea, but also worked with great pains all his life for the unity of our nation. During the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle the great leader united all the patriotic forces from all walks of life under the banner of resistance to Japan and led the anti-Japanese national liberation struggle to victory. The association for the restoration of the fatherland organized in this period was the anti-Japanese national united front which embraced the broad patriotic forces -- communists, nationalists, workers, peasants, intellectuals, youths, students and even conscientious religious men and capitalists= this organization struck root deep in the vast area at home and abroad. In the course of the just struggle of all the anti-Japanese patriotic forces for national liberation under the guidance of the great leader, valuable experience was gained in achieving national unity and fine traditions were established in this work.\r\n   After liberation the great leader raised the slogan, \"The entire nation must unite, those with strength contributing Strength, those with knowledge devoting knowledge and those with money offering money to the building of a new country\" and encouraged the people from all strata of society who love the country and nation to come out as one for the building of a democratic, independent and sovereign state.\r\n   Owing to territorial and national division, achieving the great unity of the entire nation became the most serious and urgent question which is vital to the destiny of the country and nation. From the first days of national division the great leader wisely guided the struggle to achieve great national unity under the banner of national reunification and thus developed the national reunification movement into a nationwide movement. He opened the way to dialogues and negotiations between the north and south, which had been tightly closed to each other and advanced the three principles of national reunification--independence, peaceful reunification and a great national unity--laying a solid foundation for national unity and national reunification. He guided the different sections of our compatriots in the north, south and abroad along the patriotic road to national unity and national reunification.\r\n   \"Ten-Point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the Reunification of the Country\" published by the great leader in the last days of his life is the summary of his idea of great national unity and his practical experience in this work as well as an immortal document for great national unity. This programme elucidates the fundamental principles and the ideological basis to be maintained in achieving the great unity of the nation and the specific tasks and ways of implementing them.\r\n   The idea of great national unity, the Ten-Point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation advanced by the great leader, the valuable experience he gained in his work for national unity and the brilliant results of his distinguished services are the eternal wealth of our country and nation and the solid foundation for great national unity and national reunification. Achieving great national unity and reunifying the country in our generation by defending and faithfully inheriting the great idea of national unity, brilliant results, valuable experience and traditions left by the great leader is our unshakable determination and will.\r\n   True to the great leader's idea of great national unity and his Ten-Point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation, we must strive for the great unity of all the Koreans in the north, south and abroad and achieve the independent, peaceful reunification of the country by the united efforts of the nation.\r\n   Our nation is the motive force of national reunification and the cause of reunifying the country is the cause of connecting the severed blood ties between the north and the south and realizing national unity. Apart from reconciliation between north and south and great national unity, the independent, peaceful reunification of the country would be inconceivable. The great unity of the entire nation means national reunification.\r\n   Today, the great unity of our nation and national reunification have become a more urgent question than ever before. In view of the situation at home and abroad, the fundamental interests of our nation and the trend of the times, now is the time for us to save the destiny of the country and nation through the great unity of the entire nation and demonstrate the dignity and honour as one reunified country and one nation.\r\n   Putting an end to the tragedy of territorial division and national split that has lasted over half a century and achieving national unity and the country's reunification are the vital demand and the supreme task of the nation that must not be delayed any longer. The longer the division, the greater the misfortunes and sufferings of our nation and the greater the danger of the nation becoming heterogeneous. Further distrust and confrontation between the north and the south may invite national calamity. The foreign forces, which do not like Korea's reunification are now fanning the confrontation between the north and the south in an attempt to fish in troubled waters= the imperialists are intensifying their plot of dominating everywhere under the cloak of \"globalization.\" If our country remains in confrontation, divided into north and south, in such a complex and threatening situation as today, our nation will be unable to free itself from foreign domination and subjugation, playing into the hands of foreign forces, and may be reduced to colonial slavery. Nobody with the Korean soul can shut his eyes to national unity and national reunification. Trying to delay the solution of the reunification problem, averting his eyes from it, amounts to an attempt to finalize and perpetuate division.        Our nation must overcome all difficulties and obstacles in the way of national reunification, achieve the great unity of the nation as soon as possible, and reunify the country. We are sure to reunify the country.\r\n   It is not two different nations that stand in confrontation in the north and south of Korea, but one nation that is divided artificially by foreign forces in the same land. The Korean nation is a homogeneous nation that has inherited the same blood and lived in the same territory speaking the same language for thousands of years. All the Koreans in the north, south and abroad belong to the same nation with the blood and soul of the Korean nation and are linked inseparably with the same national interests and the common national psychology and sentiment. No force can ever split into two forever the single Korean nation that has been formed and developed through a long history, nor can it obliterate our nation and our national traits.\r\n   The present division of our nation into north and south is a temporary misfortune and tragedy in the context of 5,000 years of its history. The reunion of our nation that has been divided by foreign forces is an inevitable trend of our nation's history and the law of national development.\r\n   In the past, the Japanese imperialists resorted to every conceivable scheme to annihilate our nation, occupying our country and enforcing the most heinous colonial rule. \r\n   However, the Korean revolutionaries and patriots launched a bloody struggle to save the country and the nation, and at last wiped out Japanese imperialism and liberated their country. After the defeat of Japanese imperialism, the U.S. imperialists occupied South Korea, lording it over there, trampling upon our national sovereignty, and trying tenaciously to keep our nation divided forever. But the spirit of the nation still remains alive among the South Korean people. Broad sections of the people in South Korea and particularly the young people and students continue to fight bravely against the domination of foreign forces and the treachery of the South Korean rulers. This is the manifestation of the national indignation of South Korean brothers who resist tyranny and disgrace and of the unbreakable spirit of our nation.\r\n   The national trend towards reunification is mounting higher with each passing day.                   It would be impossible to break or check our nation's will and desire to reunify the country through the unity of the entire nation. We must redouble our efforts to achieve the great unity of the entire nation and the independent and peaceful reunification of the country, full of confidence and optimism.\r\n   Great national unity must be based thoroughly on the principle of national independence.\r\n   National independence is the lifeblood of a nation= safeguarding independence is a fundamental guarantee for a nation's existence and development. It is only when we adhere to the principle of national independence that we can defend the national rights and interests, shape the nation's destiny independently in keeping with the will and demand of our nation, and fully exercise our sovereignty on the international arena and develop the relations with foreign countries on the principles of complete equality and mutual benefit. National independence is the source of national dignity and honour, pride and self-confidence, as well as the indomitable will and spirit of the nation. If a nation loses its independence and fails to get rid of domination and subjugation by foreign forces, it will be unable to avoid national humiliation and insult and the fate of a ruined nation, with its rights and interests, its traits and dignity downtrodden.\r\n   The principle of national independence is the key to the national question and the very basis of the great unity of the entire nation. The nation fights in unity in order to oppose domination and subjugation by foreign forces and keep national independence. Our struggle for the great unity of the entire nation is precisely a struggle to achieve our national sovereignty across the whole country, a struggle to accomplish the cause of national reunification by our own national force, and ensure the independent development of the reunified country and the common prosperity of the nation. Both great national unity and national reunification are aimed at keeping the independence of the country and the nation.\r\n   The principle of national independence is a touchstone that distinguishes patriotism from treachery to the nation, the line of reunification from the line of division. \r\n   Claiming for independence and north-south reconciliation and unity while pursuing the policy of dependence on foreign forces is nothing but an empty talk. Just as patriotism is incompatible with treachery to the nation, so is national independence incompatible with dependence on foreign forces. \r\n   He who truly desires north-south reconciliation, national unity and national reunification must follow the road of national independence, not the road of dependence on foreign forces.\r\n   National unity is always aimed at defending and realizing national independence= it is inconceivable to talk about national unity apart from the principle of national independence. Only when we achieve the great unity of the entire nation on the basis of the principle of national independence, can our nation become a true master of its destiny, a strong driving force and a decisive force of national reunification and national prosperity. We must categorically oppose and reject sycophancy to great powers and dependence on foreign forces, and achieve great national unity on the basis of the principle of national independence.\r\n   The entire nation must unite under the banner of patriotism, the banner of national reunification.\r\n   Loving one's country and nation and cherishing one's national traits are the common psychology and sentiment of the members of the nation. Ours is a nation with strong national character, cherishing ardent love for the country and fellow people and treasuring and inheriting the national soul. Our nation's patriotic spirit and inherent traits form a strong ideological and spiritual basis of the great unity of the whole nation. Moreover, to our nation that has suffered all manner of misfortune and pains caused by national division, national reunification is the supreme national demand, and the banner of national reunification is the banner of common national struggle, the banner of great unity of the whole nation. The entire nation must achieve great unity for the great common cause of the nation, on the basis of the inherent traits of the Korean nation.\r\n   There are a variety of differences, including those in ideology and system between the north and south that have been kept  divided for over half a century. However, the national community as one nation is far greater than them. \r\n   The demands and interests of different classes and strata of the nation are different from one another= but the primary task facing our nation today is national reunification, and we must subordinate everything to the cause of national reunification. If we regard the difference in ideology and system between north and south as absolute, and put aside the national community and the common interests of the nation while bringing the interests of individual classes and strata to the fore, we can achieve neither great national unity nor national reunification.\r\n   All the Koreans in the north, south and abroad must unite closely under the banner of patriotism, the banner of national reunification, irrespective of their difference in ideology and system, political views and religion, transcending  the interests of classes and strata. All the members of the nation -- workers, farmers, intellectuals, youths and students, the urban petty-bourgeoisie, national capitalists, politicians,  businessmen, men of culture, religious men and soldiers -- must fight in unity for national reunification, and make an active contribution to the cause of national reunification.\r\n   It is our steadfast standpoint and consistent policy to embrace and unite all the people who cherish the soul of the nation and all the people who love the country and nation, irrespective of their ideology and system, class and stratum, for the great unity of the entire nation. Our all-embracing politics is the politics of noble love for humanity that embraces everybody with loving care. It is the most magnanimous and patriotic politics that unites all the classes and strata of the nation rock-solid for the common cause of the country and nation. We will invariably carry on the all-embracing politics on the road to national unity and the country's reunification, unite with anybody with national conscience and aspiration to the country's reunification and advance hand in hand in the same rank for the country's reunification. People who have taken a wrong path in the past can repent of their mistake and embark on the road of patriotism. On the principle of asking no question about the past, we will approach with generosity those who went the wrong way against the nation in the past, but now truly repent of their mistakes and try to contribute to the cause of national reunification, and will advance with them for national reunification. We will also unite with people from upper classes in power, figures from the government party and the opposition party, big capitalists and generals  in South Korea under the banner of great unity of the nation, if they value the common interests of the nation and want the reunification of the country.\r\n   Once we join hands with people, we will cooperate with them not only on the road to national reunification but also in the struggle for the prosperity of the reunified country and will highly evaluate, in the name of the nation, those who have made contribution to national reunification.\r\n   We must improve the relations between the north and the south in order to achieve the great unity of our nation.\r\n   To replace the relations of distrust and confrontation between north and south with those of trust and reconciliation is a pressing requirement for national unity and national reunification. The successive South Korean authorities have obstructed harmony between the north and the south with their anti-north confrontation policy that regards the fellow countrymen as an enemy and foments hostility and discord among the nation and hindered the great unity of the nation in every way. The South Korean authorities' anti-north confrontation policy is the root that gives rise to misunderstanding and distrust between the north and the south. It is the stumbling block to the improvement of the north-south relations and national unity. \r\n   If the South Korean authorities continue to pursue the hostile anti-north confrontation policy, it will be impossible to create the atmosphere of trust and reconciliation between the north and the south. It will only increase tension and bring about an irretrievable result.\r\n   When different ideologies and systems exist in the north and the south, denial of the other side's ideology and system will make it impossible to avoid confrontation.        The north and the south, on the basis of recognizing the existence of the different ideologies and systems, must achieve harmony, promote co-existence, co-prosperity and common interests and open the way to national reunification.\r\n   Whoever is hostile to his fellow countrymen and pursues the anti-north confrontation policy with the backing of foreign forces and in cooperating with them, will be cursed and condemned by the people and cannot escape from the trial of history.    The wretched ends of successive rulers of South Korea prove this. If the South Korean authorities do not want to follow in the footsteps of their predecessors, they should learn a lesson from their ends and make a resolute decision to break with the outmoded anti-north confrontation. If the South Korean authorities change their policy and convert the anti-north confrontation policy into reconciliation policy of   alliance with the north, the relations between the north and the south will develop into those of trust and reconciliation and a new phase be opened for national unity and national reunification. The South Korean authorities must change their anti-north confrontation policy into reconciliation policy of alliance with the north from a patriotic standpoint and take the road of national reconciliation and unity. In South Korea the fascist laws and machinery that obstruct the unity of the nation and the reunification of the country must be abolished and all sorts of political barriers removed.\r\n   Our position in relation to the South Korean authorities is clear. We were against the successive rulers of South Korea not because they were in power. We were opposed to their policy of dependence on foreign forces, their policy against reunification, and their treachery to the country and nation. If the South Korean authorities take the patriotic stand, the stand of unity in alliance with the north, we will work with them to shape the destiny of the nation.\r\n   For the great unity of our nation, we must reject domination and interference of the foreign forces and fight against the traitors to the nation, the anti-reunification forces, who are in collusion with the foreign forces.\r\n   Domination and interference of the foreign forces is the major obstacle to the unity of our nation and the reunification of the country. Our nation has been divided into north and south by the foreign forces, and the country and nation have not yet been reunified because of their domination and interference. Dividing and ruling other nations is a stereotyped method used by imperialists. In disregard of the demand of our nation for national reunification and running against the trend of the age of independence, the United States is pursuing as ever its ambition to keep our nation divided forever and rule it. \r\n   They are aggravating the situation by fomenting antagonism and discord among our nation, instigating the South Korean authorities to confrontation against their fellow countrymen, continuing to keep their troops in South Korea and ceaselessly stepping up war exercises and military buildup.\r\n   Under the instigation and manipulation of the foreign forces, the successive South Korean rulers have built the wall of division, intensified the political and military confrontation between the north and south, put down the South Korean people, who aspire after independence, democracy and national reunification, and resorted to every scheme to divide and disintegrate the patriotic, democratic force that fights for reunification.\r\n   Without fighting against the domination and interference of the foreign forces and the divisive force at home and abroad, it would be impossible to realize unity between north and south, the great unity of the nation and the reunification of the country.\r\n   Through a nationwide struggle against the domination and interference of the foreign forces, all the Koreans in the north, south and abroad must root up the cause of obstruction to national unity and reunification. They must also launch a resolute struggle against the anti-reunification policies and the schemes for national division pursued by the traitors to the nation, who collaborate with the foreign forces for their personal wealth and power with no regard for the destiny of the country and nation.\r\n   The patriotic, democratic force that fights for reunification must heighten their vigilance against the cunning machinations of the divisive elements aimed at wedge-driving and disintegration and counter them by the force of unity. All the political parties, organizations and the figures and people from various social strata who love the country and nation and aspire after reunification must regard the great cause of national unity and reunification as the supreme demand, strengthen their unity, continue to expand the patriotic ranks for reunification and organize them on a solid basis.\r\n   For the great unity of the nation all the Koreans in the north, south and abroad must visit one another, hold contacts, promote dialogue and strengthen solidarity.\r\n   Promoting wide-ranging visits, contacts, dialogues and solidarity among our compatriots is an important way to achieve the great unity of the nation. Even though there is difference in ideologies, ideals, political views and religious beliefs within our nation, the fellow countrymen can build up mutual understanding and trust and pool their will and efforts for the common objective of the nation if they all freely travel, hold contacts and dialogues and strengthen solidarity. Cherishing the noble ideals of great national unity and national reunification, all our compatriots in the north, south and abroad must strive to realize travel, contact, dialogue and organizational solidarity.\r\n   Dialogue between the north and south must serve national unity and reunification. No one must make use of the dialogue to pursue dishonest political objectives or to perpetuate the division of the country. The dialogue must be held on the principle of giving precedence to the common interests of the nation, eliminating distrust and confrontation between the north and south and subordinating everything to reunifying the country.\r\n   The dialogue must not be the monopoly of a few men in authority or of a particular class or section. It must be a wide-ranging, nationwide dialogue that can pool the opinions of all political parties, groups and social sections. The dialogue must be participated in by the representatives of all political parties and social organizations including the authorities, and the figures and people from various walks of life in the north and south and the overseas compatriots. And bilateral and multilateral dialogues and negotiations of various forms must be promoted.\r\n   The great unity of the entire nation will be realized and consolidated in the course of developing joint actions in solidarity in the struggle for national reunification.\r\n   All the political parties, organizations and fellow countrymen in the north, south and abroad must support and keep pace with one another, taking joint action in the effort for the reunification of the country.\r\n   The struggle of our nation for the independent and peaceful reunification of the country is now entering a new historical phase. The road to reunification is still beset with many obstacles and difficulties, but we are optimistic about its future.    Our nation is one, and so is our country. \r\nOur nation must achieve great unity under the banner of national reunification.\r\n   I am convinced that the whole nation in the north, south and abroad will realize the historical cause of national reunification through united effort in our generation, true to the great leader comrade Kim Il Sung's instructions for national reunification.     \r\n  \r\n"

            "content": "Reinforcement of U.S. 8th Army\r\n Pyongyang, April 29 (KCNA) -- The United States is rendering the situation of the Korean peninsula all the more strained.\r\n   The South Korean newspaper Kyunghyang Daily news said the United States redeployed some 300 officers and soldiers in South Korea-based 8th army, which was reorganized into a field army system some time ago, and will reinforce it with another 200 by the end of the year.\r\n   Most of the redeployed officers and soldiers were sent to operation fields. The operation capacity of the 8th Army is being intensively examined through the use of them in the Rsoi training for deployment of troops from the U.S. mainland in \"emergency\" on the Korean peninsula, which was started on April 23. A U.S. military official concerned said the redeployed forces will really play the role of commanding those to be dispatched from the U.S. mainland in \"emergency.\"\r\n   It is for a Korean War that the United States reorganized the 8th Army and the U.S. mainland-based 3rd Army into a field army system and is substantially reinforcing the 8th Army. The fact indicates that the danger of another war has become all the more grave on the Korean peninsula due to the U.S. military reinforcement.\r\n   The U.S. military occupation of South Korea is a legacy from the Cold War. It has been the main cause of war and discord  on the Korean peninsula for more than half a century. It still remains a cancer-like thing threatening peace and stability of Korea and the rest of Asia.\r\n   With the Cold War terminated, the Korean people, who desire national reunification and peace, hope for an immediate withdrawal of the U.S. forces from South Korea.   \r\n   This is why the DPRK has raised the U.S. troop pullout as an indispensable demand at the \"four-way talks\" aimed at ensuring peace on the Korean peninsula.\r\n   But the United States, ignoring the demand of the time and the will of the Korean people, has not renounced the policy of keeping its military presence in South Korea but strengthened it. The reinforcement of the 8th Army serves as a clear evidence of the U.S. anachronistic policy of war.\r\n   The Korean army and people will not remain a passive onlooker to the U.S. military reinforcement. If the enemy unleashes a war of aggression, they will deal a thousandfold blow at the aggressors and uproot the cause of war on this land.    \r\n        \r\n\r\n"
