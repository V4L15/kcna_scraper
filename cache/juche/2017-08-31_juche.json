            "content": "FM Spokesman Rejects \"Presidential Statement\" of UNSC\r\n Pyongyang, August 31 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the DPRK gave the following answer to a question raised by KCNA on August 31 as regards the fact that the U.S. and its vassal forces rigged up a \"presidential statement\" of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) condemning the intermediate-range strategic ballistic rocket launching drill of the Strategic Force of the Korean People's Army (KPA):\n\t\t\t\t\t On August 30, the UNSC released a \"presidential statement\" distorting the truth as if the DPRK's launch of intermediate-range strategic ballistic rocket Hwasong-12 undermined regional peace and stability and caused grave security concerns around the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK categorically rejects the \"presidential statement\" of UNSC that flagrantly violated the right to self-defense of a sovereign state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We had already warned the U.S. that we would be closely monitoring its conduct. The intermediate-range strategic ballistic rocket launching drill carried out by the Strategic Force of the KPA this time is only a curtain raiser to the resolute countermeasures to be taken against the U.S. as it responded to our warning by waging belligerent Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military exercises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The said drill is the first step taken by the KPA in its Pacific operation and a meaningful prelude to restraining Guam, the front-line base for invasion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. had denied the DPRK's proactive measures to defuse the extreme tension and acted with imprudence. It is another lesson learned by the DPRK that only actions speak to the U.S., not polite words.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK shall conduct many more of ballistic rocket launching drill targeting the Pacific to further modernize and increase the actual combat efficiency of its strategic force."

            "content": "DPRK Central Court Sentences S. Korean Provokers to Death\r\n Pyongyang, August 31 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Central Court of the DPRK issued the following statement Thursday:\n\t\t\t\t\t The hostile forces, dumbfounded by the independent spirit and tremendous capabilities of Songun Korea demonstrating its might as a nuclear power of Juche and a world-level military power, are more persistently resorting to sordid smear campaign against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Taking the lead in the campaign are a group of conservatives in south Korea going helter-skelter, being unaware of their impending death.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Gentries of Dong-A Ilbo and Chosun Ilbo, newspapers speaking for the conservatives, committed a hideous crime of seriously insulting the dignity of the DPRK with the use of dishonest contents carried by \"North Korea Confidential\", a propaganda book authored by two British journalists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The book was written by Daniel and James, correspondents of the British news weekly Economist and the Reuters to south Korea, two years ago. As a collection of words uttered by the riff-raffs including defectors from the north, it viciously slandered the reality of the DPRK with such sophism that \"life of the north's citizens is capitalistic 100 percent\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The paid writers of the two newspapers of south Korea introduced the book as \"a guide interesting to those wishing to know about the north\", reeling off such sophism that \"the north is a country where money has greater influence than in capitalist countries\", \"youngsters without mobile phones are treated losers\", \"army is unpaid labor unit\" and that \"those with money can get married to those of high positions in society any time\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They had the temerity of carrying a photo in which the red star, symbolic of the brilliant revolutionary traditions of anti-Japanese war engraved on the upper part of the national emblem of the DPRK, was replaced by $ symbol and the name of the \"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\" was replaced by the \"Capitalist Republic of Korea\". They even committed such shuddering acts of replacing the title of the book called \"North Korea Confidential\" with \"Capitalist Republic of Korea\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Dong-A Ilbo, Chosun Ilbo and other conservative media in south Korea have so far committed smear campaign against the DPRK nonstop, adding to crimes already committed. Whenever there were such things, we seriously warned that that they will be made to pay a high price for their wild acts of escalating confrontation with the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, those conservative media, defying this warning, have persisted in smear campaign against the DPRK. Now they have reached the state of slandering and insulting even the inviolable name of our country and its national emblem.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not content with viciously slandering our socialist system, the most advantageous system centered on the popular masses which can not be found in any other parts of the world, they seriously insulted the name and emblem, symbols of the inviolable dignity of the DPRK. This is a never-to-be-pardoned high treason.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is needless to say that this is a hideous act manipulated by the group of wicked conservatives who are breathing their last after being reduced into a group of living corpses in the face of stern punishment by history and the people's mindset.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Article 60 of the DPRK Criminal Code stipulates that those who insulted the dignity of the DPRK from the anti-state purpose shall be sentenced even to maximum punishment including death, depending on the severity of the perpetration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Central Court of the DPRK declares that Dong-A Ilbo journalist Son Hyo Rim and Director General Kim Jae Ho and Chosun Ilbo journalist Yang Ji Ho and Director General Pang Sang Hun will be sentenced to capital punishment under the DPRK Criminal Code.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The criminals hold no right to appeal and the execution will be carried out any moment and at any place without going through any additional procedures as soon as the objects are confirmed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will track down to the end those who masterminded and manipulated hideous provocations of slandering and insulting the dignity of the DPRK and mete out death to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Taking this opportunity, we warn the south Korean authorities still conniving at the crime by hack writers of Dong-A Ilbo and Chosun Ilbo. If they do not start immediate investigation into those criminals who insulted the dignity of the DPRK and do not punish them, they will be branded as accomplices.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should be clearly understood that neither mercy nor leniency will be shown to those who slander the inviolable dignity of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will closely follow the attitude of the south Korean authorities."

Como una coleccion de las palabras insultantes pronunciadas por los fugitivos norcoreanos y otras gentuzas, el libro difama y tergiversa la realidad de la RPDC con las sofisterias de que \"la vida de los norcoreanos es totalmente capitalista\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA base de ese libro, los escritores venales de \"Dong-A Ilbo\" y \"Chosun Ilbo\" pronunciaron unas retoricas absurdas como: \"el Norte (de Corea) es el pais donde el dinero tiene la gran influencia mas que en los paises capitalistas\", \"los jovenes sin celulares se tratan como vencidos\", \"el ejercito es la unidad de trabajo sin compensacion\" y \"la persona adinerada puede casarse cuando quiera con otra de buena posicion\", etc. Y como si fueran verdaderos sus chismes, lanzaron sin titubeo las palabras malignas y lo calificaron de una \"guia con que pueden leer facil e interesantemente los que quieren saber el Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara colmo, se atrevieron a insertar sin vacilacion alguna la foto falsificada del escudo nacional de la RPDC cambiando por el signo de $ (dolar) la estrella roja en su parte superior, que simboliza la brillante tradicion revolucionaria de la lucha antijaponesa, y el nombre nacional \"Republica Popular Democratica de Corea\" escrito en su parte inferior por \"Republica Capitalista de Corea\". Y sustituyeron el titulo del libro \"Realidad Confidencial del Norte de Corea\" con la \"Republica Capitalista de Corea\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHasta la fecha, Dong-A Ilbo, Chosun Ilbo y otros medios de prensa surcoreanos de caracter conservador vinieron abultando su expediente criminal perpetrando sin cesar la demagogia anti-RPDC. Cada vez que cometian tales crimenes, les hemos advertido seriamente que pagaran el precio carisimo por su imprudencia conflictiva. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Sin embargo, ellos se obstinaron en la campana mediatica anti-RPDC desoyendo nuestro consejo y no vacilan en deshonrar ahora hasta el sagrado nombre y el escudo de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInsatisfechos con denigrar el mas ventajoso regimen socialista al estilo coreano centrado en las masas populares inhallable de este orbe, insultaron hasta el escudo y el nombre, simbolo de la dignidad sagrada de la RPDC, lo que deviene el archicrimen antinacional jamas perdonable. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  No cabe duda de que esta farsa fue orquestada bajo la instigacion y el control de los compinches conservadores malignos en momentos agonicos tras caerse en cadaver vivo por el castigo serio de la historia y las opiniones publicas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El articulo 60 del codigo penal de la RPDC estipula que los tipejos que insultaron la dignidad de la RPDC se someten a la pena capital inclusive la muerte segun la severidad de su perpetracion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Tribunal Central de la RPDC dicta, segun el codigo penal de la Republica, la pena capital al periodista Son Hyo Rim y el presidente Kim Jae Ho, de Dong-A Ilbo, y el periodista Yang Ji Ho y el presidente Pang Sang Hun, de Chosun Ilbo, quienes ofendieron la dignidad de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos criminales no pueden apelar tal veredicto y esta pena se ejecutara inmediatamente y sin procesos adicionales en cualquier tiempo y cualquier lugar, de acuerdo con que se confirma el delincuente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, perseguiremos hasta el fin a los complices que inventaron y manipularon el acto provocativo inaudito que calumnia e insulta la dignidad de la RPDC y acabaremos con ellos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAprovechamos esta oportunidad para advertir a las autoridades surcoreanas que toleran todavia el crimen sin precedentes de los escritores venales de dos diarios surcoreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi las autoridades surcoreanas no averiguan ni castigan sin demora a los ofensores de la dignidad de la RPDC, reconoceremos a ellas tambien como complices del caso.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDeben saber claramente que no daran benevolencia ni tolerancia a los insultadores de la dignidad de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tObservaremos atentamente la conducta de las autoridades surcoreanas."
