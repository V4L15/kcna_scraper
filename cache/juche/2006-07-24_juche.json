Its standards vary according to its interests and the stance of the relevant countries towards it and their political systems. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is well illustrated by the double standards applied by the U.S. in handling human rights issues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is well known that the U.S. styling itself a \"human rights judge\" issues a \"human rights report\" every year to pull up other countries over their human rights performance and meddle in their internal affairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The double standards applied by the U.S. over human rights issues find a vivid manifestation in the fact that it is directing the spearhead of its \"human rights offensive\" to those countries standing in the way of establishing an order for its world domination such as anti-imperialist and independent ones and those countries of military strategic and economic importance. The U.S. is, however, keeping mum about the poor human rights records in its allies and those countries that toe its line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also applying the double standards as regards the nuclear issue. The Bush ruling quarters are going busy with the moves to modernize and bolster its nuclear arsenal, while paying lip- service to the \"reduction of nukes.\" The U.S. seeks to use nukes like conventional weapons any time after designating the DPRK and other countries as targets of its preemptive nuclear attacks. It is clearly evidenced by its stepped-up moves to make nukes smaller and less heavy. In the meantime, it is zealously patronizing and backing Japan, Israel and other allies in their moves to go nuclear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is applying the double standards as regards the \"anti-terrorism war\". This can be explained well by the fact that the U.S. is defending terrorist outfits and terrorists in some countries after classifying terrorists into \"good ones\" and \"bad ones.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said standards applied by the U.S. over international issues are nothing but an illegal political lever for turning the world into the one dominated by it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

S. P. Pathak, director of the Board of the Asian Regional Institute of the Juche Idea and chairman of the Indian Society for the Study of Works of Kim Jong Il, said this when interviewed by KCNA. He visited the DPRK as a member of the delegation of Indian scholars for the study of the Juche idea. \r\n The Juche idea is now being studied and disseminated among the world progressive people for its validity and vitality, he noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality of the DPRK which we saw for ourselves convinced us that there is nothing impossible for any country and it can make even greater triumphant progress once it push ahead with the revolution and construction in reliance on the inexhaustible strength of the popular masses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n President Kim Il Sung founded the immortal Juche idea and built the DPRK into a powerful socialist state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people have defended the sovereignty and dignity of the nation and achieved fresh successes in their efforts for socialist construction, pulling through difficulties and trials under the leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n I am of the view that they could valiantly overcome all sorts of ordeals and difficulties and achieve such shining successes as they have deeply grasped the truth of the Juche idea that man is the master of his own destiny and has the capacity to carve out it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S.-led imperialist allied forces are making desperate efforts to stifle the DPRK, but they are powerless in face of the Korean people united in one mind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Everything was reduced to ruins in the war forced by the U.S. imperialists upon the Korean people, but they have built the DPRK into a powerful state guided by the Juche idea by going single-mindedly united with ardent love of their country and future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is, indeed, a great country dynamically advancing under the uplifted banner of the Juche idea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is entirely due to the U.S. imperialists' vicious and persistent anti-reunification moves.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the strategic plan of the U.S. to seize the whole of Korea with south Korea as a springboard for aggression and establish its domination over the rest of Asia. The U.S. imperialists have, therefore, been keen on the vicious and persistent moves against the reunification of Korea, defying the unanimous will and desire of all Koreans for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists have worked hard to hamstring the efforts to develop the inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since the publication of the June 15 joint declaration, the north and the south have made not small efforts to replace the inter-Korean relations by those of reconciliation and confidence.  This helped the idea of \"By our nation itself\" prevail among the Koreans and gave further momentum to their movement for independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., much upset by this development, has worked to bring back the era of confrontation to the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was not pleased with the historic Pyongyang summit. It has, therefore, left no means untried to check the implementation of the joint declaration, going overboard about the mere utterance of the words about independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whenever the inter-Korean relations made favorable progress, the U.S. instigated the pro-U.S. bellicose forces of south Korea to launch joint military exercises, thus throwing a wet blanket over the process to warm up the ties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the U.S. patronage the ultra-right conservatives of the \"Grand National Party\" of south Korea are zealously conspiring with the U.S. imperialists in their anti-reunification moves, recklessly going against the June 15 era of reunification. The anti-reunification rackets kicked up by those remnants of the forces dating back to the era of confrontation after being ostracized by the forces in the June 15 era of reunification clearly indicate how persistent and vicious the U.S. has become in its bid to push the inter-Korean relations back to confrontation and war, counting on the pro-U.S. conservative forces.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This behavior on the part of these countries only emboldens the imperialists.  The reality requires the people aspiring after independence to reinforce their revolutionary faith. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people have neither wavered nor yielded to any adversity in the entire period of the revolution and construction but courageously advanced despite any difficulties and ordeals, firmly convinced of their sure victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are confident that socialism is sure to triumph if it is defended and they are bound to meet death if it is abandoned. These words fully reflect the firm faith and revolutionary will of the Korean people who are convinced of the justice and victory of their cause. As they are stronger in their revolutionary faith than any others, they are steadily advancing along the road of socialism without any slightest shrinkage and vacillation despite so desperate efforts of the enemies to bring them to their knees. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n As shown by the reality of the DPRK, neither threat and blackmail nor nuclear weapons of the imperialists can prove effective in face of its revolutionary confidence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n The people of the DPRK will decisively frustrate the vicious moves of the imperialists against it and socialism and carry on their dynamic struggle for the advance of the human cause of independence, invariably enshrining the firm faith in socialism, concludes the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
