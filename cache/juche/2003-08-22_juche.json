            "content": "Military Pressure Will Never Work on DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 21 (KCNA) -- The former director of the Central Intelligence Agency and other heavyweights of the U.S. hard-line forces let loose a string of bellicose remarks that the agreement to hold the six-way talks would change nothing and the U.S. and south Korea should be ready for the second Korean war including the military attack despite the projected talks.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary dismisses this as an open demonstration of strength toward the dialogue partner and a racket of military pressure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is the south Korean authorities' attitude of supporting the U.S. moves to provoke a war against the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Shortly ago, the minister of National Defence of south Korea called for increasing the national defence spending and the south Korean military is applying to the Ulji Focus Lens joint military exercises now underway in south Korea the offensive tactics worked out by Striker unit, an elite combat unit of the U.S. army equipped with ultra-modern precision weapons, to suit the geographical conditions of the Korean peninsula through its exercises to get familiar with south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has so far made every sincere effort for the negotiated peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The six-way talks soon to be opened for the solution to the DPRK-U.S. nuclear issue are the result of the DPRK's positive initiative and efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. pays such lip-service as \"it has no intention to invade the north\", talking about \"dialogue\" but, in actuality, poses threat to it and openly seeks to stifle it by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an aim sought by the U.S. before the six-way talks to wrest a sort of \"concession\" from the north by threatening and blackmailing it by force and realize its ambition to invade the north with ease. The U.S. should drop this wild dream. The U.S. and the south Korean authorities would be well advised to cool their heads overheated with war fever, do soul-searching and behave with discretion.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is, in essence, little short of an open disclosure of its intention not to actively participate in the process of settling the nuclear issue, placing no big hope in the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is an intolerable mockery of and challenge to the expectation of the international community which desires so ardently a positive settlement of the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a foolish dream to attain a sinister political aim at the talks by overawing someone with a war pressure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. stand in the policy toward the DPRK is a touchstone showing whether it has the will to solve the nuclear issue with the DPRK, or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It would be difficult to expect a success of the six-party talks, if the U.S. still dreamed of stifling the DPRK by military force, not giving up its hostile policy toward the latter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Does the U.S. want dialogue or war?

It continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n First of all, the Japanese reactionaries are pushing forward their plan to turn Japan into a military giant in real earnest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits attention in their moves to emerge a military giant is their moves to introduce large-size and long-range military equipment into the Self-Defence Forces (SDF). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is chiefly aimed to conduct full-scale military actions for aggression in vast regions outside the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The modernization of the SDF is part of the moves to become a military giant and launch overseas invasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through the modernization and sophistication of armed equipment the Japanese reactionaries seek to sharply increase their maneuverability and striking force and operation capacity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is important in their moves to emerge a military giant and launch overseas invasion is to put the military system on an IT basis and militarize space. Japan is going to launch two more spy satellites in coming September after putting two spy satellites into orbit in last March. Through this Japan seeks to turn outer space into a vast theatre for the realization of its plan for aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aggressive and dangerous nature of the Japanese militarist forces finds a vivid expression in their undisguised moves to build legal and institutional mechanism for their overseas military expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are working hard to revise the articles of the present constitution obstructive to the establishment of a war-time system and overseas military actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean peninsula is made the first target of their overseas invasion. Frequent war exercises staged by the SDF in the waters close to the East Sea of Korea are aimed at the reinvasion of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Japanese reactionaries keen on reinvasion launch aggression of Korea flying the blood-stained Japanese flag, the army and people of the DPRK will deal thousand-fold retaliatory blows at them and force the sworn enemy to pay for all the crimes committed against the Korean people.    \r\n\r\n"

Due to their moves \"Korea\" has been officially used in the international community so far, instead of \"Corea\", which is a big tragedy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historians and linguists in the north and the south solemnly declare that they would thoroughly probe the truth behind the Japanese imperialists' crime related to their change of the English spelling of the country's name which has long remained shrouded in the mists. It appealed to all the Koreans including the authorities in the north and the south to take the lead in firmly defending the dignity and the sovereignty of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Attending the seminar from the north side were Pak Kwan O, president of Kim Il Sung University, Ri Jong Hyok, president of the National Reunification Institute, Mun Yong Ho, director of the Linguistic Institute under the Academy of Social Sciences, and other officials concerned and researchers of the Academy of Social Sciences, teachers and students of the university and from the south side were Kang Man Gil, president of Sangji University, Kim Yong Hwan and Kim Song Ho, National Assemblymen and figures of academic and press circles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Officials in charge of cultural relations of different embassies here attended the seminar as observers.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n"

This is the basic principle and way for the settlement of the nuclear issue between them and, at the same time, the stand and attitude to be taken by the DPRK and the U.S. at the six-way talks as dialogue partners. Only then is it possible to smoothly discuss the issue at the talks and attain their basic aim.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary as regards the rumors spread in the U.S. to sour the atmosphere of the talks and cast a shadow on the prospect of settling the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The master key to the settlement of the nuclear issue between them is for the U.S. to make a fundamental switchover in its hostile policy toward the DPRK, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue between them is a product of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK. Accordingly, only when this policy is withdrawn, is it possible to resolve the acute nuclear issue between them and normalize the bilateral relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between the DPRK and the U.S. is the best way of settling the nuclear issue and putting an end to the hostile relations, belligerent relations between them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will consider that the U.S. has practically given up its hostile policy toward the DPRK only when a non-aggression treaty with legal binding force is concluded between the DPRK and the U.S. and diplomatic relations established between them and it has been made clear that the U.S. does not hinder the DPRK from conducting economic cooperation with other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whatever document the U.S. adopts and whatever assurances it gives without any legal binding force, the DPRK can neither believe in them nor accept them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An \"early inspection\" is impossible and unimaginable unless the U.S. drops its hostile policy toward the DPRK. The DPRK cannot dismantle its nuclear deterrent force unless the U.S. makes a bold decision to make a switchover in its hostile policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will confirm the U.S. willingness to make a switchover in its policy toward the DPRK at the upcoming six-way talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the talks it will clearly distinguish between the real and false intentions of the U.S. and take a corresponding step.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Minju Joson today in a signed commentary dismisses this as a burlesque of those who dream of the revival of militarism, obsessed with it.\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind this is the Japanese reactionaries' yearning for their crime-woven past history and their lingering desire to repeat it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' moves to repeat the above-said history have entered a very serious phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are contemplating dispatching a huge contingent of the \"Self-Defense Forces\" overseas under the pretext of \"anti-terrorism war\" and \"international peace-keeping operation.\" And they are working hard to replace the \"Peace Constitution,\" which they have so far maintained though ostensibly, by \"War Constitution.\" The recent farce was a premeditated one as it was orchestrated against this background. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThrough this the Japanese reactionaries seek to stoke the hysteria of militarism mounting in Japan and thus realize their ambition for overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' attempt to repeat the past, instead of coming out to redeem it is a blatant challenge and mockery of the world justice and conscience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are well advised to drop their foolish and anachronistic ambition for launching overseas expansion as it may bring disaster and misfortune to humankind again. If they persist in their moves to repeat the past history, instead of making sincere efforts to redeem it, that will only precipitate their self-destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
