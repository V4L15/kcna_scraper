In the course of this, they highly displayed the indomitable patriotic stamina and heroic spirit of the Korean youth.\r\n   After the country was liberated, the YCLK was strengthened into the democratic youth league, a mass youth organisation, on the basis of the valuable tradition of the youth movement created during the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle. In keeping with the development of the socialist construction, it was renamed the League of Socialist Working Youth of Korea and then the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League. \r\n\r\n"

The withdrawal is a just, self-defensive step over which nobody can slander the DPRK.\r\n   It is only too natural that the DPRK, which regards independence as its life and soul, withdrew from the \"international convention\", which has reduced to a tool serving the dishonest forces in putting political pressure on independent nations, far from its mission of ensuring human rights of all countries. The withdrawal enables the DPRK to ensure human rights more satisfactorily in the country, not bound by the international legal requirements and formalities concerning the activities under the \"convention\".\r\n   We have provided our people with genuine freedom and rights on a level far higher than the requirements of the \"international convention\". Doing so is the basic principles of activities maintained by our socialist system, which values man more than any other things.\r\n   In this point of view, the \"resolution\" reveals the persistent anti-socialist, anti-DPRK campaign by the western imperialists. But, foolish is their attempt to block the advance of the DPRK with such a \"resolution\". \r\n   Their campaign only vindicates the validity of socialism and harden our people's will to defend their socialism.\r\n   No matter how others may raise outcries over the withdrawal from the \"international convention\", we will continue going our own way, smashing the dishonest forces' anti-DPRK moves.\r\n   We warn that if the dishonest forces continue hurting our sovereignty by abusing other \"conventions\" under the pretext of human rights, we will also withdraw from them. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
