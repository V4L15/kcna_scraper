            "content": "KCNA on sheer sophism of U.S. and Japan \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 3 (KCNA) -- Nowadays, the CIA is raising a hue and cry over the \"missile threat\" from the DPRK, claiming that the whole territory of the U.S. is within the North Korean  missile range, while Japan Defence Agency is busy taking \"emergency measures\" to cope with \"North Korea's missile test fire.\"\r\n Such campaign was quite frequent in the U.S. and Japan in the past years. But, we can never overlook the present campaign that has been launched at a time when the DPRK-U.S. confrontation is getting extremely acute and a touch-and-go military situation is prevailing on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's production and deployment of missiles are a matter pertaining to its sovereignty in every respect and they are intended to increase its self-defensive military capability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTherefore, they can never be a threat to other countries in any case. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the U.S. and Japanese bellicose forces are making much fuss about \"missile threat\" from the DPRK. This is nothing but a cunning trick to tarnish the image of the peace-loving DPRK, invent a pretext for their preemptive attack on it and justify their establishment of Missile Defence System (MD). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. MD is, in essence, aimed to put the DPRK under its military control, contain big powers around the Korean Peninsula and, furthermore, achieve its purpose of turning the world into a U.S.-led unipolar world. So, the MD poses a serious threat not only to the Korean people but to the world people desirous of global peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is working hard to make the fictitious \"missile threat\" from the DPRK loom as a potential one in a bid to calm down the condemnation and protest of the unbiased world opinion against the MD and justify it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The clamor about \"missile threat\" can never be tolerated as it reveals the sinister intention of the U.S. and Japanese warhawks who do not want improved relations with the DPRK, still listing it as an enemy, but seek to destroy its system through their preemptive attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pursuant to its plan for preemptive attack on the DPRK, the United States is now concentrating huge armed forces, including an aircraft carrier, in and around the Korean Peninsula to stage  large-scale war exercises such as \"Foal Eagle,\" a replica of the \"Team Spirit\" joint military drill, and \"Rsoi\", driving the situation to the brink of a war. This evidently shows the main purpose of the U.S. aggressive policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. sometimes shows \"carrot\" called dialogue and negotiations but it is no more than a window-dressing to cover up its \"stick\" strategy, which is the core of its Korea policy. That is why it has persistently turned down the DPRK's fair and aboveboard proposal for concluding a non-aggression pact between the two countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Keeping pace with the U.S. moves, the Japanese bellicose forces are taking an active part in the MD. Such action is arousing the DPRK's vigilance as it is in violation of the basic spirit of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration which calls for the settlement of the unpleasant past between the two countries and the establishment of fruitful, political, economic and cultural relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the U.S. and Japanese warhawks are pushing ahead in full swing with the MD threatening the DPRK, we have no option but to further increase our self-defensive military capability.    \r\n\r\n"

That is why the DPRK is giving top priority to boosting the defence power though it compels it to cut down its investment in economic construction and the work for improving the standard of the people's living. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. smear campaign is always accompanied by its military moves for aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. cynical ploy to justify and accelerate the criminal MD under the pretext of the DPRK's \"missile threat\" can never cut ice with anyone.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
