The U.S. government is working diligently to extend that timeline. But the core risk that the policymakers needed to know was that north Korea's nuclear weapons program is continuing to expand, advance, become more powerful, more capable, more reliable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He, in a lecture in Washington D.C. on Jan. 23, uttered that the logical next step of north Korea would be to develop the capacity to deliver from multiple firings of ballistic missiles simultaneously. He added that it might put nuclear missile technology for auction to earn money and that various options would be presented to the president in case it is impossible to settle north Korea's issue in a diplomatic manner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is ill-boding that the U.S. is building up public opinion about the story of \"nuclear and missile threat\" from the DPRK at a time when high-ranking officials of the U.S. political circle and administration were openly making reckless remarks on the military options against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a revelation of the sinister intention of the Trump group to turn back the climate of reconciliation between the north and the south of Korea at any cost and focus international attention on the DPRK's \"denuclearization\" once again as it is an expression of the U.S. displeasure with the reality in which the situation is heading towards detente and peace on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world is sincerely pleased to see the climate of reconciliation and cooperation on the peninsula created by the proactive and magnanimous decision of the DPRK and hope that the coming Winter Olympics would become an occasion of peace and reconciliation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, on the contrary to this, the U.S. is making desperate efforts to chill the hard-won climate of detente on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It deliberately strains the situation while massively introducing nuclear carrier task forces such as Carl Vinson, Ronald Reagan and Stennis and nuclear war hardware including B-2 and B-52 in the vicinity of the Korean Peninsula, and it is mulling putting brake on the positive development of the situation while crying out for tightening sanctions against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Shortly ago, the U.S. called for enhancing the efficiency of the U.S.-led strategy of maximum pressure such as \"sea blockade\" at the so-called \"foreign ministers' meeting\" of the countries that were defeated in the Korean War held in Canada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Against such background, the U.S. CIA director tries hard to build up public opinion about the story of \"nuclear and missile threat\" from the DPRK every day.

And it officially informed the UK side that its act of unilaterally finding fault with the DPRK without any evidence was a scheme to tarnish the image of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whenever cyber attacks take place worldwide, the U.S. and other hostile forces mislead the public, linking the cases with the DPRK for no ground.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a matter of fact, the kingdom of cyber crimes is the U.S. and it is also the U.S. that regards the cyber attack as an important tool for its foreign policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The cyber space is means for preemptive attack which the U.S. attaches importance to for the realization of its strategy for hegemony, as well as nuclear stick and dollars.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has regarded the cyber space as the 5th domain for the global domination next to sky, land, sea, outer space from long ago and organized units specializing in cyber warfare in the 1990s.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its cyber attack target includes the whole world ranging from anti-U.S. independent countries such as the DPRK to potential rivals like Russia and China, competitor allies and even henchmen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the Sony Pictures Entertainment was hacked in 2014, the U.S. imposed harsher sanctions on the DPRK to stifle it, calling it a hacking criminal, but the truth behind the plot was disclosed through a joint investigation of world-famous information security enterprises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and its followers such as Britain had better mind their own businesses rather than provoking other countries over cyber attack."

Pues, resulta una evidente violacion de la soberania y grave provocacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs muy ridiculo EE.UU. que recurre todavia a la sancion anti-RPDC sin ver el hecho de que esta preparo a pesar de la inaudita campana de sancion y presion el poderoso disuasivo nuclear capaz de frustrar cualquier tipo de amenaza nuclear de las fuerzas agresoras imperialistas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAunque tardiamente, EE.UU. debe volverse en si liberandose del necio modo de pensar, cancelar la anacronica politica hostil a la RPDC y parar los actos provocativos que exacerban la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana."
