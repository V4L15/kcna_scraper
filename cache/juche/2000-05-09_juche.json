            "content": "Guarantee of legal status of Koreans in Japan called for \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- At the 9th round of the intergovernmental talks between the DPRK and Japan held in Pyongyang in April our side proposed the issue of improving the legal status of Koreans in Japan as one of the key points related to Japan's redress of its past. This assertion is the most just one reflecting the DPRK's principled and fair stand to develop good-neighborly relations with Japan on the basis of Japan's redress of its criminal past. Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Koreans in Japan should be legally protected as victims of the military occupation and rule of the Japanese imperialists and  their war of aggression in the light of the background against which they settled there and from a humanitarian point of view. However, they are neither guaranteed deserved democratic and national rights nor legally  protected nor given humanitarian treatment. They have suffered all sorts of mental and physical pain generation after generation, subjected to unbearable national discrimination, contempt and persecution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Without the solution of the issue of improving the legal status of the Koreans in Japan, Japan cannot say it has fully settled its past although it resolved other matters.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As far as the guarantee of the legal status of the Koreans in Japan is concerned, the Japanese government should apologize politically and morally for having inflicted unspeakable suffering and tremendous human and material losses upon the Korean residents in Japan through the pursuance of its policy of despising them before and after the liberation of Korea and make material compensation for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The Japanese government should drop its hostile policy toward the DPRK and the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan and all sorts of national contempt and discrimination against the Korean nationals in Japan, recognize their DPRK nationality and take  ethical, moral and legal steps for their preferential and cordial treatment, so that they may live a stable life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It should refrain from acts of politically persecuting the Korean residents in Japan for no reason and alienating and destabilizing the Korean community and abandon its national obliteration policy intended to naturalize them to Japanese.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan is well advised to stand to reason and properly judge the situation and fully redress its past wrongs including the problem of the status of the Koreans in Japan and thus put an end to the inglorious history of the DPRK-Japan relations and develop new good-neighborly relations with the DPRK. \r\n\r\n"

The surroundings of the Moranbong Theatre and youth open-air theatre are suffocated in apricot flowers while the Choesung pavilion embowered by fresh pink azaleas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Moran (peony) hill is traditionally the foremost beauty spot in Pyongyang. It was so named because it looks like a peony. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The flower-scape here, one of eight scenic wonders in Pyongyang, sets about in March. Towards the 25th, a bit too early for spring, sweet aroma comes wafting from such tiny flowers as Benzoin Obtusilobum and Lonicera Chrysantha. Soon afterwards almond peeps out, heralding the onset of full flower-scape. Golden-bells and azaleas come out in early April and apricot flowers have a field day in mid-April, carpeting the hill in dazzling colors. Blazing flowers of Chaenomeles Trichogyna Nakai step in time before the fall of apricot flowers, vying with peach blossoms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Close on the heels come flowers of broad-leaved clove with gasping fragrance, snow-white pear blossoms, and red and white plums. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The ground below big trees is covered by flowering sward of Lycoris Squamigera, day lily and Hosta Longipes Nakai that last till the close of August. With the onset of the cool, the Chongryu cliff is garbed in wild Chamonile and the hill is tinged scarlet and golden. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This flower scenery is all the more spectacular in harmony with surrounding historical relics, pavilions, cascades, birds and amusement facilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The hill harbors some 200,000 trees of over 180 species such as needle- and broad-leaf and fruit trees, 150,000 of them flowering trees, as well as scores of varieties of flowering shrubs and 70-odd kinds of flowering plants. \r\n\r\n"

He kindly asked his wife, hailing from Pyongyang, if it was hard for her to do farming. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nPersonally opening the cupboard in the kitchen and the wardrobe and quilt-box in the room, he meticulously looked after every aspect of life with parental love. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He had a souvenir photo taken with the couple. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At that time they felt as if they were meeting their real father. She took him by the hand and freely asked him in undertones to name her baby who will be born in July. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Responding to her simple request without reserve, he said that it would be good to call a boy Tae Hong or name a girl Hong Dan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is, indeed, a noble picture which can be seen in the relationship between father and daughter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Thus, the two significant names related to Taehongdan, a historical land, were given. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   After he was told that many women would give birth to children from April, he took a benevolent measure for the Pyongyang Maternity Hospital to organize a mobile medical service group and send it to Taehongdan to assist at childbirth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   That is why the discharged soldiers and their wives unanimously call him their father. \r\n\r\n"
