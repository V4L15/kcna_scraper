El 80% de su contenido se dirige a divulgar la cultura al estilo yanqui y censurar la ideologia y cultura de otros paises. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAlgunos miembros de la Union Europea, Japon y otros paises tambien divulgan en gran escala las publicaciones reaccionarias que calumnian la ideologia y regimen de otros paises y adormecen la sana conciencia ideologica de los seres humanos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. y Europa Occidental controlan tres cuartas partes de las infraestructuras de Internet y la mayoria del intercambio internacional de informacion y se entregan a reprimir las voces de progreso y justicia y embellecen el regimen social antipopular y de lesa humanidad de si mismos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCrean el disturbio social en otros paises instigando a las fuerzas antigubernamentales de respectivos paises y ejercen la presion calificando la protesta a sus maniobras de \"represion de DDHH\", y a la larga, cometen la intervencion militar so pretexto de la \"defensa de DDHH\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde 1961 hasta 1976, EE.UU. perpetro mas de 900 operaciones terroristas y de asesinato cauteloso contra los politicos celebres y funcionarios importantes de gobiernos extranjeros. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl complot de EE.UU. para derrocar los gobiernos de Estados soberanos continua todavia en Bolivia, Venezuela, Ecuador y otros paises independientes y antiimperialistas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo el rotulo de \"antiterrorismo\", EE.UU. y los paises occidentales infringen brutalmente los derechos internacionales aprobados a fin de prevenir y castigar las matanzas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el periodo de 2001 a 2011 fueron asesinados cada ano 14 mil o 110 mil personas inocentes en la \"guerra antiterrorista\" conducida por EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante 5 anos despues de la invasion armada de EE.UU. contra Iraq cometida en marzo de 2003, quedaron muertos mas de un millon 205 mil iraquies y desaparecidos un millon. Y la mitad de ellos fueron los ninos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun el informe de la ONU, publicado el 4 de febrero de 2012, solo en el ano 2011 resultaron muertos 3 mil 21 civiles afganos en la \"guerra antiterrorista\" de EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde 2004 hasta junio de 2012, en Pakistan, 484 habitantes pacifistas incluso 168 ninos perdieron la vida por los ataques de uniformados norteamericanos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas tropas norteamericanas atacaron, destruyeron y saquearon a sus caprichos las viviendas, hospitales, depositos de entidades de la cruz roja, los cables electricos de alta tension extendidos por las ciudades y otros objetos  prohibidos de ser atacados aun en el tiempo de guerra, en virtud de la ley internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la decada de los 50 del siglo pasado el imperio americano uso en la guerra coreana las armas quimicas y bacteriologicas dejando como saldo incontables civiles muertos, y en la decada de los 90, uso los proyectiles de uranio empobrecido en las guerras persica y balcanica. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la guerra iraqui asesino cruelmente a muchos habitantes inocentes con las armas quimicas que derriten hasta los huesos de seres humanos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa violacion de DDHH de EE.UU. y otros paises occidentales se comete mas cinicamente en sus carceles secretas instaladas en el extranjero. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun el reglamento de gestion de carceles secretas en ultramar, aprobado por la administracion norteamericana 6 dias despues del incidente del 11 de septiembre, la Agencia Central de Inteligencia (CIA) establecio y gestiono las carceles secretas en Polonia, Afganistan, Iraq, Tailandia y otras partes de nuestro planeta. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Congreso norteamericano, en su informe publicado el 9 de diciembre de 2014, anuncio que durante varios anos la CIA torturo bestialmente a los reos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t21 paises occidentales incluso Gran Bretana ofrecieron a la CIA las carceles secretas y bases de interrogacion y le brindaron la colaboracion en las torturas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun el periodico britanico Guardian de octubre de 2013, la Agencia de Seguridad Nacional de EE.UU. intercepto las comunicaciones telefonicas de 35 jefes de Estado en confabulacion con la Casa Blanca, el Departamento de Estado y el Departamento de Defensa. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 5 de diciembre de 2013, el periodico estadounidense The Washington Post reporto que EE.UU. recopilo diariamente 5 mil millones de informaciones de moradores de diferentes partes del mundo con el metodo de perseguir el sitio de telefono movil. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa interceptacion telefonica de EE.UU. no excluye a los paises occidentales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun trascendidos, EE.UU. intercepto mas de 360 millones de comunicaciones telefonicas de Alemania, 70 millones de Francia y 46 millones de Italia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa interceptacion telefonica de EE.UU. que se comete siglo tras siglo a escala mundial resulta intolerable crimen que viola los derechos humanos de sus propios habitantes y los demas pueblos del mundo."
