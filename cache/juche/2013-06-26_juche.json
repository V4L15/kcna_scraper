Korean Authorities' Moves to Internationalize Issue of KIZ under Fire\r\nPyongyang, June 26 (KCNA) -- The south Korean authorities are seeking to bring foreign businesses into the Kaesong Industrial Zone (KIZ) under the pretext of internationalizing its issue. Rodong Sinmun Wednesday observes in a bylined article in this regard: \n\t\t\t\t\tThis is a reckless action of those keen on dependence on outsiders, sycophancy and treachery to escalate the confrontation with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe article goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe issue of inter-Korean relations is a domestic matter in every aspect. It, therefore, can never be an issue to be internationalized.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSuch sinister attempt to internationalize the issue of the inter-Korean relations is little short of an act of making a mockery of the will of all Koreans to firmly preserve the common denominator of the Korean nation formed and developed for a long historical period and reunify the nation independently.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe will, wishes and interests of the Korean nation are the absolute standards which must be applied to the inter-Korean ties. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat the south Korean puppet regime is seeking in its efforts to internationalize the inter-Korean ties is nothing but an open declaration of its intention to escalate the confrontation with the DPRK. It is, at the same time, an unpardonable criminal act to stifle the fellow countrymen in collaboration with outsiders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSuch action is also a reckless one of violating the spirit of the June 15 joint declaration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn order to mend the bedeviled inter-Korean ties it is necessary for the south Korean puppet regime to stand for respecting the idea of \"By our nation itself!\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs long as the regime sticks to the viewpoint and stance of depending on foreign forces, it is quite impossible to save the inter-Korean relations from catastrophe, much less realizing dialogue and cooperation among fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf the regime persists in its moves to escalate the confrontation with compatriots, pursuant to its aim to internationalize the inter-Korean relations, it will be held wholly accountable for all the ensuing consequences."

            "content": "EE.UU. abusa de la etiqueta de ONU en guerra coreana\r\nPyongyang, 26 de junio (ACNC) -- El imperialismo norteamericano abuso del nombre de la ONU para movilizar en la pasada guerra coreana muchas fuerzas armadas de su pais y sus satelites y justificar esta incorporacion.\n\t\t\t\t\tHasta ahora habla como si esos mercenarios hubieran combatido por la \"libertad\" y la \"paz\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto no pasa de ser una farsa para encubrir sus crimenes y justificarlos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDespues de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, el imperio se convirtio en el cabecilla del mundo capitalista y esa posicion le facilito despachar fuerzas armadas de paises satelites al frente coreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAntes de inicio de la guerra, ya se elaborado en la seccion de seguridad politica del Departamento de Estado de EE.UU. el proyecto de resolucion para remitir a la ONU el tema del supuesto \"ataque del Norte de Corea\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor otra parte, preparo al que presentaria oficialmente a la ONU sus documentos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, el Departamento de Estado decidio conceder a la \"comision de la ONU para Corea\" el derecho adicional a vigilar el \"estatus de seguridad\" en el paralelo 38o de la Peninsula Coreana e \"informar todo el proceso del eventual peligro de conflicto armado\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi preparo todas las condiciones para imputar a la RPDC la responsabilidad de cualquier choque militar por conducto de la organizacion oficial de la ONU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU, que acepto la demanda de bandido de EE.UU., convoco una reunion a las 2 de la madrugada (hora de EE.UU.) del 25 de junio de 1950 y adopto una resolucion ilegal calificando la guerra coreana de \"invasion del Norte (de Corea)\" al Sur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA las 7:40 de la tarde del mismo dia, el entonces presidente estadounidense Truman ordeno a todos los cabecillas del Departamento de Estado y la capa militar la ayuda de municiones y la movilizacion de fuerzas navales y aereas mientras MacArthur dio la orden de despegue a las aviaciones de la quinta fuerza aerea acampada en Japon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando su agresion militar, se enfrento desde el principio con el fuerte contraataque del EPC, convoco por la fuerza otra reunion del Consejo de Seguridad a las 3 de la tarde del 27 de junio para adoptar la resolucion de brindar \"apoyo\" al Sur de Corea y \"permitir\" la injerencia militar de los Estados satelites.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon el objetivo de ampliar la invasion armada, el imperio organizo el 7 de julio las \"fuerzas de la ONU\" bajo el patrocinio de tropas norteamericanas e hizo aprobar la resolucion de movilizarlas en la guerra coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsa resolucion fue invalida desde el principio porque fue aprobada en ausencia de la ex URSS, miembro permanente de esa instancia de la ONU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, Truman instalo el 25 de julio la \"comandancia de las fuerzas de la ONU\" despues de designar el 8 de julio a MacArthur como comandante.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe esa manera, las tropas yanquis y las otras de 15 paises satelites participaron en la guerra coreana bajo el rotulo de \"fuerzas de la ONU\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay que ser disuelta inmediatamente la \"comandancia de las fuerzas de la ONU\", que fue organizada como aparato para la materializacion del intento agresivo de EE.UU. contra la RPDC y obstaculiza hasta ahora el fin del estado de guerra en la Peninsula Coreana."
