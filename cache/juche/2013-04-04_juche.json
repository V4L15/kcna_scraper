No one can say a war will break out in Korea or not and whether it will break out today or tomorrow.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The responsibility for this grave situation entirely rests with the U.S. Administration and military warmongers keen to encroach upon the DPRK's sovereignty and bring down its dignified social system with brigandish logic.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In view of this situation, the KPA General Staff in charge of all operations will take powerful practical military counteractions in succession as the KPA Supreme Command had already solemnly declared internally and externally.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We have already sent a strong message to the present puppet authorities and military of south Korea following in the footsteps of traitor Lee Myung Bak so that they may understand our position.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a matter of fact, puppet military gangsters such as Kim Kwan Jin are human rejects not worth becoming targets of the DPRK's revolutionary armed forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We formally inform the White House and Pentagon that the ever-escalating U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK and its reckless nuclear threat will be smashed by the strong will of all the united service personnel and people and cutting-edge smaller, lighter and diversified nuclear strike means of the DPRK and that the merciless operation of its revolutionary armed forces in this regard has been finally examined and ratified.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. had better ponder over the prevailing grave situation."

Korean Group for Vociferating about Kaesong Industrial Zone\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) gave an answer to a question put by KCNA Thursday in connection with the fact that the puppet group of south Korea is resorting to a provocative racket over the issue of the Kaesong Industrial Zone. He said:\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet group is now openly talking about \"regrettable thing\" and \"promotion of normalization\" over the measure taken by the DPRK's army of banning the entry into and exist out of the Kaesong Industrial Zone by the south Korean personnel. It is even making such invectives as the \"emergence of massive confinement\" and \"measure for rescuing hostages\", aggravating the situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Puppet Minister of Defense of south Korea Kim Kwan Jin, die-hard warmonger, and other military gangsters seek to ignite a war at any cost, talking about \"military operation for rescuing hostages\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Kwan Jin's outburst revealed the intention of the puppet regime to cripple the Kaesong Industrial Zone, product of the June 15 era.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group had a room chief of the puppet National Defense Institute make appearance on TV let loose coarse invectives slandering the social system and the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK despite its stern warning.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an unpardonable heinous provocation against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Kaesong Industrial Zone has been maintained despite the present north-south relations that are put in the state of a war. This was attributable to the DPRK's magnanimity by which it took into consideration south Korean small businesses and people who subsist on the Zone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet group, in denial of this stark fact, even plans \"military operation for rescuing hostages\", not content with insulting the dignity of the DPRK. This clearly proves that the group is trying to use the Kaesong Industrial Zone as a fuse for provoking a war of aggression against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than the group which holds south Korean personnel in the Zone as hostages for a war of aggression against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  With no rhetoric can the group evade the responsibility for having created such a grim situation as today.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group should know that there is limit to the magnanimity of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It had better control its mouth, mindful that the Zone is less than 40 km from Seoul.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has not yet come to its senses and is still asserting that the DPRK's measure of prohibition will not last long. But this is foolish ambition.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the puppet forces are abusing the Zone as leverage for escalating confrontation with fellow countrymen, the shutdown of the Zone has become imminent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean puppet group and conservative media keep vociferating about the Zone, we will take a resolute measure of withdrawing all our personnel from the Zone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group should clearly understand that the fate of the Kaesong Industrial Zone is on the verge of bankruptcy."

Y avisamos oficialmente a la Casa Blanca y al Pentagono que las despiadadas operaciones de las fuerzas armadas coreanas ya estan revisadas y firmadas finalmente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe reflexionar ante la grave situacion creada."

            "content": "Cierre de ZIK se va haciendo realidad, opina vocero de CRPP\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPyongyang, 4 de abril (ACNC) -- A la pregunta formulada el dia 4 por la ACNC en relacion con que la banda de los titeres surcoreanos lanza una campana provocativa en el tema de Zona Industrial de Kaesong (ZIK), el vocero del Comite por la Reunificacion Pacifica de la Patria (CRPP) respondio como sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\tEn cuanto a la medida del Ejercito Popular de Corea de bloquear el transito del personal surcoreano a la ZIK, la banda titere surcoreana expresa \"lastima\" y habla de \"urgir la normalizacion\". Ademas, empeora la situacion hablando de la supuesta \"ocurrencia del caso de retencion de gran dimension\" y la \"medida de rescate de rehenes\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ministro de Defensa Nacional, Kim Kwan Jin, elemento mas belicoso, y otros gangsteres militares del Sur de Corea hablan de la llamada \"operacion militar para rescatar a los rehenes\", exponiendo su intento de desatar la guerra a cualquier precio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe esta manera, el demostro la intencion de la banda surcoreana de romper la ZIK, criatura de la epoca del 15 de Junio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPese a la severa advertencia de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea, el jefe de seccion del Instituto de Defensa del Sur de Corea comparecio en la mesa redonda televisiva e insulto atrevidamente con improperios el regimen y la maxima dignidad de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tConsideramos este suceso como imperdonable y grave provocacion contra nuestro pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA pesar de que las relaciones entre ambas partes coreanas estan en las circunstancias de guerra, la ZIK se mantiene hasta ahora gracias a la magnanimidad de la RPDC que tomo en consideracion la situacion de las empobrecidas empresas y los habitantes del Sur de Corea que se ganan la vida en esa zona.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNegando esta realidad irrefutable, la banda traidora surcoreana mancha la dignidad de la RPDC y debate hasta la llamada \"operacion militar para rescatar a los rehenes\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto evidencia que ellos tratan de tomar la ZIK como punto de partida de la guerra de agresion al Norte de Corea. Son precisamente los traidores surcoreanos los que pretenden tomar por rehenes para la guerra anti-RPDC a los surcoreanos que se encuentran en la zona industrial de Kaesong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor muy elocuentes que fueran, ellos no pueden eludir la responsabilidad de la situacion actual.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDeben saber que nuestra generosidad tambien tiene su limite, y tener cuidado con su boca tomando en cuenta que Seul esta a menos de 40 km de la zona industrial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInconscientes todavia de la gravedad del caso, la banda traidora surcoreana piensa que nuestra medida de bloqueo no va a tardar mucho.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDado que los titeres malemplean como ahora la zona industrial como escenario de confrontacion fratricida, el cierre de ella se va haciendo realidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi ellos y los medios de prensa del Sur de Corea siguen dedicandose a la chismografia, la RPDC tomara rotunda medida de retirar de la zona industrial de Kaesong a todos sus trabajadores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda surcoreana debe darse cuenta de que la zona industrial de Kaesong esta a punto de bancarrota."
