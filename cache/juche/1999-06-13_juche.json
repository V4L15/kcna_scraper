The only way for Korea's reunification is to found the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo as clarified by President Kim Il Sung, he stressed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The speaker expressed the resolve to continue their vigorous activities for supporting the Korean people in their struggle to drive the U.S. forces out of South Korea, reunify the country independently without outside intervention, overcome the economic difficulties caused by the imperialists' blockade and repeated natural disasters and defend socialism. \r\n\r\n"

Korean authorities' move to sell off IO Islet \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 13 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the National Democratic Front of South Korea issued a statement on June 9 denouncing the present South Korean \"government\" for its attempt to sell off to outside forces Io Islet, an inviolable territory of Korea, said Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The statement said:   The islet is a territory  proper to Korea which  has been governed by the Korean nation through generations. It is an islet of treasure which cannot be neglected in view of the geographical position and fishery resources.\r\nThe present \"government\" is scheming to sell off to Japan, its master, Io Islet in the South Sea of Korea, following the signing  of a treacherous South Korea-Japan \"fisheries agreement\" on transferring the dominion over Tok Islet in the East Sea of Korea, an  inalienable part of the Korean territory, to Japan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This glaringly reveals again that the present rulers are a group of the most despicable sycophantic traitors to the nation who put the successive flunkeyist traitors, including the \"five traitors of 1905\" who sold off the country to the Japanese into the shade.  Their move to sell off Io Islet  after Tok Islet, yielding to the pressure and coercion of outside forces, heedless of the nation's sovereignty and dignity, is a revelation of the despicable flunkeyist and treacherous nature and a ruse to evade the \"government\" crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   After its appearance, the present \"government\" that tries to keep itself in reliance on foreign forces and capital,  has schemed to get rid of the political and economic crisis and settle the issue of inter-Korean relations  with the backing of the outside forces.   Dependence on outside forces is the road of the nation's ruin and self-destruction.   The present \"government\" should  admit its towering crime of selling off a part of the Korean territory  to the foreign forces and be sternly punished by history. \r\n\r\n"
