The household ornamentals and stationery are in the shape of dragon, lion, mandarin duck and other animals in a message of bravery, integrity, love, friendship and harmony. Kettles, bowls, wine-glasses, braziers and so on are shaped like melon, pomegranate, lotus flower, gourd and other plants to symbolize good health and longevity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The celadon's array of decorative designs by a judicious combination of sketching and simplification are a tribute to differing symbols: those of dragon or hawk represent bravery and fortitude= phoenix, good omens, turtle, peach, crane and pine, a long life in good health, mandarin duck, butterfly and duck, love, friendship, happiness and harmony= peony blossom and peacock, living in luxury= and apricot, bamboo and reed, chastity and stamina. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In particular, the celadon is of spectacular colors blending in well with its shapes and designs. The Koryo celadon is a typically jade green which is traditionally likened to the azure blue of the autumn sky, the pure blue of the rain-cleared sky, or to the color of a stream in deep mountains. The noble and lyrical character of this color inspired so many ancient poets who compared it to jade or crystal in their verses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The elaborate craftsmanship of Koryo celadon is an eloquent proof of the Korean nation's high cultural  accomplishments. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA on Japan's attempt to avoid liquidation of past crimes \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, January 29 (KCNA) -- On January 23 the right-wing forces of Japan reportedly inaugurated what they call \"local dietmen's council for rescue of Japanese kidnapped by North Korea\" and decided to conduct a nationwide \"campaign\" for the \"settlement of suspicion of kidnapping.\" The Sankei Shimbun and men of the press in the service of right-wing forces persistently spread the \"suspicion of kidnapping\" to incite anti-DPRK feelings among the Japanese people. Some senior civil officials of Japan do not hesitate to describe the settlement of the \"suspicion of kidnapping\" as a major prerequisite to restart of food aid. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK has already made clear its position on the \"suspicion of kidnapping.\" There is no room for haggling on it with right-wing elements bereft of sound way of thinking and reason, it thinks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The point is why some senior officials of the Japanese government who \"welcomed the improved relations with the DPRK\" are persistently raising a hue and cry over non-existent \"suspicion of kidnapping\" with no reasonable ground even now when talks for normalization of diplomatic relations between the two countries are high on the agenda. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan is crying out for settlement of \"suspicion of kidnapping\" as a pre-condition for the improvement of the DPRK-Japan relations. Lurking behind it is a sinister intention to ensure its high profile in the coming negotiations between the two countries and avoid the liquidation of past crimes rather than to focus on the improvement of bilateral relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The right-wing forces of Japan think that if they succeed in branding the DPRK as \"abductor,\" they may take a position favourable to them at the negotiations. Their miscalculation goes only to betray their moral inferiority and shamelessness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The key to the solution to the outstanding issues between the DPRK and Japan is Japan's sincere liquidation of the past crimes. The improvement of bilateral relations would have been unthinkable without it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If Japan truly wants to improve the relationship with the DPRK, it should stop trying to use non-existent \"suspicion of kidnapping\" for putting pressure upon the partner of dialogue. It should also honestly admit the abduction of  millions of Koreans, the stark historic fact which it still refuses to do so. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
