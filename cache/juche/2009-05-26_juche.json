This resulted in completely demolishing the foundation of the work in the KIZ. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to bring the situation under control the north proposed a working contact for the revision of contracts on the KIZ and made efforts to realize it. But the south side defied these efforts and persistently raised the issue irrelevant to the agenda of the contact, deliberately laying a hurdle in the way of the contact. In the long run, it turned down even the north's proposal for having an additional contact, putting up an unreasonable precondition. The south side thus deprived both sides of the chance to have hard-won inter-Korean working contact. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group will be held wholly accountable for the unpardonable crimes it has committed against the nation, hell-bent on the confrontation with the north, by scuttling the work in the KIZ in which the aspiration of all Koreans after the country's reunification is reflected."

Esto muestra patentemente la ambicion negra e intento de Estados Unidos de tomar la hegemonia militar en la region de Asia y el Pacifico.\n\t\t\t\t\t  Asi critica el rotativo Rodong Sinmun en su comentario individual de este martes y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  EE.UU. piensa en que si se apodera de esta region, podria dominar al mundo. Este modo de pensar y la ambicion fueron y son invariables.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El objetivo de los yanquis para emplazar los cazas \"F-22\" reside en realizar la estrategia de guerra relampago basada en el ataque preventivo sobre cualquier objeto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El primer blanco de este ataque en dicha region es la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa actual administracion de EE.UU. habla tanto del supuesto \"cambio\" y \"dialogo entre ambas partes\".  Pero, en realidad, hereda fielmente la temeraria politica de aplastamiento militar de Bush contra Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La RPDC tiene la unidad monolitica mas poderosa que las armas nucleares y las fuerzas militares invencibles que nadie puede suponer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Las maniobras de EE.UU. encaminadas a asestar el ataque preventivo a la RPDC igualan a que se mete en la boca del lobo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito y el pueblo de Corea se encuentran en pleno estado de alerta combativa con alta vigilancia frente a tales maniobras imprudentes del imperio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  EE.UU. debe darse clara cuenta de que el intento de ataque preventivo contra Corea es precisamente  una locura que le acarrea por si mismo la desgracia y tiene que poner fin de inmediato a sus peligrosos actos militares contra esta si quiere evitar el destino de polilla nocturna."

Al fin, negando con la injusta condicion premisa la propuesta adicional de la RPDC para el contacto, llevo al fracaso la oportunidad de contacto de trabajo Norte-Sur preparado al cabo de e tantos esfuerzos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La banda de Lee, que enloquecida por la confrontacion fratricida llevo al fracaso las labores de la ZIK que reflejan la aspiracion de toda la nacion coreana a la reunificacion, asumira la entera responsabilidad por imperdonable crimen antinacional."
