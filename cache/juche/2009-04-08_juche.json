The U.S. arrested a Briton of Ethiopian origin in 2002 and used serious torture on him before transferring to the Guantanamo prison, according to Reuters.\n\t\t\t\t\t  What mattered is the fact that the U.S. prosecution appeased him to admit his guilty, promising that doing so would reduce his prison term, and forced him to make testimony unfavorable to other terror suspects. In the end, it asked him not to open to the press the facts about torture on the condition of his release.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson in a signed commentary Wednesday says:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This shows how sinisterly the U.S. worked to hide its human rights abuses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From the legal viewpoint, it is strictly prohibited to use a serious torture on a suspect in a bid to ascertain any criminal fact.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the U.S. made human rights abuses without hesitation by maltreating prisoners in gross violation of international laws.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is more serious is the fact that the said human rights abuses, branded as the most tragic case in the 21st century, were made under the approval and order of the U.S. ruling quarters. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This goes to prove that the U.S. human rights abuses were not an accident perpetuated by individuals but an organized national crime by the U.S. authorities and that the U.S. ruling authorities were directly involved in this case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. would be well advised to mind its own business before criticizing other countries over their human rights performance."

It, therefore, would be right to say that the above-said Constitution does not exist in principle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan adopted it as its policy to realize its wild ambition for overseas aggression after openly giving up the strategy for exclusive self-defense.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the military preparations necessary for overseas aggression have already been completed in Japan at present. Japan is on a par with other military powers in view of its military muscle and possession of offensive forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"Self-Defense Forces (SDF)\" were reorganized as regular armed forces capable of fighting a war for overseas aggression long ago under the pretext of \"defending the Japan proper\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Bold plans have been pushed forward to equip the SDF with modern, mobile and long-range military hardware.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese government set the \"expansion of use of satellites for security\" as one of the basic orientations of its space plan in its bid to convert Japan into a military giant and round off the capability for a preemptive attack and thus launch reinvasion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Shortly ago, it deployed Hyuga, carrier-style escort ship carrying helicopters aboard for the purpose of boosting the marine attack capability for overseas expansion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is more evidence proving Japan's departure from the \"Pacifist Constitution\" which restricts the use of Japan's military force to self-defense only.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries are opting for overseas expansion by dispatching warships of its maritime SDF to countries and waters to meet their interests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They had already sent ground, maritime and air SDFs to the Indian Ocean, Afghanistan and Iraq under the pretext of \"supporting the war on terrorism\", thus making a precedent of overseas military operation. Shortly ago, they sent two escort ships to the waters off Somalia under the pretext of \"combating piracy\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Such disturbing moves of the Japanese government and the SDF bring to light Japan's criminal attempt to justify its moves to turn itself into a military giant and kick off reinvasion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Threat\" from the DPRK and the like oft-repeated by them is nothing but a pretext to achieve their militarist ambition for overseas aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's war chariot eyeing other countries and regions is running only to fall into the abyss of destruction."
