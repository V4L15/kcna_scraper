            "content": "KCNA on Japan's missile development \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 13 (KCNA) -- Japan is going to conduct the first launch of \"H-2A\" on August 25, according to Nihon Keizai Shimbun.\r\n One may contend that there is no need to be cautious about Japan's plan, asserting that it is an independent right of a sovereign country to conduct scientific research for the peaceful use of space. But its neighbouring countries are becoming increasingly vigilant against Japan's plan to launch a space rocket because it is not simply for scientific researches. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is undergoing a rapid process of militarization and stepping up the moves to become a military power. Viewing its ambitious nuclear development plan in close linkage with this political and military tendency of Japan, one can come to a conclusion that the development of space rocket precisely means the development of nuclear delivery means. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a well-known fact that when the DPRK launched a satellite in 1998 Japan kicked up a noisy fuss about the DPRK's \"missile launch\" and staged such a fin-de-sie-cle rowdyism as \"suspending the Japan-DPRK talks\" before their resumption and stopping food aid. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Why much ado about nothing? Japan badly needed such a campaign as it was speeding up the development of missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads under the pretext of \"space research.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the Korean saying goes, the thief is afraid of his own shadow. Japan self-exposed its wild ambition through such disgraceful behaviour which invited the derision of the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is fully ready both materially and technologically to become a nuclear power any moment. What remains to be done by Japan is to have access to missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the ulterior aim sought by Japan in the space rocket test launch despite its repeated failures.    \r\n\r\n"
