Today, folk dances are developing, loved by Koreans. Among them is the Hansam dance (sleeve dance).\r\n   Koreans danced, wearing Hansam (a kind of wristlet long enough to cover the hands) in the past. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   Movements of the Hansam dance include those of driving Hansam upward, making it rise and fall like waves and swinging.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   Characteristic of this dance is that every movement ends with Hansam driving upward. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   The swinging of long Hansam haning down from the edge of the sleeves makes dance movements full of suggestion and expands their width, thus bringing the figurative line into marked relief.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   The Hansam dance is a folk dance peculiar to Korea.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   Scenes of this dance are visible on mural paintings in tombs of Koguryo, a feudal state that existed between 277 BC and ad 688 and records on this dance can also be found in many documents.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   Basic to the movements of typical Korean mask dances were those of the Hansam dance.\r\n   The court dance movements were also mainly based on this dance. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   The movements of the Hansam dance full of local flavour is currently being developed to suit the modern aesthetic sense. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   The Korean dance \"molten iron flows\", which was awarded the first prize and the gold medal in the folk dance competition at the 7th and 8th world festivals of youth and students, introduced many of Hansam dance movements in a way suited to the modern sense of beauty.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   Movements of this dance are also introduced into many other dance pieces including the folk dance suite \"Song of Seasons\", which receive favourable comments from the people.\r\n\r\n"

They also channelled into the war more than 20 billion dollars as military spending and vast military materiel or over 11 times that in the pacific war. They employed every conceivable barbarious war method and means in the Korean War.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   But they sustained an ignominious defeat before the Korean people who fought as one for the freedom and independence of the country.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   They were brought to their knees by the Korean people and signed the armistice agreement on July 27, Juche 42 (1953).&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   The former U.S. State Secretary, Marshall, said that the myth of the United States was shattered to smithereens and that the U.S. was not such a powerful country as others thought.    \r\n   \r\n"
