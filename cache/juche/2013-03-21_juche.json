            "content": "U.S. Nuclear Blackmail Will Be Foiled with Stronger Military Counteraction: Spokesman\r\n Pyongyang, March 21 (KCNA) -- It is the unshakable will and resolute determination of the service personnel and people of the DPRK to frustrate hostile acts of the U.S. and its satellite forces against the DPRK and defend the sovereignty of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the U.S. is still making a foolish attempt to test the DPRK's will and dampen its resolute decision through high-handed hostile acts including nuclear blackmail, failing to properly understand about its rival.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not content with pushing the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle war drills to the danger line, the U.S. set about making an undisguised nuclear blackmail against the DPRK after introducing mass destructive strike means equipped with nuclear warheads.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this regard the spokesman for the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army (KPA) gave the following answer to the question put by KCNA Thursday:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the KPA Supreme Command already clarified, the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military exercises are evidently dangerous nuclear war drills now under way as part of the most outrageous hostile acts to encroach upon the sovereignty and supreme interests of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a vivid expression of the crudest violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement (AA) and all the north-south agreements. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This was precisely the reason why the DPRK took an important decision to totally nullify the AA and declare the north-south declaration on nonaggression and the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula invalid.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The decision reflected the strong will and steadfast determination of the DPRK army and the people to foil the U.S. nuclear war racket with their own nuclear weapons, free from any binding, and wipe out all hostile forces toeing the U.S. policy now that it has become impossible to pin any hope on the validity of the above-said agreements and declarations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is now introducing B-52, nuclear-powered submarines and other nuclear strike means into south Korea and its vicinity in a bid to test the DPRK's will and break its resolute determination. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The flying corps of strategic bombers equipped with nuclear weapons and nuclear-powered submarines serve as \"the three major nuclear mainstays\" and \"the three major nuclear strike means\" along with intercontinental ballistic missiles that the U.S. brandishes as means of blackmail as it pleases.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is that the U.S. picked up B-52 and nuclear-powered submarines out of these nuclear strike means to send them to the sky above south Korea and its waters for a nuclear strike drill under the simulated conditions of an actual war against the DPRK. The U.S. is openly calling it a strong warning message to the DPRK and is claiming in public that it would continue such threat and blackmail against the DPRK in the future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the army and people of the DPRK will never be frightened at such a warning message, threat and blackmail.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should not forget that the Anderson Air Force Base on Guam where B-52 takes off and naval bases in Japan proper and Okinawa where nuclear-powered submarines are launched are within the striking range of the DPRK's precision strike means.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that the U.S. started open nuclear blackmail and threat, the DPRK, too, will move to take corresponding military actions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's declaration that it will react to the nukes of the enemy with nuclear attack more powerful than them is by no means an empty talk.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world will clearly see the provocateurs, who hurt the sovereignty of the DPRK, meet a miserable end in the flames of justice kindled by the army and people of the DPRK to defend its sovereignty."

The U.S. prodded the south Korean warmongers into reckless provocations against the DPRK, blustering that the U.S. would not only provide a nuclear umbrella to them but also mobilize all forces including conventional strike capabilities and missile defense capabilities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. went the lengths of opening to public the fact that U.S. B-52 equipped with nuclear weapons would stage a drill for dropping nuclear bombs in the sky above the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The danger of a nuclear war has reached an extreme phase as the U.S. nuclear submarines armed with nuclear missiles are busy sailing in the waters off the peninsula under the pretext of the Foal Eagle joint military exercises and strategic nuclear bomber is involved in the drill under the simulated conditions of an actual war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All these facts made clearer that the joint military exercises of the U.S. and south Korean puppet forces are not \"annual defensive ones\" but provocative nuclear war maneuvers against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has so far waited for an opportunity to ignite a war while introducing huge nuclear war hardware into south Korea every year under the pretext of these drills.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present situation goes to prove that the DPRK was entirely just when it had access to nuclear weapons as war deterrent to cope with the U.S. constant threat of a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No one can deny that the peace and security on the Korean Peninsula have been defended by the DPRK's nuclear deterrent for self-defence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and its allies are kicking off a \"sanctions\" racket while taking issue with the DPRK over its nuclear weapons for defending the peace and security on the peninsula and in the region. This is a grave criminal act of falsifying the fact and increasing the danger of a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Gone are the days never to return when the U.S. could resort to high-handed practices while threatening and blackmailing the DPRK with nukes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is seriously mistaken if it thinks it can frighten anyone with strategic bomber and nuclear submarines.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should know that B-52 and nuclear submarines can never get rid of the range of the DPRK's sighting strike.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It had better concern itself about its miserable fate before talking about the \"fulfillment of its defense commitment\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The provocateurs of a nuclear war and aggressors are bound to meet an end in the flames of a nuclear war kindled by themselves."

This will bring the number of interceptor missiles to 44 from the current 30.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Department also announced its cancellation of the plan for fourth-stage missile defence system in Europe and agreed to install the second radar station in Japan and look into the proposal for building the third tunnel-type interceptor missile base in the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Explaining it, U.S. Defense Secretary Hagel said it was because north Korea's long-range missile technology is developing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world is now looking at the recent steps taken by the U.S. with dubious eyes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On March 13 U.S. President Obama, when interviewed by a reporter, said north Korea may not have capabilities for attacking the U.S. mainland and Commander of U.S. Strategic Command Keller made a bluster at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing that if north Korea comes in attack targeting the U.S. mainland, the U.S. can certainly defend the country with 30 interceptor missiles now in stock.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the past the U.S. misled the public opinion, arguing pros and cons regarding the DPRK's capability of missile attack.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On one hand, it downplayed the DPRK's capabilities, saying that Pyongyang has not yet developed inter-continental ballistic missiles capable of striking the continental U.S. It, on the other hand, spread the story of \"missile threats from north Korea\", taking it as a pretext for building missile shields in Asia and the rest of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the DPRK's firm will to make showdown with the U.S. has stunned it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was astonished at the declaration made by the DPRK in the serious terms that the army and people of the country are on a high alert with nuclear weapons, inter-continental ballistic missiles and other attack means already in place targeting the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. could no longer downplay the might of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was put in hot water in the face of the imminent shower of bullets and shells to be unleashed by the DPRK on its land.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. kicked off even a nuclear war rehearsal after tightening \"sanctions\" and pressure on the DPRK over its legitimate satellite launch for peaceful purposes and the measure for self-defence. The U.S. is now caught in its own snare.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is foolish for the U.S. to think it can guarantee the security of its mainland by just deploying more interceptor missiles as a stop-gap emergency measure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No one can vouch that the U.S. can intercept all nuclear missiles of the DPRK that will be hailed on its mainland.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The interceptor missile measure of the U.S. just reveals its restlessness. The DPRK's striking power is limitless and will destroy all the strongholds and bases of aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The only way for the U.S. to guarantee the security of its mainland is to renounce its hostile policy toward the DPRK before the latter pushes the launch button."

Such moves are a wanton violation of justice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is very unfair that the UN Security Council kicked up a \"sanctions\" racket only against the DPRK's satellite launch and nuclear test while keeping mum about other countries' satellite launches and nuclear tests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We urge the UNSC to withdraw such \"resolutions on sanctions\" and demand the U.S. and south Korean bellicose forces stop at once the war drills for aggression straining the situation on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should withdraw its aggressor forces from south Korea at once.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We extend firm support to the Korean people in their struggle for safeguarding the country's sovereignty and achieving national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Ecuador-Guaranda Institute for Friendship and Cultural Solidarity with the Korean People said such grave situation on the Korean Peninsula created by the U.S. and its lackeys opposed to peaceful coexistence of humankind is arousing great concern of the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The association called on all the progressive forces to unite as one and extend solidarity to the Korean people in their struggle against imperialism and the U.S."
