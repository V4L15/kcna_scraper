            "content": "FM spokesman on satellite launch and  missile development \r\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, August 18 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea today issued a statement denouncing the hostile forces for getting most frantic in their peaceful satellite anti-DPRK campaign on the pretext that its peaceful satellite activity is \"missile launch.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The statement says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The hostile forces around the Korean peninsula, describing the DPRK's launch of satellite in August last year as missile launch, claim that the DPRK is to re-launch a long-range missile and cry for what they call \"countermeasure\" in an effort to increase pressure upon the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Underlying the anti-DPRK campaign is a very sinister political aim at tarnishing the image of the peace-loving DPRK in the international arena and isolating it through internationalization of the pressure upon it = the campaign is very dangerous in that it may undermine the principle of impartiality in international relations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As already known, the DPRK has not only a satellite activity program for peaceful  scientific researches into space but also a missile development program for the nation's defense capabilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In August last year the DPRK succeeded in launching \"Kwangmyongsong 1\" with its own efforts and technology. That is the first shining fruition of the DPRK's satellite launch program. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The two programs belong to the sovereignty of an independent country from A to Z. So, as far as the issue is concerned, the DPRK is not bound by any international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As far as satellite activity is concerned, the countries around the DPRK launched into it before the latter. The United States has more than 1,900 satellites in the space, Japan some 50 satellites and other surrounding countries not a small number of satellites. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The universe is the shared property of humankind and there is no discrimination in the peaceful use of it. That is the publicly recognized principle of international law enshrined in all the international resolutions which have hitherto been adopted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There is no law which stipulates that a specified country is free to make and launch satellites as it wishes, while other country is not allowed to conduct satellite activity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If satellite activity should be called into question, it may be done only when the number of the satellites launched by the DPRK is equal to that of the satellites launched by the surrounding countries at least. Only then can it be said that the debate on the satellite activity is impartial on an equal footing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As mentioned above, the forces hostile to the DPRK have no justification to take issue with the DPRK over the satellite issue. Therefore, they set themselves against the DPRK's peaceful satellite activity, making every possible effort to describe it as \"missile launch.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Judging from the principle of impartiality, the same can be said of the missile issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Most of the countries around the DPRK have developed missiles before the latter. They have far more missiles than it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Why do they argue that only our missiles pose \"threat\"? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There would be no reason for us to fire missiles at the U.S. if they are not a warring party and if they do nothing harmful to us, even if our missiles can reach the U.S. mainland. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If we fire missiles at the U.S. without any reason, will the U.S. stay idle? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There is no need to mention who first posed grave threat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We have been compelled to develop missiles entirely because the U.S., a warring party, occupied South Korea by force of arms, continued deploying missiles and other sophisticated military equipment there from long ago and still harbors a wild ambition for military invasion of the DPRK. This is a self-defensive measure we have adopted unavoidably. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   For the U.S. to slander the DPRK over missile issue reminds one of a thief crying \"stop thief.\" This is a trick to continue inciting antagonism towards the DPRK, create \"fear of crisis,\" make Japan bear the financial burden for the development of the \"theatre missile defense\" system and sell more weapons to South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan is now making much more ado over the missile issue than others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is long since that Japan has been within range of missiles of other countries. However, it is now making a fuss, highly sensitive only to our missiles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The reason is clear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan has not liquidated the past crimes it committed against us, though it is at the turn of the century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   That is why Japan is fearful of our missiles only, though there are many missiles around it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If Japan truly feels threat from our missile, it must know that the key to the problem is in its own hands. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If it is short-sighted, confined to its selfish interests, it will meet an irrevocable failure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We will continue our effort to catch up with neighboring countries in the field of peaceful satellite activities. As regards the missile issue, we are always ready for negotiation if the hostile nations honestly ask for it out of an intention to alleviate our concern. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We make it clear once again, however, that on behalf of the dignity of the nation, we will resolutely counter any unfair attempt to discriminate against us. \r\n\r\n"

They should have been damned for such crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The press statements strongly demanded that Japan squarely look into the requirement of the times and unconditionally accept the principled stand clarified by the DPRK government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They also hoped that trade unions, working people and religionists in different countries would positively conduct various activities in support of the DPRK government's statement. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Craftiness peculiar to Japan\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 18 (KCNA) -- Minju Joson today in a signed commentary dismisses the Japanese reactionaries' fuss about the payment of \"temporary fund\" to those who served in the former Japanese army as a behaviour of a political dwarf intended to mislead public opinion by creating the impression that they are interested in liquidating the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This move of Japan is basically aimed at evading its responsibility for the governmental settlement of the tremendous damage done to all the Korean people with a petty amount of money and improve its image. But no one will be taken in by such a trite trick of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There is a brisk movement worldwide to clearly liquidate the past in the century and greet the 21st century with good conscience but only Japan has failed to say a proper word about apology to the Korean people, to say nothing of compensation, thus becoming a target of contempt and derision of the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The proposed payment of a petty amount of money to those who served in the former Japanese army, even that to a limited number of persons, is what the Japanese reactionaries conceived as a last resort to save the situation  turning unfavorable to them day by day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If Japan is to truly repent of and liquidate the past it should make honest apology and a comprehensive and full state compensation to the DPRK so that the victims may understand it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan is well advised to drop such third-rate farce and make a right decision, though belatedly. \r\n\r\n"

This was admitted by the U.S., too, he said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Now that the international situation has become more complicated and bloody armed conflicts are breaking out in different parts  of the world one after another the united states is  making excessive profits by aggravating the situation through arms sale. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. made no scruple of using territories of such sovereign nations as Yugoslavia and Iraq as a \"weapon testing ground\" in a bid to steadily improve the efficiency of mass destruction weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such being the fact, it is hectic with its moves to bring \"international pressure\" upon the DPRK to keep it from launching  satellites and \"developing missiles\" on the pretext that they pose a \"threat\" to it and escalating the tensions on the Korean peninsula by providing the South Korean ruling quarters with sophisticated war means. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Its aim is to repeat its \"bombing of Yugoslavia\" and its \"bombing of Iraq\" on the Korean peninsula.    The escalating U.S. military threat compels the DPRK to increase its state power and defence capabilities in every way by taking measures to launch satellites and missiles with a view to defending its sovereignty and ensuring peace and security. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
