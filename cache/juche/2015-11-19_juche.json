Korean Authorities to Show Their Will to Improve Inter-Korean Relations in Practice\r\nPyongyang, November 19 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) on Wednesday gave the following answer to the question put by KCNA as regards the south Korean authorities' floating of misinformation about the north-south dialogue:\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities recently created the impression that they were interested in the improvement of the inter-Korean relations, asserting that the \"north kept mum\" about the talks between authorities and crying out for a \"response.\" Even the present chief executive jabbered that the \"north's sincerity and will to implement the agreement were more important.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is nothing but a revelation of their cynical ploy to shift the blame for having failed to hold north-south dialogue onto the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As recognized by the world public, the DPRK initiated the north-south high-level emergency contact in last August and made every possible effort to sincerely implement the points agreed upon at the contact.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was thanks to the positive and sincere efforts of the DPRK that the reunion of divided families and relatives took place at the Mt. Kumgang Resort days ago and non-governmental contacts and exchanges are being reenergized between the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities, however, are staging saber rattling with outsiders against the north almost everyday, denying their dialogue partner, and ratcheting up the anachronistic nuclear and \"human rights\" rackets against the north quite contrary to the unanimous will and desire of the compatriots for improved inter-Korean relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even at this moment, the present chief executive of south Korea is busy with disgraceful diplomacy for soliciting \"cooperation in the nuclear racket against the north\" on foreign tours. The confrontation ruckus against the north such as the introduction of \"state-compiled\" history textbook being pushed forward for the purpose of inciting hostility towards the DPRK is going on in south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities are disturbing in every way even NGO exchange getting brisk according to the inter-Korean agreement by putting up unreasonable pretexts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes without saying that all these acts are diametrically running counter to the spirit of the agreement and rattling the nerves of the dialogue partner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a matter of fact, there is no change in the attitude of the south Korean authorities before and after the August agreement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how loudly the south Korean authorities may talk about dialogue, no one would believe in their sincerity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The inter-Korean relations cannot be repaired by the unilateral efforts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean authorities truly hope to see improved relations, they should stop making empty talk, discard their obstinate confrontation attitude and strive hard to create climate for dialogue, to begin with.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They would be well advised to keenly feel responsible for the failure to open inter-Korean dialogue and fulfill their commitment, though belatedly."

But such a thing is unimaginable at the dignified media organizations under socialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As for the software which the hostile forces took issue with, they are executable software needed for subscribers to have access to animation files. It is, therefore, normal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is questionable is that only the U.S. and south Korea are speaking ill of the software which is widely used by many people of the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those who spread the story about \"hacking\" are Radio Free Asia and other pseudo media.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their manipulators are their authorities who are displeased with the stirring reality of the DPRK being known to the world and afraid of their criminal nature being brought to light.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the final analysis, the recent \"hacking\" story cannot be construed otherwise than a premeditated plot of the hostile forces to stir up repugnancy towards the websites of the DPRK in the world community and bar the just voices of Songun Korea from being heard.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., chieftain of world cyber warfare, adopted it as its official policy to mount a preemptive attack without an advance warning on computer networks of other countries through the \"presidential policy directive 20\" in October 2012. Recently it held what it called an annual security consultative meeting with the south Korean authorities at which it cried out for intensifying joint cyber exercises and cyber military education targeting the DPRK. It is the height of impudence for it to talk about \"hacking\" by someone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is sadly mistaken if it thinks it can isolate the DPRK from the world and justify its criminal acts with such false story about \"hacking\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Absurd and foolish rubbish will only touch off world derision and criticism of the tricksters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and its followers have to clearly understand that with nothing can they quell the just voices of great Songun Korea."
