To this end, the civic and social organizations will steadily escalate the candle-light demonstrations and strongly demand the united states not only hold dialogue with the DPRK but conclude a non-aggression treaty with it, the speakers noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is urgent to express positive will to achieve security in the land free from the presence of the U.S. troops, they added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The participants decided to open such seminar once in every month to discuss opinions.    \r\n\r\n"

The exercises are not ordinary military drills but premeditated and provocative war games aimed to mount a preemptive attack on the DPRK in view of the scale of troops and arms to be involved in them and their contents and nature, says Minju Joson today in a commentary.\r\n Such joint military exercises for this year assume more dangerous nature as they are to be staged at a time when the U.S. imperialists are reinforcing their armed forces in and around  South Korea and escalating the military pressure upon the DPRK under the pretext of its \"nuclear development\", the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Huge armed forces of the U.S. imperialists have already been deployed in and around South Korea and measures taken to cope with possible contingency. So, nobody can predict when the above-said exercises will go over to real action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In actuality, the danger of war on the Korean Peninsula is increasing due to the U.S. imperialists' adventurous war games and the regional situation is inching close to the brink of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK, which stands for the peace and peaceful reunification of the country, can never remain an onlooker to such dangerous war maneuvers of the U.S. imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists should promptly stop the reckless moves to provoke a new war.    \r\n\r\n"

Everything is going well in the DPRK. Nothing can destroy its socialist system. The U.S. warhawks are now floating a variety of misinformation about the just measures taken by the DPRK to cope with their moves to isolate and stifle it. But it is an expression of ignorance of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's proposal for concluding a non-aggression treaty with the U.S. is winning positive support from the world people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nMuch upset by this, the U.S. is resorting to false propaganda in a bid to shirk off the blame for the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and strike the DPRK. But it is a serious miscalculation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe U.S. should stop this smear campaign and its moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
