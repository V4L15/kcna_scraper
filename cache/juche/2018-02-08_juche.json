The international community is expecting the DPRK to show greater sincerity and concession over the denuclearization issue if it truly hopes for promoting the detente on the Korean peninsula. Unless it does so, it will be difficult for the DPRK to attain its purpose.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On the same day, the Global Times of China's People's Daily carried an argument made by a senior research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies that restoring inter-Korean relations without touching on the nuclear issue is unsustainable and fragile. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Earlier in January, some Chinese media made wicked assertions that the sustenance of the atmosphere for detente on the Korean peninsula is closely related to the solution of the \"nuclear issue of the DPRK\" and that \"detente will not last long without common recognition of the denuclearization\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such incoherent talks heard from Chinese media can not but be retorted as an arrogant act aimed at interference in the internal issue of the Korean nation and an unreasonable logic and sophism ignorant of the essence of the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Obvious is the stand of the DPRK to successfully hold the Winter Olympics as a national event and fully display the dignity and might of the Korean nation and, therefore, this is supported and welcomed by all the fellow countrymen and the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is only the U.S. and other outsiders who are to blame for the division of the Korean Peninsula and the tension there that stand against the Korean nation working hard to open up a new chapter for peace on the peninsula by its concerted efforts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t China's experts and media, that have touted for \"peaceful solution\" to the Korean peninsula issue whenever an opportunity presented itself, now shun the present positive development of the situation and are arguing for and against while setting the DPRK's participation in the Winter Olympics against its strategic issue. How can such behavior be interpreted as an act of allegedly \"disinterested\" neighbors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is evidently an act of screwballs feeling dissatisfaction with the north and the south of Korea aspiring after detente and peace, and a mischievous act to reverse and divert the international focus away from the atmosphere for the north-south reconciliation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It reminds one of a mean fellow looking over the fence of a feast host.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Winter Olympics has nothing to do with \"denuclearization\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As acknowledged by the world, the DPRK's possession of nuclear deterrence was a legitimate option for self-defense reflective of the stern historical lesson and the reality in which the DPRK's sincere efforts for the denuclearization of the whole Korean Peninsula were ignored and the U.S. nuclear threat to the DPRK aimed to destroy its sovereignty and rights to existence and development has daily increased.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At this time, swimming against the atmosphere of peace on the Korean Peninsula, the U.S. is rendering to the extremes the political and military threat and brandishing a fireball after shipping huge aggression forces including all sorts of ultramodern nuclear war weapons to the sky, land and sea, thereby threatening the Winter Olympics and the post-Olympics situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If one truly hopes for peace on the Korean Peninsula and regional stability, it is reasonable for one to say what it should do to the trouble-maker U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is illogical for the Chinese media to absurdly vociferate about \"denuclearization\", far from saying what it should do.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t So, is an event of \"denuclearization\" ever on the list of the Winter Olympics?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Call a spade a spade. It is very despicable of those Chinese media to mess with their neighbor's event, far from offering congratulations to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ignoring the reality and occasion, they are forcibly linking the issue of \"denuclearization\" to the Olympics, which cannot be interpreted otherwise than an act aimed to spoil others' feast.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They betrayed the dark intention to distract the international caution focused on them to the DPRK by doggedly standing in the way of creating reconciliation atmosphere between the north and the south of Korea that would have a positive impact on the world peace and the development of the regional situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are trying to hold the issue of inter-Korean relations on nuclear issue leash and use it as leverage for interference.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They, in the long run, left the international community unpleasant feelings that the \"initiative and proactive neighboring diplomacy\" only seeks interference in the internal affairs of other countries and nations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently they slandered the DPRK's measure for self-defense as \"narrow-minded interpretation of outside and self-justified action in the nuclear and missile issue\". They also belittled the military capabilities of the DPRK, quoting a \"conclusion drawn after inspecting from the south side position in Panmunjom\". Now to what extent have they reached.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some experts and media of China engrossed in admonishing others are now showing the same proclivity as the Trump and Abe groups and the conservative riff-raffs of south Korea marginalized after being isolated and rejected in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going blind in judging the trend of the times would make one face great disappointment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such senseless meddling doesn't fit the appearance of a \"power\"."

En tales circunstancias, la construccion de las fuerzas armadas regulares se presentaba como mayor prioridad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPercatado de la situacion y la demanda legitima de la revolucion en desarrollo, Kim Il Sung presto atencion primordial a la construccion de las fuerzas armadas regulares revolucionarias presentandola como el mas importante de los asuntos estatales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY cumplio exitosamente esta causa en menos de tres anos en las condiciones dificiles en que no hubo las experiencias ni el cimiento. He aqui la imborrable proeza revolucionaria del extraordinario politico, genial estratega militar y patriota sin par. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon su destacada ideologia militar y extraordinaria arte de mando, el Presidente y el Dirigente Kim Jong Il condujeron sabiamente para que el EPC ostentara su poderio de ejercito invencible. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGracias a la larga prevision de los grandes Lideres y su probada direccion, el EPC mantiene de decada en decada su caracter de fuerzas armadas revolucionarias del partido y crea el ejemplo de relevancia mundial en la lucha antiimperialista estableciendo la unidad monolitica con las masas populares. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy dia, el EPC acoge la era de esplendor bajo la guia del Maximo Dirigente Kim Jong Un. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo la orientacion de su Comandante Supremo, el EPC abrira con valentia la senda de avance de la revolucion del Juche manifestando su poderio inagotable.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMinju Joson apunta que el EPC es el invencible ejercito revolucionario que bajo la direccion de los grandes hombres sin iguales, allano el camino inexplorado de la construccion de las fuerzas armadas revolucionarias regulares y vino continuando generacion tras generacion la historia y la tradicion de victoria."
