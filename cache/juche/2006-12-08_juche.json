It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The sovereignty and dignity of a nation can be firmly protected by the force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Independence would be unthinkable unless it is guaranteed by the force of arms. One cannot counter any hostile forces with empty talk and fists when they come out to attack one with bayonet in order to violate one's independence. It is necessary to beat back armed invasion with arms and return fire for fire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history of the Korean nation taught us a bitter lesson that a country with a weak army cannot defend its national sovereignty and is bound to meet a wretched lot of a ruined nation as miserable as a dog in a house of death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world history and the present reality also clearly suggest that a country with a weak army can never exercise political independence and influence in the international arena and will allow itself to have its sovereignty violated by foreign forces in the end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The great banner of Songun has served as an invincible treasured sword as it has defended the sovereignty and dignity of the Korean nation with powerful armed forces from the high-handed acts and aggression and paved a wide avenue of accomplishing the cause of national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea of Songun that clarified the Juche-oriented philosophy on the army and the principle of army building provided a sure guarantee for winning victory in the acute confrontation with armed hostile forces and independently carving out the destiny of the Korean nation. The Korean revolution aimed to achieve national independence started and has emerged victorious with arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National independence would be unthinkable apart from Songun. The Korean nation had no one to whom it could complain even when Japan forced Korea to sign a treaty that led to a national ruin by mobilizing artillery pieces and guns and stormed into the Royal palace to burn its Queen to death in the past. But today more than a century since then, the Korean nation is displaying its dignity as a strong nation with tremendous deterrence and is strong enough to wipe out any formidable enemy. This is the pride and honor brought by Songun to the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such high dignity and honor of the Korean nation are ascribable to Songun. It has become a source of the dignity, pride and might of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No force on earth can ever match this invincible might of Songun.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They were created by applying the form of long poem written in Korean alphabet \"Hunmin Jongum\" and rich poem description methods, with the result that it is of great value in the light of history of developing national poems and songs in the middle ages. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The music is based on the melody of the folk-music in the main and its description method is also based on the experience in the creation of folk songs and other popular poems and songs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Sejong Musical Note\" reflects the then developed professional music and carries many pieces of musical works reflecting the traditional forms of national songs and peculiar melodies.
