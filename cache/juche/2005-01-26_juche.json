This strips the Japanese reactionaries stark naked as a group of depraved guys who do not deserve even a passing note when it comes to human nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those who are hell bent on distorting, downsizing and concealing their extra-large anti-human crimes are crying themselves hoarse over an already settled matter.

Those who are trying to flout with history will certainly face a stern judgment by history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is the only way out for Japan. It is to cleanly settle its past crimes.

The guidelines has entered the phase of its implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint operation plan \"5055\" worked out by the United States and Japan in the new century on the basis of the guidelines is the finally rounded-off version of the scenario for the second Korean war. The new \"national defense program outlines\" mapped out and published by the Japanese government on Dec. 10 last year is also aimed to carry out this war scenario. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Also noteworthy in this strengthened military tie-up is that they are speeding up the joint development of the missile defence system (MD) in real earnest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The director general of the Japan Defense Agency and the U.S. ambassador to Japan signed a MOU on jointly developing MD on Dec.17 last year. Timed to coincide with this, the Japanese government decided to reexamine the \"three principles of export of weapons\" to provide parts necessary for jointly developing MD with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries decided to push forward the work under the pretext of the \"missile threat\" from the DPRK and signed a document related to it. This fact goes to prove that the stepped -up joint development of MD is aimed to target the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is more serious is that U.S.-Japan madcap joint military exercises are now under way in areas close to the Korean Peninsula, a dangerous move to provoke the second Korean war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
