Such country is not qualified to get a permanent seat at the UN Security Council under any circumstances.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the Korean people suffered under Japan's military occupation for nearly half a century and have been in the military showdown with the U.S. for over 60 years, he said: That is why they desire peace more ardently than any other people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To denuclearize the Korean Peninsula is the behest of President Kim Il Sung, and it is the steadfast stand of the DPRK government to settle the nuclear issue peacefully through dialogue and negotiations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has so far sincerely fulfilled its commitments under the agreement made at the six-party talks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. call for unilateral inspection of the DPRK is a gangster-like assertion intended to disarm the DPRK, its warring party, disregarding the denuclearization of the whole Korean Peninsula stipulated in the September 19 joint statement the keynote of which is to remove the nuclear threat from the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will as ever make all its sincere efforts to denuclearize the whole peninsula, but never allow any attempt to hurt its dignity and pride and infringe upon its sovereignty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The June 15 joint declaration and its action program, the October 4 declaration are a landmark indicating the shortcut to the development of inter-Korean relations and the independent reunification of the Korean nation in the new century, and they are a great platform most correctly reflecting the demand of the times and the desire of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is absolutely intolerable to ignore the historic inter-Korean declarations adopted at the north-south summits and unanimously hailed by the international community on account of the regime change in south Korea."
