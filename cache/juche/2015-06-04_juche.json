She, at the same time, spouts rhetoric urging it to come out for dialogue and not to refuse the south's proposal for dialogue in a bid to mislead the public opinion, creating impression that a dialogue between the authorities of the north and the south has not yet opened due to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pursuant to her scenario, Yun Pyong Se, Hong Yong Phyo and other mandarins of the south Korean puppet regime held a series of anti-DPRK confabs with their U.S. and Japanese masters, at which they cried out for \"leading the north to dialogue in line with the strategy of pressure and dialogue.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) said in a statement on Wednesday in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said moves are no more than renewed politically-motivated chicanery and red herring operation being staged by the puppet group in a sinister bid to shift the blame for the deteriorated north-south relations on to the DPRK, tide over the ever-worsening ruling crisis and escalate confrontation with the DPRK with the backing of outsiders. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is, indeed, the height of impudence for the puppet group to talk about \"dialogue\" as it has chilled the atmosphere for improving the inter-Korean relations and scuppered the opportunity for dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No one will lend an ear to such ill-natured advertisement of \"dialogue\" by the Park Geun Hye group and it will never be able to evade the responsibility for having deteriorated the north-south relations through such hypocritical burlesque.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the puppet group truly wants dialogue with the north, the group should have elementary qualities as a dialogue partner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t First of all, the group should have the viewpoint to independently solve the reunification issue with the concerted efforts of all Koreans and the stand to recognize and implement the joint declarations agreed upon by the authorities of the north and the south. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should stop toeing the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK and roll back the policy of confrontation with compatriots in the north and halt at once the north-targeted war drills straining the situation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Only when it does so, can it claim it has elementary qualifications as a dialogue partner and it will have the face to sit together with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will closely follow what the south Korean puppet group do in practice, not just talking."

Since 1998 it has conducted experiments after setting up institutes and germ-related facilities in its military bases in Osan, Ryongsan and Phyongthaek, for the first time among its bases overseas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said experiment in the Osan military base is part of the bio-chemical warfare the U.S. has so far waged against the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During the past Korean war the U.S. perpetrated thrice-cursed germ warfare, regarding the Korean peninsula as a ground for testing bio-chemical weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It even used internationally banned chemical weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t More than 1.23 million people were brutally killed in the northern half of Korea during the war due to the U.S. imperialists' indiscriminate air raids and bio-chemical warfare.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the Armistice Agreement was signed, the U.S. has stepped up the moves for bio-chemical warfare against the Korean nation, adding to its crimes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Consequently, south Korea has turned into the world's worst colony and biggest arsenal of bio-chemical weapons as the U.S. shipped all types of nuclear and bio-chemical weapons into south Korea for deliberately conducting tests on living human bodies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said anthrax germ experiments in south Korea are heinous war crimes committed pursuant to the U.S. scenario for world domination.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For the U.S., the bio-chemical warfare is one of the major military scenarios to invade other countries and dominate the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has pushed ahead with the development of bio-chemical weapons for a long time and directed great efforts to researches into them and their production.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since truce in Korea the U.S. has more frantically pushed forward the establishment of bio-chemical weapons system according to the hegemonic viewpoints of the chief executives that it should be rounded off in the light of political and military interests of the White House and should not be restricted by the international arms control mechanism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. development of bio-chemical weapons is premised on their use and aimed at world domination. Hence, the U.S. plan for the development of bio-chemical weapons obviously assumes offensive nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t U.S. \"counter-terrorism\" is an undisguised bio-chemical warfare being perpetrated by the U.S. worldwide under the pretext of coping with \"bio-chemical threats\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is hyping \"threats\" from the DPRK in a bid to invade the DPRK located in the region of military and geopolitical importance in its strategy for world domination. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lurking behind the U.S. noisy trumpeting about the non-existent \"bio-chemical threat\" from the DPRK is a sinister intention to legalize its bio-chemical warfare under its pretext.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ongoing U.S. moves to ignite a bio-chemical warfare are a grave human rights abuse against the international community and a hideous crime which deserves humankind's punishment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is, indeed, an arch criminal manufacturing, stockpiling and proliferating WMDs. It is an empire of devils, chieftain of bio-chemical warfare and synonym for human rights abuses as it stoops to any move to exterminate other nations and countries in utter disregard of international law and world public opinion for realizing its ambition for aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The moves stepped up by the U.S. for a war of aggression against the DPRK under the pretext of \"nuclear and bio-chemical threats\" would only compel the DPRK to further bolster up its capability for self-defence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. and the south Korean puppet group persist in their moves for bio-chemical warfare, they will be held wholly accountable for all the ensuing consequences and will have to pay a dear price for them."

They were closeted over the issue of maintaining \"close cooperation\" to put \"strong pressure\" upon the DPRK and increase the \"efficiency of sanctions\" as a reaction to \"the north's serious increase of nuclear capability.\" Meanwhile, they let loose rhetoric calling for \"dynamism of the international community,\" trumpeting about the improvement of \"human rights in the north\" and the like. \n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Thursday observes in a commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This goes to clearly prove that the group of traitors has reached the worst phase in its moves to tighten a siege of political and military pressure and economic sanctions to the DPRK in collusion with outside forces and realize its ambition to stifle the DPRK come what may.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural, therefore, for the DPRK to bolster up its nuclear deterrence for self-defence to cope with the prevailing serious situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet forces are sadly mistaken if they calculate they can get something by ratcheting up the sanctions and pressure upon the DPRK through such cooperation with outside forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The desperate efforts being made by the traitors in collusion with outside forces only harden the will of the DPRK to mercilessly meet the challenge of aggressors with the invincible military muscle of Songun Korea.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK keeps tabs on all crimes committed by the puppet group of traitors, hell-bent on the confrontation with the DPRK in collusion with outside forces.

Pero, la banda de Park Geun-hye, complice de la guerra bioquimica de EE.UU., dice sin escrupulos que discutira este tema en la \"reunion conjunta\" con las tropas norteamericanas, prevista para julio que viene. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTales hechos demuestran una vez mas claramente que mientras existan los invasores norteamericanos y su brigada de choque, camarilla de Park Geun-hye, la nacion coreana no puede defender la vida y la seguridad de la nacion ni eludir los desastres de la guerra nuclear y bioquimica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa camarilla de Park, que se entrega con frenesi a la provocacion de guerra bioquimica contra la parte connacional en contubernio con las fuerzas extranjeras, sera condenada categoricamente por la nacion."

Pues, el plan de desarrollo de armas bioquimicas norteamericanas reviste el caracter ofensivo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa \"guerra antiterrorista\" de EE.UU. es la provocacion de la guerra bioquimica que se comete abiertamente en la palestra internacional bajo el rotulo de hacer frente a la \"amenaza bioquimica\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. difunde el rumor de \"amenaza\" de la RPDC a fin de agredir a ella que esta situada en la posicion muy importante en lo politico, militar y geopolitico. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHabla tan ruidosamente de la inexistente \"amenaza bioquimica\" de la RPDC con el designio malintencionado de justificar la guerra bioquimica, considerada como metodo eficiente para la realizacion de la estrategia de hegemonia mundial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas maniobras norteamericanas tendentes a desatar la guerra bioquimica devienen la exterminacion de derechos humanos en la sociedad internacional y el crimen de categoria especial a ser liquidado sin falta por la humanidad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. es el autor de la produccion, posesion y proliferacion de armas de exterminio masivo, el imperio de malos, criminal de guerra bioquimica y pronombre de la violacion de los derechos humanos que no vacila en exterminar a otras naciones y paises sin tener en cuenta la ley internacional ni la opinion publica mundial para satisfacer su ambicion agresiva. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuanto mas EE.UU. intensifique las maniobras de guerra de agresion anti-RPDC pretextando la \"amenaza nuclear y bioquimica\", mas consolidaremos la capacidad de autodefensa nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi EE.UU. y los titeres surcoreanos siguen recurriendo a las maniobras de provocacion de la guerra bioquimica, se responsabilizaran de todas las consecuencias y pagaran muy caro por su crimen."
