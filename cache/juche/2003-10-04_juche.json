This was attributable to the existence of the treaty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Denouncing the U.S. imperialists for having shipped at least 1,000 nuclear weapons into south Korea under the pretext of the treaty in a bid to stifle the inviolable DPRK, he demanded that the anti-national and anti-reunification treaty be repealed and the U.S. troops immediately pull out of south Korea.    \r\n\r\n"

General Assembly \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 3 (KCNA) -- Choe Su Hon, vice-minister of Foreign Affairs who is heading the DPRK delegation, in a speech made at the 58th session of the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 30 said that the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is the ultimate goal and initiative of the DPRK and an earnest desire of the entire Korean nation.\r\n He said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the six-party talks held in Beijing in late August, the DPRK set as the goal the abandonment by the United States of its policy hostile to the DPRK in exchange for renunciation of our nuclear program. To achieve that goal, the DPRK proposed to take all necessary measures through the package deal and work towards their implementation on a step-by-step basis pursuant to the principle of simultaneous actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the position of the United States is that it will discuss its steps only after the DPRK takes all actions first. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This can be construed only as an ulterior intention to disarm and eliminate the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We have never made any promises with regard to the next round of the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All developments concerning the nuclear issue well prove that pressure can never be a means for settlement of the nuclear issue and multi-party talks can be fruitful only when the United States commits itself to abandon the policy hostile to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our demand is modest and simple. We just want both sides to drop guns simultaneously and co-exist peacefully. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He expressed hope that the UN member states would have a correct understanding of the DPRK's position and actively cooperate for a fair solution to the nuclear issue and for peace on the Korean peninsula and the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that for the UN member states it is the most important task at present to establish a just and equitable international order and relations in line with the aspirations and desire of the entire humankind, he stressed that to this end it is necessary to strictly observe the principle of respect for sovereignty and equality in the international relations, enhance the functions and role of the United Nations and particularly, democratize the United Nations.    \r\n\r\n"

Dismissing his criticism as foolish one, a signed commentary of Rodong Sinmun today says:\r\n The chief executive made an apology, though belatedly, and busied himself managing to get things straight and thus got a sort of understanding from the people. But the day the typhoon hit south Korea Choe went to the U.S. and talked nonsense that one should not only rely on dialogue and negotiations as regards the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. and the food aid and energy supply to the north should be stopped if the six-way talks fail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the final analysis, Traitor Choe flew to the U.S. to escape from the recent typhoon and committed treachery there. With nothing can he justify his crimes. This is, in fact, not just a matter to be censured and jeered but the biggest crime to be judged by the south Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Yet, he has the face to appear before the public and talk such nonsense. This only proves that he is a hypocritical pseudo politician. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Choe faulted the other to cover up his crimes but it only brought his unpopular true colors into bolder relief. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Choe would be well advised to bear in mind that traitors are bound to meet denunciation and destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The infringement upon the sovereignty of a country by military attack and massacre of people are the biggest violation of human rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The invasion of Iraq by the U.S. imperialists without the UN approval and in violation of international law was a grave infringement upon sovereignty and a typical state-sponsored terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"war on terrorism\" advocated by the U.S. is aimed to commit terrorism, not to check it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It can not but be a brigandish act reminding one of a thief crying stop the thief and a crafty psychological operation targeted against the DPRK for the U.S. to absurdly relate the DPRK to human rights abuse and terrorism though it has nothing to do with them.\r\n As it has already declared several times, the DPRK has nothing to do with terrorism and strongly opposes all forms of terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nobody will lend an ear to the U.S. far-fetched allegations about the human rights abuse and terrorism in the DPRK and they will only reveal more glaringly the brazen-faced and mean nature of the U.S. as the chieftain of human rights abuse and terrorism.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They proved that the area of Pyongyang is the cradle of the culture of Kojoson. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Historians from the south reviewed achievements made by historical circles in the north and the south in the studies of Tangun and Kojoson and said it has been proved through Koguryo mural tombs that the Korean nation is descendants of Tangun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The speakers stressed the need for the historians of the two parts of the country to deepen joint academic studies of Tangun and Kojoson that had a great influence on the development of national history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A joint press release of the symposium was adopted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to it, the historians of the north and the south shared the same view that the Korean nation is a homogeneous nation with Tangun as its founding ancestor, a resourceful nation that went over to a civilized society in the earliest period in the East to create an excellent national culture and that Kojoson was the first ancient state of the Korean nation and a powerful and independent sovereign state that displayed its grand sight as a civilized state in the East. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They also reached consensus on the need to conduct brisk academic exchange, solidarity and cooperation to glorify the national history spanning five thousand years, preserve the fine national character and keep the commonness of the nation and turn out actively for the solidarity and unity of the intellectuals of the north, the south and abroad and for the great unity of the whole nation and national reunification in accordance with the idea of \"By our nation itself\".    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It successfully solved the issue of carrying forward the revolutionary cause, an issue vital for the future destiny of the Party and revolution, on the basis of the consolidated organizational and ideological foundation of the Party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was on October 8, 1997 that leader Kim Jong Il was elected the General Secretary of the WPK according to the unanimous will and desire of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With an unswerving will to carry out the ideas and cause of the President, he authored many works to give answers to theoretical and practical matters arising in developing and strengthening the WPK as the Party of Kim Il Sung forever and in the Party building and activities. Among them are \"The Workers' Party of Korea Is a Juche-Type Revolutionary Party Which Inherited the Glorious Tradition of the 'DIU'\" (October 17, 1982), \"On the Fundamentals of Revolutionary Party Building\" (October 10, 1992), \"Let Us Hold the Great Leader Forever in High Esteem and Accomplish His Cause\" (October 16, 1994) and \"The Workers' Party of Korea Is the Party of the Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung\" (October 2, 1995). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK, the general staff of the Korean revolution and the organizer and guide of all victories, is demonstrating its might as an invincible, powerful and dignified party which is in perfect harmony with the popular mass.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This vividly proves that the United States is the world's biggest nuclear criminal and rogue state destroying and disturbing world peace and security while making free with all the pretty phrases about them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Entirely justifiable is the stand of the DPRK to thwart the U.S. nuclear threat with its nuclear deterrent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is none other than the United States that drove the DPRK to the increase of its nuclear deterrent. Nevertheless, the United States sidestepped the just proposals of the DPRK for a solution to the nuclear problem and only demands that the DPRK scrap its nuclear program first, describing its increase of nuclear deterrent as a threat and challenge to the global community. This discloses its ridiculous intention to completely disarm the DPRK and carry into practice its policy of isolating and stifling the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK does not mind what the United States bluster as its option and cause are just and it does not feel any prick of conscience. It would not neglect its defenses, overawed by what the United States says. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the United States resorts to nuclear threats, totally discarding its obligation to non-nuclear states, the DPRK has a legitimate right to cope with the U.S. moves to stifle it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
