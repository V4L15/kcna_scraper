            "content": "True Colors of U.S. \"Anti-Terrorist War\" Disclosed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 3 (KCNA) -- The \"anti-terrorist war\" by the U.S. imperialists is one of the basic means to stifle anti-imperialist independent countries and achieve their ambition for world domination, says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article.\r\n The article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are now pursuing an appeasement policy toward big countries so as not to aggravate relations with them, but pressurizing and threatening anti-imperialist independent countries with a hard-line policy to overturn them one by one. Here they are attaching foremost importance to the \"anti-terrorist war.\"\r\n The \"anti-terrorist war\" of the U.S. imperialists is the most heinous and mean state terrorism, a war of pillage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Staging the \"anti-terrorist war\", the U.S. considers smear propaganda as one of the basic tricks to find a pretext of aggression. To conduct a smear campaign against anti-imperialist independent countries and stir up the world public for it is a prior process of the U.S. \"anti-terrorist war\" and a prelude to an armed invasion.\r\n Along with false propaganda, forcible inspection of sovereign states is a major factor of the U.S. \"anti-terrorist war\". It is one process of the U.S. \"anti-terrorist war\" to \"prove\" its false data through inspection and put international pressure. \r\n It is another trick of the U.S. \"anti-terrorist war\" to rig up pretexts and conditions for the deployment of the armed forces of aggression and the beginning of military action.\r\n Psychological warfare is one of major U.S. tricks in the \"anti-terrorist war\". The U.S. psychological warfare is a heinous trick for the \"anti-terrorist war\" which paves the way for invasion with words and money instead of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is noticeable in the U.S. \"anti-terrorist war\" is to start a war of aggression against one target while conducting a smear campaign against the next target of aggression. Those countries designated by the Bush administration as an \"axis of evil\" and \"dangerous states\" are the objects of the \"anti-terrorist war\".\r\n In order to frustrate the U.S. \"anti-terrorist war\" it is imperative to have a resolute anti-U.S. and anti-war stand and strengthen national defence power. To strengthen national defence power is the foremost way to foil the U.S. \"anti-terrorist war\" and defend the sovereignty, security and peace of a country.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Struggle for Peace against War Called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 3 (KCNA) -- The United States is getting frantic in its moves to ignite a war against the DPRK in order to stem the trend of the Korean nation's history toward reconciliation and reunification and realize its ambition for domination over the whole of Korea. In order to shatter the vicious moves of the U.S. imperialists for a war of aggression and bring about steady progress of the era of independent reunification, all the Koreans at home and abroad should wage a vigorous struggle under the banner of peace against war.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday says this in a signed article. \r\n Their ambition to invade the DPRK and dominate the whole of Korea remains unchanged and is becoming all the more pronounced than ever before, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. Korea policy is a hostile policy and a criminal policy for a war of aggression.\r\n The U.S. imperialists' moves for a war against the DPRK have always been frantic. Their dangerous and brigandish nature has reached the worst phase since Bush came to power. Since the outset of office his bellicose group has systematically escalated its moves against the DPRK, extremely antagonizing it and listing it as a target of preemptive nuclear attack. The U.S is now persisting in its campaign to do harm to the DPRK and pressurize it while barring the six-party talks from resuming. This is, in fact, aimed at inventing a pretext to provoke a war against the DPRK.\r\n To struggle against the outside forces' moves for aggression and war under the banner of peace against war is a sacred duty of the Korean nation to achieve the independent national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An atmosphere of peace is a prerequisite to independent national reunification.\r\n Dialogue and war exercises can never go together. If ceaseless joint military exercises with foreign forces are allowed to go on in south Korea against fellow countrymen as now, it is impossible to hold north-south dialogue nor is it possible to expect any desired results from the talks to be held by the north and the south in an atmosphere of mutual distrust and confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the habitual method of the U.S. imperialists to chill the ardent desire of the Korean nation for reunification and obstruct the cause of national reunification through the moves for a war against the DPRK. By escalating such provocative war maneuvers on the Korean Peninsula in particular, they seek to deter the north-south relations from favorably improving and keep the movement for national reunification from making progress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation should never allow them to go on with their reckless war exercises to invade the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It declared that south Korea would deal with the issue of Tok Islet in strong terms from the stand of defending the territory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ministry clarified its stand that the Japanese government's behavior is unacceptable, telling the Japanese ambassador in Seoul that the description of Tok Islet in high school textbooks in Japan is a wanton violation of the sovereignty of Korea.\r\n The south Korean ambassador to Japan also lodged a protest with the Japanese Foreign Ministry against this matter on March 31.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It, therefore, can be made right before using. \r\n As its density remains unchanged, it can be kept for a long time. \r\n It is made with raw materials rich in the country and chemicals which are common to be used in local industrial factories.    \r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
