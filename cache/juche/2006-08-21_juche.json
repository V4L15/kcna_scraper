It forces other countries to accept freedom and democracy of American style and puts political and economic pressure upon those countries failing to comply with its demand or unhesitatingly resorts to even military aggression against them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. leaves no means untried. It drives a wedge among various nations, tribes and religious sects to set them against one another and spark political, ethnic and religious disputes. Then it meddles in them under the pretexts of \"mediation\" and \"settlement\" to fish in troubled waters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. releases a \"report on human rights\" each year to pull up other countries over their human rights issues and openly interferes in elections taking place in different countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its interference in the internal affairs of other countries is seriously infringing upon their sovereignty, obstructing the healthy development of nations, gravely violating the principles of justice and impartiality in resolving international issues and posing a big threat to the peace and security of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality proves that to shatter the U.S. interference in the internal affairs of other countries presents itself as a very important and urgent task of the times for ensuring the independent development of countries and world peace and security. Failure to stand firm against the above-said U.S. interference would make it more arrogant and high-handed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world progressive countries and peoples should not tolerate the U.S. arrogant and brigandish meddling in the internal affairs of other countries but resolutely struggle against it. This interference can never work on those countries which set store by their sovereignty. The U.S. moves to meddle in the internal affairs of other countries are bound to fail if all countries take their sovereignty as their life and soul and resolutely struggle to defend it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the countries advocating independence should see through the reactionary nature and danger of the above-mentioned U.S. interference and remain vigilant against it.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun Saturday observes this in a signed commentary carried in connection with the disclosure of the fact that the U.S. forces have conducted bomb-dropping exercises almost every day in the area of their firing range in Maehyang-ri, Hwasong County, Kyonggi Province, since last November, though its closure was formally announced a year ago.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. forces side was compelled to announce the above-said measure in face of the ever-growing protest and denunciation of people from all walks of life including Maehyang-ri inhabitants and fighting organizations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the recent disclosure proved their measure hypocritical. The U.S. imperialist aggression troops have ceaselessly conducted bomb-dropping exercises in Maehyang-ri by deceiving south Koreans with the smokescreen of \"closure.\" Worse still, they are pressurizing the south Korean authorities to offer a land for a new firing range as a substitute for the closed one. This clearly shows what extent the U.S. brazen-faced nature as a suzerain country has reached, while despising and insulting south Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation goes to prove once again that nothing but misfortune can be expected from the U.S. which, keen on meeting its own aggressive interests, is utterly indifferent to the security of south Koreans, to say nothing of their will and wishes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This clearly shows what is the trend in the era of independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The publication of the June 15 joint declaration turned the inter-Korean relations into those of reconciliation and cooperation from those of confrontation and distrust and threw all the leftovers of the past era of confrontation into a dustbin of history. The U.S. forces' presence in south Korea, a typical leftover of the era of the Cold War and confrontation, should be eradicated, first of all, as they are a cancer-like entity standing in the way of the inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no justification for the U.S. forces to remain in south Korea any longer as they are inciting distrust and confrontation between the north and the south and obstructing the reunification of the country in the June 15 era of reunification when national cooperation and unity are growing strong between the north and the south and all the Koreans are aspiring after the peace and reunification of the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation can never make any progress unless the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces are withdrawn from south Korea. This is a lesson taught by the present era of independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The U.S. forces present in south Korea staged large-scale joint military exercises together with the south Korean war-like forces whenever inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation made new progress, thus poisoning the atmosphere of reconciliation and inciting inter-Korean confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n There is neither justification nor pretext whatsoever for the U.S. to keep its aggressor forces in south Korea any longer now that the south Korean people are waging a dynamic struggle for the pullback of the U.S. forces from south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to clearly understand the need of the era and face up to the trend of the times, withdraw its forces from south Korea at an early date and refrain from doing anything obstructive to Korea's reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In December Juche 34 (1945), he merged them into the Aviation Association of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Having been elected the chairman of the association, he energetically led the work for founding the air force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He visited the Pyongyang Institute in mid March 1946, where he said that in order to build a completely independent and sovereign state, it was imperative to have an air force capable of defending the territorial air of the country with honor as well as the ground and naval forces. And he added that an aviation class for training aviators and technical service personnel should be set up at the institute. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He specified the tasks and ways for the management of the aviation class ranging from the political and ideological education, general military education and aeronautical education for the aviation class students to ensuring conditions for practicing aviation.\r\n Under the President's wise leadership and meticulous care, the aviation class of the Pyongyang Institute, the mother body of the air force, produced many competent aviators in a short span of time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Basing himself on this, he organized a regular air force on August 20, 1947, the first of its kind in the Korean history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Young as it was, the Air Force of the Korean People's Army humbled the U.S. imperialists who boasted of being air superiority during the Fatherland Liberation War (1950-1953). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now the ideological and moral traits of the air force of the KPA are good and the standard of its military technique is incomparably high.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
