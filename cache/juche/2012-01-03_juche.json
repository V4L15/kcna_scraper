            "content": "KCNA Commentary Condemns Japan for Rubbing Salt into Wounds of Koreans Stricken with Grief over Greatest Loss\r\nPyongyang, January 3 (KCNA) -- The whole world was in bitter grief at the end of the last year over the demise of leader Kim Jong Il, peerlessly great man produced by mankind and great leader recognized by the world.\n\t\t\t\t\tHeads of state and governments, party leaders, organizations and personages of different countries mourned his demise in humblest reverence and sincerely sympathized and encouraged the Korean people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFormer Prime Minister Koizumi and other officials of Japan sent condolence messages to the DPRK and visited the Korean Hall to express deep condolences over his demise.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Japanese authorities, however, committed unpardonable acts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey officially revealed their hostile stand, saying \"the government has no intention to express condolences\". Worse still, they let loose such balderdash as uttering it was their hope that the great loss the Korean nation suffered would not adversely affect the peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapanese Prime Minister Noda convened a \"security meeting\" on December 19 at which he instructed all the ministries and agencies to strengthen the posture for gathering information about north Korea and keep full readiness. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe government set up a \"Cabinet room for measures\" at the Crisis Management Center of the Residence of the Prime Minister and ordered the \"Self-Defense Forces\" and the Coast Guard Agency to step up the alert posture. He also called for \"examining measures for evacuating Japanese residing in south Korea in the event of contingency.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan, a neighbor, behaved recklessly, betraying its bitterness towards the DPRK at a time when personages of all social standings in the world were mourning the demise of Kim Jong Il in humblest reverence. This glaringly proves in what bitterness towards the DPRK the Japanese politicians were steeped.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Japanese authorities' evil actions found a more striking manifestation in the fact that they desperately blocked the visit to the homeland by the chief vice-chairman of the Central Standing Committee of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) to express condolences before the bier of Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChongryon officials and compatriots, upon hearing the sad news which came like a bolt from the blue, strongly demanded the Japanese authorities allow the mourners delegation of Chongryon headed by the chief vice-chairman to visit the homeland.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was quite natural for the compatriots to take such action as they have revered Kim Jong Il as their father.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe was the outstanding leader of Chongryon and benevolent father who brought happiness to the Koreans in Japan and carved out a future for their younger generation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe was the defender of justice as he led Chongryon as a Juche-based overseas compatriots organization and protected Chongryon and compatriots in Japan from the suppression by the reactionaries within and without Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe was, indeed, the great father of the nation who would be always remembered by Chongryon and compatriots in Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis clearly tells that it was a matter of most elementary ethics for the chief vice-chairman of Chongryon to visit the homeland and express condolences carrying with him the bitter grief of Koreans in Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThat was why many officials and lawmakers of Japan urged the prime minister and the chief Cabinet secretary to allow the visit of the chief vice-chairman.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBut the prime minister and the chief Cabinet secretary objected to all this to the last moment. They claimed it was their policy not to recognize the reentry of the senior most official of Chongryon in case he pays a visit to the homeland to express condolences. This behavior was little short of rubbing salt into the grief-stricken Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was nothing but a base and rude behavior for the Japanese authorities to have blocked the condolatory visit to the homeland by a member of the Korean nation, far from sharing sorrow and sympathy with the neighbor saddened with the great loss.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNevertheless, the Japanese authorities are interpreting this rude behavior as \"an expression of their firm will to settle the pending issues like abduction and the nuclear issue, etc.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Japanese reactionaries have put the DPRK-Japan relations at the lowest ebb, talking for years about the abduction issue which no longer exists and poses no problem. Yet, they are using it as a pretext for hurting the supreme leadership of the DPRK even today when the Korean nation is grieving the great loss. This is unpardonable in any respect.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBy doing so, the Japanese authorities are only beclouding the prospect of the relations between the DPRK and Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was in pursuit of a base purpose that they took the above-said disgusting attitude.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe support rate for the present Cabinet is now rapidly declining in Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Japanese authorities feared that their flexible attitude towards the great loss the Korean nation suffered might cause the support rate for them to further sink. Precisely for this reason the present rulers took a high-handed attitude to meet the interests of the anti-DPRK forces who consider the abduction issue as a lever for keeping themselves alive.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is nothing but a mean and ridiculous behavior of the morally stupid guys who stoop to any infamy to gratify their political greed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is as clear as daylight what miserable end they will meet.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Korean people came to more clearly know about the Japanese political pigmies while experiencing the great loss in bitter grief.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is a tragedy for Japan itself that those ignorant of any elementary ethics and morality and etiquette are administering state affairs, holding power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe army and people of the DPRK will never forgive those who let loose the thrice-cursed vituperations against the Korean people who grieved the great loss to the nation but settle accounts with them to the last."

            "content": "ACNC comenta acciones inmorales de Japon durante el duelo nacional\r\nPyongyang, 3 de enero (ACNC) -- A finales del ano pasado, todo el planeta sumergio en la profunda estela de pesar por el fallecimiento del Dirigente Kim Jong Il, gran hombre nacido de la humanidad y reconocido por el mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\tLos jefes de Estado y gobierno, los lideres de partido, las personalidades de entidades y distintos sectores de muchos paises rindieron los mas sentidos tributos a la memoria del Dirigente y expresaron sinceros consuelos y estimulos al pueblo coreano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTambien en Japon, el ex premier Koizumi y otras personalidades enviaron mensajes de condolencias y visitaron la Casa Coreana para expresar profundo pesame. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, las autoridades japonesas cometieron acciones inmorales ante la nacion coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMostraron oficialmente la posicion hostil de que  \"no tienen previsto expresar condolencias a nivel gubernamental\" y chismearon que \"desean que el duelo nacional de Corea no tenga influencias negativas en la paz y estabilidad de la Peninsula Coreana\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 19 de diciembre, el premier japones Noda convoco la \"reunion de seguridad\" y ordeno a todos los ministerios y agencias intensificar la recogida de informaciones sobre el Norte de Corea y tomar todas las medidas necesarias. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl gobierno instalo la \"sala de medidas del gabinete\" en el centro de control de crisis de la oficina del premier e instruyo a las \"Fuerzas de Autodefensa\" y a la Agencia de Seguridad Maritima mantenerse en el estado de alerta. Y hablo de la \"revision de las medidas necesarias para los japoneses residentes en el suelo surcoreano frente a la situacion emergente\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn aquellos momentos en que las personalidades de distintos estratos de los cinco continentes del mundo expresaban los mas sentidos pesames, Japon actuo asi con tanta hostilidad al pais vecino. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades japonesas impidieron la visita de condolencias a la patria del vicepresidente responsable del Presidium del Comite Central de la Chongryon (Asociacion General de Coreanos Residentes en Japon). \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl recibir la triste noticia sobre el deceso del Dirigente, los funcionarios de la Chongryon y los compatriotas residentes en Japon exigieron fuertemente a las autoridades japonesas permitir la visita a la patria de la delegacion de condolencias de la Chongryon presidida por el vicepresidente responsable. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Dirigente fue destacado lider de la Chongryon, benevolo padre inolvidable de los compatriotas residentes en Japon y defensor de la justicia quien convirtio a la Chongryon como autoctona organizacion de compatriotas en ultramar y defendio esta organizacion y a los coreanos en Japon desde las represiones brutales de los reaccionarios internos y externos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPues, la visita de condolencias de la delegacion de la Chongryon es una cuestion relacionada con la moralidad mas elemental del ser humano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor eso, muchas personalidades japonesas, incluso los diputados, exigieron al premier y al director del secretariado del gabinete permitir esa visita. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, la negaron hasta el final el premier Noda y el jefe del secretariado del gabinete, diciendo que si el maximo cuadro de la Chongryon realiza la visita de condolencias, no reconocerian su reentrada en el pais. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades japonesas describen su actitud tan pueril como \"la expresion de fuerte voluntad de solucionar los problemas pendientes como el de secuestro y el nuclear\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe esta manera, Japon ensombrecio las perspectivas de las relaciones Corea-Japon. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEntonces, ?que objetivo persiguen los gobernantes japoneses?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy dia, en Japon cae en picada el apoyo popular sobre el gabinete actual. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades japonesas piensan que la actitud flexible ante el duelo nacional de Corea reduciria mas el apoyo. De ahi que tomaron actitud intransigente para congraciarse con las fuerzas anti-RPDC que toman el problema de secuestro como su medio de subsistencia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs un proceder tan grosero y villano que pueden cometer solo los politiqueros moralmente inmaduros que no vacilan en cometer cualesquier crimenes para satisfacer su ambicion politica. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el periodo de gran duelo nacional, pudimos conocer mejor a los enanos politicos japoneses. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs una tragedia para Japon el hecho de que el poder esta en manos de los que no tienen ni la mas elemental moralidad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito y el pueblo coreanos no toleraran nunca a los que incurrieron en calumnias y maldades con respecto al duelo nacional, y ajustaran la cuenta final con ellos."
