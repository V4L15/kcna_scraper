            "content": "U.S. Anti-DPRK Vituperation Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 11 (KCNA) -- The U.S. diplomatic boss in a recent radio interview, crying over DPRK's \"nuclear threat,\" threw together the balderdash that north Korea cannot join the international community unless it abandons nuclear weapons.\r\n Categorically refuting this trash, a Rodong Sinmun commentary Monday says the United States is putting up an absurd argument, never stopping tongue-lashing over the \"nuclear issue\" of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The analyst continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is nonsensical for the U.S. to take issue with the \"nuclear threat\" from the DPRK. And linking the DPRK's \"renunciation of nuclear weapons\" with its \"joining the international community\" is contradictory to the nature of the matter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With the DPRK and the U.S. technically at war, no one can tell when the U.S. scheme to make a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK will be carried into action. It was not easy but painstaking for the DPRK to have an access to nuclear weapons while going through manifold difficulties imposed upon it by tightened sanctions and blockade by the enemy. However, the DPRK had no other option but to choose this in order to defend its idea and system, security and sovereignty from the U.S. moves to stifle it with nukes. It was a just defensive step, to all intents and purpose, to defend itself. Herein lies the reason why the DPRK has built its own nuclear deterrent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the United States is turning an unseeing eye to the background and purport of the DPRK's accession to nuclear weapons. Wantonly distorting and exaggerating its nature and truth, the U.S. is trying to mislead public opinion by creating the impression that the DPRK is harboring \"nuclear ambition\" in a bid to brand it as a \"nuclear criminal\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We do not intend to possess nuclear weapons forever. If the U.S. nuclear threat to the DPRK is removed and its hostile policy to \"bring down the system\" of the latter is withdrawn, not a single nuclear weapon will be needed to the latter. Since the DPRK has been compelled to possess nuclear weapons by the increasing nuclear threat from the U.S., it is quite logical that the U.S. nuclear threat to the DPRK and its hostile policy toward the latter must be retracted, if the nuclear issue is to be settled. This is the pivotal point and the main key to the settlement of the nuclear issue.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Only when the principle of national independence is firmly maintained is it possible to correctly solve the national problem and successfully shape the destiny of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National independence is also the lifeline in accomplishing the cause of the reunification of the country. Apart from it no one can talk about the reunification of the country or think of the common prosperity of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the Koreans join efforts, they can well achieve the reunification of the country and national prosperity and there will be nothing out of their reach. Unshakable is the will of the Koreans to steadily advance toward independence under any condition with the faith that reunification and prosperity can be achieved by national independence.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This politico-ideological might of the Korean revolution has become a main source of winning steady victory in Korean-style socialism despite any storm and stress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun revolutionary leadership of Kim Jong Il is a decisive factor of augmenting the politico-ideological might of the Korean revolution in every way as required by the era of Songun. \r\n The headquarters of the revolution is the very core of the single-minded unity and it is a sure guarantee for glorifying Korean-style socialism to devotedly protect it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To devotedly defend the headquarters of the revolution serves as a slogan for practice and action for the servicepersons and people in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The politico-ideological might of the revolutionary ranks is being fully displayed by all the servicepersons and people in implementing the Party's line and policies in a do-or-die spirit in hearty response to its call. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This might represents strong revolutionary enthusiasm and creative ingenuity displayed by broad masses in carrying through the line and policies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This might also finds a vivid manifestation in the fact that all members of the society are working, helping and leading each other forward on the basis of collectivism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are united close on the basis of revolutionary comradeship, helping and leading each other forward in a big family whose members hold Kim Jong Il in high esteem as their father.

Ample experience and exploits were gained and the idea on equality between sexes was formulated in the \"Ten-point Programme of the Association for the Restoration of the Fatherland\" during the anti-Japanese armed struggle. And the \"Law on Sex Equality in North Korea\" was promulgated on June 30, Juche 35 (1946). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The adoption of the first constitution of the DPRK in 1948 and the \"Socialist Constitution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea\" in 1972 laid a solid legal foundation of sex equality and enabled the Korean women fully exercise their rights to independence and enjoy free state and social activities on an equal footing with men. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A lot of women have occupied important positions of the Party and government bodies. Women accounted for 20.1 percent of the deputies to the Supreme People's Assembly as of September 2003. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Having obtained a high degree of knowledge through over ten years of schooling, all the women participate in the independent and creative working life, giving full play to their talents in making social wealth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In particular, more than 42 percent of the country's experts and technicians are women. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many women have made a great contribution to the development of science and technology and demonstrated the dignity and honor of the nation. Among them are Prof. and Dr. Kang Hui Ho, Dr. Hyon Yong Ra, \"World Table-tennis Queen\" Pak Yong Sun, \"Marathon Queen\" Jong Song Ok, WBCF champions Kim Kwang Ok, Ryu Myong Ok and Choe Un Sun and prize winner in the international concours \"Art of the 21st Century\" (piano) Yun Jin Bok. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over the last five decades, hundreds of women have been awarded the title of the Hero of the DPRK and Labor Hero for their distinguished service for the prosperity of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In an interview with KCNA on the occasion of the \"World Population Day\" (July 11), Kang Nam Il, director of the Population Research Institute, said the role of the women in the DPRK will become greater as days go by to further promote the social development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year's theme is \"equality\".    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Blasts U.S. New Move for Sanctions against DPRK\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 11 (KCNA) -- The U.S. recently launched one more offensive for sanctions against some economic institutions in the DPRK allegedly on suspicion of their involvement in proliferating weapons of mass destruction (WMD).\r\n By the president's administrative order the U.S. announced its plan to apply sanctions against companies of different countries including three economic companies of the DPRK, which it claims involved in the \"plan for the development of WMD\", and companies of other countries which have business relations with those companies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard the U.S. Department of Treasury said it would open to the public the charges against the enterprises which have had deals with the north Korean companies in question and names of those enterprises. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is preposterous for the U.S. to fault ordinary economic institutions in the DPRK which have nothing to do with the proliferation of WMD and charge them with the manufacture, purchase, possession and development of materials related to WMD and their spread and of the missiles that can be used as delivery means for WMD. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through this move the U.S. seeks to cause enterprises in the DPRK suffer much from future foreign trade in a bid to block its way of earning foreign currency. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a foolish attempt to bar the inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation and legitimate economic dealings with other countries with an eye to economically isolating and stifling the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. economic sanctions are part of its policy of interference and blockade against other countries. U.S. sanctions and economic blockade against the DPRK, in particular, have persisted for the last decades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dozens of acts are now in force in the U.S. for imposing economic sanctions and blockade against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The laws enacted by the successive U.S. Congresses labeled any government of a country subject to sanctions as a \"criminal government that violated international law\" and this entailed a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S sanctions against the DPRK have become more persistent and stringent since the outset of the new century.  It can not but draw attention to the fact that Washington has not made any slight retreat or concession as regards the economic sanctions against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is pointing an accusing finger at the principal dialogue partner at the six-way talks at a time when the international community wishes to see the Korean Peninsula denuclearized through the talks in an atmosphere of confidence and stability. This behavior cannot be interpreted otherwise than a departure from the elementary morality and ethics between states. \r\n The DPRK has exercised patience and shown utmost prudence in the relations with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Explicitly speaking, the U.S. new measure for economic sanctions against the DPRK will not help settle the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. but touch off bitterer hostility against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should bear in mind that the DPRK has never been deterred by any \"pressure\" as it is an independent sovereign state.\r\n Sanctions will get the U.S. nowhere.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
