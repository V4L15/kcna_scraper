The election was a historic event of weighty importance in increasing the nation's defense capabilities and accomplishing the cause of army building. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Jong Il set forth the idea that national defense is immediately the lifeline of the revolution and the destiny of the country and victory of socialism are guaranteed by arms and a unique idea that the army precisely means the party, the state and the people. He put forward national defense-first politics and army-first politics as the basic mode of state politics and set a brilliant example of army-first leadership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Today all the officers and men of the KPA, entertaining unquestioned worship for their leader, are devotedly defending the headquarters of the revolution led by Kim Jong Il and fully preparing themselves to be the first line guards and the first line death-defying corps who unfailingly carry out his orders and instructions through thick and thin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is under his distinguished army-first revolutionary leadership that the defense line of the country has been consolidated as strong as an iron wall, the monolithic unity of the revolutionary ranks strengthened as firm as a rock and a breakthrough made in socialist economic construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people and army have won one victory after another in the fierce confrontation with the imperialists and brought a new leap forward and progress in socialist construction. This historic miracle is a resounding victory of the army-first politics of the WPK and the precious fruition of his outstanding and seasoned guidance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. and their followers intensify as never before their vicious campaign to stifle the DPRK, a resolute defender of the socialist banner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   No force on earth can be a match for the revolutionary armed forces that have grown under the guidance of the three commanders of Mt. Paektu and there is no limit to their striking power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the imperialist aggressors dare to trespass on the inviolable land, sky and seas of the country even 0.001 mm, the KPA will annihilate the enemies and blow up their bulwark with merciless strikes and accomplish the historic cause of national reunification through a just war. \r\n\r\n"
