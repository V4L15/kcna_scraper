In other words, the Japanese government authorities \r\nmanipulated the rightwing reactionaries to make such \r\nutterances  denying the criminal case which they wanted to \r\nsay but could not for fear of condemnation from the people \r\nat home and abroad.\r\n   The Japanese government is to blame for  the above-\r\nmentioned developments.\r\n   If the Japanese authorities are concerned about the \r\ninterests of their country and people, they should not try \r\nto relapse into misconduct, but honestly admit the past \r\ncrimes, including the \"comfort women\" issue and make an \r\napology and compensation for them. \r\n\r\n"
