General of the Korean People's Army Kim Yong Chol. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Several pending issues arising in the military field including the issue of defusing military confrontation and tension and providing military guarantees for north-south cooperation and exchange were placed on the agenda of the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The head of the north side's delegation speaking at the talks referred to the lessons to be drawn from the north-south military relations in the past which underwent repeated suspension and resumption. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If one side closes the door of dialogue, quite contrary to the desire of the nation and away from the stand of attaching importance to the nation, this will mean blocking the way of easing the military tension, he said, underscoring the need to settle all the inter-Korean military issues on the principle of putting the interests of the nation above all and protecting it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Should one side fail to respond to the fair and aboveboard principles and proposals that had been advanced and implement the military agreements already reached to save its face, this will make the north-south dialogue meaningless and entail very serious consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the principled stand of the north side on the tasks to be settled at the talks, he said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Firstly, both sides should decide on the issues of preventing clashes in the West Sea of Korea and realizing joint fishing there as early as possible as they had already been taken up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Secondly, both sides should take military measures, keeping pace with the reenergized inter-Korean economic cooperation and exchange. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thirdly, both sides should take measures to thoroughly implement the military agreements already adopted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A chief delegate of the south side spoke next. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The talks continue.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- The south Korean Internet magazine \"Trend of Situation\" on May 2 carried an article contributed by Jon Yong Ho, permanent researcher of the south Korean Institute for Civic Rights Studies in which he praised the line of economic construction of the Workers' Party of Korea in the era of Songun under the title \"Economic Strategy of Kim Jong Il, chairman of the National Defence Commission, in the 21st Century.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article stressed that the building of an economic power stepped up by the DPRK in all fields despite the evermore undisguised U.S. hostile policy toward it is possible thanks to the Songun politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is following the policy of attaching importance to the national defence industry because it serves as a basis for providing a material guarantee for armed forces for self-defence given the reality in which the DPRK is standing in acute military confrontation with the U.S., the article noted, proving the justice of the line of economic construction in the era of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's stand of maintaining the line of building an independent national economy is right, the article said, adding: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The line of economic construction in the era of Songun is characterized by the fact that it makes it possible to develop economy in a diversified and comprehensive manner. The socialist independent economy in the north aims at satisfying the demands of the country and people, instead of earning money. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il put forward the People's Army as a main force of the revolution and has led the nation to accelerate the building of an economic power by encouraging the whole society to learn from the revolutionary spirit of the army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the goal to build an economic power is attained, it will be possible to bring the people a happy and stable life as desired by Kim Jong Il and, at the same time, make great progress in achieving common prosperity of Northeast Asia and in the efforts to accomplish the cause of national reunification. In the future the north's economy will develop its own way on the principle of Songun quite different from a capitalist mode.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
