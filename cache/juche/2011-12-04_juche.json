Korean Authorities' Rhetoric about \"Flexibility of North Policy\" under Fire\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPyongyang, December 4 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea Sunday gave the following answer to the question put by KCNA as regards the south Korean authorities' intensified moves for confrontation and war behind the scene of \"flexibility of north policy\": \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean conservative authorities have recently vociferated about \"flexibility of north policy\" in a bid to give impression that they are interested in the improvement of the north-south relations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey said that the flexibility is to \"ease the inter-Korean relations and defuse the tension\" and that they expect that \"the north would positively respond to their sincere efforts\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is shameless and deceptive sophism and intolerable mockery and insult to the south Korean people and all other fellow countrymen hoping for the north-south dialogue and improvement of the relations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTheir talk about the \"flexibility of north policy\" is an empty talk, and nothing has changed in their confrontation policy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey have become all the more intent on the anti-DPRK smear campaign and war moves, persistently finding fault with the nuclear issue and \"Cheonan\" warship and Yonphyong Island shelling cases. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey have kicked up together with outside forces anti-DPRK campaign over the nuclear issue while standing in the way of resuming the six-party talks for the peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula. They are driving the situation to the extreme phase while working with blood-shot eyes to make military provocations against the north. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is none other than the puppet Ministry of Unification that has desperately checked the contacts, exchanges and cooperation between NGOs of the north and the south including organizations for implementing the June 15 joint declaration and meddled in the humanitarian projects under the pretence of \"May 24 measures\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTheir anti-DPRK campaign over the human rights issue and sinister daydream of confrontation of systems have reached the reckless phase. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNot content with their rhetoric about the theory of \"defending principles\" at home, they noisily advocated this theory outside. They unhesitatingly let loose confrontation remarks that they would not opt for improvement of inter-Korean relations unless there is a change in the north's attitude. It is ridiculous for them to talk about the flexibility. Their shamelessness shocked everyone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is quite natural that the south Korean people from all walks of life and public opinion at home and abroad strongly demand a switchover in their confrontation policy denouncing the deceptiveness of their talk about the flexibility. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe \"flexibility of north policy\" touted by the puppet group is nothing but hypocrisy to cover up their purpose for confrontation. It is also rhetoric aimed to convince the public that they are interested in the improvement of the north-south relations, divert public criticism and tide over ruling crisis. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll facts show that for the wagon of the \"north policy\" to take right path it is prerequisite to replace the carter, not just horse.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe true colors of the \"flexibility\" have been brought to light. The puppet group is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can deceive the public and mislead the opinion with such foolish and ridiculous trick.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo matter how desperately the puppet group may cling to the threadbare confrontation policy behind the smokescreen of \"flexibility\" it will get them nowhere. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt should clearly understand that it can neither expect improved north-south relations nor save its destiny unless it makes a fundamental change in its confrontation attitude to the DPRK."
