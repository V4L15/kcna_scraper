Korea Demanded \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 15 (KCNA) -- The South Headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification reportedly made public a statement \"Let us put an end to the U.S. forces' 61-year-long unjust presence in south Korea and their war moves and launch an all-out struggle for their withdrawal\" on Sept. 8.\r\n The statement recalled that the history of division of the country and the nation started 61 years ago as the U.S. troops landed in south Korea for aggression and plunder. They have imposed immeasurable misfortune and pain upon the Korean people, it said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is still keen on reinforcing its military \"alliance\" with south Korea and intensifying provocative actions for a nuclear war against the north, interference in internal affairs of Korea and the moves to perpetuate the division of the Korean nation. National independence, peaceful reunification and national prosperity can never be achieved as long as the U.S. troops remain in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The struggle for the withdrawal of the U.S. troops is a starting point in the movement for peace and reunification of the Korean Peninsula. All Koreans should turn out in the patriotic movement for independent reunification, peace against war and great national unity and frustrate the U.S. war moves through a massive anti-U.S. struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the same day, the chairperson of the National Council of Girl Student Representatives and the chairman of the south Korean Federation of University Student Councils separately issued statements calling for driving the U.S. troops out of south Korea and building an independent reunified country at an early date.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S. imperialists are strongly opposed to the efforts of the north and the south to achieve independent reunification through reconciliation and cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The pro-U.S. forces in south Korea, however, are clinging to the U.S. apron-strings, not yet away from their illusion about the U.S., the aggressor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities are destroying the very foundation for the development of inter-Korean relations by toeing the U.S. hostile policy toward the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The cooperation with the outside forces precisely means the negation of the historic June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is preposterous to say something about the improvement of the inter-Korean relations now that the joint declaration is openly disregarded. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The cooperation with the outside forces is driving the inter-Korean relations to an uncontrollable catastrophe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists have reached the worst phase in their criminal moves to harm and invade the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Korea, prodded by the outside forces, is joining in the racket to put international pressure upon the north and backing those forces in the sanctions against it, quite contrary to the interests of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The cooperation with the outside forces leads to inter-Korean confrontation and war against the north.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
