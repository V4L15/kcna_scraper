It is expressive of the pride of the Korean nation who has created the world's most civilized morality and culture that originated from the Taedonggang culture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean nation is the strongest in the world  in terms of spirit and morality, custom, emotion and wisdom and rare in courage and will,  unity and creativity. It is the strongest in the world because it loves justice and truth and hates injustice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The superiority of the nation lies in the greatness of the leader. President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il are the great fathers of the Korean nation who firmly preserved and developed the national identity in the whole period of the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is necessary to more firmly preserve the character of the Korean nation in face of the moves of the imperialists for \"globalization.\" It is also necessary to have strong faith and will, great courage and high national pride and always live and struggle, optimistic about the distant future of the nation by learning from Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, incarnations of the national character. This is the only way of giving fuller play to the national character and national spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The national character of the Korean people is excellent, pure and strong because its core is the revolutionary outlook on the leader. Based on absolute trust and loyalty to the leader, Kim Il Sung's nation is demonstrating its most distinguished and best identity everywhere. The Korean people, who  created this best national character for the first time in human history, will always regard it as their flesh and blood and soul and glorify the nation as the most proud one in the world in this noble spirit. \r\n\r\n"

This was the most hideous kidnapping of foreigners in history. Yet, Japan has neither admitted this crime nor apologized and compensated for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Nevertheless, Japan is trying hard to link the DPRK with some of the kidnapping and missing cases in Japan in a bid to charge it with \"kidnapping\" without any evidence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Obviously, kidnapping is a serious problem in Japan. This is clearly evidenced by the recent kidnapping of a foreigner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kidnapping is so rampant in Japan that even foreigners are frequently abducted there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan had better stop vociferating about the DPRK's non-existent \"issue of kidnapping\" in vain and focus on resolving its serious issue of kidnapping. \r\n\r\n"
