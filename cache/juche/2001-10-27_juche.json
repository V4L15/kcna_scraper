            "content": "Japan's escalated moves for overseas aggression under fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 27 (KCNA) -- The Japanese reactionaries' bid to revise the \"Law on Cooperation in UN Peace-Keeping Activities\" is not aimed to solve issues of international disputes and peace but prompted by their foul intention to use their participation in the \"UN Peacekeeping Operation\" as a legal pretext to invade other countries any time, says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article.\r\n This indicates that the Japanese reactionaries have become ever more undisguised in their moves for overseas aggression under the pretext of \"international contribution\" and they have entered a very dangerous phase, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The international community welcomes Japan's economic cooperation with other countries, but opposes with high alertness its moves to dispatch its forces abroad for military actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is ridiculous is that the Japanese reactionaries are working hard to revise the law under the pretence that \"SDF\" would participate in \"peacekeeping activities\" to be required right after the conclusion of the war in Afghanistan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is by no means an accidental coincidence that the keynote of the amendment to the \"Law on Cooperation in UN Peacekeeping Activities\" was set out by the Japanese reactionaries in the wake of the passage of the \"bill on supporting anti-terror measures\" through the house of representatives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarists' overseas aggression has rapidly entered a practical phase.\r\n With no trick can the Japanese reactionaries cover up their dream of overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This aggression, too, will lead them to self-destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are well advised to face up to the reality today and stop acting rashly.    \r\n\r\n"
