It is, in essence, aimed to destroy \"Jongyojo\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What is all the more intolerable is that they are going to block teachers at all levels from joining \"Jongyojo\" by forming a government-sponsored teachers organization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is an intolerable challenge to the South Korean teachers who have waged a bloody struggle for the legalization of the existence and activities of their organization for more than a decade, commanding support and encouragement from broad pro-democracy forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities are well advised to drop the fascist plot to disorganize and destroy \"Jongyojo\" and fully guarantee the freedom of all its activities including the right to trade union activities. \r\n\r\n"

Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The might of Juche Korea where the entire party, the whole army and all the people are united in one mind, is more powerful than atomic bombs. What will the U.S. get if it pounces upon this country? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. hard-line conservative forces should know the declaration of Juche Korea that if a war is imposed upon it, it will not miss the opportunity to wipe out aggressors is not a mere advertisement. And they should see its war capacity and the changed situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There is no guarantee for the safety of the U.S. mainland when the U.S. ignites a war against the north in the Korean  peninsula and the war will stigmatize the U.S. as a nuclear war criminal and bury it in the cesspool of history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is not without reason that news analysts said a war in the Korean peninsula will build a strong anti-U.S. front in Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. bellicose circles should see the realities squarely and immediately stop their criminal moves to provoke a war in the Korean peninsula and give up their ambition to swallow up Juche Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It will be a right option in the interests of the U.S. to take the road of relaxation, not DPRK-U.S. confrontation, and do its best for the improvement of DPRK-U.S. relations. \r\n\r\n"

We do not threaten the United States but the latter with huge nuclear weapons and long-range missiles threatens the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Its assertion is seeking to disarm the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States is cunningly attempting to shift the blame for the non-fulfillment of the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework on to us and, furthermore, abrogate it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We have already made it clear that we do not want to consider the United States as the sworn enemy but will develop relations with it on the principle of equality and mutual benefit if it recognizes our sovereignty and freedom of option and approaches us with good faith. This is the DPRK's principled stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The point rests with the attitude of the U.S., not with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We will continue strengthening self-reliant defence capabilities as long as the U.S. military threat upon us continues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We do not have lingering attachment to the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework. To make matters worse, the United States is trying to abrogate the agreed framework. If it is abrogated, the DPRK and the U.S. may go their own way. \r\n\r\n"

This is the main result of the strenuous efforts made to model the whole party on the Juche idea in the last 25 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The editorial underscores the need to strengthen the WPK and enhance its leadership role in every way, holding higher the banner of modeling the whole party on the Juche idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We should build more firmly the wpk into a vanguard of loyalists who uphold the ideology and leadership of Kim Jong Il in good faith and devotedly defend him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  No matter what trials we may confront and no matter how complicated the situation may be we should remain rallied more firmly around Kim Jong Il in mind and purpose and in the sense of moral obligation. \r\n\r\n"

It is the greatest feat the respected Kim Jong Il has performed under the banner of modeling the whole party on the Juche idea and a most striking manifestation of the loyalty and the sense of moral obligation to be expressed by communists toward the preceding leader that he has built the WPK into the party of the great leader Kim Il Sung which shines with his august name and revolutionary history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The WPK has grown to be a militant, dynamic and strong party in which the leader's ideological system and the leadership system have been firmly established, unshakable unity has been attained on the basis of strong sense of organization and discipline and which forms an integral whole with the popular masses.  This is the real picture of the ever-victorious WPK, a revolutionary one of Juche type that has grown strong and developed under the banner of modeling the whole party on the Juche idea, provided by Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All party members, servicemen of the people's army and the people should firmly arm themselves with the ideas and theories of Kim Jong Il and become absolute worshippers, resolute defenders and faithful implementers of his line and policies so as to actively contribute to building and developing the party, the army and the government as well as the economy and culture in conformity with the idea and intention of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The meeting was attended by senior party and state officials, including Han Song Ryong, Ri Yong Mu and Choe Thae Bok. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
