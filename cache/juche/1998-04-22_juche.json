Thaebaek area as a secret bombing training field, Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation reported.\r\n   The spokesman said:\r\n   Prompted by the United States, the South Korean authorities built the training field in the area covering about two million phyong in and around Nyongwol county, South Korean Kangwon Province, and allowed it to be used by the U.S. Pacific Air Force.    They also take charge of the management of the field and such danperous follow-up work as putting out of forest fire and removal of unexploded bombs after trainings.\r\n   To the training field, which is called the second or third largest point of strategic importance in the world, strategic bombers belonging to the U.S. Pacific Air Force have flown from Guam, Okinawa, Yokosuka and other areas several times every week from the beginning of the 1980s for firing and bombing exercises. As a result, forests, ecological environment and cultural relics in the area have been destroyed. Damage by unexploded bombs is also terrible.\r\n   The United States must promptly abolish the training field and all other military bases in South Korea and withdraw its troops.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
