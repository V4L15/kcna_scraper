Korea's \"NSL\" must be abolished\r\nPyongyang, March 16 (KCNA) -- The upper echelons of the South Korean political camp have said it is still too soon to abolish the \"National Security Law\" (NSL).\r\n   Commenting on their assertion, Rodong Sinmun today says the anti-nation, anti-democracy and anti-reunification fascist law must be scrapped unconditionally in any case.\r\n   The daily says:\r\n   We regret that even the man who suffered from the evil law in the past is now reluctant to remove it, oblivious of his sufferings, and is finding fault with our criminal law which has nothing to do with inter-Korean relations.\r\n   He, who called more than once for the abolition of the fascist law, a legacy of the successive dictators, is refusing to repeal it with our criminal law as the reason to keep on it. Such an act is really a self-contradiction.\r\n   We maintain once again that if South Korea wants to be our independent dialogue partner, it should not hesitate to replace the anti-north confrontation policy with a pro-north reconciliation policy in the spirit of national independence.\r\n   The South Korean ruling circles had better refrain from following in the footsteps of the \"civilian\" dictators.    \r\n     \r\n\r\n"

This is the banner of struggle and advance which our people should hold high.\r\n   All the party members and other working people should bear deep in their mind the intention of  General, who kindled the flame of a fresh great upsurge, and advance like the wind with spurs put on Chollima and thus demonstrate the invincible might of Korean-style socialism all over the world.\r\n   The signal fire lighted by the general at the Songjin Steel Complex will lead to a new advance and final victory. \r\n   His on-site guidance to the complex is a historic event which has started such a great upswing as was made in the '50s.\r\n   The Korean people see the image of the fatherly leader President Kim Il Sung in the great leadership traits of the General. They are convinced that only when they dynamically advance in response to his call can they make a fresh upswing in socialist economic construction as in the '50s.\r\n   The signal fire lighted at the Songjin Steel Complex will lead to the final victory.\r\n   When the flame of the great upsurge spreads throughout the country, a decisive victory will be won in the forced march of socialism.    \r\n \r\n\r\n"

The absence of the Soviet Union, a permanent member nation at that time, means there was not a unanimous approval of the permanent member nations.\r\n   The \"UN Command\" in South Korea is a U.S. product of the Cold War. \r\n   The UN Secretary General in a letter to the DPRK Foreign Minister on June 24, 1994 clarified that the \"UN Command\" was organized by the United States, not by the UN Security Council as a subsidiary organ under its control.\r\n   The United States should not attempt to legitimate the existence of the \"UN Command\" by submitting a report of the command to the UN Security Council every year but dissolve it.\r\n   The United Nations should call in question the \"resolution 84\" and the use of the UN Flag by the U.S. Forces Command in South Korea and correct them.\r\n   We expect that the UN member nations will pay deep attention to dissolving the \"UN Command\" in South Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
