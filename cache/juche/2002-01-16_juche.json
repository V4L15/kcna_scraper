As a result, the political structure of the world has begun gradually turning into a multi-polar structure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. remains the main target of the struggle for the global independence in the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has persistently pursued its strong-arm strategy to dominate the world by taking advantage of its strategic position unchallenged in the west. \r\n That is why it has long been the main target of the struggle of the anti-imperialist forces for independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the emergence of the bellicose bush administration the attitude of the U.S. challenging the efforts for multi-polar world and independence of humankind has become more arrogant and reckless than ever before. The U.S. can never stem the trend of the times nor block its development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seeks to set up a monopolistic international order of domination and plunder as well as unlimited expansion of market through \"globalization,\" but the moves are bound to meet fiasco. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the trite method of the imperialists to find a way out of crisis in aggression and war. The moves of the U.S. imperialists are getting all the more pronounced in reckless state terrorism and war of aggression on the plea of \"combating terrorism.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people strongly desire to remain a dignified  independent people, not slaves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Leader Kim Jong Il's idea of attaching importance to military affairs, army-based policy, is the best and most correct revolutionary idea and political mode that reflect the changed international circumstances and the requirements of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea and policy that enjoy the support of the world are an all-powerful treasured sword that makes it possible to turn misfortune into a blessing. They are a sure guarantee for the accomplishment of the cause of global independence.    \r\n\r\n"

This is attributable to the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK and its military presence in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is to totally blame for the hard-won atmosphere of peace and reunification waning and the tensions increasing from the onset of the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The showdown between the DPRK and the U.S. and the north-south confrontation can never be defused nor can peace on the Korean peninsula and global peace and security be guaranteed unless the U.S. drops its hostile policy towards the DPRK and pulls its forces out of South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is neither reason nor justification for the U.S. to keep its forces in South Korea any longer now that the cold war era is over and the world greeted a new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. persistent insistence on its forces' continued presence in South Korea would only more saliently reveal its true colours as the enemy of peace and invite international isolation and self-destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to face up to the trend of the times towards independence in the new century and properly understand the mindset of the world people, drop its hostile policy towards the DPRK at an early date and pull its forces out of South Korea.    \r\n\r\n"
