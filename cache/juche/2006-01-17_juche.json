            "content": "U.S. Chiefly Accountable for Having Totally Scrapped DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 16 (KCNA) -- The United States can never evade its responsibility for having totally scrapped the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework (AF) and delayed the settlement of the nuclear issue in a deliberate manner.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday observes this in a signed commentary. It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some officials are spreading misinformation that the DPRK is to blame for the end of the unsuccessful construction of the light water reactors (LWRs), while demanding it \"compensate\" for this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The main spirit of the AF called on both sides to respect each other's sovereignty and create reconciliation and trust in order to put an end to the hostile relations between them and, furthermore, ensure peace and security in the Korean Peninsula and other parts of Asia-Pacific and the rest of the world.\r\n The LWR project, a key point of the AF, was considered to be a guarantee for terminating the hostile relations between the DPRK and the U.S. and finding a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. Under the AF the U.S. was committed to providing two LWRs to the DPRK by the year 2003 in return for the latter's freeze of nuclear facilities and supplying 500,000 tons of heavy fuel oil to it every year till their construction is completed. The U.S. also gave the DPRK assurances that it would not threaten the latter with nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., however, has not fulfilled any commitment under the AF. The Bush administration categorically refused to implement the AF and has systematically perpetrated premeditated acts of totally scrapping official documents signed between the DPRK and the U.S., unreasonably asserting that a series of agreements including the AF signed by the preceding regime with the DPRK are \"beneficial\" to it only, while being harmful to the U.S. interests and prestige. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite nonsensical for some politicians to urge the DPRK to \"compensate\" for the unsuccessful end of the LWR construction in stead of holding the U.S. chiefly accountable for the abrogation of the AF. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the DPRK that has to claim compensation for the loss caused by the suspension of the LWR project. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whoever is concerned about the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula should properly know who stands for the denuclearization of the peninsula and who persistently blocks it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The line and policies strengthening the revolutionary army into an invincible army and making revolutionary ranks an elite one with it as the main force, giving priority to the development of national defence industry while simultaneously developing light industry and agriculture and opening a new history of Songun revolutionary culture are the banner of struggle guaranteeing a victorious advance for building a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the staunch policy and stand of the Party to counter the aggressive moves of the U.S. imperialists and reactionaries with a merciless military strike, their vicious offensive to isolate and stifle the DPRK with revolutionary economic strategy and their despicable psychological warfare with a powerful ideological battle. The policy and stand instill the conviction of victory into the army and people of Korea all out in building a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The line and policies of the Party for building a great prosperous powerful nation serve as an invincible weapon based on the revolutionary zeal and creative power of the army and the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the great pride of the Party to have such army and people who have unchangeable confidence in the justness and victory of the socialist cause, revolutionary optimism that they break through trials, always cheerful although their path is thorny and the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance that they create something out of nothing and faith can move even a mountain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The signal successes in all fields of politics, military affairs, economy and culture and the might of the DPRK as a powerful country of Songun clearly prove how just and viable the revolutionary line and policies of the Party are, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

All the crimes of the U.S. imperialists who have infringed upon the sovereignty and democracy of the south Korean people and inflicted all sorts of misfortune and disaster upon them while instigating the fascist dictatorial regimes to confrontation and war with the north during their 60 odd-year long occupation of south Korea should be settled without fail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The drive for the settlement of the past is a struggle to settle accounts with all the crimes the successive fascist dictators and traitors related to the \"Grand National Party\" have committed following the evil habit of flunkeyism, treachery and fascist dictatorship against reunification.\r\n The crimes committed by those traitors from the Syngman Rhee regime framed up by the U.S. imperialists in south Korea right after Aug. 15 liberation of Korea, the \"Yusin\" dictatorial regime, the fifth and the sixth republics to the \"civilian government\" were anti-people, anti-national and anti-reunification treacheries which can never be pardoned. The repetition of the past can never be checked unless the wrong past is liquidated. \r\n The drive for the settlement of the past in south Korea is one to ostracize the GNP, a traitorous political party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is impossible to realize the long-cherished desire of the south Koreans to liquidate the fascist dictatorship and materialize democratic politics as long as the GNP, the descendent of the successive traitorous regimes that had committed all sorts of anti-people and anti-national crimes, regarding flunkeyism, treachery, fascism and division as their way of existence, is left intact. If the GNP comes to power in south Korea it would be impossible to check the repetition of such a medieval age of darkness as that of \"Yusin\" dictatorship, much less expecting any progress in the movement for national reunification.\r\n All the parties, factions and people of all social standings in south Korea desirous of progress, patriotism and reunification should closely unite and solidarize to wage a joint struggle and take a joint action for the settlement of the past to the last and thus build an independent and democratic new society free from domination, treachery and fascism in south Korea without fail.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Paektu in the leadership over the youth movement took place at the April 25 House of Culture Monday on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the foundation of the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League. \r\n Presented at the seminar were six papers that made a profound scientific and theoretical explanation of the undying leadership exploits performed by the three generals of Mt. Paektu in pioneering, strengthening and developing the Korean youth movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The floor was taken by Kim Kyong Ho, first secretary of the Central Committee of the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League, anti-Japanese revolutionary fighter Kim Ok Sun, Kim Jong Suk, editor-in-chief of Minju Joson, Kim Yong Sik, first secretary of the Committee of the Korean People's Army of the Youth League, and others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Speakers at the seminar noted that President Kim Il Sung who established the glorious tradition of the Juche-oriented youth movement in the period of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle laid down the line of building the popular and monolithic youth organization even under so difficult and complicated situation right after the liberation of Korea and proclaimed the foundation of the Democratic Youth League to the world on January 17, Juche 35 (1946). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that Kim Il Sung gave a genuine origin to the Juche-oriented youth movement, set an example of world historic significance in building revolutionary youth organizations and strengthened and developed the youth league to be an organization intensely loyal to the Party and the revolutionary cause, they stressed that his revolutionary exploits would  shine forever. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They explained the immortal leadership feats Kim Jong Il has performed by putting up the slogan \"Love the Youth!\" and placing the work of the youth league on a new higher stage as required by the developing revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pointing out that Kim Jong Il was the first in history to formulate the idea and theory of the youth movement based on the revolutionary outlook on the leader, they noted that he made sure that the youth league was renamed the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League and has strengthened and developed it into the youth organization of the President, the reliable ranks of members of the young vanguard of Songun by providing wise leadership and showing profound care for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The path of victory and glory covered by the youth league is closely associated with the undying exploits performed by anti-Japanese war hero Kim Jong Suk who performed distinguished feats in establishing the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Korean youth movement and energetically led the work of the youth league after liberation, they added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They called upon all the officials of the youth league and other young people to resolutely uphold and glorify the undying exploits performed by the three generals of Mt. Paektu in developing the Korean youth movement and accomplish generation after generation the revolutionary cause of Juche that started in the Paektu forest, true to the Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present at the seminar were Kim Jung Rin, secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, participants in the celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the youth league and members of the delegation of Korean youths and students in Japan and the delegation of the Youth Federation of Korean Nationals in China.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And monumental edifices including the Taean Friendship Glass Factory and Paekma-Cholsan Waterway have been built in different parts of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In particular, last year witnessed greater successes than those in the recent few years in the field of economic construction. This eloquently proves the fact that the realization of his intention of building a great prosperous powerful nation is not a matter of the distant future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK, who have laid a solid foundation for the building of a great prosperous powerful nation and won only victory under the Songun revolutionary leadership of Kim Jong Il, took a big step toward greater victory this year.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
