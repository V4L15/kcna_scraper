This has been continued till now due to the Japanese army's sexual assaults on Korean and other Asian women during the second world war and Japan's failure to fully redress its past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese authorities are seriously mistaken if they think they can play down Japan's extra-large crimes in the past and get them buried into oblivion in history with such artifices as \"civilian fund\" and \"letter of apology.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He strongly demanded the Japanese authorities comprehensively investigate and make public the truth about human and material losses Japan inflicted upon the Korean people in the past, punish those responsible for them and make a state apology and compensation for its past at an early date.    \r\n\r\n"

Ishihara scornfully called the DPRK \"Hokusen\" in Japanese in his television appearance on April 16.\r\n   The remarks of the Tokyo metropolitan governor, a dastardly anti-communist element and fanatic militarist, are an intolerable crime as they tarnished the dignity and honor of the DPRK, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is a clear indication that national chauvinism of looking down upon and insulting the Korean nation still remains in the mind of the Japanese reactionaries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese government, if it has a proper political view and willingness to improve relations with the DPRK, should never gloss over and connive at Ishihara's behaviour but call him to account. Doing so would help create an atmosphere for the DPRK-Japan talks and improve the bilateral relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If such grave anti-DPRK behaviour persists in Japan, it will put the DPRK and Japan in a serious situation, far from improving their relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people treasure the DPRK's dignity and authority more than anybody else.\r\n   Ishihara should make an official apology to the Korean people, being heavily responsible for his criminal deeds. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese authorities should take an immediate step to prevent such reckless deeds as his against the DPRK and Chongryon (General Association of Korean Residents in Japan).    \r\n\r\n"
