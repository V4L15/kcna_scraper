A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland said this in a statement released on Mar. 8 in connection with the fact that the U.S. secretary of Defense and the south Korean minister of Defence at their recent talks held in Washington agreed to transfer the above-said right to south Korea till April of 2012, that is five years later and officially announced it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Citing facts to prove the U.S. continued military presence and domination over south Korea and its ceaseless moves for war of aggression, the statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This indicates that the U.S. loudmouthed transfer of the above-mentioned right to south Korea is nothing but hypocrisy and there will be, practically, no change in the present master-and-servant military relations between the U.S. and south Korea and on the contrary it will only reinforce the U.S. military presence and domination over south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind this charade is a sinister aim to instigate the south Korean bellicose forces to launch a war of aggression against the north and evade the responsibility for the provocation of the war by painting it as a \"fratricidal war.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these facts go to prove that the U.S. much publicized \"transfer of right to command wartime operations\" is nothing but a deceptive farce to mislead the domestic and foreign mind-set and opinion and a product of the dangerous plot to escalate its moves for war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised not to mislead the public opinion through the above-said charade, but take its hands off the Korean Peninsula and quit south Korea, taking all its equipment for war of aggression with it as early as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should give up the farce of \"take-over of the right to command wartime operations\" and take practical measures to put an end to the U.S. domination and interference and withdraw the U.S. troops from south Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The imperialist forces cannot dare run wild, if the anti-imperialist, independent countries unite and support each other in the common struggle against imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South-South cooperation should be expanded on the principle of collective self-reliance. If the developing countries aspiring after independence develop this cooperation, they can frustrate the \"globalization\" maneuvers of the imperialists and successfully build an independent national economy without depending upon them. And they can improve their material and cultural life in a creative way to meet the desire and demand of their people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The democratization of the international community is an important requirement in guaranteeing the Juche character and national identity of each country. This can never be realized apart from international unity and cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The only way of barring the imperialist forces from freely manipulating   international organizations including the United Nations and of resolving all the international issues on democratic principles is for the countries aspiring after independence to boost international unity and cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Independence, peace and friendship are the idea of the foreign policy of the Workers' Party of Korea.  The WPK and the DPRK people are strengthening unity and cooperation with the peoples of all the countries worldwide aspiring after independence on the basis of this idea and are making strenuous efforts to establish fair international relations and order. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will fulfill its international duty and mission for the era in the implementation of the common cause of adhering to the Juche character and national identity of the countries and nations and realizing global independence by energetically striving to boost unity and cooperation with the progressive people of the world and democratize the international community.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It also testifies to the fact that they are harassers of peace and security on the peninsula and the chieftain of a war as they cause the dark clouds of a nuclear war to gather over this land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the mettle of Songun Korea and the will of the servicepersons and people of the DPRK to respond to force in kind and retaliate against any provocation with merciless counter-blows. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and the south Korean warlike forces should unconditionally cancel their plan to stage the extremely dangerous DPRK-targeted war exercises, pondering over the ensuing grave consequences.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
