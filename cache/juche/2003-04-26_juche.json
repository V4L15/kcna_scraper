And it persistently avoided the discussion on the essential issues to be discussed between both sides. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the DPRK set out a new proposal for the settlement of the nuclear issue, proceeding from its stand to avert a war on the Korean Peninsula and achieve lasting peace and stability, it will follow the U.S. future attitude toward it.    \r\n\r\n"

This clearly indicates what a dangerous phase the Japanese reactionaries' ambition for overseas aggression has reached.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently the director general of the Japan Defense Agency asserted at the security commission of the house of representatives that it is worth examining the need for the \"self-defense forces\" to have the capability to attack bases in other countries, a full revelation of Japan's intention to launch reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is serious is that Japan is seized with its ambition for overseas expansion at a time when the United States is not hesitating to commit undisguised encroachment upon the sovereignty of weak and small countries under the pretext of \"anti-terrorism war\", its strategy for world supremacy. Needless to say, the DPRK is the first target of Japan's overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people who had been subject to immeasurable misfortune and sufferings by the Japanese imperialists in the past are watching the moves for reviving Japanese militarism with a high degree of revolutionary vigilance and are fully ready to decisively repel this attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is well advised to cool its head heated with militarism, pondering over the grave consequences to be entailed by its ambition for reckless overseas expansion    \r\n\r\n"
