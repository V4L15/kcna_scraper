            "content": "National Seminar on Juche Idea Held in Nepal \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 4 (KCNA) -- A national seminar on the Juche idea was held in Katmandu on Dec. 22 last year on the occasion of the 14th anniversary of leader Kim Jong Il's assumption of office as supreme commander of the Korean People's Army and the 88th birth anniversary of anti-Japanese war hero Kim Jong Suk.\r\n Manik Lal Shrestha, chairman of the Nepal Institute for Juche Studies, in a keynote report at the seminar said that the exploits President Kim Il Sung performed in the movement for global independence are really great, adding that the President embodied the Juche idea, liberating Korea through an anti-Japanese armed struggle, establishing people's power and building a powerful socialist country of Juche on the land of Korea, once a backward agricultural state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He noted that Kim Il Sung was a great leader whom no politicians in the world could match. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One of the greatest feats performed by Kim Il Sung was the successful solution of the problem of the succession to the revolutionary cause, the reporter said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Korean-style socialism remains shining as a bulwark for the cause of independence, displaying its tremendous vitality despite the imperialists' offensive to isolate and stifle the DPRK thanks to the Juche idea fathered by President Kim Il Sung and the guidance of Kim Jong Il, his great successor.\r\n The life and undying exploits of President Kim Il Sung are associated with the life of anti-Japanese war hero Kim Jong Suk who was his most faithful bodyguard and a great model of the Korean women's movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il's assumption of office as supreme commander of the KPA convinced everyone that the cause of independence against imperialism is sure to be crowned with a decisive victory. \r\n Speakers deeply explained and proved the undying exploits the three generals of Mt. Paektu performed by founding the Juche idea and developing it in depth and the originality and vitality of the Juche idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lam Prid Paswan, vice-president of the Senate of the Nepalese National Assembly, addressing the seminar, noted that the seminar offered an opportunity to deepen the conviction that the Juche idea is the greatest idea in the present times. The Korean people are ushering in an era of independence at the head of progressive mankind, guided by the Juche idea, he added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A message of greetings to Kim Jong Il was adopted at the seminar.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The political and military potentials the WPK and the people of the DPRK have consolidated as firm as a rock by implementing the independent revolutionary line serve as a sure guarantee for protecting the sovereignty of the country and the gains of the revolution, successfully advancing the revolution and construction and checking and frustrating the imperialists' aggression and interference.\r\n It is an urgent task common to humankind to avert a war and defend peace. Doing so is prerequisite to building a new independent world. Peace can be won only when the people of all the countries in the world who love independence and peace turn out as one in the stubborn struggle against the imperialists' aggression and their war policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the consistent stand of the WPK to develop the friendly and cooperative relations with the world people who advocate independence.\r\n The WPK will develop the good neighborly and friendly relations with all the countries of the world on the principle of independence and on the basis of international justice. The DPRK will strive to improve and normalize the relations even with those countries which were hostile towards it in the past should they respect the sovereignty of the DPRK and abandon their hostile policy toward it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will as ever make a positive contribution to the building of an independent, peaceful and friendly new world.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But at a press conference held next day, he again justified the Iraqi war, asserting the ouster of Hussein was a just decision.\r\n In this regard Minju Joson today says in a signed commentary: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bush tried hard to justify the Iraqi war though he admitted it was totally wrong. It is extremely preposterous for him to make such outcries which admit of no argument. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What Bush uttered is nothing but brazen-faced sheer sophism because it is based on the brigandish logic that everything sought by the U.S. is \"just.\"\r\n Bush's assertion about the Iraqi war reflects the invariable nature of the U.S. as a robber. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The sovereignty of every country can be guaranteed and defended only by dint of indigenous powerful physical deterrent capable of resolutely smashing any act of aggression. This is a serious lesson drawn by many countries of the world from the developments of the Iraqi war.\r\n The reality eloquently proves how just is the great Songun policy of the Workers' Party of Korea which has built the powerful self-reliant defence power capable of reliably defending the sovereignty of the country without the slightest hesitation despite the persistent moves of the U.S.-led imperialist allied forces to isolate, blockade and stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK will surely build a great prosperous powerful socialist nation and achieve the cause of national reunification under the banner of great Songun in any storm and stress and no matter how the earth may change.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In this regard the \"Grand National Party\" clans launched a noisy conspiratorial \"coloring\" offensive as part of their dastardly anti-north campaign. They claimed that the law was \"legislation of socialist Reds\" as it is intended to conduct \"pro-north education against the U.S.\" and a \"plot to turn private schools into centres for a revolutionary struggle.\"\r\n Minju Joson Wednesday observes in a signed commentary in this regard: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The keynote of the law is to combat irregularities and corruption at private schools as it has long been promoted by many civic and social organizations including the \"National Teachers Union.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since the publication of the historic June 15 joint declaration the south Koreans' consciousness of national independence has rapidly mounted and, accordingly, the progressive pro-reform forces, reunification and patriotic forces have grown stronger whereas the ultra-right conservative forces have been seriously marginalized and weakened. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The real intention of the GNP group is to do harm and stifle the progressive pro-reform forces, reunification and patriotic forces under the absurd pretext of any linkage with the north, a trite method employed by their predecessors in a bid to tide over their crisis and create an environment favorable for their return to power. They kicked off a frantic \"witch hunt\" just as they did after the case of the \"People's Revolutionary Party\" and the case of the \"National Democratic Youths and Students League\" were fabricated. All this is aimed to attain the above-said sinister aim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now is the June 15 era when the Koreans are working hard to achieve independent reunification through national reconciliation and unity. In order to reunify the country by implementing the June 15 joint declaration one should not take issue with any pro-north gesture in south Korea but encourage it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It deals with the facts that he expanded the territory widely northward, delivered a telling blow to Paekje, Kaya and Japan in the south to capture many castles of Paekje and helped and put Silla under its stronger control, demonstrating the might of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The third paragraph includes regulations to manage and protect the mausoleum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As it gives in details many facts that the Korean and foreign historical records have missed, the epitaph serves as very valuable data in correctly understanding and systematizing the then Oriental history, to say nothing of the history of Koguryo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The monument is one of the most priceless cultural relics for the peoples of Korea and other countries in the East for its valuable historical data, rich content, grandeur, well-arranged sentences and delicate penmanship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The monument stands on the eastern hill in the Kuknae Castle, the capital of Koguryo (Jian City, Jilin Province, China at present).    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
