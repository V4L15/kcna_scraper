Korea urgently demanded by times and nation \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 18 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article dismisses the U.S. moves to keep its troops in South Korea as a criminal act going against the trend of history and the times.\r\n The article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is persistently pursuing the policy of occupation of South Korea in utter disregard of the strong global trend toward independence and peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By keeping their forces in South Korea, the U.S. imperialists seek to realise their wild ambition to invade the DPRK anytime and use the Korean peninsula as a springboard from which to attack other Asian countries and establish their domination over the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. troops' pullback from South Korea is urgently  demanded by the history of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation stands strongly opposed to the U.S. imperialists' moves for aggression and interference and categorically demands the unconditional withdrawal of the U.S. imperialist aggression troops from South Korea. It is clearly evidenced by the fact that despite the U.S. ever more pronounced anti-DPRK and anti-reunification moves representatives of the political parties and organizations and personages from all walks of life in the north, south and abroad recently met to significantly mark the first anniversary of the historic June 15 Joint Declaration and renewed their resolution to independently solve the issue of the country's reunification by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is left with no justification to claim any longer that the U.S. forces should stay in South Korea to \"deter southward advance\" of the soviet union and repel the \"invasion of the south\" by the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Soviet Union does not exist any more and the north and the south of Korea adopted the historic June 15 Joint Declaration in which they stated their will to achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the country on the basis of reconciliation and unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to  drop its criminal hostile policy toward the DPRK and immediately withdraw its aggression troops from South Korea, well aware of the will of the Korean nation for independent reunification and the trend of the times.    \r\n\r\n"

They have gone the length of taking measures for such a military action as \"readjusting and redeploying combat forces\" and making such provocative remarks about \"non-military provocations.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Korea is known to have allowed more than 100 foreign trading ships to cross the strait a day without permission. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But they are making such a fuss over the passage of a few trading ships of the north through the strait. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This cannot be construed otherwise than a move to put a brake on the implementation of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and push the present inter-Korean relations back to those of confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their behaviour will only result in aggravating the inter-Korean relations. The South Korean military authorities will be held wholly responsible for the ensuing consequences.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
