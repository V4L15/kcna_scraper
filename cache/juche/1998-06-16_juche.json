They have also contended that \"frozen\" development and export of missiles is vital to the improvement of the bilateral relations.\r\n   The missile issue is related to the sovereignty and existence of our people.\r\n   We are militarily confronted with the United States, which has  the largest quantities of nuclear weapons, inter-continental ballistic missiles and other mass destruction weapons in the world.\r\n   What it really seeks in the efforts for preventing our missile development is to disarm and attack us any moment.\r\n   It is the consistent principle maintained by the DPRK government in national defence that as long as it remains subjected to military threat from outside, it should produce by itself and deploy military equipment to safeguard the security of the country and the people.\r\n   On this principle, we will continue developing, testing and deploying missiles.\r\n   With missiles of the united states, which is at war with the DPRK technically, aiming at our territory, we find no reason to refrain from developing and deploying missiles to counter them.\r\n   The discontinuation of our missile development is a matter which can be discussed after a peace agreement is signed between the DPRK and the United States and the U.S. military threat completely removed.\r\n   If the U.S. \"concern\" over our missiles is truly related to the peace and security of northeast Asia, the United States should immediately accept the DPRK-proposed peace agreement for the establishment of a durable peace mechanism on the Korean peninsula.\r\n   Our missile export is aimed at obtaining foreign money we need at present.\r\n   As the United States has pursued economic isolation of the DPRK for more than half a century, our resources of foreign money have been circumscribed. So, missile export is the option we could not but take.\r\n   If the United States really wants to prevent our missile export, it should lift the economic embargo as early as possible and make a compensation for the losses to be caused by discontinued missile export.\r\n   We will as ever put the interests of our state and the wellbeing of our people above anything else and never allow others to slander such a policy.    \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n"

Anyone with the spirit of the nation should come out to the work for national reconciliation and unity, transcending the differences in political view, religious belief, residence  and position.\r\n   We are convinced that political parties, organisations and public figures in South Korea and overseas will respond to the patriotic proposal of political parties and organisations in the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"

You can reach it after a ten-odd-km drive from the Kumgangsan Hotel. It looks like an assemblage of all things in the world. Hence its name. Famous in the Manmulsang area are Samson (three-fairy) rock, Kwimyon (demonfaced) rock and Chonson (fairies-from-heaven) rock.\r\n   Samson rock consists of three rocks standing side by side behind Mansang pavilion at the entrance to Manmulsang. A little way from it is a big rock with a small rock on top of it.  It is called Kwimyon rock because it looks like a demon. Rocks near the Samson and Kwimyon rocks look like pillars of queer shapes and have their interesting names and pines, wild cherries and azaleas rooted in their cracks decorate them beautifully in spring and autumn.\r\n   If you go to the left for a while through Chonil gate called the Kumgang gate of Manmulsang you can reach Chonson rock where, according to a legend, fairies, charmed by the beauty of the mountains, came down from heaven to play. The rock, which serves as an observatory, consists of four rock pillars and can accommodate ten people. It commands a view of peaks in the area of outer Kumgang, as well as the mysterious beauty of Manmulsang.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
