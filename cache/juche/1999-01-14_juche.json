            "content": "Sophism reversing black and white\r\n   Pyongyang, January 14 (KCNA) -- Gary Samore, a special U.S. presidential assistant, said at a recent seminar that the United States would not ease sanctions on the DPRK and the DPRK could not receive \"benefits of the agreed framework if it does not grant access to its suspected underground nuclear facilities.\"\r\n   His provocative remarks are the height of shamelessness, a sophism reversing black and white and impudent utterances aimed at shifting responsibilities onto the other side. \r\n   These are only increasing hatred for the United States.\r\n   It is none other than the U.S. that has created serious threats to the peace and security of the Korean peninsula in wanton violation of the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework.\r\n   Although four years have passed since the adoption and effectuation of the Geneva agreement, the U.S. has not faithfully implemented any of its commitments to the agreement including the construction of light-water reactors, the supply of heavy oil and the lifting of economic sanctions. On the contrary, the U.S. nuclear and military threats against the DPRK have further increased.\r\n   Now, the U.S. is loudly crying that the Geneva agreement may be \"broken\". However, the agreement has already reached such an extent as it may break up of its own accord due to the U.S. hypocritical and double-dealing attitude.\r\n   The U.S. must take full responsibility for this and unconditionally compensate for the economic losses it has inflicted upon the DPRK by delaying implementing the agreement.\r\n   It is an unavoidable demand of the international law that if one side brings damage to the other side in contravention of any agreement, it must make compensation for it.\r\n   With no sophism or plot can the United States flee from its responsibility.    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n"

Korea visit\r\n   Pyongyang, January 14 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today carries a commentary on South Korea visit by director-general of the Defence Agency of Japan Norota.\r\n   The news analyst says: \r\n   He agreed with the South Korean military bosses on \"intensified military cooperation\" over the \"suspected underground nuclear facilities\" of the DPRK and \"its missile development\",  and looked round panmunjom in the forefront area. \r\n   This clearly betrays the shameless,  militaristic stance of the Japanese reactionaries.\r\n   \"Intensified military cooperation\" is aimed at the DPRK in every particular and takes it as a prerequisite to set up a military alliance with the South Korean rulers.\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries seek to inveigle the South Korean rulers deeper into the umbrella of militarism and set up an aggressive military alliance called \"security alliance\" and thus bind South Korea more tightly to it.\r\n   This will lead Japan to take the road of re-invasion on a full scale, using the South Korean authorities as a shock brigade.\r\n   During Norota's visit to South Korea, an agreement was also reached on holding a concrete working-level consultation on \"search\" and joint exercises between the Japanese maritime \"self-defence force\" and the puppet navy at an early date. This is an expression of the Japanese reactionaries' attempt to unify the operation system between them, to expand military infiltration into South Korea and to make the puppet army a shock brigade for re-invasion.\r\n   Re-invasion of Korea will lead them to the hell. The Japanese reactionaries had better stop such foolish acts as digging their own grave.    \r\n\r\n"

This was a historic event which made it possible to more firmly ensure the revolutionary cause of Juche with armed forces, it says, and goes on:\r\n   The Worker-Peasant Red Guards grew into a revolutionary armed force of the Workers' Party of Korea under the leadership of Kim Il Sung. Now, they have entered the highest level of development under the guidance of Supreme Commander Marshal Kim Jong Il.\r\n   The Marshal has seen to it that the red guards can fully display their political and ideological might and continue to improve their military equipment in keeping with the requirement of modern warfare. And he has turned the whole country into an impregnable fortress by building steel-strong defence positions in all parts of the country.\r\n   Together with the Korean People's Army (KPA), the Worker-Peasant Red Guards have become a powerful armed force of the Workers' Party of Korea and created a proud history of victory and glory.\r\n   Today the members of the red guards under the great brilliant commander have a very high level of  ideological and mental traits and military preparedness.\r\n   If the enemy encroaches upon a blade of grass and a tree of the fatherland, all the members of the red guards, together  with the KPA,  will turn out in a sacred war to annihilate the enemy, make the enemy a forlorn wandering spirit and honorably defend the leader, system and fatherland at the cost of their lives.\r\n   A national meeting was held in Pyongyang on Wednesday to mark the 40th anniversary of the Worker-Peasant Red Guards. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
