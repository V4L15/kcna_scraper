(1)\r\nPyongyang, 16 de enero (ACNC) -- Con la aparicion del nuevo pais poseedor de la bomba de hidrogeno, todo el mundo bulle desde los primeros dias del Ano Nuevo.\n\t\t\t\t\tProbablemente, todo el ano, el enfoque de la sociedad internacional apuntara a Corea socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi dijo a la ACNC el doctor So Song Il, director del Instituto de Ciencias Socio-Politicas de la Academia de Ciencias Sociales, y prosiguio:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl poseer la bomba H, la RPDC se puso en la misma posicion de la potencia nuclear de los paises miembros permanentes del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero hay diferencia diametralmente opuesta en el desarrollo de armas nucleares de la RPDC y Estados Unidos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPrimero, desde el punto de vista de su objetivo; EE.UU. desarrollo la bomba atomica y fabrico hasta la bomba H casi 10 anos despues para tomar la hegemonia mundial, pero la RPDC las desarrollo a fin de defender la soberania y el derecho a sobrevivir, o sea, con el objetivo autodefensivo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA finales de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, la existencia de Alemania fascista y Japon militarista no fue una gran amenaza a Estados Unidos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi EE.UU. no hubiera tenido la ambicion de la hegemonia mundial tras frenar la ampliacion de la influencia de la ex URSS, que hizo un papel principal en aniquilar el fascismo, no habria sentido la necesidad de desarrollar las armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn contraste con tal ambicion de EE.UU., caudillo de agresion y guerra, la RPDC tomo la decision rotunda para defenderse desde las maniobras de aplastamiento militar y la amenaza nuclear de las fuerzas hostiles encabezadas por el imperio gringo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl respecto, el secretario general de la Comision para los Asuntos Exteriores del Senado de Italia, Antonio Razzi, respondio a las preguntas de los periodistas que la primera prueba de la bomba H de la RPDC es de caracter autodefensivo.
