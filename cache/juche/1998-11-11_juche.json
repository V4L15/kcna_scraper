He said as the matchless combatants, who devotedly fight for the sake of the party, the revolution, the country and people, are defending the forefront with the noble love for the country and burning hatred for the enemies, the revolutionary cause and socialist homeland are invincible.\r\n   He looked round a power station built by the servicemen of the combined unit with their own efforts. He said that the People's Army had done a lot of good things in order to help the country as much as it can, and that such a commendable thing as thinking of the revolution and the country before anything else is a beautiful trait of the Korean People's Army, the army of the party, the revolution and the people.\r\n   Earlier on November 9, the KPA  Supreme Commander inspected an island-defending unit of unit No. 1202 of the KPA.\r\n   He noted with great satisfaction that the unit had turned the defence theatre into an impregnable fortress and changed the looks  of the unit, with all logistic facilities and surroundings kept clean and tidy.\r\n   He said that the soldiers of the heroic Korean People's Army, the army of the party and the revolution, were all like the island defenders who carry out the party's orders and instructions in a revolutionary spirit, readily going through thick and thin. The socialist motherland is invincible and the Juche revolution is ever-victorious with this matchless army that displays its revolutionary features in national defence and socialist construction, he added.\r\n   He was accompanied by KPA vice marshal Jo Myong Rok, director of the General Political Department of the KPA= KPA  vice marshal Kim Yong Chun, chief of the general staff of the KPA= KPA generals Kim Ha Gyu, Hyon Chol Hae and Pak Jae Gyong= KPA colonel general Ri Myong Su= and staff members of the KPA Supreme Command. \r\n\r\n"

But, the U.S. authorities' policy for military occupation of South Korea and moves for provoking a new war have been further intensified day by day.\r\n   The Cold War was terminated, and an agreement on non-aggression was adopted between the north and south of Korea. \r\nNevertheless, the U.S. authorities , under an absurd pretext of coping with \"threats of attack\" from the north, are more frantically carrying on the adventurous large-scale joint war drills with South Korea and Japan, thus driving the situation of the Korean peninsula to the brink of war.\r\n   This shows that as long as the U.S.-South Korea \"combined forces command\" is left intact, peace and stability will never be ensured on the Korean peninsula nor can the independent and peaceful reunification of the country, the cherished desire of the nation, be achieved.\r\n   With a correct understanding of the present-day reality, the United States should dismantle the \"UN command,\" that is \"South Korea-U.S. combined forces command,\" without delay and pull the U.S. troops out of South Korea unconditionally in accordance with the resolution adopted at the 30th session of the UN General Assembly.\r\n   Kim Dae Jung's regime should immediately withdraw their requests for  permanent stationing of the U.S. troops, and thereby turn to the road of independence, not pro-American flunkeyism and treachery. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Worse still, the South Korean authorities, who are in a serious financial crisis,  seek in the law to collect money from overseas compatriots and incite division among them.\r\n   Their attempt to enact the \"law\" is part of their anti-north, anti-reunification confrontation moves to block national reconciliation and unity.\r\n  The overseas compatriots are well aware of what the  South Korean authorities pursue in enacting the \"law.\"\r\n   Koreans at home and abroad are calling for giving up the scheme to enact the reactionary \"law\" at once, not merely erasing some articles.
