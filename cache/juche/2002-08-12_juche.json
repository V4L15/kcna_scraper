But only the GNP is trying to throw a hurdle in the way of inter-Korean dialogue, displeased with the two sides restarting dialogue and moving towards detente, cooperation and reunification. It is the old game and intrinsic characteristics of the GNP to spread sheer lies and negate even patriotism and justice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We can never connive at the grave consequences the GNP's foolish acts may bring to the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since the publication of the landmark June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, which is essential for the destiny of the nation and the prospect of reunification, the GNP has rejected it, alleging that the south submitted to the north and played into its hands. The GNP has impeded the implementation of the declaration, even calling for dropping its second paragraph. As soon as the naval clash occurred on the west sea, it, availing itself of the chance, took great pains to bring the situation to confrontation and war, bereft of reason. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We would like to ask the GNP, which objects to improved inter-Korean relations without proper reasons, as follows: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What has the GNP done for the nation and reunification? Was it formed only to mock the destiny of the nation? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP, going against the trend of the times and the aspiration of the fellow countrymen, is now digging its own grave.     \r\n\r\n"

It is because the principle clarifies man's position and role in the world proceeding from his fundamental requirement for dominating and transforming nature and society and leading an independent and creative life and confirms the possibility of meeting it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The philosophical principle of the Juche idea is a perfect one as it scientifically elucidates man's position and role in the present world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This principle explains that man is the master of his own destiny and is capable of carving it out. This is a fundamental principle for shaping man's destiny. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Juche idea and its system and all its ideological and theoretical contents are evolved with man placed in the centre of everything and with this philosophical principle taken as an ideological, theoretical and methodological basis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The philosophical principle serves as a scientific and revolutionary principle fully reflecting the reality today when the position and role of the popular masses as the master of the world have been remarkably enhanced and indicating ways of shaping the human destiny in keeping with their desire and wishes for independence.     \r\n\r\n"
