            "content": "DPRK, Powerful Nation of Independence, Self-support and Self-defence\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 6 (KCNA) -- The DPRK is a dignified powerful socialist country of independence, self-support and self-defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was the noble idea and cause set forth by President Kim Il Sung in the early years of his revolutionary activities to build a rich and powerful, independent and sovereign state in the liberated country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He accumulated a precious experience in the building of an independent and sovereign state under the banner of establishment of Juche in the days of the sanguinary anti-Japanese warfare. Basing himself on this, he founded the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on September 9, Juche 37 (1948). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has since regarded it as one of the most cardinal issues related to the destiny of the country and nation to hold fast to independence in its activities and vigorously advanced along the path of independence indicated by the great Juche idea.\r\n The struggle for establishing Juche in the revolution and construction was difficult, indeed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Korea has been divided by outside forces, the U.S.-led imperialist reactionaries persisted in moves to provoke a new war and economic blockades against the DPRK and the great power chauvinists put pressure on it firmly adhering to an independent stand.\r\n It, however, has pushed ahead the revolution victoriously, foiling all the challenges of history categorically with the conviction of independence and the revolutionary principles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It had never deviated from the one road of Juche even in the period of \"Arduous March\" and the forced march when its destiny was at the crossroads of life and death owing to the unprecedentedly intensified isolation and suffocation of the DPRK by the imperialist reactionaries and the consecutive natural disasters after the national funeral. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n General Secretary Kim Jong Il, with clear-cut penetration into the requirements of the time in which the anti-imperialist military front became the main one of the revolution, established the mode of Songun politics applying the Juche idea in an all-round way so as to increase the politico-ideological might of the country in every way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He saw to it that the primary efforts were directed to the development of the munitions industry while preparing all the servicepersons of the Korean People's Army to be the ideologically strong men and a-match-for-a-hundred stalwarts through uninterrupted field inspection of KPA units. Under his energetic leadership the self-reliant defense capabilities of the country have been consolidated to be invincible one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He also energetically led the whole army and the entire people to forcefully accelerate the socialist economic construction, holding higher the banner of self-reliance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over last ten-odd years the DPRK has carried on grand nature-remaking projects successfully to change the looks of the territory, built modern factories, production bases and other monumental edifices in different parts of the country and energetically undertaken technological updating of the national economy, registering startling achievements. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The grandiose sunrise of building a great, prosperous and powerful nation in the DPRK which bridged over ordeals proves once again that the line of independence, self-support and self-defense kept by the DPRK is entirely correct.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Accuses S. Korean Puppet Army of Whipping up War Hysteria\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 6 (KCNA) -- The south Korean puppet army was reported to have planned to organize a \"commemoration event\" on Sept. 9 as a repetition of the landing operation in Inchon conducted by the U.S forces during the last Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"event\" involving large transports, landing craft, scores of landing armored cars and planes and huge troops is, in actuality, a landing operation exercise of the puppet navy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a grave act of treachery for the south Korean puppet army to replay the landing operation in Inchon, a synonym for aggression and genocide, as it was a military operation directly commanded by MacArthur and other brass hats of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n GIs indiscriminately killed at least 1,300 innocent peaceable people in the very day they landed in Inchon in mid-September of 1950. They arrested, imprisoned, tortured and killed at least 75,000 civilians in Seoul only. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Half a century has passed since then but the soul of more than 1.2 million people brutally killed by the U.S. imperialists in south Korea during the Korean war seems to call for revenge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said commemoration event is projected by the south Korean authorities at a time when the south Korean people and the international community are becoming increasingly vocal condemning the monstrous crimes committed by the U.S. forces against humanity through their intrusion into Inchon. This is a hideous atrocity little short of committing double crimes against so many slain civilians. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n This is nothing but an open praise of aggression and massacres perpetrated by the U.S. forces present in south Korea. It brings to light the treacherous nature of the Lee Myung Bak clique as running dogs of the U.S. in carrying out its adventurous scenario for aggression against the DPRK and its war servant. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Warmongers keen on sycophancy toward the U.S. and dependence on foreign forces are getting more desperate in their moves to block national reconciliation and unity and ignite a new war at its instigation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are exerting efforts to stoke hostility toward fellow countrymen in the north and establish a \"view on the principal enemy\" while putting spurs to boosting the combat readiness of the three services of their army and beefing up their armed forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n They staged the Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military exercises, a replica of the Ulji Focus Lens aimed at \"the overall examination and improvement\" of the readiness to launch a war against the DPRK, and are escalating various forms of espionage against the DPRK in the land and sea and air and intrusions into its territorial waters. These undisguised military provocations are creating a tense situation reminiscent of the eve of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  \r\n They are also busy ensuring the transfer and expansion of the U.S. military bases. They have expanded the area of the Mugon-ri drill ground in Phaju City, Kyonggi Province to reach millions of phyong (one phyong equals 3.954 sq yds) and offered it to the U.S. forces as their exclusive drill ground. The U.S. forces base in Phyongthaek has been enlarged and the construction of a base for the U.S. Apache unit in Kunsan and a naval base on Jeju Island is now under way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality goes to prove that the Lee Myung Bak bellicose forces' moves for confrontation with the DPRK and compatriots have reached an extremely grave phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lee group is sadly mistaken if it calculates it can get something by whipping up war hysteria through such landing operation exercise, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Such confrontation with fellow countrymen and war moves would only lead the Lee group of traitors to final destruction.   \r\n\r\n\r\n"
