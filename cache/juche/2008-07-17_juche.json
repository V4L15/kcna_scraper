But it has been restored to its original state at the very site thanks to the policy of the Workers' Party of Korea and the government of the DPRK for properly preserving and managing the cultural remains of the nation and ensuring the freedom of religion by law and in practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n President Kim Il Sung visited the temple on February 12, Juche 80(1991). Then he said that there are many historical remains permeated with wisdom and talent of the Korean ancestors in different parts of the country, stressing that the historical relics and remains should be preserved and managed well  as they are precious heritages giving national pride to the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The temple is often visited by Buddhists and people at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The chief priest of the temple conducts the visitors to the main building, Buddhist monastery and other buildings of the temple and its surroundings, saying that the Kwangbop Temple is well preserved and managed thanks to the government's cultural preservation policy. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 16 (KCNA) -- The newly appointed commander of U.S. forces in south Korea recently talked about the DPRK's \"application\" of what he called \"Iraqi armed forces' tactics.\" Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary dismisses his remarks as a very insolent and grave political and military provocation as they seriously defile and hurt the dignity and self-esteem of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a serious attention is the aggressive nature and danger of his anti-DPRK outbursts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The remarks made by him calling on the U.S. forces and the south Korean armed forces to cope with something are nothing but sophism intended to introduce modern offensive means into south Korea under the pretext of \"threat\" from the DPRK and thus round off their preparations for starting the second Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a matter of fact, the U.S war-thirsty forces are mulling the continued delivery of the latest type war hardware and other equipment such as interceptor missiles to the south Korean puppets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a particularly serious attention is that the U.S. is contemplating plugging south Korea into the missile defense system (MD). After listing the DPRK as the main target of the MD, the U.S. warlike forces are seeking to build it on the Korean Peninsula in collusion with the south Korean puppet armed forces. They are now actively involved in it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose forces are massively bringing their forces of aggression into south Korea, a blatant challenge to the DPRK, their dialogue partner. This is further deteriorating the situation. This reckless criminal act, a revelation of the U.S. unchangeable hostile policy towards the DPRK, is hamstringing the process of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and leading the situation to the brink of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. truly stands for detente and peace on the Korean Peninsula, it should take a practical step for dropping its hostile policy towards the DPRK which finds its manifestation in the massive introduction of armed forces of aggression into south Korea and military provocations against the DPRK.  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
