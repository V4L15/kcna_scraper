It is a hackneyed method of the United States to interfere in other's internal affairs under the cloak of \"peaceful settlement\" after brewing disputes in those countries that challenge their domination and arbitrary practices in Africa and other parts of the world and resort to espionage and terrorism to topple sovereign governments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    U.S. espionage and subversive activities and arms build-up intended to stifle the socialist system in the DPRK are getting more undisguised on the Korean peninsula.

Last July a high-ranking South Korean official said that  the \"sunshine policy\" was aimed at making the north take off its overcoat in all aspects of society, economy and military by providing it with rays and heat and \"this was the way of overpowering the north without fighting by luring the north to changes, while maintaining a strong security posture.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Some time ago, the South Korean chief executive let loose balderdash at a recent press conference on the first anniversary of the assumption of his office that the \"sunshine policy\" was a replica of the U.S. policy whereby it destroyed the former socialist countries and led them to \"reform and opening\".   The \"sunshine policy\" means, in essence, \"inducing\" the north to carry out \"reform and opening\" through so-called \"reconciliation and cooperation\".   The South Korean authority's talk about \"sunshine\" allegedly to give rays and heat to the North Korea was prompted by megalomania into which they fell, oblivious of their position.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Are there in South Korea under the so-called \"government for the people\", any  ray for others or any chance to embrace others?   The successive \"presidents\" in South Korea, a colony of the United States for over a half century, have been installed with the consent of the White House and the prerogative of supreme command over the army is in the hands of Pentagon. The economy has come under the trusteeship of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and culture has been infected with western and Japanese way of life.   It is as clear as noonday that there can be neither a ray of independence nor a chance of democracy and benevolence in such a colony. What remains in South Korea is nothing but trampled-down sovereignty and  democracy, abject poverty,  endless bankruptcy of enterprises, a huge army of the unemployed and unceasing suicides.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Prisoners of conscience, who are subjected to  torture and appeasement, are yearning for a ray of freedom and those wanted, who are under constant surveillance and pursuit, are desirous of rays of democracy.   It is preposterous, indeed, for this \"government\" which is not in a position to deal with its own business to talk about offering  rays and heat to the North Korea.   The South Korean chief executive should be accountable to the nation for having misled public opinion at home and abroad by peddling the \"sunshine policy\" which brought disappointment  to the fellow countrymen earnestly desirous of reunification.   We state once again that any policy contrary to the three principles of national reunification does not go down with us.   The South Korean chief executive should discard the dream of \"sunshine policy\" opposed to the nation and reunification. \r\n \r\n"

Recently alone, a joint meeting of the government, political parties and organisations in the DPRK, reflecting the pressing situation prevailing on the Korean peninsula and the ardent desire of the entire nation for reunification, offered the South Korean authorities an important proposal for holding wide-ranging dialogues between the north and the south.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Nevertheless, the South Korean authorities are persisting in their anti-north confrontation and war policy while paying lip service to \"dialogue.\"    Do they have the face to talk about dialogues with the north when they defined the partner of dialogue and reunification as the \"principal enemy\" and are inciting a fever of confrontation and war against the north?   What is all the more ridiculous is Kim Jong Pil's utterances that the \"policy of engagement with the north is a realistic counter proposal for the peace and stability of the Korean peninsula and improved relations between the north and the south.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their \"policy of engagement with the north\" means to \"induce\" the north to capitalism through \"reconciliation and cooperation.\" accordingly, it is an anti-north confrontation policy aimed at negating the ideology and system of the north and unifying the country through \"northward invasion.\"   If inter-Korean relations are to be improved, the danger of war to be removed and the door to genuine dialogue for reunification to be opened, such anti-communist confrontation fanatics and enemy of reunification as Kim Jong Pil must be thrown into the dustbin of history. \r\n\r\n"

This is a whopping lie which was invented out of an ulterior intention to charge the DPRK with violating the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework at any cost and put pressure upon it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As was proved by the successful launch of its first satellite last year, the DPRK's science and technology have laid solid foundations of the Juche-based and self-supporting industry capable of manufacturing anything if necessary.   Those who spread rumors need to know about this.   They should also bear in mind that the DPRK's consistent anti-nuke and peaceloving stand has been widely known to the world.   Accordingly, their talk about \"the DPRK's introduction of nuclear technology\" from other countries is a foolish attempt to discount the scientific and technological achievements and level of the DPRK and an expression of their arrogant stand that only the United States can monopolize scientific and technical progress of humankind.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Through such a false propaganda campaign, they seek to link the DPRK with the issue of developing nuclear weapons.

Small plots, 30 Phyong or 40 Phyong each (1 Phyong = 6 feet square) in valleys have been repartitioned to be a vast plain. Tens of thousands of hectares of paddy and non-paddy fields have been rezoned into fields, 800 Phyong and 1,000 Phyong each to suit mechanized farming.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nMore than 2,680 irrigation and drainage channels and various structures will be made. Ridges between paddy fields were removed and water channels straightened to put a large area of land under cultivation. Roads stretch out crosswise at  500 metre intervals in favour of mechanization of farm work.   The successful completion of the land rezoning in the province in a matter of several months, which had been considered hardly possible for centuries, demonstrates the indomitable spirit of the Korean people who are out in the building of a powerful nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This epoch-making change in the province is a shining fruition of the far-reaching plan of General Secretary Kim Jong Il.   On his way to frontline inspection one day last year he called a conference of officials concerned on a mountainous road and gave them highly important instructions to set a good example in land rezoning in the province and let the whole country follow it, saying if the land of the province is rezoned, a large area of land can be brought under the plough and agricultural production can be increased remarkably.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Saying the land rezoning should be undertaken in a big and bold way so that it may remain flawless in a distant future, he fixed even the scale of land rezoning suited to topographical conditions and steered the gigantic nature-harnessing project.   Servicemen of the Korean People's Army, shock brigade members from all provinces and working people from all walks of life in Kangwon Province were out to carry out the project for the eternal prosperity and development of the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Though hard pressed for everything,  they set an example in land rezoning through fortitude, flattening hills and diverting the flow of rivers.   Preparations for farming are in full swing on the rezoned fields.    All the officials and agricultural workers in the province are working hard to turn the plain into a fertile land so as to bring in a good harvest from the first year of the great change. \r\n\r\n"

Previously, the production of baking soda depended on the ammonia industry.    Potassium carbonate is collected from the dust of kilns and put in water before salt treatment and blowing of low-pressure carbonic acid gas into it. Then, its reaction produces crystals of soda. When they are filtered, medicinal and edible soda is obtainable.   Crystals of potassium chloride can also be made when the filtered liquid is concentrated and cooled.
