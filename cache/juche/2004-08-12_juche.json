Korean Authorities Hit for Their Additional Troop Dispatch to Iraq \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 11 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Korean National Peace Committee Tuesday issued a statement denouncing the south Korean authorities for their additional troop dispatch to Iraq.\r\n The statement bitterly condemned the troop dispatch as an anti-national criminal act as it hurts the dignity of the nation and brings irrevocable disasters to the fellow countrymen by toeing the U.S. line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that the Koreans still vividly remember the disgraceful history in which millions of them shed blood and died in alien lands after being taken away under the pretext of \"conscription\" and \"compulsory labor\" during the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule and many young and middle-aged south Koreans met the same lot in jungles of Vietnam after being taken there as cannon fodder for the U.S. troops in the 1960s, the statement said: We can never remain a passive onlooker to the reality in which such disgraceful history is repeating itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It demanded the south Korean authorities stop at once the troop dispatch to Iraq which goes against the aspiration and demand of the people, estranged from the nation, and withdraw the decision on the troop dispatch at once and make a switchover from submission to the U.S. to national independence, though belatedly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It called upon the people from all walks of life in south Korea to turn out in a nationwide struggle to put an end to the U.S. military occupation and colonial rule, the root cause of all misfortunes and sufferings, and shatter the treacherous acts of the pro-U.S. traitorous forces for the dignity and sovereignty of the nation and the peace and reunification of the country.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This indicates that the United States is set on rounding off a system for realizing the preemptive strike strategy in these areas and carrying this into practice, come what may. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not unknown to the DPRK that it would be the first target of the strike by the U.S. forces in Japan prepared for preemptive attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A preemptive attack is surely answered with a terrible retaliatory strike. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States should behave itself properly, mindful of the grave consequences to be entailed by its harebrained preemptive attack strategy.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n"

The Bush bellicose regime is seeking military aggression behind the scene of dialogue. To this end it has pushed ahead with the relocation of U.S. troops in south Korea and their \"reduction\" and the transfer of its army bases, while introducing there ultra modern weapons and war means without let-up according to the large-scale arms buildup plan calling for spending 13 billion U.S. dollars. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRecently the U.S. worked out \"operation plan 5027-04\", an adventurous scenario for a war against the DPRK, to pose an undisguised threat to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ulji Focus Lens-04 would render the situation on the Korean peninsula so tense that a war may break out any moment. \r\n If the U.S. mounts a preemptive attack on the DPRK, misjudging its peace-loving will as weakness, the DPRK will wipe out the aggressors with the might of ideology, unity and the invincible Songun policy and eliminate all the sources of war on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the south Korean authorities cooperate with outside forces and keep committing treacheries against the nation, they will be held wholly responsible for all the ensuing grave consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and the south Korean warlike forces are well advised not to run amuck but cancel at once the plan to stage the provocative war exercise against the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S. imperialists scheme to stifle the DPRK by mobilizing precision guided missiles and ultra-modern military hardware as they did in Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Actually, the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean war-thirsty elements are putting spurs to preparations for provoking a war against the DPRK according to the operation plan. The \"military reduction\" noisily propagandized by the U.S. is a prelude to the war of aggression. Only recently, under the cloak of \"reduction,\" the U.S. imperialists decided to hurl 13 billion U.S. dollars, much more than the originally earmarked 11 billion, into the \"plan of combat power buildup\" of  their forces in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Following the lead of the bellicose Bush group, the present south Korean military is kicking up a very ill-boding anti-DPRK confrontation ruckus, while sharply boosting military expenditure and getting overheated in arms buildup. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a foolish dream if the U.S. war hawks think it can vanquish the DPRK by \"blitz warfare.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush bellicose group should abandon the adventurous plan to invade the DPRK, which would entail destructive consequences to it, and withdraw all its aggression forces from south Korea.

Koreans assassinated Ito Hirobumi, a boss of the invaders, and committed suicide by disembowelment at the International Peace Conference held in The Hague calling for the independence of Korea. They rose up in nation-wide struggles including the March First Popular Uprising and June Tenth Independence Movement.

And he called on Korean people, armed groups and uprising organizations to turn out in an armed riot and thus defeated the Japanese imperialists and achieved the liberation of the country on August 15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people have conveyed the immortal exploits of the President, who accomplished the historic cause of national liberation and glorified the dignity and honor of the nation, down through generations.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
