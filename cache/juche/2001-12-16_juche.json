That is why the declaration serves as a milestone of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our fellow countrymen should hold higher the banner of national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The basic spirit of the declaration is national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the fellow countrymen in the north, south and overseas should resolutely shatter the U.S. imperialists' anti-national, anti-reunification and war provocation moves and check and frustrate the moves of the anti-reunification forces for \"cooperation\" with foreign forces under the uplifted banner of national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans should firmly unite as one under the banner of the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The interests of classes and strata of our nation are different. But this can not be set above the issue of the country's reunification concerning the life and death of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north, south and overseas should firmly unite under the banner of the joint declaration and vigorously struggle to achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the country.    \r\n\r\n"
