Whether or not the matters are discussed at the talks is a key to progress of the talks.\r\n   But the U.S. side failed to accept the DPRK-proposed items and refused to negotiate the matters.\r\n   It indicates that the U.S. side has deliberately ignored the essential matters and misguided the talks for its purpose.\r\n   Actually, the U.S. side brought forward matters which have nothing to do with the purpose of the talks, intentionally laying obstacles to progress of the talks. \r\n   Foolishly enough, it attempted to make a framework for justifying foreign interference in the internal affairs of the Korean nation by mixing inter-Korean dialogue with the \"four-way talks\" and internationalizing the Korean issue.\r\n   It is clear to everyone that what should be solved by the two halves of Korea cannot be put on the agenda of the Geneva talks.\r\n   The U.S. side, however, has insisted on the discussion of unessential matters, while persistently opposing the discussion of the essential matters. Such unreasonable position and insincere attitude of the U.S. side are what impeded progress of the talks.\r\n   Whether the talks continue or not depends on the U.S. attitude.\r\n   Our sincere efforts and principled demand concerning the talks will remain unchanged.    \r\n    \r\n"

Side, too, officially admitted.\r\n   Nevertheless, the U.S. side, the other party to the framework agreement, instead of showing its good faith by adopting a practical and positive measure, has still postponed its implementation under this or that pretext, three years since it was adopted.\r\n   Wantonly violating the framework agreement, their deeds are not proper behaviours in view of both the elementary norms of international relations and the political and moral honor of the united states styling itself as a big power.\r\n   Every minute and second is very valuable for the Korean people, who are on a forced march of socialism in the spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle. They will never idle away time, expecting something from the U.S. empty promise.\r\n   If the U.S. side continues to delay implementing the framework agreement under groundless pretexts and conditions, it will have to be held wholly responsible for all consequences to be entailed by its perfidious misdeeds.\r\n    \r\n\r\n"
