            "content": "GNP's moves to cook up \"law on special inspection\" flailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 26 (KCNA) -- The South Korean Grand National Party, complaining about the authorities' decision on concluding the investigation into the \"special inspection of remittance to the north,\" is now having a confab to cook up a new \"law on special inspection\" and submit it to the \"National Assembly\" in a bid to extend the period of investigation on the basis of the report presented without the approval of the authorities.\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun carries a signed commentary today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The confab betrays the GNP's criminal intention to make a mockery of the mindset of the South Koreans and drive the north-south relations to a catastrophic phase. Lurking behind this is a base purpose to relate the case in question with the historic north-south summit meeting and find fault with it, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The far-fetched insistence of the anti-reunification elements only reveal their political and moral vulgarity and treacherous nature as they are jealous of the participants in the historic June 15 event and hamstring the north-south relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP is a group of traitors who were opposed to the north-south summit meeting from the outset. It is making desperate efforts to hurt the historic Pyongyang summit and the June 15 Joint Declaration even today when their great vitality is expressed in creating an atmosphere of reconciliation and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For its traitorous nature and deep-seated bad habit of speaking ill of others, the GNP had to drink bitter cups in the past \"presidential elections.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those who betray the nation and read the face of foreign forces, going against the trend of the times are bound to meet a stern punishment and denunciation by the nation and history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP should immediately stop its moves to cook up a new criminal \"law on special inspection\" against the mindset of the South Koreans demanding the conclusion of the investigation.  \r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the basis of the careful preparations made by the U.S. imperialists to start the Korean war, regarding it as an important part of the efforts to invade the continent, stifle socialism and implement their strategy for world domination, started armed invasion of the young DPRK on June 25, 1950. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the war they hurled at least two million troops into it and used over 20 billion U.S. dollars as military spending and more than 73 million tons of war materiel in the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They, however, could not bring the Korean army and people to their knees. The enemy sustained a shameful defeat in the three-year war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though half a century has passed since the ceasefire of the war that brought only death and disgrace to the boss of imperialists, the U.S. imperialists are persistently working to invade the DPRK, oblivious of the lesson taught by history. And their moves have reached their height today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the doctrine of aggression of the U.S. imperialists that in order to dominate the world they should conquer Asia and in order to bring Asia under their control they should swallow up Korea. On the basis of this doctrine they are making last-ditch efforts to start a war, while putting unprecedented military pressure upon the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But they will never succeed in their ambition to carry out their strategy for world domination at the sacrifice of the Koreans. If the U.S. imperialists provoke another Korean war at any cost the DPRK will mete out a thousand-fold punishment to the aggressors.    \r\n\r\n"

If a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula owing to the reckless military provocations of the U.S. imperialists, it will spill over into a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the Korean peninsula stands at the crossroads of war or peace, the entire Korean nation is responsible for defending peace and preventing a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is possible to defend the peace on the Korean peninsula and the security of the nation only when all the fellow countrymen in the north, the south and abroad turn out in the anti-U.S. and anti-war struggle as one. In order to prevent the danger of war before the nation and defend the peace of the country and the security of the nation at present all the Koreans should lift high the banner of the June 15 Joint Declaration and increase the might of national cooperation in every way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a key issue in protecting the peace on the Korean peninsula and the security of the nation to fully support the patriotic Songun policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A powerless nation has no right even to complain about aggressors' flagrant infringement upon its dignity and sovereignty. This is the tragic reality today when unilateralism and high-handed practices are rampant. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when a nation is strong enough to return clubbing for clubbing and gunfire for gunfire to emerge victorious is it possible to prevent any aggressors from mounting an attack on it and protect its sovereignty. The Korean nation has such strength and tremendous military muscle.    \r\n\r\n"

They laid bouquets before the tombs of 400 mothers and 102 children. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The speakers said that the u.s. imperialists killed peaceable people, one fourth of the population of Sinchon county and brutally murdered at least 4.2 million innocent Koreans in all parts of the country during the fatherland liberation war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Sinchon left a bloody lesson that illusion about the class enemy means death, they stressed, adding that if they are captivated by illusion about the enemy and peace, they can hardly defend their dignity and destinies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that the hair-trigger situation in which a new war may break out any time is prevailing in Korea and the second Korean war is becoming a reality, they called on all the young servicepersons to step up their preparations for a decisive battle with the U.S. imperialists in a do-or-die spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A resolution to vow revenge was adopted at the rally. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, revenge-vowing meetings, indignation meetings, oratorical meetings and meeting sessions took place at industrial establishments, cooperative farms and schools across the country and a large number of people visited the Sinchon Museum and the hall for class education on the same occasion. \r\n\r\n"
