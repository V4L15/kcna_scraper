It is, indeed, a fortunate thing.\r\n   The recent talks never proceeded with no difficulties. \r\nThe U.S. side hung up the talks, bringing forward the fiction of \"the building of underground structure\" and \"ballistic missile test.\"\r\n   The fiction was made by those ignorant of the realities.\r\n   The \"missile launching\" is false propaganda of U.S. side over the launch of an artificial satellite. The launch of artificial satellite is the internationally-recognised legitimate right of a sovereign state.\r\n   The U.S. loud-mouthed \"secret underground nuclear facility\" is nothing but an underground structure for civilian use. Therefore, there is no reason whatsoever to throw doubt on it.\r\n   The U.S. should not worry about this, but direct efforts to the implementation of the framework agreement.\r\n   If the U.S. side again goes back on its recent words as regards the construction of LWRS and the delivery of heavy oil, it will bring about irretrievably serious consequences. \r\n\r\n   \r\n"

Our socialism is a scientific socialism based on the Juche viewpoint toward man, popular masses, and it is the most viable socialism, he noted.\r\n   He stressed the need to defend to the end the Korean-style socialism centred on the masses, the life and soul of the Korean people, under Kim Jong Il's leadership.\r\n   Andria Velonandro An Selme, chairman of the Madagascan National Committee for the Study of the Juche Idea, said that what is important in actively supporting and encouraging the Korean people in their struggle to defend socialism is to wage a vigorous struggle for independence against impeiralism in each country.\r\n   No force on earth can block the dynamical onward movement of the popular masses who are advancing along the road of anti-imperialist independence, the road of socialism, he stated.

There is no reason why only a few particular countries can launch artificial satellites in an effort to use the space for peaceful purposes.\r\n   Japanese politicians ignorant of this internationally-recognised common sense still slander the DPRK. The slander cannot be construed otherwise than an act of betraying their ignorance.\r\n   Even after the news of the DPRK's launching of the artificial satellite was reported, they are claiming that it is a \"missile.\" judging from this, their insistence is not a product of their ignorance of international usage and common sense, but they seek in this to attain a political aim.\r\n   Japan began the development of artificial satellites from the 1960s. It has launched scores of artificial satellites up to this date from 1975.\r\n   On September 7 this year it launched a rocket under the pretext of exploring an ozone layer.\r\n   Worse still, a large number of mass destruction weapons of other countries are deployed in and around the territory of Japan.\r\n   Japanese politicians are claiming that their own missiles, artificial satellites and mass destruction weapons of other countries have no danger, but our own artificial satellite poses threat to peace and security, and so they cannot tolerate it.\r\n   Their claim is a brigandish sophism that cannot go down with anyone under the present international order the keynote of which is independence and equality.\r\n   If they are interested in peace and security in northeast Asia, they must first repent of their stepped-up building of Japan into a military power and apologize to the DPRK for slandering it.\r\n   If Japan continues acting rashly irrespective of international usage and its own lot, it will meet bitterer condemnation and curses from international community.\r\n   The Korean democratic lawyers association scathingly condemns Japanese politicians for making utterances wantonly violating the sovereignty and dignity of the DPRK, as well as international law and usage, over the DPRK's launching of artificial satellite, and presents their misbehaviour to the international community.\r\n   Japan must be aware of its own lot and act with discretion. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
