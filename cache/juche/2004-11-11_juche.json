            "content": "S. Korean Mandarin's Anti-North Remarks under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 10 (KCNA) -- Kim Hui Sang, chairman of the Emergency Planning Committee of south Korea, at a recent international forum groundlessly pulled up the DPRK, saying that the Korean Peninsula looks like a powder magazine and the north is little short of a tinderbox. He went the lengths of asserting that it is not likely to see the ultimate settlement of the north's nuclear issue unless the system of liberal democracy is established throughout the Korean Peninsula and no one can vouch that the north would not spark off another crisis even though an agreement is reached on the nuclear issue.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Wednesday in a signed commentary terms these extremely provocative and insulting remarks against the north and treacherous outbursts disclosing the already bankrupt anachronistic ambition to achieve reunification by prevailing over communism and absorbing the north in violation of the basic spirit of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The news analyst goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Not a few officials of south Korea have made hostile and provocative remarks against the north since the publication of the June 15 joint declaration but it is the first time that they directly cited the north as a root cause of war and openly cried out for reunification under the \"liberal democratic system\" at an international forum. What matters is that what he uttered reflects the stand of the south Korean authorities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He claimed his statement was made in his own capacity but now is the time for the south Korean authorities to publicly clarify their stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite obvious that Kim let loose such virulent anti-DPRK vituperation under the influence of the U.S. and the ultra-right conservative forces within the \"Grand National Party\" and Uri Party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is deplorable, indeed, that obsessed with an anachronistic pipedream, the south Korean authorities still let such anti-communist fanatics as Kim remain in office. It is hard to expect any improvement in the inter-Korean relations unless they do away with such hostile attitude toward their fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should apologize for having laid a stumbling block in the way of improving the north-south relations, immediately stop inciting confrontation with the north and sternly punish those responsible for this smear campaign.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The national self-esteem of the Korean people grew stronger as they acclaimed President Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il as the leaders of the nation and the Koreans came to demonstrate its dignity to the world as a great nation blessed with the peerlessly great men. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The national self-esteem of the Koreans means a strong spirit of national independence, the spirit of setting store by the national dignity and carving out the destiny of the nation by its own efforts, and the unshakable resolution and firm will not to allow anyone to hurt the national dignity even a bit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and the people of the DPRK won brilliant victories in the two revolutionary wars against the formidable imperialist enemies and built a powerful socialist state, independent in politics, self-supporting in economy and self-reliant in defence, despite all sorts of pressure of dominationist forces. This is a shining fruition of the spirit of national independence. The Workers' Party of Korea regarded the national character as a foundation and fully applied it to the struggle to achieve great national unity and national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the national mettle of the Korean people not to allow anyone to infringe upon the sovereignty and dignity of the nation even a bit. The Korean people are fully demonstrating the national dignity and might in the great Songun era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unshakable is the will of the Korean nation to settle the difficult situation prevailing on the Korean Peninsula and put spurs to the development of the national history through national cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is leaving no means untried to arrest the Korean nation's cause of independent reunification and realize its ambition to dominate the whole of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. moves can never be tolerated as they are prompted by its national chauvinist tendency of looking down upon and despising the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans should have pride and self-confidence that the Korean nation is the best and strong national self-esteem that they can do anything when they get united under the banner of the Korean nation-first spirit.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And the books expound in a profound way that it is their revolutionary conviction, obligation, conscience and ardent love for the country and the nation. They also stress that it is thanks to the trust in and love for them of the fatherland and nation, kith and kin and the deep care of President  Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In \"Blessing\" the hero who had been regarded as \"human scum\" and \"old bachelor\" owing to electric and other brutal torture, began living a happy life as the father of Chuk Bok (blessing) after being sent to the north of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The third volume of the musical book carries 18 pieces of music for piano solo based on famous songs and folk songs and the fourth 30 pieces based on children's songs and folk songs.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"
