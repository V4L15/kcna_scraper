            "content": "Rodong Sinmun Observes Youth Day \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 28 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today dedicates an editorial to the Youth Day.\r\n The editorial says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean youth movement was started by President Kim Il Sung and it has made steady progress along the right path indicated by him. Leader Kim Jong Il has successfully carried forward the policy of attaching importance to the youth pursued by the President all his life and developed this movement in depth at a new higher stage.\r\n Under the leadership of Kim Jong Il the Korean youth movement has entered a new stage of development and the ideological and moral traits of the youths have reached the highest level something rare to be seen elsewhere. It is great pride of the Workers' Party of Korea, the country and the people to have millions of passionate youths capable of successfully carrying forward the tradition of Juche, the reliable young vanguard of the WPK well educated and trained under the care of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il.\r\n All the young people should always remember the deep trust of the Party and the great expectation of the people and devote themselves with intense loyalty, patriotic dedication, youthful energies and wisdom to the drive to glorify socialist Korea built by the President and being led by Kim Jong Il as a great prosperous powerful nation of Juche, the best one in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should add luster to the glorious tradition of devotedly defending the revolutionary headquarters and uphold the Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il with loyalty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the young Koreans devotedly defending the leader means most ardent patriotism and the greatest exploits and the Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il means the first lifeline of the Korean youth movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should trust and follow leader Kim Jong Il as their father and the sun of the revolution in any adversity and prepare themselves as human bullets and bombs who regard it as their unshakable faith and pure conscience to protect the leader at the cost of their lives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All our young men and women should fully display their virile energies and courage and militancy on all fronts and at the posts of socialist construction to demonstrate their honor of being the vanguard and shock brigade. They should, at the same time, steadily cultivate and train themselves to have noble mental and moral traits as the younger generation for the Juche revolution and the young people in the Songun era.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is, at the same time, a Juche-oriented line of socialist economic construction as it makes it possible to protect the dignity and authority of the country and give full play to the advantages and might of socialism in all aspects under the banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said line means a successful inheritance and development of the basic line of socialist economic construction laid down and consistently maintained by President Kim Il Sung. The line is a revolutionary one to protect the dignity of the country and the nation and defend socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il has wisely led the drive to bolster the military power of the country in every way and further develop the national defense industry with his energetic Songun revolutionary leadership for the last 45 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to the wise guidance provided by Kim Jong Il who set forth the unique line of economic construction in the Songun era and steered the work to implement it, the national defense industry in the DPRK has become powerful enough to produce modern offensive and defensive means and any military hardware and combat equipment of Korean type. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The line is the most popular one for providing the Korean people with a happy and bountiful life and a strategic line for building a rich and powerful country of Korean style by their own efforts, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"

They will have to own full responsibility for the undesirable consequences to be entailed by the worst deterioration of the bilateral relations, warns Minju Joson Saturday in a signed commentary.\r\n The Japan Liberal Democratic Party claimed that there can never be any normalization of the relations between Japan and the DPRK without a solution to the \"abduction issue,\" proposing the application of economic sanctions against the DPRK as one of its important political commitments to stay in power, the commentary says, and goes on: The DPRK can never overlook the Japanese reactionaries' move to use its anti-DPRK conspiratorial plot for their wicked farce aimed at staying in power.\r\n There is no reason for them to pull up the DPRK as regards the heated scramble for power kicked off by the rejection of the bills related to the postal privatization. The reactionaries' recent manifestation of their hostile stand on the DPRK clearly reflects the wicked mentality of those accustomed to meeting their own interests at the sacrifice of others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The approach taken by the LDP politicians towards the general election clearly shows the real picture of the Japanese politicaldom full of pseudo politicians who seek power only, utterly indifferent to the progress of the people and the country, the commentary says, urging the Japanese reactionaries to face up to the gravity of the situation and refrain from their rash acts.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This, at the same time, indicates that the U.S. policy to bring down the \"system\" in the DPRK has gone over to the phase of practice from the legislative phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such U.S. behavior is a very disturbing act as it is little short of challenging the DPRK which has shown generous magnanimity and flexibility for a solution to the nuclear issue and an act of throwing a hurdle in the way of the six-party talks.\r\n The U.S. seems not to be interested in the dialogue and the settlement of the nuclear issue at all but more keen on standing in confrontation with the DPRK and bringing about a \"regime change\" and \"bringing down the system\" in the DPRK.\r\n If the U.S. persists in such behavior, it will compel the DPRK to change its mind. The U.S. should abolish at once such unreasonable post of \"envoy\" and abandon its ambition to \"bring down system in the DPRK.\"    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
