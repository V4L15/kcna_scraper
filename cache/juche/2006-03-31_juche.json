            "content": "U.S.- S. Korea Joint Military Exercises Slammed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed commentary. It goes on:\r\n These war maneuvers are a preliminary war and a test nuclear war designed to finally examine and round off the preparations for a war against the north and mount a preemptive nuclear attack on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This large-scale saber-rattling cannot but be a very dangerous development as it is timed to coincide with the U.S. ever-increasing pressure and escalating conspiratorial plots against the DPRK. \r\n The U.S. has not only tightened its financial sanctions against the DPRK and intensified the \"human rights\" offensive against it but escalated its smear campaign against Pyongyang. As if it were not enough with these moves, it is crying out for a preemptive attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is due to the frantic moves of the U.S. against the DPRK that the six-party talks still remain stalled and confrontation and tensions are festering on the Korean Peninsula.\r\n The DPRK has already warned the U.S. and south Korea against the serious consequences to be entailed by these war gambles and strongly demanded a halt to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a matter of fact, the U.S. imperialists' saber-rattling has made the prospects of the peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue and the six-party talks gloomier, thrown more obstacles to the process of improving the inter-Korean relations and compelled the north to postpone the inter-Korean ministerial talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are a chief disturber of peace, a chieftain of war and a cursed foe of national unity and the reunification of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will stake their lives at the dignity of the nation and the cause of reunification and frustrate the intention of the United States and its allies to invade the DPRK, going against the desire of the Korean nation and the trend of the times, the commentary concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean Men of Literature and Art Vow to Struggle against Expansion of U.S. Forces Base \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 30 (KCNA) -- A \"literary and art festival for peace\" and a \"candle-light cultural festival\" reportedly took place in Taechu-ri, Phyongthaek City, Kyonggi Province in south Korea on Mar. 25.

It is the consistent military policy and strategic target of the U.S. imperialists to bolster up nuclear forces and hold nuclear supremacy, the article says, and goes on:\r\n The U.S. imperialists, considering nukes as almighty means for establishing world domination order, are threatening other countries with them and bringing in dark clouds of a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. application of double-standards to the nuclear issue finds its expression in conniving, patronizing and assisting its allies' development and production of nuclear weapons while kicking up a row of pressure on those countries whose ideology and system are different from its own over the \"nuclear issue\".                                  The U.S. is applying double-standards to the nuclear issue according to state relations with itself and its strategic interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. double-dealing attitude in the nuclear issue is a revelation of its unilateralism and highhandedness. Its unreasonable behavior weakens the binding force of the NPT and drives the world to a nuclear arms race. Its nuclear highhandedness reduces the NPT to a good-for-nothing and eggs nuclear-free countries to have nuclear means. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is talking about \"non-proliferation\" while stepping up nuclear arms buildup and modernization and openly pursuing a nuclear war because it has a sinister intension to make anti-imperialist and independent countries victims of its nuclear hard-line policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. anti-DPRK campaign over the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula is a typical example of its application of double-standards to the nuclear issue.\r\n It is the unfair application of double-standards that the U.S. is scheming to completely check the peaceful nuclear activities of the DPRK, while announcing that it will provide nuclear technique and fuel to some countries outside the NPT.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
