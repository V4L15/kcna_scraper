            "content": "Meeting of Members of Young Vanguard for Songun Revolution Held  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 28 (KCNA) -- A meeting of members of the young vanguard for the Songun revolution was held at the People's Palace of Culture Wednesday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The meeting serves as an important occasion in demonstrating the revolutionary spirit and will of the Korean youth who are dynamically advancing toward the bright future of a great prosperous powerful socialist nation and in enhancing the vanguard role of youth in the general advance for the Songun revolution, taking the lead in upholding the Songun leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The meeting discussed the tasks for the youth to glorify their honor as a first-line death-defying corps, a reserve combat unit and a special detachment of the supreme commander whose members defend the headquarters of the revolution at the cost of their lives and creditably discharge their mission and duty as the young vanguard in the general charge for attaining the peak of building a great prosperous powerful socialist nation and the ways to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The meeting was attended by Kim Yong Nam, Kim Il Chol, Choe Thae Bok and other officials and youth and students and officials of the youth league who rendered distinguished services in the general march for the Songun revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A congratulatory message of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea to the participants in the meeting was conveyed by Kim Yong Nam, president of the Presidium of the DPRK Supreme People's Assembly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The message highly praised the participants in the meeting and all other young people across the country for having strikingly demonstrated the spirit and bravery of the young vanguard by taking the lead in upholding the Party's Songun leadership and bearing the brunt of all fronts for building a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The message expressed the belief that all the participants in the meeting and all other young people across the country would fully demonstrate the heroic spirit of members of the young vanguard for the Songun revolution in the general advance for building a great prosperous powerful socialist nation, single-heartedly rallied around Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Kyong Ho, first secretary of the Central Committee of the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League, made a report to be followed by speeches. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter said that President Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il led the Korean youth movement to victory so that the youth could play a vanguard role in accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went on to say: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The undying feats Kim Jong Il has performed by putting the position of the youth in the great Songun era on the highest level and leading the youth league to increase its vanguard role and thereby bringing about a victory to be recorded in the national history will shine forever along with the glorious history of the Songun revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He called on the youth to defend and further glorify the undying feats performed by the three generals of Mt.

But, a few days later, in a \"government's answer\" to a question of the Diet, his cohorts reversed his remarks and totally denied the historical fact, claiming that \"there is no evidence of forcible drafting\" of a great number of \"comfort women\" by the Japanese army during the Second World War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on this, a Rodong Sinmun analyst Wednesday says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This behavior of the Abe group resorting to every conceivable artifice to stamp out in history the past crimes in forcing women into sexual servitude at any cost reveals the craftiness peculiar to the Japanese. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For Abe and his cohorts to deny the coercion in drafting \"comfort women\" for the imperial Japanese army is a preposterous and paradoxical argument and insult to and mockery of the victims to the drafting and world conscience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There were a great many wars recorded in history. However, only Japan committed extra-large inhuman crimes, taking a lot of women to battlefields in groups as sexual slaves on the instructions of the government and military and with their involvement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n History and truth cannot be distorted or wiped out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The harder Japan denies the forced drafting of \"comfort women\" for the Japanese army and distorts its crime-woven history, the clearer it reveals its moral vulgarity and filthy conscience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a rule of conduct and right behavior to frankly admit crimes and sincerely reflect on and apologize for them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Western Powers' Arms Build-up Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 28 (KCNA) -- The Western powers including the U.S. and their allies have become more frantic in their moves to modernize and develop military hardware and step up arms build-up in a bid to hold military supremacy and realize their ambition for world domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson Wednesday observes in a signed commentary in this regard: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The job to bolster military capacity is, by no means, a monopoly of a specified country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is self-evident that the moves of some countries to qualitatively bolster their military muscles cannot but be an issue of concern to those countries concerned as they are intertwined with one another politically and geographically. That is why many countries are sensitively responding to the Western powers' attempt to hold military supremacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is elementary common sense that any military measure taken by any country to go unchallenged in the military field would upset the military equilibrium among countries, spark off military mistrust and threat and increase the danger of a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It is the only way for any country to survive in this world today to build its own strength now that the hegemonic forces seek to seize other countries by force and put them under their domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another war has not yet broken out on the Korean Peninsula where the interests of big powers are intertwined and the hegemonic forces have revealed their attempt to put the DPRK under their military domination. This is entirely thanks to the DPRK which has paid due attention to building strength to defend itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will exercise its legitimate right to self-defence as long as the hegemonic forces' hostile policy toward it goes on and Northeast Asia is exposed to the danger of a war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They are bringing the chill of distrust and confrontation to the DPRK-U.S. and inter-Korean relations which have entered upon the road of reconciliation and improvement and driving the situation to a phase of tension. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite nonsense that the U.S. stages joint war games with south Korea to counter \"threat\" from someone. They are obviously maneuvers to mount an attack on the DPRK. And they are very dangerous acts of war provocation to invade the DPRK unawares while showing off strength and presenting threat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The RSOI and Foal Eagle are a highly dangerous play with fire against the DPRK replacing in scale, nature and content the \"Team Spirit\" joint military exercises which were a three dimensional nuclear test war and a preliminary war. The U.S. itself makes it plain that it has not changed its hostile policy toward the DPRK by staging the war rehearsals which, at the slightest slip, might destroy the climate of the relaxation of tension in a moment and throw the whole of Korean Peninsula into the vortex of a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-DPRK war exercises of the U.S. and south Korean warmongers seriously threaten the process of peace and reconciliation on the Korean Peninsula. The Korean nation and the world peace-loving people will never tolerate the developments.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

And they said that it was a deserved judgment given to the \"government\" which has so far had the humiliating negotiations with the U.S. while turning aside from the interests and will of the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They warned that the people would in unity wage a struggle urging the \"government\" to resign, if it insists on the conclusion of FTA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the rally speakers said that if the agreement is concluded the south Korean media would be shackled to the U.S. media. They stressed that it would be possible to check the conclusion of the humiliating agreement when over 18,000 unionists struggle in firm unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A declaration of struggle was read out at the rally. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the rally the participants staged a demonstration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the same day members of other civic and public organizations in south Korea conducted information activities in Seoul, calling upon the citizens to turn out in the struggle against the conclusion of FTA.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It oppresses and tramples down the countries that differ from it in ideology and system and disobey its orders with the military force. Such practices are a wanton violation of the international laws and an act against history hindering the sound development of the international relations. That is why the international community has called for breaking the old international order, which allows specific countries' policy of strength and high-handed practices, and establishing a new, fair international order. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists' policy of strength is a criminal act of seriously threatening and wrecking the global peace and security and giving rise to the arms race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is entirely attributable to this policy that peace has been wrecked and tension aggravated in different parts of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Moves for arms race are being intensified in different parts of the world as the imperialists have massively produced and deployed nuclear weapons and other modern war means and hardware, increasing the military spending. Today's reality indicates that new Cold War and nuclear arms race are near at hand. As long as the imperialists' policy of strength is allowed it is impossible to realize the aspiration of humankind after independence and peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists' policy of strength is not an expression of their mightiness but a revelation of their vulnerability and it is no more than a last-ditch effort of those on the brink of ruin.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
