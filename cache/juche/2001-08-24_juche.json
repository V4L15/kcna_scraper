This once again proves victims' testimonies that refugees there were strafed in those days were truth.    \r\n \r\n"

Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 24 (KCNA) -- Papers here today carry commentaries on the \"Ulji Focus Lens\" joint military exercise against the DPRK staged by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean warmongers.\r\n The military exercise is a test and preliminary war for invasion of the north in its character, programme and scale, Rodong Sinmun in a signed commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We cannot but take a serious view of all sorts of military drills against the DPRK staged by the South Korean military authorities together with the U.S. to cool down the nation's desire for reunification and incite confrontation and war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a premeditated crime to make a provocation against the north and block the implementation of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a concentrated expression of their criminal ambition to bring the north-south relations back to a state of confrontation which was before the adoption of the joint declaration and, furthermore, to harm the north in collusion with the U.S. imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The foolish act of hampering national reconciliation and reunification and levelling guns at the fellow countrymen in defiance of the spirit of the north-south joint declaration  can be done only by those traitors and warmongers who do not want the development of the north-south relations and the reunification of the country and depend on the foreign forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is our firm will to drive the U.S. aggression troops out of South Korea and reunify the country independently and peacefully with the united efforts of the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We declare once again that from the viewpoint of our important mission for the country and the nation we will never allow the aggressive foreign forces and the traitors to harm us in league with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson says that the South Korean warmongers should know that their joining in the U.S. imperialists' moves for a war of aggression on the north precipitates their self-destruction.    \r\n\r\n"

Deeply touched to see the performance, many Koreans turned out in the struggle against the Japanese imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was Kim Jong Il who discovered the original work of \"Sea of Blood\" and developed it as a model revolutionary opera. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He set it as the germ of the idea of the opera to turn the victims to the bloody repression into brave fighters and provided meticulous guidance to the creation of the opera. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary opera \"Sea of Blood\" was thus completed in a matter of months. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Stanzaic songs, Pangchang, dances and successive three-dimensional stage decor were introduced to the opera quite different from the preceding operas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary opera \"Sea of Blood\" opened a new history of creation of genuine operas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The subsequent period witnessed the creation and performance of a series of other \"Sea of Blood\" style operas in the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
