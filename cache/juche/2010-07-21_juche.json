This clearly testifies to the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il who has consistently laid main emphasis on the idea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His work serves as important guidelines that should be cherished not only by the Korean people but also the parties and the peoples of all countries aspiring after socialism."
