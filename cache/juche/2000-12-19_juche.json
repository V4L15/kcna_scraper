            "content": "Kim Jong Il directs land realignment project in South Hwanghae Province \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 19 (KCNA) -- General Secretary  Kim Jong Il on Monday gave on-site guidance to the land leveling and realignment project in South Hwanghae Province. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went round Yonan and Chongdan counties and other parts of the province and acquainted himself in detail with the progress of land realignment project. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Feasting his eyes on the vast expanse of standardized fields, he was greatly satisfied to note that soldier-builders and people intensely loyal to the party and the revolution have done a lot of work in such a short span of time by fully displaying the revolutionary spirit of fortitude, the revolutionary spirit of soldiers, and highly praised their proud feats. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then he advanced highly important tasks that would serve as a guideline in accelerating the socialist rural construction including land realignment and bringing about a radical turn in agricultural production. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that the land leveling and rezoning project started by our party is an important work to obtain new arable land for increased grain output and realize the comprehensive mechanization of agriculture, he stressed the work should be dynamically pushed forward without a let-up through a mass drive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that rich experience has been gained through the land realignment projects in Kangwon, north Phyongan and south Hwanghae provinces it is possible to realign the land across the country in a short span of time if the organizational and political work is conducted among the masses in keeping with a high degree of their revolutionary enthusiasm, he said, urging all the provinces, cities and counties to work hard to finish the land realignment by their own efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He also set forth tasks to be fulfilled to increase the grain output in the realigned paddy and non-paddy fields. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Learning about the specific agricultural situation of the province, he said it is very important to boost agriculture in the province, the largest granary of the country. And he urged industrial establishments and other relevant units to satisfactorily supply necessary farm materials to it in time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The province is favorable for double cropping as its soil is fertile and climate mild, he said, pointing out that no portion of this precious land should remain idle and double cropping should be introduced on a large scale with main stress on grain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then he put forth tasks to be carried out to build all rural villages well as befitting socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that officials and agricultural workers in the province have done a lot of work to implement the \"theses on the socialist rural question in our country\", he earnestly called for turning all the rural villages into modern socialist villages good to work and live in so as to hand them down to posterity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Accompanying him were secretary Kim Kuk Thae, department director Jong Ha Chol and first deputy department directors Pak Song Bong and Jang Song Thaek of the Worker's Party of Korea Central Committee and generals of the Korean People's Army Hyon Chol Hae and Pak Jae Gyong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the spot he was received by vice marshal of the KPA Ri Yong Mu, chief secretary of the south Hwanghae provincial committee of the WPK Kim Un Gi, Col. Gen. of the KPA Sim Myong Su, vice-Minister of Agriculture Choe Sang Byok and leading officials of the province and counties. \r\n\r\n"

They are a sinister behavior to shift the blame onto war veterans, it held. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement urged the South Korean authorities to announce the results of the investigation into the case at once and take a strong counteraction against the U.S. side seeking to twist the incident. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "History of 20th century indicts Japan \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 19 (KCNA) -- The 20th century is about to come to its end. At this historic turn of the century people retrospect the history of the world wars in the 20th century which brought greatest-ever disasters to humankind and most cruelly violated civilization and hope that there would be no such wars any more. At this moment, the international community is increasingly vigilant against Japan. This is due to its inglorious past and present and its untransparent future agenda. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the first half of the century Japan killed tens of millions of Asians through wars of plunder and aggression and in its latter half it employed all sorts of gimmicks to keep its hideous crimes buried in oblivion of the history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is none other than Japan which is about to greet a new century without liquidating its past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The bitter Asian history of the 20th century started with the Japanese imperialists' military invasion of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists, afraid of being embroiled in the scourge of a hopeless war if the Korean people rise up in anti-Japanese war of resistance, hatched the most wicked plot in the world history of diplomacy to topple the weak feudal government of Ri dynasty. That was the fabricated \"Ulsa five-point treaty\" and \"Korea-Japan annexation treaty.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n History records such examples as threatening other countries by force of arms to force them to sign shackling treaties but has never witnessed such despicable things done by Japan. It stole the official seal of a government institution of other country and forged the signature of its head of state to fabricate a treaty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After depriving Korea of its national rights by such a vicious method Japan enforced a colonial military fascist rule over it for over 40 years. In that period it kidnapped or took away over six million young and middle-aged Koreans to force them into medieval slave labor and killed millions of Koreans by the most cruel methods. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists kidnapped nearly 200,000 Korean women in broad daylight and forced them into sexual slavery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTheir brutal mass killings of those women in battle sites are still fresh in the memory of people as a horrible nightmare. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The international community hates Japan so much for its crimes related to the \"comfort women for the army\" because they were the most despicable and barbarous crimes against humanity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities, proud of being an economic power, are showing their moneybags off everywhere they go. But there is a point at issue which should never go unnoticed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The point is with whose blood, sweat and wealth the foundation for the industrial progress of Japan which boasts of \"high-rate growth\" was laid. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During Japan's rule over Korea over six million young and middle-aged people were taken to Japan to slave there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nJapanese big businesses grew fat with the immeasurably precious treasures looted from Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists, not satisfied with the plunder of all the material and cultural properties of Korea including underground resources and cultural relics, took away even brass spoons and chopsticks from Korean families. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the last Korean War which broke out in 1950 Japan raked up enormous profits in return for its direct involvement in the war and the offer of its whole territory to the U.S. armed forces as a logistic base. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, Japan's offer of its whole territory to the Korean people would not be enough to compensate for the human, material and cultural and spiritual and moral losses it brought to them for a century from early 20th century up to this date. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But in Japan at the turn of the century there is a Samurai view of history that \"there is no need to feel guilty for what was done in the past\" and \"it is possible to know the truth of history only 100 years later.\" And even arrogant remarks that the military fascist colonial rule over Korea was \"legal\" are heard from there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japanese right-wing forces' denial of their history of aggression and crimes is not simply attributable to Japan's deep-seated bad habits and shameless nature. This was prompted by their ambition and carefully arranged plan to repeat their past history any time at any cost and realize their old dream of \"Greater East Asia Coprosperity sphere.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their other purpose is to evade the state compensation for Japan's crimes against humanity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities have made a mockery of the international community with all sorts of wordplays for over 50 years since the end of World War II. They pretended to apologize for the crimes with the words \"regret\" and \"repentance,\" but retracted them by saying \"there is no need to make apology\" and \"what Japan did was legal.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan announced that it fully compensated to the south east Asian countries by giving them small \"aid,\" grant or in the form of \"loan.\" It dreamed up a poor case of \"suspected kidnapping\" in a bid to evade the apology and compensation to the Korean people and is about to see out the 20th century with its crimes unsettled, clamoring about \"people's sentiment.\" This is a height of shamelessness and moral vulgarity of the Japanese authorities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities are grossly mistaken if they think that they can erase unprecedented killings, rape, kidnapping and plunder committed by the Japanese imperialists against the Korean people by playing tricks over the issue of \"a few persons missing\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should be judged by justice and history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history indicts Japan for its crimes. Japan is a war criminal state of the 20th century and the only \"enemy state\" which is going to greet the 21st century without settling its war crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history of the 20th century will always curse disgraceful Japan which adamantly refuses to repent of the wrongs done for a century. \r\n\r\n"
