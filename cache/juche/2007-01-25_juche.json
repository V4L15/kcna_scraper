            "content": "KAPPC on Its Stand on Tour of Kaesong \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 24 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Korean Asia-Pacific Peace Committee (KAPPC) gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA Wednesday as regards south Korean media's misinformation about the issue of tour of Kaesong:\r\n South Korean media released misinformation that the KAPPC withdrew its policy of dealing with Lotte tourist business over the issue of tour of Kaesong and took the stand of dealing with Hyundai Asan over the tour of Kaesong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In an effort to make this sound plausible the media reported that the KAPPC informed the former minister of Unification on a visit to the Kaesong Industrial Zone on December 8 last year of this and gave Hyundai Asan \"a positive message over the issue of tour of Kaesong\" at a meeting with it at Mt. Kumgang Resort. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a false report that does not deserve even a passing note. But the KAPPC is compelled to clarify its stand as they are engrossed in the smear campaign against the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said misinformation released by south Korean media all at once cannot be interpreted otherwise than a mean diatribe made by the authorities in collusion with high fliers and tricksters of Hyundai Asan who stoop to any infamy to meet their business interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KAPPC has remained true to the bilateral good faith, invariably considering national reconciliation and unity as the basic purpose of inter-Korean economic cooperation undertakings including the dealing with Hyundai Asan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The upper crust of Hyundai, however, forgot the privileges and benefits granted to it by the KAPPC, playing into the hands of those high fliers and tricksters, and behaved quite contrary to the ties of trust and friendship maintained by its predecessor with KAPPC for years. This compelled the KAPPC to totally reexamine the business with Hyundai and decide to stop dealing with it over the tour of Kaesong which was high on the agenda. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Hyundai side deeply repented and apologized to the KAPPC side for its wrong doings several times and assured the latter of taking measures against the recurrence of similar things. \r\n The KAPPC treated the Hyundai side with magnanimity and favor, considering that it made a shift in its stand and attitude. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality, however, proves that the Hyundai side's words of apology and repentance were no more than hypocrisy and that the high fliers and tricksters inside Hyundai are still keen to lead the cooperation with the KAPPC in a wrong direction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KAPPC has no formal agreement with the Hyundai side over the issue of tour of Kaesong and, moreover, there was no agreement with the latter in this regard in recent days. The KAPPC's stand is consistent and it feels no need to examine or consider any change.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Hyundai side and the south Korean authorities should tell the whole story of the recent case, make honest apology and assure the KAPPC of taking measures against the recurrence of a similar case, bearing deep in mind that any plot hatched contrary to the main objective and purport of the north-south cooperation undertakings would only make it impossible for any cooperation undertaking with the KAPPC to make smooth progress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KAPPC, at the same time, cannot but take issue with the groundless smear campaign launched by south Korean media and the biased stand of the conservative media including the Dong-A Ilbo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should not swim against the trend of the times if they are not in a position to lead the trend of the times as required by the original mission of media at a time when the desire for national reconciliation and unity is growing stronger. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-reunification conservative media keen on inciting mistrust and confrontation among the fellow countrymen only cannot meet the need of the June 15 era of reunification and, accordingly, will not be able to escape ruin, censured by the nation and history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KAPPC will closely watch the future attitude of the Hyundai Asan and the south Korean authorities.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is not aimed to guarantee security through the elimination of nuclear weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear weapons should be reduced not through the modernization of nuclear warheads but through a phased and comprehensive cutback. The U.S. modernization of nuclear weapons would only increase the danger of a nuclear war and put world peace at greater peril. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. much publicized \"nuclear non-proliferation\" is nothing but hypocrisy. Humankind is exposed to a serious danger of nuclear war due to the reckless moves for a nuclear war of the U.S. imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a result the Korean Peninsula is fraught with the world's biggest danger of a nuclear war. The U.S. imperialists are keen to provoke a nuclear war in Korea. In order to cope with such situation the Korean people have boosted the self-reliant defence capability in every way under the banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The bellicose Bush forces' reckless moves for the modernization of nuclear weapons are as foolish an act as disturbing their own security. The U.S. imperialists would be well advised to get rid of their nuclear hysteria, urges the commentary.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

If one backs down in the revolutionary principle when building socialism, one cannot build it successfully to suit the fundamental interests of the people and, worse still, the existence of socialism itself is endangered. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary principle is the life and soul of the independent people because it is the basic guarantee for defending the sovereignty of the country and the nation, smashing the strong-arm and arbitrary practices of the imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists are getting more virulent in their strong-arm and arbitrary practices and infringement upon others' sovereignty. Consequently, the sovereignty of many countries is gravely sapped and violated and peace is harassed and wrecked. The U.S. imperialists, in particular, resort to state terrorism, undisguised aggression and war, nuclear threat and strong-arm actions against sovereign states and interference in their domestic affairs, taking no account of the United Nations and international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One should maintain the revolutionary principle in the standoff with imperialism, if he wants to defend the sovereignty of the country and the nation, smashing the imperialists' strong-arm and arbitrary practices. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The destiny of the country and the nation can be safeguarded only when the ideological and cultural infiltration of the imperialists is opposed with the revolutionary ideological offensive and strength with strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people of the DPRK have firmly defended Korean-style socialism in the standoff with the U.S. imperialists, invariably adhering to the revolutionary principle in the building of socialism. This struggle teaches the truth that the revolutionary principle is the life and soul of the independent people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The important lesson drawn by the DPRK people in the showdown with the U.S. is that they can defend socialism and display the dignity of the country and the nation only when they put up an unflinching fight with a super-tough stance, never yielding nor stepping back with regard to the revolutionary principle in the standoff with the enemies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  One comes off the victor when he maintains the revolutionary principle and the loser when he discards it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a by-lined article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Building an economic power is an important work to augment the national power in every way, above all, and thus turn the country into an invincible power.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Economy serves as a material basis of political independence and the political independence of the country would be unthinkable without its powerful economic potential. Only when a party and a state building socialism depend on powerful economic potential of the state, can they shape a line and policies according to their own viewpoint and belief and dynamically push ahead with socialist construction in the interests of their revolution and people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when a country augments its economic potential and demonstrates the advantages of socialism in the development of economy while giving priority to the ideological work is it possible to better prepare its people as one strong in idea, possessed of high national self-esteem and firm faith in socialism, and consolidate the ideological position of a rich and powerful country like an invulnerable fortress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The state's powerful economic potential provides a basis of the defense industry. It can manufacture modern weapons and combat and technical equipment necessary for a modern war only when it develops its defence industry on the basis of the solid economic foundation. The whole army has been modernized and all the people have been placed under arms in the DPRK. This reality is a striking demonstration of the might of the nation's economic foundation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Building an economic power is also important for significantly improving the standard of the people's living to enable them to live in happiness with nothing to desire more in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Success in building a great prosperous powerful socialist nation in all aspects by improving the standard of the people's living depends on how to build an economic power. It is impossible to materialize an ambitious plan and project for the improvement of the standard of the people's living unless material conditions for doing so are provided. It is an important guarantee for enabling the people to enjoy an affluent and highly civilized material and cultural life to build an economic power based on its solid economic foundation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It terms this action an entirely unreasonable one and a despicable fascist action intended to stem the trend of the times towards national reconciliation and unity and reunification,\r\n It was a righteous act conducive to national reconciliation and unity and reunification for the members of Jongyojo to have posted articles praising the Songun policy of the DPRK on Internet sites, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To incriminate those who praised the Songun policy which serves as a treasured sword for protecting the nation and realizing the desire for reunification and patriotism aimed at defending the security of the nation, exalting its dignity and paving a wide avenue for independent reunification, is, to all intents and purposes, a traitorous act of quelling the desire of the Koreans to protect the dignity and interests of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The whirlwind of the arrest of the above-said members is nothing but a link in the chain of the actions taken by the security authorities to stamp out Jongyojo, regarding the reunification-oriented education conducted by it as a thorn in their flesh. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary warns the south Korean security authorities to halt their silly and reckless actions to stem the trend of the times towards national reconciliation and unity and reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
