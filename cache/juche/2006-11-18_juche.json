            "content": "DPRK Stand to Contribute to Peace and Security in Asia Clarified \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tehran, November 15 (KCNA) -- The parliamentarians representing the voices of the Asian people, aware of the sense of responsibility as the master of the continent, should thoroughly reject the moves of the hegemonic forces to stamp out the history, culture and tradition of Asia, place the common denominators above their differences and demonstrate the united strength of the region in one voice in the international arena under the slogan of solidarity, peace and justice of Asia. Choe Thae Bok, chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly of the DPRK, who is leading the delegation of the DPRK to the 7th Assembly of the Association of Asian Parliaments for Peace held in Iran, declared this in a speech at its plenary meeting on Nov. 13.\r\n He said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The struggle of the Korean people to achieve the reunification and denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is now facing a grave challenge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration, in particular, openly listed the DPRK as part of an \"axis of evil\" and a target of preemptive nuclear attack and has since escalated the threat and pressure upon the DPRK such as staging nuclear war exercises and imposing financial sanctions against it, bringing to light an attempt to bring down its social system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the extremely tense situation where the supreme interests and security of the DPRK were seriously threatened it successfully conducted on Oct. 9 an underground nuclear test under secure conditions as an exercise of its sovereign right to self-defence to cope with the U.S. nuclear threat, sanctions and pressure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will surely force the Bush administration to own its historic responsibility for having torpedoed the process of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It remains unchanged in its stand to peacefully realize the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula through dialogue and negotiation though it was compelled to conduct the nuclear test by the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the DPRK has already clarified, its nuclear weapons are war deterrent for self-defence to cope with the U.S. nuclear threat and sanctions which have reached an extreme phase and it will feel no need to keep even a single nuke if the U.S. ceases its nuclear threat and sanctions against the DPRK in a verifiable and trustworthy manner.\r\n Availing ourselves of this opportunity, we express thanks to the Asian people who sent support and solidarity to our people in their struggle for the peace, reunification and denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and believe that the invariable will of the DPRK for the denuclearization and the independent option of its people to protect the supreme interests of the state will receive well-deserved respect. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will as always unite close with the Asian people and make a positive contribution to peace, security, independent development and prosperity of Asia.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Since then the Korean nation had suffered unbearable humiliation, maltreatment, cruel sacrifices and misfortune, the distress and tragedy as a ruined nation for more than 40 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the occupation of Korea the Japanese imperialists unhesitatingly committed the most hideous crimes against humanity in history. They massacred at least one million innocent Koreans, forcibly drafted more than 8.4 million Koreans to impose slave labor upon them and forced more than 200,000 Korean women into \"sexual slavery\" for the Japanese aggressor army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They severely destroyed and looted precious cultural treasures and natural resources of Korea and made no scruple of depriving the Koreans of their written and spoken languages and their own names in a bid to enslave them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their fabrication of the \"Ulsa Five-Point Treaty\" and colonial domination over Korea were the most brigandish and hideous state-sponsored crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is obliged to apologize and compensate for the crimes committed against the Koreans in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, Japan has worked hard to beautify and justify the hideous state-sponsored crimes committed in the past, instead of reflecting on them and making an apology for them before the Koreans and other peoples of the world. It is keen to stage a comeback to Korea, distorting history and eyeing even its inviolable territory including Tok Islet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is more desperately pursuing its hostile policy towards the DPRK, zealously joining the U.S. in its sanctions and pressure upon it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans including the south Koreans should more dynamically turn out in a more dynamic anti-Japanese struggle to force Japan to redeem all the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists against the Korean nation and frustrate the Japanese reactionaries' moves for reinvasion so that they may not suffer the same disgrace and ordeals as the Koreans did in the past.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In the present times it stands out with greater urgency to struggle with this steadfast ideological standpoint and morale. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation is now living in the June 15 era of reunification. The progress of the era would have been unthinkable without these viewpoint and morale. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present times have witnessed evermore desperate moves of the outside forces in their interference in the internal affairs of the Korean nation intended to block its cause of independent reunification and undermine the inter-Korean relations and their moves to provoke a war against the DPRK. No force on earth will or can save the Korean nation from the danger of war. Destructive would be the consequences to be entailed by the stance of attaching importance to outside forces and dependence on them under this situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when the Koreans cherish the viewpoint of attaching importance to the nation and the nation-first spirit and decisively oppose flunkeyism and dependence on outside forces, establishing the spirit of fighting with the joint efforts of the Korean nation itself, can they triumphantly push forward the cause of independent reunification, frustrating the interference of outside forces and their moves for aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Deeply cherishing the spirit of attaching importance to the nation and the nation-first spirit, the Korean nation will vigorously hew the path of the cause of independent reunification under the uplifted banner of \"By our nation itself\".    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In recent days alone, they amended and supplemented the already-prepared provocative war operation plans against the DPRK, making much ado about someone's \"threat\" in conspiracy with the U.S. imperialists. They are now busy introducing latest precision striking weapons including F-15K, Aegis destroyer and air-to-ground guided missiles ahead of the schedule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their action cannot be justified by anything.

These hideous state-sponsored crimes started with the fabrication of the \"Ulsa (1905) Five-Point Treaty.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. divided the Korean nation after the Second World War by taking advantage of the Japanese imperialists' enforcement of the colonial rule based on the treaty for scores of years. Explicitly speaking, but for the Japanese imperialists' occupation of Korea and enforcement of the colonial rule over it, the U.S. would not have made its way into south Korea after Korea's liberation under the pretext of disarming the Imperial Japanese Army and the Korean nation would not have undergone the tragic division for more than six decades. The misfortunes and pains the Korean nation has suffered for more than a century trace their origin to Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is preposterous for Japan to raise a hue and cry over \"a threat to security,\" taking issue with the DPRK over its measure of bolstering the war deterrent for self-defense. This reveals its grievances at having become unable to realize its reinvasion scheme due to the DPRK's increased war deterrent.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
