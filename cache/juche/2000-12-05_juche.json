And he handed the south side draft agreement of the north side on this matter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then he said if the delegates of the two sides fail to should discharge their responsibilities for this work intended to make a breakthrough in the history of division spanning half a century and relink the blood ties of the nation, they will bring only disappointment to the people at home and abroad who follow the talks with great expectation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Both sides should take a sincere and open-hearted attitude toward the talks to produce an agreement conducive to the implementation of the June 15 joint declaration, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The two sides had discussion on the draft agreement set forth by the north side and agreed to continue the negotiations for preserving their common points and narrowing down their differences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They agreed to hold the next round of the talks in the north side's portion of Panmunjom in the latter part of December. \r\n\r\n"

This is a precious fruition of foresight of Kim Jong Il who saw to it that political and ideological education has been intensified among soldiers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A congratulatory message to Kim Jong Il was adopted at the symposium. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan urged to redress its past \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 5 (KCNA) -- A Japanese magazine Sekaishuho recently published an article saying that such hideous crimes as kidnapping and drafting Koreans for slave labour committed by the Japanese imperialists in Korea in the past were openly sponsored by the Japanese government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard Minju Joson today in a signed commentary says that this is one more evidence proving that those crimes were something unprecedented orchestrated and put into practice by the Japanese government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the Japanese government is shameless enough to deny this stark fact, the commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has turned its face away from the issue of redressing its crime-woven past and employed every possible means and method to evade the responsibility for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a gross miscalculation for the Japanese government to try to settle this issue by paying a petty amount of money to victims. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government should abandon its wrong attitude and opt for redressing Japan's past crimes, though belatedly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only by doing so, can Japan regain confidence from the international community, become its full-fledged member in the new century and normalize its relations with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world will closely follow Japan's future attitude. \r\n\r\n"

We rejoice at and highly appreciate the great successes the fraternal Korean people under the wise guidance of the great leader Kim Jong Il have made in socialist construction and in the struggle for the peaceful reunification of the country by frustrating the imperialists' moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK and overcoming repeated natural disasters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We are sure that the Korean people will register greater success in their efforts to build a powerful socialist nation and achieve the peaceful reunification of the country. \r\n\r\n"
