Korean Conservatives Hit for Scheming to Seize Power \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 12 (KCNA) -- The Swiss Committee for Supporting Korea's Independent and Peaceful Reunification made public a statement on March 2, denouncing the south Korean ultra right-wing conservatives for intensifying their conspiracy and moves to seize power under the patronage and manipulation of the U.S. imperialists.\r\n Branding the merger of the Grand National Party and the United Liberal Democrats, remnants of the \"Yusin\" dictatorship of south Korea, as a dangerous plot to seize power, the statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP, the ULD and other pro-American ultra right-wing conservatives in south Korea are working hard to nullify the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, ignite a war against the DPRK and stamp out social democratization. And they seek to establish a fascist regime to suppress the struggle of the south Korean people for the withdrawal of the U.S. troops and the country's reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are the U.S. imperialists behind the south Korean pro-American ultra right-wing conservatives opposed to independence, reunification and democracy.\r\n The U.S. imperialists and the south Korean pro-American ultra right-wing conservatives are scheming to turn the June 15 era of reunification back to the era of confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even though the GNP and the ULD are merged and they are patronized by the U.S. imperialists, the moves of the south Korean pro-American ultra right-wing conservatives will surely be shattered.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S. imperialists can never cover up their true colors as the arch criminal who gave rise to the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Saturday says this in a signed article. \r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some time ago, south Korean KBS, quoting a confidential document of the Command of the U.S. Armed Forces in the Pacific, disclosed that the U.S. was about to use nuclear weapons against the DPRK in 1975. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Prior to this, it was disclosed that the U.S. forces in south Korea kept 280mm atomic guns for firing small-sized nuclear shells at the end of the 1950s. The recently revealed data clearly show who is chiefly to blame for the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula.\r\n Right after the Korean war, the U.S. imperialists declared south Korea as a \"theatre of vital operations\" for the materialization of the strategy of domination over Asia and the rest of the world and politicized the conversion of south Korea into a nuclear base.\r\n The nuclear weapons of the U.S. forces in south Korea are not \"deterrent means\" but weapons for an attack upon the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reckless U.S. nuclear war exercises every year are worsening the crisis of war in the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists should open to the public overall the nuclear weapons they have shipped into south Korea and put them under international inspection, not raising a hue and cry over someone's \"nuclear issue\". They should withdraw all the nuclear weapons and their forces from south Korea. This is a fair solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula and the best way for ensuring peace and security in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Paektu. And it has been made a tradition to issue sheetlets and stamps every year on the occasion of April 15 and February 16, the most auspicious holidays of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A lot of stamps reflecting the economy, culture, history, folk customs, nature, animals and plants of the country and international events have been brought out.\r\n Among them are those on various themes dealing with successes gained by the Korean people in socialist construction including \"Chollima\" tractor and \"Sungri-58\" truck manufactured by the Korean working class. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n International joint stamps were also brought out. Typical of them are the Korea-China joint stamp dealing with Mt. Kumgang in Korea and Lushan in China and the Korea-Russia joint stamp with Korean tiger and sable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Korean stamps earned fame at international stamp fairs and exhibitions held in over ten countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The stamp \"Folk Holiday\" was awarded a top prize at the third contest for selecting best foreign stamps held in China.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Urges U.S. to Drop Its Biased Nuclear Policy\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 11 (KCNA) -- The U.S. biased nuclear policy is upsetting the general view of the international community on the energy issue.\r\n The U.S. is still working hard to completely block the DPRK's nuclear activities for a peaceful purpose although it talks about the provision of nuclear technology and fuel for a civilian purpose and the like to those countries outside the NPT.\r\n The public opinion is focused on the question as to why the U.S. takes an uncompromising hard-line stand toward some countries and why it zealously protects and encourages some countries over the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has long shut its eyes to its allies or those countries in which it is interested over the matter of R&D for nuclear weapons and its intensification and covertly helped them, unhesitatingly transferring even nuclear technology to those countries although they are outside the NPT. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This notwithstanding, it urged the other countries to strictly observe the NPT and has applied sanctions against them in a coercive manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. not only insists that those countries incurring its displeasure including the DPRK be denied access to nuclear technology including that for a civilian use but threatens that it would not rule out a preemptive nuclear attack on them.\r\n This proves that the U.S. call for nuclear non-proliferation is nothing but sophism intended to pressurize other countries to meet its own interests.\r\n The U.S. biased application of double standards concerning the settlement of major international issues found a clear manifestation in the issue of providing light water reactors (LWRs) to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. declared the complete stop of their construction despite its commitment to provide them under the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework. Even at the six-party talks it opposed the provision of the LWRs, a cornerstone for building confidence, imposing unacceptable conditionality upon the DPRK, and pressurized it to completely stop its on-going peaceful nuclear activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. demand is a wanton violation of the sovereignty of the DPRK and a brigandish practice in view of the current trend of the world toward the development of nuclear energy for peaceful use and even in view of the fact that it is the legitimate right of the sovereign and independent countries to conduct nuclear activities for a peaceful purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n How can the Korean people cave in to the outsiders' pressure and give up the independent nuclear energy industry which they have built up for decades, tightening their belts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the U.S. has completely given up its commitment to the provision of the LWRs the DPRK can never stop its peaceful nuclear activities even a moment. \r\n It is quite intolerable for the U.S. to overlook nuclear issues of some countries, treating them in a friendly manner, and unconditionally reject some countries over nuclear issues, seeking its own interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. nuclear policy aimed at meeting its own interests away from impartiality and equality has only earned distrust of the international community and the U.S. dictation of this or that in the nuclear issue would get it nowhere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. attempt at totally blocking the DPRK's nuclear activities for a peaceful purpose will not be favored by the world people as it is quite unfair.\r\n The U.S. should recognize the right of all countries to use .nuclear technology for a peaceful purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is our assertion that the DPRK should be treated the same way as those countries possessing nuclear weapons outside the NPT are done.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
