Japan's racket over \"missile launch\" is a move to find a pretext for reinvasion.\r\n   Before they call for improved ties with the DPRK, they must renounce their hostile, bellicose policy toward the DPRK, mindful that when worsened bilateral relations develop into a military conflict, Japan will have to pay dearly. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
