Korea\r\n Pyongyang, February 23 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists are escalating dangerous military pressure on the DPRK, having confabs for slapping brigandish new \"sanctions\" against it over its satellite launch, its legitimate and independent right, and underground nuclear test for self-defence to protect it.\n\t\t\t\t\t They are mulling kicking off Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military exercises targeted against the DPRK again on March 1 in a bid to bring dark clouds of a war of aggression to hang over Korea despite the strong protest and denunciation at home and abroad.

The DPRK, therefore, had no other choice but to carry out the nuclear test to safeguard its sovereignty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is the chief culprit that compelled the DPRK to access and bolster nuclear deterrence by pursuing the hostile policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The misjudgment and mistake made by the U.S. in its DPRK policy and in the execution of the policy were based on its inveterate repugnance for the DPRK and bitterness to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. hostile policy aimed at the socialist system in the DPRK has become all the more undisguised, constantly making the latter to take tougher measures for self-defence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK repeatedly expressed its stand that it could not but reexamine in an all-round way the nuclear issue in the light of the U.S. increased anti-DPRK moves and warned that if the U.S. fails to choose a correct policy, the DPRK will \"modernize and expand the nuclear deterrence to be unimaginable by the U.S.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The wrong option taken by the U.S. while regarding the DPRK as a thorn in the flesh is the very reason that drove the DPRK to opt for developing, acquiring and possessing nuclear weapons. This is the unanimous comment of the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's access to nukes and its measure for bolstering them were all a reaction to the U.S. hostile policy toward it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nuclear stand-off between the DPRK and the U.S. will never end in a game."

It is stipulated in Article 24 of the UN Charter that the primary mission of the UNSC is to protect world peace and maintain its security. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Article 1 of the Outer Space Treaty indicates that space shall be researched and used in the interests of all countries, and clarifies that it is a common wealth of humankind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the final analysis, there is no reason from legal point of view for the DPRK's space activities to become a target of sanctions of the UNSC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is an illogical nonsense and trick on the international community to assert that the DPRK poses a \"threat to the international peace and security\" because it used \"ballistic missile\" technology as the U.S. alleges.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Among UN member states the U.S. launched most of satellites including military satellites. It is also the U.S. which keeps most of nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missiles in the world and is very keen on establishing the worldwide missile defence system for preemptive nuclear attack.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is in accordance with the U.S. logic to assert that the U.S. is the biggest threat to the world peace and security and it should be the first target of sanctions of the UNSC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There were no less than 2,000 nuclear tests and at least 9,000 satellite launches in the world since the UN came into existence. But never has there been even a single resolution of its Security Council that banned nuclear test and satellite launch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. which carried out the most nuclear tests and satellite launches in the world cooked up the UNSC's \"resolution\" that prohibited only the DPRK from conducting nuclear test and launching satellite. It is a violation of international law and height of double-standards.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should no longer be allowed to seriously infringe upon the independent right of the DPRK to use the space for peaceful purposes nor should it be allowed to abuse the UNSC as a tool for executing its hostile policy towards the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should seriously respond to the just demand of the DPRK that it should select one alternative of opening the phases of detente and stability by respecting the DPRK's right to satellite launch or continuing to go along the wrong way as it does now by pushing the situation to the point of explosion being pursuant to its hostile policy towards the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We would like to clarify once again that the recent third nuclear test was carried out as part of the practical countermeasures for defending the country's sovereignty and security to cope with the ruthless hostile act of the U.S. which wantonly infringed upon the DPRK's legitimate right to satellite launch for peaceful purposes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK delegate said he is convinced that the Committee will pay due attention to taking necessary steps to make sure that all member states strictly abide by the principle of equal sovereignty, core of the UN Charter and basis of the international relations, as the essence of the situation created on the Korean Peninsula is a serious issue of whether the sovereignty of a UN member state is respected or violated."

Por esta razon el pueblo coreano se vio obligado a realizar la prueba nuclear para la defensa de su soberania.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El mal juicio y error de EE.UU. en el establecimiento de su politica sobre la RPDC y el proceso de su cumplimiento, que continua siglo por siglo, parten de su veto cronico y hostilidad a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Se torna cada dia mas brutal la politica hostil de EE.UU. para aplastar el regimen socialista de la RPDC, lo cual obliga a esta tomar duras medidas autodefensivas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ya la RPDC habia reiterado su posicion de que se vio obligada a revisar generalmente el problema nuclear debido a las crecientes maniobras anti-RPDC de EE.UU. y advirtio que en el caso de que EE.UU. no escoja una politica correcta, el poderio disuasivo nuclear de la RPDC se modernizara y se ampliara en un grado inimaginable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hoy dia, la opinion publica internacional evalua que la erronea opcion de EE.UU., que considera a la RPDC como espina atravesada en su garganta, ofrece a esta ultima el motivo de desarrollar, obtener y poseer armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El enfrentamiento nuclear RPDC-EE.UU. no sera un juego."
