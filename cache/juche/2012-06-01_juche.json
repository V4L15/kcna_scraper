Such \"American-style massacre\" of civilians proved once again the true colors of \"constitutional state\" and \"guardian of human rights\" much touted by the U.S., it said. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has been pursuing hegemony in the world, grossly trampling upon other countries' sovereignty and capriciously committing human rights violations against other nations, it noted, adding that it appears to be increasingly contributing to international disorder."
