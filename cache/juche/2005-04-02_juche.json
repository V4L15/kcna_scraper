            "content": "U.S. Cold War-Minded Political Mode Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 1 (KCNA) -- Peru's well known news commentator Juan Mariategui wrote a book \"Review of International Politics\". Under the first title \"Peace Talks. Cold War Persists on the Korean Peninsula\" of the Asian Part of the Fifth Charter of the book, he referred to the fact that the Korean Peninsula was divided by the U.S. imperialists' occupation of south Korea in 1945 and the Korean war broke out in 1950. In the book he also dealt with the atrocities perpetrated by the U.S. imperialists against south Koreans and the arrogant behaviour of the U.S. blaming the nuclear activities of the DPRK while conniving at the production of nuclear weapons\r\nby other countries.\r\n He continued: The U.S. is persistently applying the political mode dating back to the Cold War era to the Korean Peninsula even today when the world structure of the Cold War was destroyed to open a U.S. unipolar era. The U.S. imperialists staged an aggressive joint military exercise with south Korea every year. They have rearmed Japan and egged it on to pursue a hostile policy towards north Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Various attempts were made by the north and the south in the past to achieve Korea's reunification. However, they proved futile due to the interference by the U.S. and Japan. The issue of the Korean Peninsula should be settled through dialogue free from foreign interference under any circumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n President Kim Il Sung provided a number of meetings and talks for the country's reunification between the north and the south in the wake of the joint conference of representatives of political parties and public organizations in north and south Korea held in April 1948. Then he put forward the proposal for founding the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo, the 10-Point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the Reunification of the Country and so on to indicate ways of achieving the\r\ncountry's reunification. The reunification of the Korean Peninsula should be achieved peacefully, not by a war, pursuant to this policy and the Korean Armistice Agreement should be replaced by a peace agreement.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

His Juche idea serves as a banner to be held aloft by the Korean people in building a rich and powerful country and his working method is the revolutionary one applied by them to practice. His behest serves as the lifeline for building such a country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He led the two revolutionary wars and the social revolution at two stages to victory and laid solid foundations for the eternal prosperity of Songun Korea, while turning misfortune into a blessing and adversity into favorable conditions. Thanks to these foundations, the DPRK is now demonstrating its might as a country strong in ideology, a military power and a country with strong independent national economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to further strengthen and glorify the revolutionary party of Juche type, the invincible revolutionary armed forces, the single-minded unity of the party, the army and the people around the headquarters of the revolution, the independent national economy and the foundations of self-reliant national defence industry, to which he dedicated himself all his life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No other country could look down upon the DPRK or dare provoke it because the authority of the President remains unquestioned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His cause of building a rich and powerful country is now being creditably carried out by leader Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il's Songun leadership is solely geared into materializing the President's idea and glorifying his feats. We should once again make a world-startling leaping advance and innovations in the ongoing general march for the Songun revolution with the same ardent patriotic enthusiasm and the persevering will as were displayed in the period when the Korean people hewed an untrodden path to build a country and built a powerful socialist country on debris under the guidance of the President and in the same spirit as was displayed in the period of the \"Arduous March\" when a breakthrough\r\nwas made in the efforts to build a great prosperous powerful nation despite stern trials.\r\n The editorial urges all the people to bring about a radical turn in the economic construction and the improvement of standard of people's living under the Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il this significant year which marks the 60th anniversaries of the Workers' Party of Korea and the liberation of the country and thus eternally glorify the feats performed by the President in building a rich and powerful country. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

But when renegades of socialism came to power and made one concession after another, the U.S. took a tough attitude towards it and buckled down to bringing it to a collapse. Its carrot tactics succeeded in doing so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the Gulfs War, the U.S. put pressure upon Iraq in various aspects. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWhen Iraq yielded to its pressure by making concessions in various fields, the U.S. set the no-fly zone in the air above the country as it pleased, sent a U.N. weapons inspection team there to scour all the targets including presidential palaces and succeeded in invading and occupying Iraq by force of arms with ease. Its stick tactics worked there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Thursday in a signed article called for maintaining the utmost vigilance against the U.S. carrot tactics and building up forces strong enough to cope with its stick tactics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Aggression and plunder represent the invariable nature of the U.S. imperialists, the article observed, and went on: \r\n The U.S. imperialists have used the carrot tactics in order to appease and deceive their rival, weaken and calm down his anti-U.S. sentiment and create illusion about them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has employed a variety of the carrot tactics such as \"peace,\" \"aid\" and \"cooperation\" to cover up nooses and thorn hidden in them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists become coward before the strong but get ferocious before the weak. They dare not wield a stick before the countries strong in political and ideological capability and enormous in military muscle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the last several decades they have left no means untried to stifle the DPRK. The basic method employed by them is to stifle it by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTheir nukes, carrier flotillas, strategic bombers and various types of missiles are involved in this stick tactics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. says that it has \"no intention to invade north Korea.\" But this only betrays its ambition to dominate the whole of Korea at any cost by applying the carrot and the stick to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article called upon the world progressive countries and peoples to clearly see through the U.S. imperialists' tactics for aggression and check and frustrate their crafty and vicious moves for aggression.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is an act of instigating the Japanese reactionaries in their ambition for territorial expansion and a de facto violation of the Korean nation's sovereignty over territory.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Friday says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently friction between south Korea and Japan was brought to surface over the issue of the islet. However, U.S. State Secretary Rice kept mum about the issue but actively supported Japan's bid for a permanent membership of the UNSC when she visited the country. In south Korea she turned aside the \"indignation\" of its authorities at Japan's ambition to grab the islet, the commentary points out, and says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind such bad behavior of the U.S. siding with Japan over the issue is a sinister and criminal intention to carry out its military domination over Northeast Asia.\r\n The U.S. seeks to invent a pretext for justifying its military intervention in Northeast Asia and beefing up its armed forces by fanning up Japanese reactionaries' moves for territorial expansion and instigating them in their ambition for militarism, with regard to the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The appearance of the era after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration and its powerful advance have shaken the foundations of the U.S. colonial rule over south Korea to the full. So the U.S. schemes to increase pressure upon the south Korean authorities by sowing dissension between south Korea and Japan over the islet issue and hurting the former's economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAlong with it, the U.S. attempts to divert elsewhere the attention of the surrounding countries calling for its political switchover as regards the six-party talks and while away the time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such U.S. vicious behavior is a dangerous crime as it checks the process of unity, stability and reunification on the Korean Peninsula, wrecks peace and security in the region and brings a new era of Cold War to Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should give up its ambition for revival of militarism and territorial expansion, mindful that it is a foolish illusion to calculate it can get a permanent seat of the UNSC with support of the U.S. and emerge a \"political power\", which can be done only by political dwarfs, and such deed will only lead to its isolation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
