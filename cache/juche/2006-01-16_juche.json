Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 15 (KCNA) -- Survivors of violence committed by government institutions of south Korea and crimes related to the cases fabricated by them in the past and bereaved families of those killed due to those crimes reportedly called a press conference on Jan. 10 in front of the building of the Committee for the Settlement of the Past History for Truth and Reconciliation at which they called for a joint probe into those cases of violence. \r\n O Jong Ryol, permanent chairman of the People's Solidarity for Inheriting the Spirit of the Movement for Democratization, and other speakers said that this land will always remain a criminal society if the truth about the above-said crimes are kept buried into oblivion, declaring that he would continue to probe the truth behind the cases. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the end of the conference the participants had an interview with the chairman of the committee and others. They demanded the revision of the law on the probe into the truth behind the past history, complaining that the law has \"too many flaws.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A number of people died due to harsh torture at prisons and detention houses and its sequela but the authorities turned down a relevant lawsuit, they said, stressing the need for the committee to come out to properly probe the truth behind the past cases of violence.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This revolutionary spirit is a manifestation of the noble view on life based on the will to dedicate oneself to the prosperity of the country.  \r\n Rodong Sinmun Sunday says this in a by-lined article dedicated to the anniversary of leader Kim Jong Il's famous work \"Let Us Live not Merely for Today but for Tomorrow\" published on Jan. 14, Juche 85 (1996). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The devoted efforts made by the servicepersons of the People's Army and working people to bring about a rosy future of a rich and powerful country strongly convinces everyone of the tremendous vitality of the above-said work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Set out in the work are ideas and theories such as the idea that one should devote oneself to the future of the country and the happiness of the generations to come though one may not enjoy happiness in one's lifetime and the idea that one should always live and work optimistically with firm confidence of victory in the revolution. They serve as immensely precious ideological and mental pabulum for the Korean people to glorify their lives on the road of revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people's revolutionary trait of living not merely for today but for tomorrow finds a vivid expression in the fact that they are confidently advancing along the road of Songun full of conviction of sure victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The justice of the Songun revolution the servicepersons and people of the DPRK have grasped, while weathering out all sorts of tempests of history instills the conviction of sure victory into them and encourages them to staunchly struggle for a rosier future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have struggled on the basis of the revolutionary view on life taught by Kim Jong Il. In this course they have grown to be indomitable fighters making a higher leap forward and advancing faster without any pessimism and hesitation under any situation and circumstances. \r\n The above-mentioned trait also finds its manifestation in the fact that an optimistic and emotional lifestyle is prevailing throughout the country.\r\n Neither bourgeois ideological and cultural poisoning nor psychological warfare can ever work on the society where everyone lives full of confidence and optimism while conducting popular cultural and sports activities, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Japan should show to the world its will to settle its past wrongs in practice this year.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today urges this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By nature Japan's settlement of its past crimes is an issue of paying the debt incurred to the Korean nation, the victim, as an assailant and its honest apology and compensation for the damage done to the Koreans are essential for its liquidation of the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is under a legal obligation to redress its past crimes because its occupation and rule over Korea were the most hideous state crime committed on the basis of an illegal false document and all crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists in the period of their occupation and rule were monstrous crimes to which the statute of limitations is not applicable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also a moral responsibility for Japan to settle its past crimes because the crimes committed by Japan in Korea in the past were crimes against humanity as they were a blatant violation of the elementary rights and dignity and morality and ethics of human beings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The liquidation of the past crimes has become an international trend in the present times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Involved in this undertaking are not only war criminal states but victor nations which committed certain crimes in violation of international law. Germany, a war criminal state during the Second World War, has already admitted the crimes committed by Nazis and made honest apology for them and paid adequate material compensation to the victims. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Quite contrary to this, Japan has persistently refused to admit its past crimes and settle them. It is leaving no means untried to evade its responsibility for its past crimes, denying and whitewashing all sorts of wrongs committed by it in Korea in past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to sincerely redeem its past crimes without delay if it wishes to shake off the ill fame of \"enemy state\" and live with clean conscience as a member of the international community, enjoying its trust, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In the DPRK servicepersons constitute a core and main force of the youth movement as they are firmly standing guard over the anti-imperialist military front, the most important lifeline in defending socialism, tightly holding the arms of the revolution in their hands. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Proceeding from the stand of Juche, Kim Jong Il put forward servicepersons as a paradigm of the young vanguard in the Songun era and has energetically led all young people to actively learn from their noble thinking and mentality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the most shining exploit Kim Jong Il has performed for the eternal prosperity of the country and the nation that he has trained the younger generation of Songun capable of undertaking the huge task of building a great prosperous powerful nation in the 21st century despite the grim tempest of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The single-minded unity symbolizes the eternal prosperity of Songun Korea and serves as a treasured sword for victory, the article says, stressing that Korean-style socialism will always emerge victorious thanks to this unity as long as there is the large young vanguard of Songun intensely loyal to the party and the leader.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
