This is a despicable crime of leaving the destiny of the nation to the tender mercy of foreign forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural that the south Korean people are refuting and opposing the moves to make the \"bill\" a law as a foolish act of driving the inter-Korean relations into catastrophe quite contrary to the trend toward dialogue and the improvement of relations growing strong thanks to the inter-Korean agreement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is stunning the public is that the NA is talking about \"inter-Korean parliamentary talks\" while crying out for the carriage of the \"bill\" for confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is preposterous to talk about \"implementation of the agreement,\" \"improved relations\" and \"dialogue\" while categorically negating and opposing the dialogue partner. This behavior is no more than clumsy red herring of those with ulterior motive.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean politicians have a reason, they had better face up to the reality of the DPRK where the people enjoy a worthy life, stop reckless tongue-lashing and mind their own business in the world's worst  tundra of human rights..\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has already declared that it would resolutely counter the moves to pass the \"bill\" and \"human rights\" racket against it, regarding them as a declaration of a war against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It remains unchanged in its resolute stand never to pardon those who try to infringe upon its dignity and sovereignty."
