Its \"proposal\" means that it would discuss what it should do only when the DPRK has completely dismantled its nuclear weapons in a unilateral manner. This is, in essence, little different from the above-said demand raised by the U.S. to the DPRK so far over the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The so-called \"landmark proposal\" made by the U.S. is an unfair one as it lacks any commitment to observe the principle of \"words for words\" and \"action for action.\" Particularly, it advanced the \"three-month period for preparations\" for the dismantlement of nuclear facilities which is nothing but a far-fetched assertion lacking scientific and realistic nature. This was what the U.S. side used to disarm a country in Mideast last year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is mistaken if it seeks to get something from the DPRK by applying to the DPRK the same method it applied to other country. If the U.S. seriously examines the DPRK's proposal and commits itself to renounce its hostile policy toward the DPRK and opts to make reward for freeze on the principle of \"words for words\" and \"action for action,\" that will serve both the purpose of settling the nuclear issue and the interests of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The progress of the talks and the prospect of the solution to the issue will depend on the U.S. attitude.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
