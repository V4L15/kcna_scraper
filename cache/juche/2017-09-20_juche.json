            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on Japan's Militarist Attempt at Rearmament\r\n Pyongyang, September 20 (KCNA) -- Kawai, special aide for diplomacy to the president of the Japan Liberal Democratic Party, recently told reporters that it is needed to discuss the issue of arming the \"Self-Defense Forces\" with intermediate range ballistic missiles and cruise missiles for \"peace\" and \"prosperity\" as the DPRK and China have such weapons. \n\t\t\t\t\t In the U.S. a few days later, he had a talk with the director general of the Heritage Foundation, a policy research institute, in which he asserted the need to introduce cruise missiles into \"SDF\" in order to contain China.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on the fact, Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says it is a revelation of the shameless aggression scheme of the Japan ultra-right forces to step up militarist rearmament by creating whatever pretexts in order to realize the ambition for overseas expansion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan has long switched the direction of bolstering the military capabilities into attack-oriented and has made desperate efforts to put regional countries within its striking range, the news analyst says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"theory of threat from the DPRK\" touted by the Japan ultra-right forces is just a pretext for realizing rearmament.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whenever the DPRK took measures for self-defence to cope with the ever-increased nuclear threat and blackmail from the U.S. after the end of Cold War, the Japanese reactionary ruling quarters have vociferated about \"threats\", and through this have met their political and military interests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan, stooge of the U.S., is making desperate efforts to opt for reinvasion by possessing strategic weapons. This points to Japan's extreme aggressive ambition for dominating Asia-Pacific.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What merits a serious attention is Japan's wild act of seeking rearmament while failing to come to its senses even though it is a war criminal state and a defeated nation."

Korean Puppet Forces Assailed\r\n Pyongyang, September 20 (KCNA) -- The south Korean puppet forces have gone zealous in military provocation while talking about \"regular deployment\" of nuclear strategic assets of the U.S. on the Korean peninsula, introduction of weapons and \"examination of redeployment of tactical nuclear weapons\".\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a senseless act of treachery to turn the Korean peninsula and the surrounding region into a world-wide thermo-nuclear war theatre with the backing of the U.S., says Minju Joson in a commentary Wednesday.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The commentary goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a well-known fact that the U.S. seeks to hold hegemony in Asia-Pacific with the Korean peninsula as a military foothold. It is for this reason that the U.S. has deliberately escalated the situation on the Korean peninsula, categorically stemming the north and the south from opting for reconciliation and unity. It has often staged \"sanctions\" and \"pressure\" racket and cried out for \"threats and provocation from the north\". Herein lies the main reason why the U.S. has massively introduced aggression forces and nuclear strategic assets into the Korean peninsula and the areas around it while staging frantic war exercises to invade the DPRK together with the puppet forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters is that the situation on the peninsula gets worse due to the south Korean puppet forces' active pursuance of the U.S. dangerous criminal moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet forces are calling for \"regular deployment\" of the U.S. nuclear strategic assets. This is a revelation of sordid intention to inflict a nuclear disaster on the Korean nation in collusion with the U.S. master, the sworn enemy of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts clearly prove that the south Korean authorities are nothing different from the group of traitor Park Geun Hye, a group of sycophantic traitors which plunged the south Korean people into misfortune and pain while inciting confrontation with the fellow countrymen under the pretext of \"security\" even though they pushed the situation on the Korean peninsula into the constant danger of the outbreak of a nuclear war during its stay in power as the top-class war servant of the U.S."
