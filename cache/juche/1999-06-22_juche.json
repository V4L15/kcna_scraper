            "content": "General officer-level meeting of KPA and U.S. Forces sides held\r\n      Panmunjom, June 22 (KCNA) -- The  general officer-level meeting of the Korean People's Army and the U.S. Forces sides was resumed at Panmunjom today to discuss the armed conflict in the waters off the west coast. \r\n   Present at the meeting were members of our side with lt. \r\n   General of the KPA Ri Chan Bok as its chief delegate and members of the U.S. Forces side with Maj. General Michael Dunn as its chief delegate. \r\n   Addressing the talks first, the chief delegate of our side said that the waters, where both sides clash with each other, definitely belong to our territorial waters both in the light of the provisions of the Armistice Agreement (AA) and the practice  so far followed since the truce. \r\n   He went on to say:  The sub-paragraph 13b of the Armistice Agreement clearly stipulates that only five of the islands lying to the north and west of the \" A-B Line\"  of the provincial boundary line between Hwanghae-do and Kyonggi-do shall be under the  military control of the commander-in-chief, United Nations command. \r\n   This legally states that all the five islands under the control of the U.S. Forces are inside our territorial waters. \r\n   As regards this point, a delegate of the U.S. side at the staff officers meeting held on January 30, 1952 to discuss paragraph 3 of the agenda of the armistice talks said, \" that paragraph was meant to control on only those islands.\"    \r\n   Following the signing of the AA, warships of the U.S. Forces sailed to the high seas to come to the five islands north of the extension line of the Military Demarcation Line in the waters off the west coast. \r\n   This fact proves the U.S. Forces side's recognition of our right to naval patrol pursuant to the AA. \r\n   That was why our fishing boats conducted routine fishing operations in those waters  during the fishing season every year.                                       \r\n   But the South Korean rulers are talking about the \" limit line\"    which is not stipulated in the AA and on which no agreement was made between both sides and which no one has recognized. They have illegally infiltrated scores of warships of different types into the north side's territorial waters since June 4 to threaten the safety of northerners who were engaged in peaceful fishing operation and disturb it.\r\n   Recalling that the South Korean warships recklessly attempted to bump against warships of the KPA navy while blocking them from performing self-defence patrol duty to protect our peaceful fishing boats, the chief delegate of our side stated:   \r\n   The recent incident was directly commanded by top commanders of the \" ROK\"    army from its very beginning.\r\n   This incident was followed by ill-boding military movements of the U.S. encouraged by this, the South Korean rulers carry on their provocations by infiltrating warships deep into the north side's territorial waters.\r\n   Their military provocations in the territorial waters off the west coast are an intolerable challenge to us and a perilous crime of leading the situation on the Korean peninsula to an extreme pitch of tension.\r\n   Now the Korean people and people's army are greatly angered by these naval provocations committed by the \" ROK\"    navy and are determined to make them pay dearly for this without fail.\r\n   The United States and the South Korean authorities should fully admit the responsibility for this incident, sternly punish those involved in it and assure us that they will not repeat it in future.\r\n   But the U.S. Forces side asserted that as our warships \" intruded\"    into the south side's territorial waters to fire at South Korean warships first, many warships of theirs were damaged. And the U.S. Forces side advanced what it called \" proposal\"    on preventing the recurrence of conflict in the waters off the west coast.\r\n   However, the \" proposal\"    was nothing but a brigandish one intended to maintain the \" northern limit line\"    unilaterally defined by them and get our warships withdrawn from there.\r\n   The chief delegate of our side promptly refuted it in strong terms.\r\n   Accusing the U.S. chief delegate of insisting on his wrong assertion, the chief delegate of our side stated:  Insisting on the \" northern limit line\"    cannot be construed otherwise than an intention to drop sub-paragraph 13b as it diametrically runs counter to that provision. \r\n   If the U.S. side wishes to abrogate the sub-paragraph 13b, it should make its stand clear.\r\n   The U.S. chief delegate, however, failed to answer that question.\r\n   Our chief delegate went on to state:  If the problem is to be solved,  the U.S. and the South Korean authorities should first make an apology for causing that serious armed conflict, give us assurances that they would never repeat such provocation and withdraw at once the \" northern limit line\"    unilaterally set by them.  A mere talk about \" easing tensions\"    without such assurances is no more than a mockery of public opinion. Concluding his statement on the basis of his review of the proceeding of the meeting, the chief delegate of our side declared:\r\n   What we have to make clear firstly at today's meeting is that the U.S. Forces side still seeks to infiltrate its warships into our territorial waters to spark a reckless conflict, instead of drawing a lesson from the incident.\r\n   Secondly, the U.S. Forces' side ignores the Armistice Agreement and has no willingness to implement it.\r\n   Our chief delegate had this to say:\r\n   The KPA side has no idea to debate on this matter any longer now that the unreasonable stand and attitude of the U.S. side have been confirmed.\r\n   There is a limit to our patience and self-restraint.\r\n   If the U.S. Forces' side refuses to draw a lesson from the recent incident and instigates the provokers again to invade our territorial waters off the west coast, the KPA will not restrain itself but get them buried at sea forever by employing all the necessary self-defensive means.\r\n   The South Korean rulers would be well advised to think twice before feeling sorry later.    \r\n\r\n"

Kumgang tour\r\n     Pyongyang, June 22 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Korean Asia-Pacific Peace Committee issued a statement on Monday denouncing the South Korean authorities for trying to use the Mt. Kumgang tour for their sinister purposes.\r\n   The spokesman said:\r\n   An unidentified South Korean woman, Min Yong Mi by name, came to the Mt. Kumgang area of the north side on June 20 as a tourist and made ill-intentioned remarks to tempt northerners who were on routine environmental inspection duty.\r\n   She told them, \" Those who defected to the south are well off now\"   and \"  You must be tired, climing up and down the mountain.\"    She revealed her ulterior intention, saying, \" If you come to the south, you will live in happiness.\"    \r\n   This is a provocation against the north and has nothing to do with tourism.\r\n   Moreover, it is a product of the South Korean authorities' premeditated anti-north plot to foil the Mt. Kumgang tour sponsored by our committee and the Hyundai Business Group.\r\n   Those who include a professional agent among tourists of Mt. Kumgang in an attempt to preach \" defection\"  must be condemned by the nation and pay dearly for that.\r\n   Our competent organ will conduct a necessary investigation on the unidentified woman who violated our law by doing something that has nothing to do with tourism of Mt. Kumgang in the north.\r\n   The South Korean authorities must ponder over the consequences of their foolish attempt to abuse the Mt. Kumgang tour for their sinister purposes. They must admit responsibility and apologize for the incident.    \r\n\r\n"

But, the South Korean authorities reinforced armed forces and launched the \" bump-and-push operation.\"   \r\n   There is a limit to our patience.\r\n   The South Korean authorities should clearly know that if they persistently commit reckless provocations despite the north's repeated warnings, they will get powerful self-defensive blows from the north.\r\n   The people and the people's army of Korea are now fully ready to annihilate the enemy.\r\n   We mean what we say.\r\n   Our revolutionary armed forces will keenly follow every movement of the South Korean authorities.    \r\n\r\n"
