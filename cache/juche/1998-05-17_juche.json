The fact shows well that \"dialogue\" and \"confidence-building\" the present rulers of South Korea are calling for are no more than hypocrisies and they are in actuality following in the footsteps of the warmaniacs of the \"civilian\"-veiled regime.\r\n   The warmongers must not run riot.    \r\n\r\n"

If it continues reading other's mind, it can never win international confidence.\r\n   It would be well advised to deeply think of itself before lobbying other countries for support for its permanent membership.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"
