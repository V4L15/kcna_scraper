Rodong Sinmun Monday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists' psychological warfare is crafty tactics to benumb the people's mentality and reason. It is a dangerous method to militarily browbeat people so that they may remain crestfallen and non-resistant and yield to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If people are outwitted by the imperialists' psychological warfare, they will opt for treachery, perfidy and surrender and the country and nation will go to ruin in the end. This is a lesson taught by history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are now persistently working to apply the crafty and vicious psychological warfare to the DPRK. They are intensifying the above-said warfare against the DPRK because it is winning victory after victory, displaying the might of Songun politics despite any anti-socialist hurricane after the collapse of the former Soviet Union and East European socialist countries. It is also because the world socialist movement and the movement for independence are growing stronger as the days go by, inspired by the DPRK's advance, whereas the U.S. imperialists are finding themselves in a more difficult position. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are scared by the invincible might of the DPRK to which the world people look up as a beacon of hope. Such psychological warfare, however, does not work on the Korean people strong in faith and mental power. It only stokes their anti-U.S. sentiment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A people strong in revolutionary faith are sure to emerge victorious. When people are confident of sure victory, they will not be afraid of any formidable enemy but can fight it with confidence and optimism without vacillation in any adversity and ordeal and decisively frustrate the enemy's psychological warfare.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is intended to further concretize the realization of \"strategic flexibility\" of the U.S. forces in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such moves intensified by the U.S. from the outset of the year as deployment of up-to-date combat wing in south Korea and its plan to conduct large-scale joint military exercises under the pretext of \"familiarization with local conditions\" are a dangerous provocation of threatening peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The resolution warned that if the U.S. continues its moves to provoke a war, threatening peace on the Korean Peninsula, it would meet a strong resistance of all the people.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
