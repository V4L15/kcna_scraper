This is part of the smear campaign to harm the DPRK, block the improved relations between the DPRK and Japan and obstruct the settlement of the humanitarian and other outstanding issues between the two countries.\r\n    The \"case of suspected abduction\" is a political plot hatched by the South Korean puppet Agency for National Security Planning to encourage the Japanese people to confrontation with the DPRK= It is a product of the hostile policy the Japanese reactionaries are pursuing towards the DPRK hand in glove with the South Korean puppets.\r\n   The \"suspected abduction\" advertised by Japan itself lacks political reason and international morality. In fact, this is a foolish act of Japan to pretend to be victim after inflicting immeasurable pains and losses upon the Koreans.\r\n   While keeping mum about the \"comfort women for the army\" issue and shocking crimes of the past, Japan is taking issue  with the DPRK over the fiction of the \"suspected abduction\".\r\n   Japan must sincerely make an apology and compensation for the misfortune and pains it brought to the Korean people, instead of persisting in its smear campaign.\r\n   We will never tolerate the crimes the Japanese reactionaries committed against the Korean people, including women, but settle our account with them a thousand times generation after generation.    \r\n      \r\n  \r\n"

The South Korean authorities should immediately stop pursuing the policy of confrontation with the fellow countrymen and accept the five-point policy of great national unity out of the stand of national independence.\"\r\n   \"The patriotic forces of national reunification will certainly build a reunified state, a Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo, in the face of all manner of challenges,\" he added.    \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n"

Nevertheless, the U.S. reactionary ruling quarters are trying to keep their forces in South Korea permanently, far from withdrawing them.\r\n   A clear proof of this is that the United States is persistently spreading rumors about non-existent \"threat\" from the north and scheming to revise the \"mutual defence pact\" with the South Korean puppets.\r\n   The U.S. will get nothing from its policy of strength that runs against the trend of the times.\r\n   If it truly wants peace and stability on the Korean peninsula, it should take a step for total withdrawal of its forces from South Korea, not seeking to keep them indefinitely.\r\n   The pullout of the U.S. Forces from south is an urgent matter which brooks no delay.\r\n   The U.S. military should know it clearly and take a decisive step to withdraw its forces.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
