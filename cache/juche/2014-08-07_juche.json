The bill calls for cutting off north Korea's financial source of obtaining dollar and other foreign currencies to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons and missiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, the chief U.S. negotiator for the six-party talks said at a hearing before the U.S. Congress that the U.S. would continue pursuing its pressure policy towards north Korea as long as it does not stop the nuclear program.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Thursday in an article observes in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. bluffing that it would continue pressing for north Korea's denuclearization is aimed to render the relations between the DPRK and its neighboring countries tense and create an atmosphere of putting sanctions and pressure on it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is making desperate efforts to defame the dignity of the DPRK with groundless lies and fabrications and hinder its advance through all sanctions and blockade.

These are part of those countermeasures.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army of the DPRK is reliably protecting the dignity and security of the country and the nation, tightly holding such treasured sword of justice as strategic rockets tipped with nuclear warheads powerful enough to strike the U.S. mainland. This reflects the firm will of the army and people of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. had better to think twice over the nuclear stand-off with the DPRK."
