Korea is requirement of time\r\n Pyongyang, November 26 (KCNA) -- U.S. warhawks insist on the continued occupation of south Korea by the U.S. forces, according to reports.\r\n   They allege that withdrawal of the U.S. forces from south Korea is \"premature\" and it would upset the \"balance of strength\". They went the length of justifying the continued occupation of south Korea by the U.S. forces, exploding the theory of phased military reduction.\r\n   This is an open challenge to our just demand for the withdrawal of the U.S. forces from south Korea and a mockery of the unbiased public opinion of the world sympathizing with our position.\r\n   Withdrawal of more than 40,000-strong U.S. forces from south Korea is a requirement of the times which brooks no further delay.\r\n   A tense situation in which war may break out any moment has been created on the Korean Peninsula owing to the U.S. forces' occupation of south Korea. The U.S. forces have staged frantic war exercises with the south Korean puppets against the north every year. Recently, they defiantly staged the foal eagle joint military manoeuvres, bringing the situation to the dangerous phase. \r\n   No one can vouch that modern war which will plunge humankind into a holocaust will not break out on the Korean Peninsula.\r\n   Twentytwo years ago, the 30th U.N. General Assembly Session adopted resolutions on the dissolution of the \"U.N. Command\" and withdrawal of all the foreign troops from south Korea, reflecting the desire of the entire Korean people and the world peaceloving people for a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula.\r\n   To implement the resolutions is a basic guarantee for preventing the danger of war and ensuring peace and security on the Korean Peninsula. It is an unavoidable historic responsibility of the united states to dissolve the \"U.N. Command\" and withdraw its troops from south Korea in accordance with the resolutions.\r\n   While crying that withdrawal of foreign troops is essential for the settlement of disputes in other regions, however, the united states stubbornly refuses to drive its forces out of south Korea. With nothing can it justify its insistence.\r\n   The U.S. forces' occupation of south Korea is a product of the Cold War era which had already ended. With the adoption of the agreement on nonaggression between the north and the south of Korea, the United States cannot justify its insistence on \"deterrent to southward invasion\". In addition, \"four-way talks\" for peace and security on the Korean Peninsula will soon open. Accordingly, the United States cannot justify its forces' occupation of south Korea with anything.\r\n   Contacts and dialogues are now under way between the DPRK and the United States. In order to develop the contacts and dialogues into ones for dispelling mistrust and misunderstanding between the two countries and improving bilateral relations, above all, the U.S. forces must get out of south Korea.\r\n   The solution to the Korean question is, in essence, withdrawal of the U.S. forces from south Korea.\r\n   Only when the United States withdraws its troops from south Korea, it will earn confidence from the Korean people and the world progressives.\r\n   The U.S. must immediately withdraw its forces from south Korea in accordance with the requirements of the times.    \r\n\r\n"

But, the movement of patriotic students and people for independence, democracy and reunification has been further intensified.\r\n   Worse still, the catastrophic crisis of the south Korean economy has further precipitated the ruin of Kim Young Sam.\r\n   This is why the Kim Young Sam group are trying to find a way out of their crisis of ruin in provoking a war against the north.\r\n   They must stop the adventurous war exercises against the north at once, mindful that if they unleash war, they will be annihilated.    \r\n\r\n"

So the Japanese women always uphold him  as their own father.\"\r\n   She vowed to uphold, with pure and clean conscience, the General as the sun of socialist Korea and as her own father, together with her sons and daughters to the last moment of her life,  true to instructions of the Generalissimo Kim Il Sung.\r\n   Many hometown visitors said that while visiting hometowns, they keenly felt that parents are not called as parents for the mere reason that they gave birth to them and the land where they were born is not the country. They cannot live even a moment, without the embrace of the General and their genuine homeland is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, they said.\r\n   They sang songs and recited impromptu poems carrying their pride and honor of living, upholding the general, and resolve to live and work under his guidance, deeply moving those present at the banquet.\r\n   An art performance was given at the banquet.    \r\n\r\n"

The tradition of patriotism established by the Korean communists is that of loyalty and filial duty to the leader of the revolution.\r\n   Kim Jong Suk took the lead in the establishment of the great tradition and bequeathed it to the new generation of the revolution as a precious heritage.\r\n   She set an example in giving full play to the noble patriotism based on the revolutionary outlook on the leader for the first time in history.
