Korean Navy's Intrusion into Territorial Waters of DPRK Censured\r\n Pyongyang, September 22 (KCNA) -- The Southwest Front Command of the Korean People's Army issued the following pres release on Saturday:\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet forces' grave intrusion into the waters of the West Sea is again going beyond the tolerance limit in the season for catching blue crab.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The number of the cases of intrusion of warships of the south Korean navy into the territorial waters of the DPRK is on the steady increase and the sphere of their intrusion is gaining in depth as the days go by.  Provocative and reckless firing and shelling targeted against the DPRK are being committed from the five islands and waters around them almost every day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Many speedboats of the south Korean navy intruded deep into the territorial waters of the DPRK side along the maritime demarcation line southwest of Yonphyong Island several times on Sept. 21 alone, kicking up a firing and shelling racket.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The gravity of the situation is that though they claimed those boats they encountered were obviously peaceful civilian ones, the south Korean forces fired bullets and shells at them at random.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such hysteria is nothing but an adventurous military provocation which can be orchestrated only by the south Korean military warmongers accustomed to mimicking the bad habit of the U.S., their master fond of saber-rattling.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters is that such military provocations are being committed under the pretext of the disorderly fishing operations of fishing boats of other country, not ones of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Worse still, such provocations are being perpetrated by them on the basis of lies and far-fetched assertions that fishing boats of the DPRK crossed the illegal \"northern limit line\" which has never been recognized.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet forces have gone so despicable as to insist that they were ships of the DPRK for fear of the country to which they actually belonged.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They intruded into the DPRK's territorial waters and fired shells and bullets. But they raised a hue and cry, afraid of the possible countermeasure of the army of the DPRK. This shows the pitiful position of the puppet military which goes reckless while making far-fetched assertions to maintain the \"northern limit line\" at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The Lee Myung Bak puppet regime and the military warmongers would be well advised to realize their wretched situation and stop running riot.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Southwestern Front Command has already received the operation order from the Supreme Command to turn the West Sea of Korea into a deadfall of enemies and wage a great war for national reunification if enemies fire even a bullet into the area of the DPRK side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What remains to be done now is a powerful strike of the DPRK's front units which know of no limit."

Korean Regime Hit for Moving to Stage PSI with Outsiders\r\n Pyongyang, September 22 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the National Peace Committee of Korea issued the following statement Saturday:\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet regime is to hold a naval interception drill, part of PSI, for searching and tracking vessels suspected of carrying weapons of mass destruction with the involvement of huge troops together with the U.S., Japan and Australia in waters off Pusan on Sept. 26 and 27.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t PSI which the Bush administration cooked up to blockade and stifle anti-U.S. and independent countries like the DPRK in 2003 has drawn strong public denunciation from its outset as it was in wanton violation of international law and a product of brigandish aggression moves in serious breach of the Korean Armistice Agreement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. openly said that PSI is \"another arrow in the quiver targeting north Korea\", an indication of the provocative and aggressive nature of the drill.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t So, the preceding regime of south Korea was reluctant to take part in the drill.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the Lee Myung Bak regime, steeped in sycophancy toward the U.S. and confrontation with the fellow countrymen, decided to take part in PSI as its full member soon after it took office. It even took an active part in it, saying that \"PSI is not needed but for the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the south Korean puppet army's reckless anti-DPRK war moves deepened the tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The puppet regime now moves to stage PSI drill against this backdrop, a dangerous act of disclosing its attempt at aggression on the DPRK and increasing the danger of a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Committee strongly denounces in the name of all the Koreans the U.S. and Lee regime's criminal moves as an intolerable military provocation and a war act aimed to seriously encroach upon the sovereignty and dignity of the DPRK and ignite a war of aggression at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Koreans from all walks of life are strongly opposed to the drill that escalates military tensions on the Korean Peninsula and harasses the peace in Northeast Asia, and countries around it are expressing deep concerns about it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK already clarified that it will view south Korea's participation in PSI as a declaration of a war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will never remain an on-looker to the mad-cap war drill.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They have already occupied combat positions and are waiting for an order for a final charge in the face of the reckless war provocation racket on the part of the U.S. and the south Korean regime. If the enemies fire even a bullet on the DPRK, they will strongly retaliate against them with merciless just war as it had already declared and turn the group of aggressors into forlorn wandering spirits.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee regime should clearly understand the towering grudge and spirit of annihilating enemies of the army and people of the DPRK and do not act rashly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Koreans of all social standings and world peace-loving people should strongly stand against PSI drill that escalates military tension on the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia and brings the danger of a nuclear war."
