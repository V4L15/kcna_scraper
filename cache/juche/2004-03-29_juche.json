This proves that the ulterior intention of the U.S. is not to ensure peace on the Korean peninsula but to stifle the DPRK militarily, not to seek a negotiated solution to the issue but to achieve its aim, wasting time behind the scene of talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We fully support the statement issued by a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK dated March 19 in which it declared that it was compelled to take strong measures for just self-defence to protect the supreme security of the state. \r\n The statement urged the U.S. to act with discretion, cogitating over the unpredictable consequences to be entailed by Foal Eagle and RSOI. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It ardently called on the progressive people of India and the rest of the world to bitterly denounce the joint military exercises and voice full support and solidarity with the Korean people in their struggle for the independent reunification of the country.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan Urged to Drop Its Ambition for World Conquest \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 28 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today carries a lengthy article headlined \"Japan, ferocious aggressor force in the 21st century, dreaming of world conquest.\"\r\n It says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The brigandish ambition of Japan to obliterate and dominate other countries and nations through aggression and war and achieve \"prosperity\" remains unchanged in the 21st century, too. Japanese militarism is by no means a departed soul but has emerged a real and dangerous war force for overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It cites concrete facts to prove that the Japanese reactionaries have rounded off their military operational, legal, economic, ideological and mental preparations and procedures for overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their gun roar for overseas aggression sounded already long ago. A proof of this is that they are dispatching the \"Self-Defence Forces\" overseas under the signboard of letting them participate in \"peace-keeping operations\" of the United Nations, legally guaranteed by the \"law on overseas troop dispatch\". Japan had dispatched a total of 3,987 troops of the SDF to different parts of the world on 15 occasions from 1992 to 2002 in a bid to demonstrate its position as a military power to the world. When the \"September 11 incident\" occurred in the United States in the new century, Japan, as if it had waited for it to take place, cooked up the \"law on special measures to combat terrorism\" under the pretext of \"support to the U.S.,\" drastically extending the sphere of the SDF's activities even to the Indian Ocean and dispatching SDF's fleet there to actively back the U.S. forces in their Afghan war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  What should not be overlooked is the fact that Japan is massively dispatching fully armed troops of the SDF to war-torn Iraq. The Japanese reactionaries sent even 8,900-ton large transport ship Osmi to the battle area in February in the wake of their dispatch of SDF to Iraq at the end of last year and in January this year. It is the first time since the end of the Second World War that Japan dispatched SDF to the battle area for overseas military operations. The Japanese militarist forces armed to the teeth seem to think it is high time they set out for world conquest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Various restrictions compel Japan to take the road of converting itself into a military giant based on militarism and realizing overseas expansion backed by the United States at present. But it is its view that it can fully realize its ambition for overseas aggression only when it gets rid of a U.S. \"nuclear umbrella\" one day in the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It is an invariable design of the Japanese reactionaries to realize their ambition for domination over Asia and world conquest in the 21st century even by use of nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the past the Japanese militarists were familiar with many wars of aggression and always accustomed to a blitz attack and surprise attack. It is as clear as daylight that they will not hesitate to commit any hideous crimes again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe DPRK is made the primary target of Japan's overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is the calculation of the Japanese reactionaries that they can never realize their ambition for continental aggression unless they seize the DPRK, an invulnerable bulwark of socialism, standing as a gate to the Asian continent. The Japanese reactionary ruling quarters are now further escalating their political, diplomatic economic and military pressure upon the DPRK than ever before under the pretext of its \"missile and nuclear issues\" in a bid to stage a comeback to Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They may launch a surprise invasion of the DPRK under the pretext of \"its threat\". If the \"threat from north Korea\" serves as a prelude to the Japanese reactionaries' reinvasion of Korea, it will do as a prelude to their Asian reinvasion. Japan's threat to the DPRK precisely means a threat to Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Having completely discarded its veil of a \"peace-loving state\" it has used for more than half a century since the end of the war, Japan has revealed its true colors as a war state and warlike forces for domination keen on world conquest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' wild ambition for overseas aggression can never come true. This is not an option helpful to Japan's peace, security and prosperity but one leading it to self-destruction.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It glaringly reveals their intention to justify Japan's past history of overseas aggression and the wild ambition of the revived Japanese militarist forces for expansion overseas. Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article  Recalling that stamps on Tok Islet were issued in Japan recently, the article notes it has been historically and legally proved that Tok Islet has been part of the territory of Korea since ancient times and, accordingly, Japan can never claim \"dominion over Tok Islet.\"\r\n Japan claimed again \"dominion over Tok Islet,\" the assertion that has long gone bankrupt, instead of fully redeeming its unprecedented past crimes against the Korean people. This is a wanton violation of the dignity and sovereignty of the Korean nation and an intolerable mockery of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' claim is, in essence, aimed to launch military provocation against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They seek to convince the world public that Tok Islet belongs to Japan and occupy the islet by force under that pretext and launch reinvasion of the whole of Korea, using the islet as a springboard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, the Japan Self-Defence Forces have rounded off all preparations for overseas aggression, for the reinvasion of Korea for the present. Now they just require a pretext to do so. That was why they began clamoring for the dominion over the islet. It is their true intention to launch armed invasion of Korea under that pretext. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' strategic plan is to seize economic interests and jurisdiction over the area of Tok Islet, to begin with, and put the islet under their complete control in a bid to establish a 200-mile unchallenged economic sea limit centering on it and monopolize their economic interests in the area. Furthermore, they seek to convert the islet into a military base and effectively use it for marching northward as they did in the past Russo-Japanese war. It is a major political and military objective of the Japanese reactionaries to use the islet as a springboard from which to realize their ambition for reinvading Korea. The Japanese chief executive's absurd territorial claim to Tok Islet is little short of the green light to the reinvasion of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarist forces are set to stage comeback to Korea and rush headlong into overseas aggression, fluttering blood-stained \"Hinomaru\" and singing \"Kimigayo\" as they did in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's reinvasion of Korea means digging its own grave. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries had better stop running amuck.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Minju Joson today says this in a signed commentary.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush gentries are staging frantic large-scale war maneuvers while escalating the moves to stifle the DPRK by force of arms despite the sincere efforts of the international community and the countries concerned to settle the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. through dialogue in a peaceful way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. ulterior design on the Korean peninsula still remains unchanged. It seeks to stifle the DPRK by force of arms and swallow up the whole of Korea at any cost. The U.S. talk about \"peaceful settlement\" and \"dialogue\" is not to ensure peace on the Korean peninsula but to achieve its sinister purpose of gaining time for rounding off the preparations to disarm the DPRK behind the scene of dialogue and stifle it militarily. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is escalating its moves to stifle the DPRK by force of arms, deliberately throwing hurdles in the way of settling the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. with a hypocritical and deceptive talk about \"peaceful settlement\" to gain time. This only compels the DPRK to take all the self-defensive measures to cope with them. This is the option of the DPRK for self-defence which no one can find fault with. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. foolishly attempts to attack the DPRK, the former will be held wholly responsible for all the ensuing unpredictable consequences.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Slams U.S.-South Korea Joint Military Exercises in S. Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 27 (KCNA) -- The present situation on the Korean peninsula remains dangerous owing to the reckless moves of the U.S. warhawks and their followers to unleash a war of aggression against the DPRK so that a nuclear war may break there anytime.\r\n The United States started a military exercise dubbed Freedom Banner 04 with the mobilization of hundreds of combat vehicles, tanks and armored cars for landing belonging to a flotilla of the U.S. Marine Corps and thousands of its soldiers at Phyongthaek Port on March 8. On March 22, RSOI and Foal Eagle joint military exercises began with the involvement of huge armed forces including at least 40,000-strong U.S. forces occupying south Korea, GIs deployed in the Asia-Pacific region and the south Korean army. Timed to coincide with these maneuvers, a joint military exercise of the U.S. and south Korean marine corps codenamed a \"plan for combined rehearsal\" is now underway in the area close to the Demilitarized Zone of the Military Demarcation Line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such war maneuvers simultaneously going on in the sky, land and sea of south Korea are, to all intents and purposes, very adventurous exercises under the simulated conditions of preemptive nuclear strikes at the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Involved in them are about 5,500 U.S. marines and over 3,000 GIs of other services deployed in the Hawaii, Okinawa and Iwakuni bases. Aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk with some 70 fighters and 5,500 combatants aboard and Aegis destroyers having precision strike capacity and equipped with a missile interceptor system and a weapons system for the use of depleted uranium bombs have also arrived in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is describing these military exercises as \"annual events\" and \"drills of defensive nature\" in an attempt to cover up their aggressive nature. But they are precisely the largest- ever nuclear war exercises targeted against the DPRK in the light of the scale of GI participation, the level of the equipment involved and the selection of the operational theatre. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Countless joint military exercises of the U.S. forces and the south Korean army were held in south Korea in the past. But never have the Marine Corps called most elite unit in the U.S., Striker Unit known as a U.S. rapid task brigade, and uptodate war means been simultaneously mobilized for several military drills in the area close to the DMZ and Seoul area as this time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No wonder, foreign media viewed the current war maneuvers as the largest since 1994.\r\n The U.S. announced its plan to stage these military exercises right after the end of the six-way talks. This is a challenge to the Korean people, the international community and the countries concerned in their sincere efforts for a peaceful negotiated solution to the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whenever an opportunity presented itself, high-ranking officials of the U.S. administration talked about a \"peaceful solution\" to the nuclear issue, asserting that the U.S. is ready to push forward the work to settle the nuclear issue peacefully and the U.S. will not attack north Korea. But the situation prevailing on the Korean peninsula clearly proves that the U.S. talk about \"dialogue\" and \"peace\" is no more than a hypocritical window-dressing to conceal its aggressive nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ulterior intention of the U.S. is not to settle the nuclear issue peacefully but gain time behind the scene of the talks and finally bring down the DPRK by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no guarantee that the current war maneuvers staged with the mobilization of armed forces huge enough to ignite a war will not go over to a war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dialogue and confrontation are incompatible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK neither want a war nor avoid it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK will not slacken vigilance against the U.S. hostile acts even a moment but take strong self-defensive steps if it threatens the supreme security of the DPRK.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
