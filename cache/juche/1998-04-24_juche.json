This is a typical example set by the KPA in battles to honorably defend the fatherland.\r\n   In the period of socialist construction it resolutely shattered the new war manoeuvres of the enemy -- the intrusion incident of the U.S. armed spyship Pueblo (January 1968), a large spyplane EC-121 incident (April 1969), Panmunjom incident (August 1976), resumption of the Team Spirit 93 joint war exercises, \"nuclear inspection\" racket -- and reliably defended the security of the country and the people.\r\n   The might of the heroic KPA  has grown stronger since General Kim Jong Il, a genius of military affairs, was elected Supreme Commander of the revolutionary armed forces and Chairman of the National Defence Commission. He put forward the policy on modelling the whole army on the Juche idea and has wisely led the army building and activities.\r\n   The KPA has been developed into an invincible army, the strongest picked armed forces with modern means of attack and defence thanks to his extraordinary intelligence, outstanding strategy and tactics and tested commanding art.\r\n   Seeing the invicible revolutionary armed forces displaying  their  might as the pillar of Korean-style socialism, the Korean people are making the forced march, of socialism, optimistic of victory.    \r\n\r\n"

Paektu defeated the Japanese imperialists and accomplished the historic cause of national liberation through the 15 year-long hard-fought  anti-Japanese revolutionary war thanks to the Juche-based military idea and wisdom of the President,  his outstanding strategy and tactics and rare commanding art.\r\n   The KPA which succeeded the KPRA and strengthened and developed into regular armed forces after the liberation of Korea inflicted an ignominious defeat upon the U.S.  aggressors which boasted of being the \"strongest\" in the world and their stooges in the last Fatherland Liberation War under the leadership of the President and honorably defended the freedom and independence of the country, he said.\r\n   As the revolutionary army has General Kim Jong Il with literary and military accomplishments  and virtue and talent as its Supreme Commander, it has greeted its best days of development as the main force for the accomplishment of the revolutionary cause of Juche. He opened up a new era of historic change in the building of Juche-based army, the reporter said.\r\n   Kim Il Chol further said:\r\n    \"Today our people's army has prepared itself to be the lifeguards  and death squads most faithful to the Supreme Commander. The army is filled with the spirit of unity between officers and men, between superiors and subordinates based on loyalty to the leader and revolutionary comradeship. It is able to annihilate the enemy wherever he may be on the earth. \r\n   \"In recent years Korean socialism has advanced along the road of Juche, though the imperialists and reactionaries have intensified their campaign to isolate and stifle the DPRK as never before and the confrontation with the enemy has reached a dangerous phase in which a war may break out any moment. The realities of Korea vividly prove the greatness of  General Kim Jong Il's  revolutionary guidance over the army.\r\n   \"His on-the-spot guidance to people's army units is a brilliant model of the art of the revolutionary leadership over the army, which will brilliantly be recorded in history of the revolutionary struggle as an event which fully demonstrates the potentials of the invincible people's army based on the harmonious whole of the supreme commander and his men.\"\r\n   The reporter called for firmly establishing the leadership system  and revolutionary morale under which the whole army acts as one upon the orders of General Kim Jong Il. He also called for worshiping only the Supreme Commander absolutely and making revolution to the end under his leadership.\r\n   Referring to the reckless military threat and arms buildup by warmaniacs of the U.S., Japan and South Korea which get on the nerves of the DPRK, he warned them not to act rashly, mindful of the indomitable fighting spirit and will of the people's army and people of Korea.    \r\n\r\n"

It is also a condition for an atmosphere of genuine reconciliation and friendship in Asia, he said.\r\n   He bitterly denounced the Japanese government for evading its reponsibility and compensation for the \"comfort women\" crime.\r\n   He described the establishment of the \"Asia Fund for Women\" as a token of Japan's discrimination against other nations. Japan must admit its crime politically, morally and legally and demonstrate its willingness to thoroughly atone for the crime, he urged.    \r\n \r\n\r\n"
