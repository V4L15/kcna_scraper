            "content": "Tenacious U.S. Confrontation Psychology against DPRK Revealed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 18 (KCNA) -- The \"national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2007\" passed through the U.S. Senate in June calls on the state and defense departments to submit to the Congress a report on \"deterrent to north Korea\" of the \"UN Command\" present in south Korea.\r\n The report is to specify the possibility of requesting the nations, which took part in the Korean war, to dispatch their troops in peace time in a bid to reinforce the \"deterrent to north Korea\" of the \"UN Command\", those nations which are able to send troops and, in case they are dispatched, the effect on the diplomatic efforts to remove \"nuclear threat\" from someone, and so one and so forth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson in a commentary Tuesday describes this as a vivid indication that the U.S. has made the provocation of a second Korean war an established fact and is preparing another military attack on the DPRK under the UN cloak. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that, in case the \"UN Command\" is reinforced with multi-national military forces as the U.S. wants, this will adversely affect that much the military strain on the Korean Peninsula, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is not interested at all in the peace and security of the Korean Peninsula. It only dreams of military hegemony in this region. To be sympathetic to this is, to all intents and purposes, tantamount to being embroiled into the anti-pacific and hegemonic policy of the U.S. and to a suicidal act of jumping into fire with faggot on one's back. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The countries concerned should make a cool-headed analysis of the situation obtaining on the Korean Peninsula and refrain from doing a thing not helpful to world peace and security.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They are, at the same time, working hard to isolate and stifle the DPRK through political pressure and economic sanctions and watching for a chance to mount a military attack on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean People's Army and people rallied close around Kim Jong Il who has pursued the Songun policy are driving the U.S. imperialists and their allies to a tight corner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality requires all the countries and nations to grasp the validity and vitality of the Songun policy of Kim Jong Il who has protected the dignity and honor of the country and the nation by augmenting the national power with priority given to military affairs and learn from it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But they have demonstrated a new spirit of the times and raised high the torch of struggle and innovation, picturing to themselves the day they would emerge victorious. The servicepersons, in particular, have set an example in the revolutionary cultured practice in the Songun era and all the people have led an optimistic life, making redoubled efforts to spruce up their home towns, villages and working places. This is a clear proof of their firm faith in the justice of their cause and its victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people's faith and optimism about a sure victory fully reflect their undisputed trust in Kim Jong Il and their will to follow him to the last. They are firmly convinced and optimistic that they are sure to win as long as they are led by Kim Jong Il. This is the truth of the revolution deeply enshrined by the army and people of the DPRK because he represents their life and soul and plays the role of a banner for winning every victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are dedicating themselves to upholding the Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il because they are firmly convinced that the path of Songun indicated by him is the most just path and a road of victory and glory as it guarantees the prosperity and happiness of the country. This is a vivid manifestation of the Korean people's revolutionary faith and optimism as they trust and follow their leader only. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK all out in the grand march for Songun revolution are convinced of the day of victory and full of faith and optimism to make a higher leap forward, looking back on the history of their proud struggle.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But the fighter ran into the tree to be crashed. From then on, the people of Ichon have called the tree \"hero gingko tree.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By the collision, only one bough remained. Since then, the tree has shot out many branches to become exuberant. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tree is 20 meters high, 7.8 meters in the circumference of the lower part of the trunk and 14 meters in diameter of its umbrella. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It opens flowers in the middle of April and bears some 100 kilograms of fruits every year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The state has registered the tree as a natural monument.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

There were only five GIs who made a step forward. Three of them had their heads, arms and legs bandaged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It meant 99 percent of the company was killed or wounded. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The company was an epitome of the losses divisions including the First Cavalry Division under the U.S. Eighth Army Corps had sustained. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n MacArthur had been supplemented with 10,000 - 15,000 forces from the U.S. mainland every month from August 1950. Surprised at the tragic reality which was more miserable than what he had imagined, he gave up his original plan to upgrade those who \"distinguished themselves\" and went back. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Terror about death prevailed in the U.S. army and evaders from military service ever grew in number. The U.S. Navy Prosecutor-general deplored that the number of deserters of the U.S. Navy reached 46,000 in the period from the start of the war to the end of 1952 and the deserters of the army amounted for 20,000 on a monthly average, sometimes 3,000 a day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the Korean war, 405,498 U.S. aggressors were killed, wounded or taken prisoners.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
