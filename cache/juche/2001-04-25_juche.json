Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The editorial continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The distinguished personality of President Kim Il Sung as a great man and his exploits lie in that he founded the army before anything else guided by the army-first idea and opened a new road of advancing the revolution with the army as its main force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The path covered by the Korean revolutionary armed forces since the first gun report in the forest of Mt. Paektu represents the glorious history in which they have fought as the vanguard of the generals of Mt. Paektu, learning from the idea, will, traits and spirit of general Kim Il Sung, commander of guerrillas on Mt. Paektu who founded and led the KPA, general Kim Jong Suk, anti-Japanese heroine, and general Kim Jong Il, supreme commander of the KPA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The editorial makes a particular mention about the fact that Kim Jong Il created the mode of army-first politics in the arduous period in which the country was at the crossroads: Defending  socialism or becoming a slave of imperialism and has solved all the problems arising in the revolution and construction in reliance upon the powerful KPA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA is a strong army based on comradeship whose servicepersons are firmly united thanks to the army-first idea and will of Kim Jong Il and an invincible army which always emerges victorious as Kim Jong Il does. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army-first banner of the Workers' Party of Korea is the banner of victory of Korean-style socialism which made the red flag of revolution vigorously flutter in this land and an everlasting banner of struggle which should always be held aloft as long as imperialism exists on the earth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il is the great successor to the lineage of Mt. Paektu and the tradition of army-first revolution and a staunch defender of socialism who emerges ever-victorious in the confrontation with imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people's army and the people of Korea will glorify the exploits Kim Il Sung performed in the army building for all ages, guided by the army-first idea of Kim Jong Il and under his leadership, and accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche to completion with the might of the invincible army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson carries an editorial titled \"The Korean people's army will demonstrate its honour of being the main force to accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche.\"    \r\n\r\n"
