Korean authorities hit for their decision to call Japanese king \"emperor\"\r\n   Pyongyang, September 27 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the National Democratic Front of South Korea (NDFSK) released a statement on September 22 denouncing the South Korean authorities for deciding to call the Japanese king \"emperor,\" the Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation said.\r\n   The \"emperor\" is a symbol of the Japanese imperialists' aggression and war crimes as well as pronoun of the devil who inflicted the incurable wounds of misfortune and pains upon the Korean people, the statement says, and continues:\r\n   Japan's moves for staging a comeback are getting all the more pronounced with each passing day and the \"emperor\" serves as a mental pillar of the resurgent militarism. A decision to call the Japanese king \"emperor\" in the context is one more humiliating act vis-a-vis Japan. It is as good as a declaration that the South Korean authorities will be a guide for reinvasion by Japanese militarism.\r\n   The South Korean authorities decided to call the Japanese King \"emperor\", the king who is the most villainous boss of Japan's samurais who hurt the pride of the Korean nation refusing to make an apology, compensation and reparation for the damage the Japanese imperialists imposed upon the Korean people during their colonial rule.\r\n   The decision cannot be pardoned at all because it is an unbearable insult to the martyrs who laid down their lives for the liberation of the country and to the millions of people who were killed by Japanese after conscription and labor draft as well as the \"comfort women for the army.\" \r\n\r\n"

The idea is a firm guideline for frustrating the obstructive moves of the separatists at home and abroad and accelerating the reunification of the country, says rodong sinmun today in a signed article.\r\n   In order to create an international climate favorable for Korea's reunification, the north and the south should place the common interests of the nation above all in external relations, the paper says, and continues:\r\n   The South Korean authorities should not depend on outside forces nor cooperate with them but reject them by pooling strength with fellow countrymen with the stand of national independence.\r\n   The north and the south should avoid confrontation and competition that impairs the dignity of the nation and helps outside forces to catch fish in troubled waters in the international arena and cooperate with each other in defence of the common interests of the nation and to exalt its honour.\r\n   The South Korean authorities should change their policy of confrontation with the north into a policy of reconciliation with it with compatriot feelings and refrain from hindering national reconciliation and unity.\r\n   The United States should fundamentally rectify its anachronistic policy toward the DPRK and refrain from obstructing the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea.\r\n   We do not consider the united states the sowrn enemy but want DPRK-U.S. relations normalised. The U.S. should honestly fulfil its commitments and obligation under the DPRK-U.S. framework agreement.\r\n   Japan should sincerely repent of its crime-woven past, renounce hostile policy toward the DPRK in the interests of the two peoples and in keeping with the requirement of the time and refrain from egging the South Korean authorities on to north-south confrontation and obstructing the reunification of Korea.\r\n   The United Nations should help solve the Korean issue peacefully and fairly, true to its commitment to impartiality and justice and should not allow its arena to be used in obstructing and delaying the reunification of Korea. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Korean anti-nuke peace committee on Japan's move for militarization\r\n Pyongyang, September 27 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Korean anti-nuke peace committee issued a statement on Saturday, bitterly denouncing Japan for igniting the train of arms race in the wake of the DPRK's peaceful satellite launch.\r\n   The Japanese government and high-ranking military officials argue that the \"self-defence forces\" should possess their own reconnaissance satellite and that Japan should join in the U.S. plan for ballistic missile defence including the Theatre Missile Defence (TMD). They are trying to include the needed expenses in next year's budget.\r\n   The statement brands this armament expansion move as a dangerous act that will stimulate and encourage arms race in East Asia and pose direct threat to peace and security in this part of the world.\r\n   The statement continues:\r\n   Japan, a defeated nation that is not to have its regular army, is systematically increasing military spending and continuously importing and developing uptodate military equipment and technology. This proves that militarism has revived in Japan and now influence Japan's politics.\r\n   Japan's military spending was several hundred million yen after the war, exceeded a trillion yen in the 1970s and reached 4,950 billion yen last year.\r\n   Japan's militarization will lead to overseas aggrandizement and aggression. This is a lesson drawn from modern history of Japan.\r\n   Why is Japan making a fuss branding the satellite launch of the DPRK as one for military purposes while describing its own satellite launch as one for peaceful purposes?\r\n   It is because Japan intends to lull domestic and foreign complaint and concern over its snowballing military spending, overseas dispatch of the \"self-defence forces\" and other activities for becoming a military power and make an excuse for promoting its militarization legitimately and overtly.\r\n   Japan has already laid a legal basis for legitimate involvement in hostile military action against the DPRK by revising the \"U.S.-Japan defence cooperation guidelines,\" a product of the Cold War. Japan's smear campaign is also aimed at shifting on to the DPRK the blame for regional arms race that will be caused by its overt militarization policy such as possession of reconnaissance satellite and introduction of the TMD system.\r\n   The Japanese authorities must cool their heads swollen with expansion fever and ponder over whom they oppose.\r\n   If Japan continues to move for militarization, obsessed with megalomania and overseas expansion fever, it will inevitably meet a more miserable fate than it did some 50 years ago. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
