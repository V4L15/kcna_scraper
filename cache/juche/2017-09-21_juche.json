They are, for instance, the adoption of the Law on the Protection of the Rights of the Child, promulgation of the Decree on the Introduction of the 12-Year Compulsory Education System and the institution as a national holiday of the founding day of the Children's Union, which was formerly a holiday for children only.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the consistent and unwavering stand of the DPRK to set the protection and promotion of the rights of the child as one of the primary principles of the State activities and provide them with the best of everything.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since its birth on September 9, 1948, the DPRK has creditably fulfilled its duty and role as the protector of the rights of the child through providing in its Constitution the issue of protecting the rights of the child and adopting a number of national and social welfare policies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Today, children in the DPRK are valued as the treasure of the country and masters of the future, growing up to be able workers, knowledgeable, morally sound and physically fit thanks to the policy of prioritizing children and love of young generation of respected Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un, he noted, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The persistent and vicious embargo and sanctions against the DPRK are not only hampering the endeavors for the protection and promotion of the rights of the child but also seriously threatening their right to survival.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such is the persistency and inhumanity of the sanctions imposed by the hostile forces against the DPRK that even the right of the child to good educational conditions and environment are violated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such inhumane and hideous sanctions against the DPRK that constitute violations of the ideal of humanitarianism and the spirit of the Convention must be lifted without any conditions and without delay.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK, as a State party to the Convention, will do its best in the future too to implement its obligations under the Convention in close cooperation with the Committee.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Members of the Committee on the Rights of the Child appraised the measures and achievements of the DPRK for protecting and promoting the rights of the child and asked a series of questions and the DPRK delegation gave full answers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The participation of the DPRK delegation to the session served as an important occasion showing that the DPRK is fully displaying its mission in the field of human rights including the protection and promotion of the rights of the child and attaching importance to the international dialogue and cooperation for the protection and promotion of genuine human rights."

Upset by the vexing demand from the Japanese reactionary authorities that they should not lose initiative at the Tokyo trial, the court declined the agenda carrying the important demand related to the future of Koreans in Japan in just ten seconds.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement said that this shameless act of the Tokyo District Court is a revelation of the deep-rooted bad intention of the Japanese reactionaries to undermine the national education for Koreans in Japan and also clearly proves the despicable nature of the Japanese authorities keen on frantic moves against the DPRK and Chongryon while faulting the DPRK's just step for bolstering the nuclear deterrence for self-defence. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The despicable and trite hostile act of the Japanese reactionaries who are using the issue of the national education for Koreans in Japan as a means for political and diplomatic pressure on Chongryon is a criminal act that can never be tolerated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The application of the tuition-free program for students of the Korean senior high schools has no ground to be declined or rejected in the light of the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists against the Korean nation in the past and from the aspect of international law and viewpoint of Japanese laws.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent unjust decision made by the court under the behind-the-scene manipulation of the Japanese authorities is a wanton violation of law and vicious human rights abuses against humanity in breach of International Convention on Human Rights on ensuring foreigners equal right to education.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The vicious discrimination and suppression perpetrated by the Japanese reactionaries against Koreans in Japan and their children for the mere reason that they are Koreans can never evade curse and censure by the international community, to say nothing by all Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese justicial authorities should behave with discretion, deeply repenting of what a big disastrous consequence the recent decision made to chime in those in power will have on the development of the DPRK-Japan relations."
