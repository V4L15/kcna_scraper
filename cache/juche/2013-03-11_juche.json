            "content": "Kim Jong Un Inspects Islet Defence Detachment\r\n Pyongyang, March 11 (KCNA) -- Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army Marshal Kim Jong Un Monday inspected the Wolnae Islet Defence Detachment, an outpost in the biggest hotspot in the western sector of the front very near from Paekryong Island.\n\t\t\t\t\t He saw children on the islet jumping for joy, taking hands of their mothers and held them in his arms one by one before having a photo taken with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He walked along the lane leading to the detachment and learned in detail about the terrains of the islet, deployment of firepower equipment and the soldiers' living for hours.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was briefed on the enemy's situation from the commander of the detachment at the observation post.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He acquainted himself with the troop deployment and targets of the 6th marine brigade of the south Korean puppet army on Paekryong Island and praised the detachment for being fully ready to go into action in order to cope with the enemy's attempt at provocations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underscored the need to keep increasing the density of fire and steadily modify and supplement the proposal for assignment of fire power duties and use of artillery pieces in order to cope with the enemy's changed troop deployment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He specified before the commanding officers of the detachment and the leading members of the artillery unit of the 4th Army Corps of the KPA who accompanied him the order of strike and density of fire for wiping out enemy's targets including radar posts, detectors for artillery pieces, Harpoon launching base, 130mm multiple rocket and 150mm self-propelled howitzer batteries under the 6th marine brigade of the south Korean puppet army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He ratified new regulations for naval operation: To fire threatening warning shells when enemy's warships sail close to waters on the extension of the Military Demarcation Line and fire powerful sighting shells to destroy them when they intrude into them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said his inspection of the islet defence detachments stationed in the biggest hotspot was to accurately learn about the combat preparations and finally confirm the order for precision strike at enemy's targets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The enemies are on a knife edge for fear of prompt shelling from the KPA, he said, adding that the enemies feel fretful after straining the situation by staging what they called annual drills in the most sensitive waters where the two opposing sides stand in sharp confrontation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the saying goes that a guy who is fond of playing with fire is bound to perish in flames, all the enemies quite often playing with fire in the sensitive hotspot should be thrown into a cauldron once I issue an order, he said, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The density of our fire is very high at present and it can strike enemy's targets on Paekryong Island three or four times and turn it into a sea in flames.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He told the commander of the detachment to photograph enemy's positions engulfed in flames and blown up during a battle and send pictures to the Supreme Command.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Once an order is issued, you should break the waists of the crazy enemies, totally cut their windpipes and thus clearly show them what a real war is like, he noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As I told commanding officers while inspecting the Jangjae Islet Defence Detachment and the Mu Islet Hero Defence Detachment, if the Supreme Commander issues an order, the artillerymen of the Wolnae Islet Defence Detachment, too, should make the first gun report and signal flare for the great war for national reunification, he stressed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Satisfied to see combat positions including the observation post built well in line with the instruction of the Supreme Command on making thorough preparations for all-out action, he said that this detachment is a perfect unit as it has turned into a strike base from a defence one.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He awarded higher military ranks to the commander and political commissar of the detachment on the spot by an order of the Supreme Commander as they have turned the detachment into an impregnable fortress, unsinkable warship.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had a photo taken with Kim Kwang Chol, private third class soldier, on watch duty and commanding officers of the detachment after taking them to his arms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round soldiers' bed room and education room to take warm care of their living.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  He gave a pair of binoculars and an automatic rifle to the detachment as souvenirs and had a picture taken with soldiers and their families.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He enjoyed a performance given by the art group of the detachment soldiers on the same day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Praising them for giving a good performance and singing songs well, he said this was a model of the Songun culture. He also praised the detachment for conducting well the political and ideological education as intended by the party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Choe Ryong Hae, Kim Kyok Sik, Kim Yong Chol, Pak Jong Chon, Rim Kwang Il and An Ji Yong."

Water supply is of particular importance for fish farming, he added. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Feasting his eyes at the food factory and protein food factory standing near the outdoor ponds, he said with deep emotion that they were visited by Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said people cannot substantially benefit from fish farms if the supply of food for fishes is not put on a par with fish production no matter how many modern ones are built. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Seeing the letters displayed in the compound of the fish farm \"Sturgeons go to sea while the DPRK advances into the world\", he told the officials to add the letters \"Satellites enter space\".

Korea to Be Held Accountable for Catastrophic Consequences: CPRK\r\n Pyongyang, March 11 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) issued the following statement on Monday:\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and south Korean puppet warmongers finally kicked off Key Resolve joint war maneuvers, the provocative saber-rattling for invading the DPRK, despite its repeated warnings and strong denunciation at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The madcap joint war maneuvers under way in the sky, ground and seas of south Korea in parallel with Foal Eagle joint war exercises which started on March 1 are participated in by U.S. imperialist aggressor forces, south Korean puppet troops, armed forces of satellite countries including the UK and Australia, U.S. nuclear carrier group, B-52 strategic bombers, F-22 Stealth fighters, Aegis destroyers and other ground, air and naval strike means equipped with nukes and live shells.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Timed to coincide with the large-scale north-targeted war exercises, the puppet authorities and military gangsters are openly letting loose a spate of provocative outbursts calling for \"striking commanding forces and strongholds\" and \"bringing down the north's regime\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such three-dimensional joint war exercises are the most dangerous drills for a nuclear war and most undisguised provocations unprecedented in their nature, scale and the program of their drills.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces are, however, describing the war maneuvers as \"annual defensive ones\" to cope with the \"north's provocation\" and \"threat\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Do they have any reason for raising a hue and cry over someone's \"threat\" and \"provocation\" while posing a real threat and committing provocations?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the height of shamelessness for the U.S. and its stooges, military gangsters to paint the war exercises for aggression as \"annual defensive ones\" while staging them after keeping huge nuclear war hardware close to the DPRK's gate for decades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t How can the largest-ever nuclear war maneuvers aimed to mount a preemptive strike at the headquarters of the other party and its strategic bases and \"bring down the regime\" be \"defensive ones\"?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Key Resolve joint military exercises for aggression are a clear declaration of war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We had already clarified that the Korean  Armistice Agreement would be completely nullified, all agreements on the north-south non-aggression be totally scrapped and second and third strong practical countermeasures be taken in succession from March 11 when the nuclear war maneuvers of the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces to invade the DPRK enter a full-dress stage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They have challenged the DPRK's ultimatum with their reckless saber-rattling, totally abrogating the AA and agreements on non-aggression, the minimum mechanisms for deterring a war. The complete collapse of this mechanism for averting a war has caused the situation on the peninsula to lead to the outbreak of a war, unhindered. This grave situation clearly proves that the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces have escalated the tension on the peninsula, deliberately taking issue with the DPRK's legitimate satellite launch for peaceful purposes and its nuclear test, a just measure for self-defence, for the purpose of provoking a war of aggression against the DPRK. It, at the same time, clearly indicates that the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppet forces are chieftains of a war and arch disturbers of peace on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's option has become clearer as they kicked off the above-said drills for aggression against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the invariable stand and will of the army and people of the DPRK to counter enemies coming in attack with a dagger with a sword, a rifle with an artillery piece and nukes with precision nuclear strike means of Korean style more powerful than them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hearts of our service persons and people are burning with the will to annihilate the enemies and all of them are now seeking a way to give vent to their pent-up grudge against them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All service personnel and people of the DPRK and all its offensive means including sophisticated nuclear strike means are in place for a final offensive for national reunification as it had already declared.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All strike means of the DPRK have already been put on alert and when they open fire, everything will turn into a sea in flames.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The service personnel and people of the DPRK have turned out as one in an all-out action. If the U.S. imperialists and south Korean puppet forces dare fire even a shell on the inviolable territory, seas and air of the DPRK, its army and people will not miss the golden chance but blow up the strongholds of invasion through merciless strikes and achieve the national reunification, the long-cherished desire of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Intolerable is the lawless society under the reign of the U.S. high-handed and arbitrary practices.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will sternly punish all unjust provocateurs and aggressors with arms for justice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and south Korean puppet forces are wholly to blame for all the ensuing catastrophic consequences from this moment."

Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Hyok, chairman of the youth league committee of the Pyongyang Thermal Power Complex, said that all the youth of the complex have turned out as one in a sacred war to take revenge on the enemies who are going reckless in kicking up a military frenzy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that the U.S. imperialists and other hostile forces got the UN Security Council to adopt a \"resolution on sanctions\" again in violation of international law and have escalated their moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The grim situation clearly proves that the DPRK was very just when it made the option for self-defence by beefing up the nuclear deterrence defying the enemies' ceaseless challenges and pressure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However desperate the enemies may be, we will keep to the road of independence, the road of Songun chosen by us.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The young vanguard are replete with the firm pledge to display the stamina of the Korean youth in an all-out showdown with the sworn enemy U.S. imperialists just like those heroes in the 1950s, including Ri Su Bok and Kang Ho Yong dedicated their youth and lives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We, youth fully support the statement of the spokesman for the Supreme Command of the KPA which stated that it would take more powerful and practical second and third countermeasures in succession against the war maniacs, and defend the sacred dignity of the country at the cost of their lives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Rim Un Hyok, student of Kim Hyong Jik University of Education, said that he is full of will to hold the arms of revolution again and resolutely and mercilessly punish those who seek to encroach upon the inviolable sovereignty and the supreme interests of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To look back on history, there were not a few countries and nations which lost the state rights and were subject to humiliation being caught in the whirlwind of upheaval overnight because of their weak state power, he said, and continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the wise guidance of the great Generalissimos Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, the DPRK has pushed forward the drive for building a thriving nation under the uplifted banner of independence despite unprecedented trials and hardships and thus become a world-level military power equipped with nuclear deterrence for self-defence no one dares provoke.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t More powerful than A-bombs is the single-minded unity of the army and people of the DPRK around the dear respected Marshal Kim Jong Un, matchless commander of Mt. Paektu. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Only victory is in store for the army and people of the DPRK who are all out in the just cause under the Songun revolutionary leadership of Kim Jong Un, the peerlessly great man."

            "content": "Second Korean War Is Unavoidable\r\n Pyongyang, March 11 (KCNA) -- The Korean Peninsula is now on the brink of war due to the tightened political, economic and military pressure of the U.S. and its allied forces on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t Upset by the fact that the DPRK has smoothly been building a thriving socialist nation despite the persistent blockade on the part of the imperialist allied forces, the United States prodded the UN to adopting a \"resolution on sanctions\" against the DPRK, terming its peaceful satellite launch \"development of long-range missile\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the DPRK conducted its underground nuclear test of higher level in face of their ganger-like action, the U.S. and its followers invented a new UN \"resolution on additional sanctions\", which is aimed to overthrow the leadership and socialist system of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"resolution\" stipulates for checkup of the DPRK's airplanes, vessels, government employees and institutions abroad. This is just a wanton violation of its sovereignty and dignity, and it is as good as giving a green light to the second Korean War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It totally denies the DPRK's self-defensive right and provides a pretext to stamp out it, while paving a way for openly launching military actions under the signboard of \"nuclear nonproliferation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In reality, the U.S. and its allied forces, including the south Korean puppet army, kicked off on March 1 Foal Eagle and Key Resolve joint military exercises, aimed at preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK, throughout south Korea. Involved in the exercises, which has been staged on a full scale from Monday, are super-large nuclear-powered carrier task force carrying nuclear warheads, B-52H and other huge war means of the U.S. forces for making ground, sea and air nuclear strikes and its allied forces including south Korea, U.K. and Australia. The south Korean puppet brasshats went the lengths of making such reckless anti-DPRK remarks as \"removal of the north's regime from the earth\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In face of the prevailing situation, the DPRK took tough countermeasures one after another. It declared that it would take strong counteractions in succession, void the Korean Armistice Agreement and all agreements on nonaggression between the north and the south and the joint declaration on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, put a total halt to the operation of the Panmunjom mission of the Korean People's Army and cut off the north-south hotline in Panmunjom. It also expressed its will to exercise its right to making preemptive nuclear strike on the bases of the aggressors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The important measures have enjoyed full support from all the servicepersons and civilians of the country, who are eagerly awaiting an order for the start of a sacred war for national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Army-people rallies took place in different parts of the country to harden their resolve to devotedly defend the country, rallied closer around their leader. Displayed in streets, villages, factories and farms, schools and all other parts of the country are slogan-boards and posters carrying such letters as \"The respected Supreme Commander, just give us your order!\", \"Deal a sledgehammer blow at those encroaching upon our sovereignty!\" and \"Punish the aggressors without mercy and achieve national reunification!\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army groups on the front, ground, naval, air and anti-air and strategic rocket units of the Korean People's Army, the Worker-Peasant Red Guards and the Young Red Guards have already launched an all-out action in line with the operational plan finally approved by Supreme Commander Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Supreme Command of the KPA declared that the Armistice Agreement, which has existed for form's sake, would be completely invalid from March 11.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world will witness how the DPRK wins in the fight against the aggression of the U.S.-led imperialist allied forces."
