We were deeply impressed by the shining achievements made in the high-tech field, in particular.\r\n Warm hospitality accorded to us by Chinese comrades in Wuhan, Guangzhou, Zhuhai, Shenzhen and every other place we went and the warm southern climate pleased us away from intense cold of mid-winter though for a short time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The progress made in the southern part of China which has undergone a rapid change and the stirring reality of China, in particular, deeply impressed us. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Still fresh in my memory is my visit to Shanghai five years ago that has changed beyond recognition. Touring various special economic zones making a great contribution to the socialist modernization drive with Chinese characteristics, we were more deeply moved by the Chinese people's enterprising and persevering efforts and fruits born by them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In a word, our visit to the southern part of China convinced us once again that China has a rosier future thanks to the correct line and policies advanced by the Communist Party of China. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The astonishing changes that have taken place in the vast land of China have been possible because the CPC laid down a new line and policies to suit the specific conditions of the country such as the thought of \"three represents\", the \" view on scientific development\" and \"construction of a harmonious socialist society\" and powerfully encouraged the people in their efforts to materialize them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is our firm belief that the hard-working Chinese people will successfully attain the far-reaching targets of the new 11th five-year plan and thus build a comprehensively well-off socialist society before long and accomplish the cause of complete reunification of the country without fail.\r\n We are rejoiced as over our own over the fact that everything goes on well in China, our neighbor, and satisfied over the steady vigorous development of the DPRK-China friendly relations despite the present complicated situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK-China relations provided and cultivated by revolutionary forerunners of the two countries go a long way towards giving a strong impetus to our socialist  construction and ensuring peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and, furthermore, in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world.\r\n We feel sincerely thankful to the Chinese party, government and people for invariably setting store by the DPRK-China friendship on a strategic level and rendering disinterested support and assistance to the Korean people in their struggle to defend socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Workers' Party of Korea and the DPRK government will as ever exert every effort to consolidate the ties of fraternal friendship deeply rooted in the minds of the two peoples and inject more fresh energy into this friendship, common boon, in various fields.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japanese Reactionaries' Anti-DPRK Moves Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 18 (KCNA) -- The Korean people will certainly settle not only the past crimes of the Japanese imperialists but also the anti-DPRK hostile moves Japan has systematically, overall and viciously pursued after the liberation of Korea.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries have pursued hideous hostile policy toward the DPRK in political, economic, military, diplomatic and all other fields since the liberation of Korea and the establishment of the genuine people's government in the northern half of Korea, the article says, and goes on:\r\n In the third article of the \"agreement\" signed between Japan and south Korea in 1965 the Japanese reactionaries specified that the south Korean \"government\" is a \"legitimate one\" in the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In view of the obtaining situation of the Korean Peninsula and the urgency of reunification, the DPRK government offered a proposal to hold the three-party talks between the DPRK, the U.S. and south Korea to discuss the issues of concluding a peace agreement between the DPRK and U.S., withdrawing the U.S. forces from south Korea and adopting a declaration of nonaggression between the north and south of Korea. However, the Japanese reactionaries took issue with the proposal to block it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The viciousness of the Japanese reactionaries' hostile policy toward the DPRK finds its manifestation at the 9th Asian Table-tennis Championships held in Japan in May 1988, the 24th Olympic Games in 1988 and other sports games. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In November 1991 the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK made public a statement announcing that it would sign the Safeguards Accord if the U.S. starts withdrawing its nuclear weapons from south Korea. But only Japan linked the \"nuclear issue\" with the negotiations for normalizing diplomatic relations between the DPRK and Japan to put unjustifiable pressure upon the DPRK. The Japanese government had raised the \"nuclear issue\" and the \"issue of abduction\" in each round of DPRK-Japan talks to lay artificial difficulties in the talks and impudently tried to adopt a \"resolution\" at the meeting of the Board of Governors of the IAEA to impose international pressure upon the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is Japan that alleged the launch of artificial earth satellite \"Kwangmyongsong No.1\" was a \"missile launch.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is the main point of the Japanese reactionaries' anti-DPRK hostile policy is economic sanctions upon the DPRK. They have put pressure and sanctions upon the DPRK, chiming in with the U.S. imperialists' economic sanctions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's anti-DPRK hostile moves have become more vicious since the publication of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration.\r\n Japan's desperate hostile moves against the DPRK and its bid to extremely aggravate the DPRK-Japan relations are aimed to evade the settlement of its past and find a pretext for reinvasion of Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The trial application shows that its proportion of disinsection is 98 percent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is economically profitable. As the insecticide is put in water by drops at certain intervals, 500 g of the insecticide per hectare (50 g in the term of medicinal component) is enough. It makes it possible to save manpower and agricultural chemicals compared with the method of spraying chemicals.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun Calls for Pushing Forward Three-point Patriotic Movement\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 18 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a by-lined article calls on all the Koreans in the north and the south and overseas to conduct a vigorous three-point patriotic movement for independent reunification, peace against war and great national unity in hearty response to the joint New Year editorial issued by the newspapers of the Party, the army and the youth league.\r\n It says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The three-point patriotic movement set forth in the joint editorial serves as the banner of struggle which helps encourage the burning patriotic zeal of all the Koreans and display it in practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The patriotic movement for independent reunification is a nation-wide patriotic movement to accomplish the cause of national reunification by giving full play to the common idea and feelings of the Korean nation which values its dignity and sovereignty most. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when all the Koreans put the dignity and interests of the nation above anything else to settle all the problems arising in accomplishing the cause of national reunification as required by the idea of \"By our nation itself\" with the firm consciousness of national independence and keep the nation-first spirit prevalent in all their residential quarters as pointed out in the joint editorial, will the hot wind of independent reunification sweep across the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The patriotic movement for peace against war is the struggle to give full play to the staunch stamina of the Korean nation rejecting aggression and domination to defend the peace of the country and the security of the nation.\r\n The U.S. reckless policy of aggression on Korea is sparking off the burning hatred of all the Koreans for the U.S. The patriotic movement for peace against war is mighty in getting all the Koreans to focus the spearhead of their struggle on the U.S., the root cause of aggression and war, with their will to defend the nation and peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The patriotic movement for great national unity is a movement for pooling all the Koreans' ardent desire for independent reunification and patriotic will. When all the fellow countrymen in the north and the south and abroad continue to boost the atmosphere of national reconciliation and unity as required by the June 15 era of reunification and further intensify solidarity in the movement for independent reunification and the struggle for peace against war, they have nothing fearful and insurmountable even if they face grave hardships under any complicated situation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
