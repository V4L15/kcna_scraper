            "content": "Minju Joson revela intencion malsana de sustitucion de administracion en Sur de Corea\r\nPyongyang, 29 de diciembre (ACNC) -- Hace unos dias, en el Sur de Corea se realizo la sustitucion parcial del gobierno. Publicando la lista correspondiente, Chongwadae hablo tanto de \"otro salto economico\" y la \"vida de los habitantes\" como si corregiria algo en seguida.\n\t\t\t\t\tLa presente sustitucion de las fuerzas conservadoras en Poder no pasa de ser una sofisteria de vampiros para chupar mas la sangre de los habitantes surcoreanos que estan en la situacion dificil por vida tan miserable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi inicia el periodico Minju Joson en un comentario individual divulgado el dia 29 y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl objetivo de esta farsa no persigue la resolucion del problema de la \"activacion de la economia\" y la \"vida de los habitantes\", sino el objeto de rehabilitar a toda costa la dictadura de \"Yusin\" al ganar sin falta la mayoria de escano en las elecciones parlamentarias de la \"Asamblea Nacional\" y alcanzar la ambicion de retoma del Poder aprovechando la division de las fuerzas de oposicion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRealmente, al mismo tiempo que realizo la reorganizacion de la administracion, el \"Partido Saenuri\" paso al sistema electoral antes que otros partidos politicos. No habra ningun cambio en la politica anti-popular de las autoridades conservadoras aunque fueran cambiadas las personalidades de alto rango de la administracion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAunque \"verifique\" con frecuencia a los nuevos determinados, no se cambiara nada la naturaleza anti-popular de las autoridades surcoreanas. Mientras tales tipejos sigan tomando el Poder, no se mejoraran la vida de los habitantes surcoreanos."
