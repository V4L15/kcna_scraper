Korea protested \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 29 (KCNA) -- U.S. State Secretary Powell's projected tour of South Korea is protested in Seoul, according to a news report.\r\n At least 400 members of the joint measure committee for checking the \"Missile Defense\" system (MD) and realizing peace held a rally in the street in front of the \"Christian Youth Hall\" in Seoul on July 27 in protest against Powell's Seoul visit. Then they marched along the street holding placards reading \"We oppose Powell's South Korean visit\" and \"We oppose MD.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the end of the demonstration they gathered in front of the U.S. military base in Ryongsan, Seoul, demanding a stop to the MD and the return of the base. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Earlier, more than 50 members of the organization held a press conference at the airport where he was supposed to arrive, to protest against his visit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The organization was reported to have planned to stage a demonstration in the vicinity of the \"government\" building and \"chongwadae\" where Powell is expected to visit and hold a rally and an overnight one-by-one demonstration in front of his lodging quarters and thrust a letter of protest to him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The national alliance for democracy and reunification in a statement released on July 27 in protest against Powell's South Korean visit held that \"the organization strongly rejects the South Korean tour by the State Secretary of the United States, the world's biggest rogue state that defies the Korean nation's desire for reconciliation and reunification and pushes the MD.    \r\n\r\n"
