Korea protested \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 29 (KCNA) -- U.S. State Secretary Powell's projected tour of South Korea is protested in Seoul, according to a news report.\r\n At least 400 members of the joint measure committee for checking the \"Missile Defense\" system (MD) and realizing peace held a rally in the street in front of the \"Christian Youth Hall\" in Seoul on July 27 in protest against Powell's Seoul visit. Then they marched along the street holding placards reading \"We oppose Powell's South Korean visit\" and \"We oppose MD.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the end of the demonstration they gathered in front of the U.S. military base in Ryongsan, Seoul, demanding a stop to the MD and the return of the base. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Earlier, more than 50 members of the organization held a press conference at the airport where he was supposed to arrive, to protest against his visit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The organization was reported to have planned to stage a demonstration in the vicinity of the \"government\" building and \"chongwadae\" where Powell is expected to visit and hold a rally and an overnight one-by-one demonstration in front of his lodging quarters and thrust a letter of protest to him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The national alliance for democracy and reunification in a statement released on July 27 in protest against Powell's South Korean visit held that \"the organization strongly rejects the South Korean tour by the State Secretary of the United States, the world's biggest rogue state that defies the Korean nation's desire for reconciliation and reunification and pushes the MD.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Museum that bears witness to GIs' crimes \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 29 (KCNA) - The Sinchon Museum in Sinchon county, South Hwanghae Province, is drawing many Korean and foreign visitors as it indicts the U.S. imperialists and their stooges for their monstrous atrocities. \r\n An unusually greater number of people visited the museum in June that marked \"June 25, the day of struggle against U.S. imperialism\" and in July which marks \"July 27, the day of victory in the war\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In just 50-odd days of their occupation of Sinchon when the Korean People's Army was making a temporary strategic retreat during the Korean War the U.S. imperialist aggressors killed in cold blood more than 35,000 civilians or a quarter of its population. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The barbarous mass killings perpetrated by GIs in Sinchon put the atrocities of the Hitler fascists into the shade. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They roped the legs of Ju Chun Il, model worker of the Sinchon Rice Mill, to the two separate carts and drove them in the opposite direction, thus killing him on the spot by tearing his limbs off. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They gouged out the eyeballs of civilians, men and women, young and old, and cut off their noses and ears, slaying them. Not content with this, they stripped women naked and drove wooden sticks into their wombs, killing them in cold blood. GIs' brutalities baffled human imagination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that the babies were happy enough to be with their mothers, GIs separated the babies from their mothers and detained them in another warehouse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They poured petroleum over the hungry babies scratching ground and walls with their fingers and threw torches there, burning all of them to death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ju Sang Won, who was 5 years old at that time, narrowly escaped from death. As a lecturer at the museum he used to tell visitors with bitter anger that he keenly realized the U.S. imperialist aggressors are heinous ogres and two-legged beasts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These thrice-cursed brutalities were not committed in Sinchon only. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Not content with killing Koreans with bullets and bombs everywhere they went in the northern half of Korea, GIs buried people alive, chopped them to pieces with axes and knives and even used poisonous gas and germ weapons to kill them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They killed in cold blood more than 1.1 million innocent civilians in different parts of South Korea including Rogun-ri, Yongdong county, North Chungchong Province. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people and the officers and men of the Korean People's Army can never forget those brutalities committed by the GIs during the last Korean War but renew their pledge to take revenge upon them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n KPA soldier Choe Song Hun stated that if the U.S. imperialists again ignite a war of aggression the soldiers of the people's army will take a thousand-fold revenge upon them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
