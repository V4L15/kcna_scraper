Every chamber has a thin flat stone set on four edgewise sides. Their top is covered with a stone roof and the chambers are supported by stone piles. therefore, it looks like the roofs laid sporadically. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Advanced forms are odok-type and mukbang-type. unlike chimchon-type, the odok-type reveals its appearance in the earth, which is formed with great stone slabs erected on the three sides of the four and with a roof put on them and then a flat stone covering the remaining side. it resembles a structure consisting of four walls and the roof. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The three walls of the mukbang-type are made of flat stones which are piled up like brick-laying and on top of them is a roof and the walls are reinforced with stones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This shows that the Korean dolmen developed from a simple structure into a sophisticated and refined one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These three types of dolmen representing every stage of dolmen development are found concentrically on the basin of the Taedong River centred on Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This shows that dolmen structure finds its cradle and centre on the basin of the river with Pyongyang at its centre, like every other aspect of the culture of ancient Korea. It provides clear evidence that Pyongyang was the capital of ancient Korea which existed for nearly 3,000 years in the east, with a fine history and cultural tradition, and the cradle of the Korean nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
