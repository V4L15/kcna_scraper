            "content": "DPRK Foreign Ministry's Spokesman Blasts U.S. Delaying Tactics in Solution of Nuclear Issue \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 28 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Ministry of Foreign Affairs released the following statement Friday blaming the U.S. for the deadlocked implementation of the October 3 agreement of the six-party talks: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The implementation of the October 3 agreement of the six-party talks is at a deadlock due to the behavior of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has not fulfilled its commitments as regards the lifting of the sanctions within the agreed period but insisted on its unreasonable demands concerning the nuclear declaration, thus throwing hurdles in the way of settling the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As clarified in the statement issued by the spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on January 4, the DPRK worked out a report on the nuclear declaration and informed the U.S. side of this in November last year. And when the U.S. proposed to have a further discussion on the content of the report with the DPRK, the latter has shown so far such magnanimity as responding to such negotiations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Simple is the reason why the DPRK responded to the negotiations on the issue of the nuclear declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration was so absurd as to raise the issue of \"suspected uranium enrichment\" in 2002, scuttling the DPRK-U.S. dialogue and straining the situation to an extreme pitch of tension. This pushed the DPRK to its access to nuclear weapons in the end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK rendered necessary sincere help in clarifying the issue raised by the U.S. side, taking into consideration the face of the Bush administration which was to blame for the former's access to nuclear weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the U.S. side claimed that the issue of \"suspected uranium enrichment\" can be solved if the DPRK tells about whereabouts of the imported aluminum tubes, the DPRK took such a measure as an exception as allowing U.S. experts to see even sensitive military objects and providing them with samples. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And when the U.S. side was the first to raise the issue of the \"suspected nuclear cooperation with Syria,\" it asked the DPRK to reconfirm its commitment not to proliferate the nuclear technology as the relevant object of Syria was destroyed by the bombing of Israel, making it unnecessary to clarify it any longer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This \"suspicion\", too, had nothing to do with the DPRK. But it was so broadminded as to meet this request as a part of its sincere efforts to help implement the October 3 agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe DPRK has sincerely taken part in the negotiations taking the face of the U.S. side into consideration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the further the negotiations went on, the greater disappointment the attitude of the Bush administration brought to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. side is playing a poor trick to brand the DPRK as a criminal at any cost in order to save its face. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK can never fall victim to the Bush administration's move to justify its wrong assertion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Explicitly speaking, the DPRK has never enriched uranium nor rendered nuclear cooperation to any other country. It has never dreamed of such things. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such things will not happen in the future, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Should the U.S. delay the settlement of the nuclear issue, persistently trying to cook up fictions, it will seriously affect the disabling of nuclear facilities which has been under way so far with a great deal of effort.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Spokesman for KPA Navy Command Issues Statement \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 28 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Navy Command of the Korean People's Army issued the following statement on Friday blasting the moves of the south Korean military authorities to \"protect\" the \"northern limit line\" at any cost: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the south Korean armed forces at a confirmation hearing of the \"National Assembly\" on March 26 blustered that he would \"defend the northern limit line in the West Sea as a line based on the conception of the territory under any circumstances\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His provocative outbursts are very dangerous and treacherous ones as they are not a simple expression of an individual view but openly reveal the wild ambition of the south Korean authorities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His vow to defend the \"northern limit line\" devoid of any legal validity betrays the intention of the south Korean military to put into practice the already worked out scenario for invading the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"northern limit line\" on which the south Korean military has insisted as a shield is a bogus line as it was unilaterally drawn by the U.S. imperialists right after the ceasefire without any agreement with the DPRK side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean warlike forces are now taking very disturbing military moves, vociferously asserting that the \"northern limit line defends five  islands in the West Sea\" and \"Yonphyong Islet is like a dagger to be thrust into one's throat while Paekryong Islet the one to be thrust into one's side\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Military brasshats including the chief of the General Staff of the Navy have held operational confabs on measures to defend the \"northern limit line\" to the end one after another in these areas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On March 18 the south Korean trigger-happy forces deployed more destroyers and guard ships in the frontline waters in the West Sea of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  On March 26 they infiltrated 14 warships deep into territorial waters of the DPRK side southeast of Ssanggyo-ri, Kangryong County, South Hwanghae Province on 13 occasions. The number of warships that intruded into those waters reached 5 or 6 on a daily average. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the meantime, fighter bombers and armed helicopters are kept fully ready to go into action any moment. They also issued an order to batteries of 155 mm caliber howitzers and various type guided weapons deployed on the above-said five islets to be ready to go into action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Combined firepower drills for \"striking and destroying\" warships of the Navy of the Korean People's Army and drills for tactical naval maneuvers are staged on Paekryong, Taechong and Yonphyong Islets and in waters around them almost everyday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A situation in which an armed conflict may break out any moment is prevailing in the frontline waters in the West Sea due to the reckless military provocations of the south Korean military warmongers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any attempt on the part of the south Korean military authorities to \"protect\" the \"northern limit line\" at any cost would only spark off a clash in the said waters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has so far made every sincere effort for the solution of the issue of the MDL in the West Sea fraught with the danger of military conflict. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A particular mention should be made of the fact that it arranged a series of military talks including the defence minister-level talks and repeatedly advanced most reasonable and realistic proposals for the implementation of the north-south agreement on setting up \"a special zone for peace and cooperation in the West Sea\" and fixing joint fishing waters and peace waters there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean military authorities, however, accepted none of those proposals and have been keen on how to defend the controversial \"northern limit line.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean warlike forces will not escape the nation's curse and condemnation but will have to pay a dear price for their continued escalation of the tension quite contrary to the trend of the June 15 era of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Navy of the Korean People's Army will neither pardon the south Korean military authorities' moves to keep the illegal bogus line as the maritime military boundary nor remain an on-looker to the reckless military provocation committed by warships of the south Korean army in the inalienable territorial waters of the DPRK side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should not misjudge the patience and self-restraint of the DPRK but immediately stop the intrusion of warships into its territorial waters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Should the arrogance of the south Korean forces lead to military provocations, the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK will mercilessly wipe out the provocateurs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean military warmongers had better behave with discretion.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is like pouring water into a bottomless pot. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Iraq has turned into an inescapable trap for the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Iraqi armed resistance forces are conducting attack operations against U.S. occupation troops in various parts of Iraq almost every day, making them shudder. The death toll of U.S. forces in Iraq has reached 4,000. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The morale of the U.S. forces in Iraq is sagging, seized with uneasiness and fear. The U.S. authorities and military feel acute shortage of strength of troops with the number of conscription evaders increasing and recruitment remaining a serious problem. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seeks to keep enforcing its policy of occupation with the help of its allied countries but it stands no chance of success. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those countries which dispatched their troops to Iraq at the request of the U.S. in the past have already withdrawn them from there or are likely to do so. This goes to prove that the collapse of the \"coalition forces\" led by the U.S. forces is becoming a reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is getting clearer today that the U.S. committed a great mistake when it started the Iraqi war under the pretext of \"anti-terrorism\" and it was the beginning of its misfortune. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Demonstrations condemning the U.S. and demanding an end to its war in Iraq are going on in an unbroken chain in different parts of the world. Voices demanding a halt to the Iraqi war are growing stronger as the days go by in the U.S., too as there is no prospect of its success. Iraq is being reduced to a bottomless pit to swallow the U.S. up in the true sense of the word. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Miserable, indeed, is the position of the U.S. making desperate efforts to straighten out the Iraqi situation after spawning it under an absurd pretext.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 28 (KCNA) -- The south Korean Federation of University Student Councils (Hanchongryon) released a statement on March 19, in which it denounced the authorities' decision to organize a \"team which specializes in arrests\" and hurl it into scenes of demonstrations as a move to revive the \"Paekgoldan (scull team)\" ill-famed for brutal suppression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement recalled that a large number of people who struggled for social progress and democratization were killed by the \"Paekgoldan\" and dictators who stayed in power with its help in the past period of fascist dictatorship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Expressing irrepressible resentment at the present \"government\" which is intensifying the suppression of people under the pretext of \"security\" even in the June 15 era of independent reunification, the statement declared the authorities' attempt to restore the old dictatorship in south Korean society is bound to meet the unanimous denunciation of all the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hanchongryon will resolutely smash the authorities' moves for suppression and force them to pay dearly for the blood shed by the slain fellow students, it warned.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "MINREX califica de decepcionante conducta de EE.UU.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, 28 de marzo (ATCC) -- En relacion con el comportamiento de Estados Unidos que produce el estancamiento en la implementacion del Acuerdo del 3 de Octubre logrado en las conversaciones a 6 bandas, el portavoz del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea hizo publica este viernes la siguiente declaracion: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDebido al procedimiento de EE.UU., va cayendo en estancamiento la ejecucion del Acuerdo del 3 de Octubre de las conversaciones a 6 bandas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  EE.UU. no cumplio en el plazo acordado su deber para el levantamiento de la sancion sino entorpece la solucion del problema presentando de continuo sus injustas demandas relativas al aviso nuclear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Como ya se dejo en claro a traves de la declaracion del portavoz del MINREX fechada 4 de enero, en noviembre del ano pasado, la RPDC ya redacto el aviso nuclear y lo informo a la parte norteamericana. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTambien, a instancia de la parte norteamericana, vino procediendo hasta ahora con magnanimidad a las negociaciones bilaterales para consultar con mas profundidad el contenido de dicho documento. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Es simple el motivo de la aceptacion de esas negociaciones por parte de nuestro pais.\r\n  Al plantear en 2002 esa absurda \"sospecha de enriquecimiento de uranio\", la administracion Bush llevo a la quiebra el dialogo con Corea y empeoro al extremo la situacion obligando a esta a la posesion de armas nucleares.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Tomando en consideracion el decoro de la administracion Bush que tuvo que responsabilizarse por el respecto, ofrecimos con toda sinceridad la cooperacion necesaria para aclarar la \"sospecha de enriquecimiento de uranio\" planteada por la parte norteamericana. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Como la parte norteamericana dijo que podria disipar esa incertidumbre si nuestro pais le aclara el paradero de tubos de aluminio importados, facilitamos medidas prerrogativas de permitir a los especialistas norteamericanos visitar nuestras instalaciones militares delicadas y ofrecerles las muestras. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nCuando comenzo a cuestionar la \"sospecha de cooperacion nuclear de la RPDC con Siria\", la parte norteamericana solicito simplemente la ratificacion del compromiso de la parte coreana sobre la no- proliferacion nuclear diciendo que no hace falta investigar mas ese asunto, ya que las instalaciones correspondientes de Siria fueron destruidas por el ataque aereo israeli. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Aunque esta \"sospecha\" tampoco tiene nada que ver con nuestro pais, aceptamos con magnanimidad esa peticion como parte de nuestros sinceros esfuerzos por poner en practica el Acuerdo del 3 de Octubre. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Nuestro pais vino procediendo con sinceridad a las negociaciones  tomando en consideracion la honra de la parte estadounidense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Pero, a medida que avanzan las negociaciones, nos quedamos decepcionados por la actitud de la administracion Bush. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Para el decoro de si misma, la parte estadounidense recurre a los metodos sucios para convertir a toda costa a la RPDC en la culpable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Pero, nunca podemos convertirnos en la victima para justificar la injusta insistencia de la administracion Bush. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Evidentemente dicho, nunca incurrimos en el enriquecimiento de uranio ni en la cooperacion nuclear con otro pais. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nNunca hemos pensado en esas cosas ni se nos ocurriran en lo adelante. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Si EE.UU. retarda la solucion del problema nuclear pretendiendo convertir en hechos lo que no sucedio, esto tendra serios impactos en la neutralizacion de instalaciones nucleares, que ha venido impulsandose a duras penas hasta ahora.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
