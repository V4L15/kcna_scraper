Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun politics is an independent one for repelling foreign interference with arms of justice and protecting the dignity and sovereignty of the nation. The U.S. imperialists dare not attack the DPRK though they regard it as a thorn in their flesh. This is a proof of the validity and great vitality of the Songun politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The politics represents the unshakable will and pluck of the army and people of the DPRK not to allow anyone to infringe upon the sovereignty of the country and nation even a bit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It serves as a just treasured sword to remove the danger of war from the Korean Peninsula and protect its peace and security with matchless arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But for the Songun politics, a nuclear war would have broken out on the peninsula more than once and the whole territory of Korea would have been engulfed in that war to force all the Koreans in the north and south to suffer its holocaust. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun politics also serves as a powerful engine to protect the Korean nation's cause of reunification, strengthen the pro-reunification patriotic forces and push forward the process of reconciliation on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Strengthening the internal forces for reunification provides a sure guarantee for the success in the reunification movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people, too, are turning out in the struggle for independence against the U.S. in the spirit of national independence, quite different from what they did in the past. There is only the structure of the Korean nation's confrontation with the U.S. on the peninsula where anti-Americanism has become the trend of the times. And \"By our nation itself\" has become an idea of all the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite natural for all the Koreans in the north, the south and overseas to highly praise the Songun politics which fully demonstrates its vitality in practice and support it as the most patriotic politics to keep the nation alive and bring about a bright future of a reunified country.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 17 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the National Democratic Front of south Korea issued a statement on Tuesday in denunciation of the noisy campaign of descendents of pro-Japanese traitors to retake their \"forefathers' land\", according to the Kuguk Jonson Internet site.\r\n The Korean nation had been subject to the unbearable fate of colonial slavery for over 40 years, having lost the state power to the Japanese imperialists owing to such pro-Japanese traitors as Ri Wan Yong, Ri Kun Thaek and Song Pyong Jun, the statement noted, and added: Those traitors should have been punished by a stern judgement of history after the August 15 liberation of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It further said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The judicial authorities patronize the descendents of the traitors and admit their ownership, arguing that there is no legal ground for the state to confiscate the land, even though it belonged to pro-Japanese elements. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe scandalous campaign of the descendants of pro-Japanese elements to retake land is an inevitable offspring of the U.S. colonial rule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As long as the U.S. stays in south Korea and patronizes such   pro-U.S. and pro-Japanese traitorous forces as the Grand National Party, it will be impossible to stop such impudent act as the above-said campaign, not to speak of the settlement of the Japanese imperialists' past crimes  If the tragic reality today, in which the descendents of pro-Japanese elements who sold off the country become influential, is to be rectified,\r\nall the people should turn out in a fight to end domination and subjugation by outsiders and resume national sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the present, the people of all walks of life should intensify the fight to confiscate all the properties of the pro-Japanese traitors and get the U.S. forces withdrawn from south Korea, while struggling to institute a \"special law on the redemption of pro-Japanese elements' properties.\"  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a serious mistake and blunder that may entail irretrievable catastrophic consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Should the U.S., overconfident of its \"strength,\" opt for starting a war of aggression against the DPRK, persistently pursuing its hostile policy to stifle Pyongyang, the latter will mercilessly wipe out the aggressors with the matchless arms of Songun and achieve national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson urges the south Korean authorities to stop such treacherous acts as allowing the U.S. carrier to enter their port and join the aggressors in their war maneuvers, dropping their servility to the U.S. and anti-north confrontational posture as early as possible.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Putin's DPRK visit marked historic events as they put the DPRK-Russia friendship on a higher level in keeping with the need of the new century, the desire of the two peoples and the trend of the development of international relations, and served as an engine of injecting strong dynamism into the bilateral relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently Kim Jong Il paid a visit to the Russian embassy here and received a medal commemorating the 60th anniversary of the victory in the Great Patriotic War presented by Russian President V.V. Putin.
