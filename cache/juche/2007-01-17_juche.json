But this was nothing but a beguiling ruse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What it really pursues is to consummate its capabilities of a preemptive attack on the DPRK and carry it into practice when necessary in a bid to implement its policy of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In its drive to translate into practice its policy of stifling the DPRK by force of arms, the U.S. is now massively deploying aggressive armed forces in and around the Korean Peninsula while scheming to frantically stage war exercises under various names for boosting the capacity of operational command. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In inveigling Japan into the establishment of a missile defense system, too, the U.S. seeks to intensify joint military actions against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan plunge itself into a joint military action with the U.S. forces, it will be an exercise of \"the right to collective self-defense\" and will go against the principle of \"exclusive defense.\" Nevertheless, Japan is rolling up its sleeves in this as it judges that this is favorable for the realization of its reinvasion scheme against the DPRK and overseas expansion policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and Japan are desperately trying to provoke a new war on the Korean Peninsula at whatever cost as they see eye to eye with each other in their criminal aim and interests.

            "content": "Japan Urged to Redress Its Past Crimes \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 16 (KCNA) -- Japan has sidestepped the issue of redressing its crime-woven past for more than 60 years since the defeat of the Japanese imperialists. There are not a few countries that committed war crimes in the world but it is only Japan that has played sleight of hand to hide those crimes and evade its responsibility for redressing them. Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed commentary carried with the approach of 62 years since their defeat.\r\n Recalling that Japan has insisted that the issue of Japan's redress of its past had already been settled, asserting that it was a \"simple comparison\" and \"mistake\" to compare Japan with Germany over the issue of settling past crimes, the commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has never shown its will to properly repent of, apologize and compensate for its crime-woven history, quite contrary to Germany. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While Koizumi was in power, Japan made a desperate bid to hold a responsible post at the UN only to suffer disgrace. The international community curses the Japanese reactionaries as rascals unrepentant of their crime-woven history. Nevertheless, the Abe Cabinet is keen to create the impression that Japan's failure to win trust of the international community was attributable to \"shortcomings in its political diplomacy,\" instead of finding its cause in the issue of redressing its past wrongs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's foreign policy can be termed diplomacy aimed at winning popularity through dependence on the U.S. and bribing operations. It is the true nature of the island country to improve its image by offering money or goods to other countries while serving big countries. This nature remains even today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The crimes committed by Japan can never be forgotten no matter how much water may flow under the bridge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's honest settlement of its past crimes would be a starting point in getting rid of its blemished conscience and getting confidence of the international community.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The construction was started as part of the so-called \"mid-term national defence program\" in 1995.  \r\n A spokesman for the Korean National Peace Committee in a statement on Tuesday dismissed the construction of the naval base as an extremely dangerous military move of the warlike forces of the south Korean military to convert the Jeju Island into an advance base for carrying out the U.S. new military strategy to invade the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Describing the construction of the Jeju naval base as a link in the chain of the moves for establishing the U.S. missile defence system covering Phyongthaek, Inchon, Kunsan, Kwangju and Jeju, the statement continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The moves for the construction of the above-said naval base stepped up by the south Korean warhawks in real earnest while modifying and supplementing anti-north war scenarios in all aspects together with the U.S. clearly prove that their moves to invade the DPRK have entered a dangerous phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean warhawks should immediately stop the construction of the Jeju naval base, clearly understanding that the arms buildup and saber rattling for aggression will only invite self-destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
