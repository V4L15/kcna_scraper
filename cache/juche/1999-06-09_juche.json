During the U.S. delegation's visit, we allowed it an adequate access to the project and rendered cooperation to it.   The visit proved objectively that the underground facility in Kumchang-ri is an empty tunnel, not related to nuclear development at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As a result, it was clearly proved once again that we have been sincerely implementing the Geneva agreed framework.    The point is for what the tunnel in Kumchang-ri will be used. This depends entirely upon the attitude of the U.S. side concerning the implementation of the DPRK-U.S. agreement reached in New York.\r\n\r\n"

It also made clear that north-south high-level political talks  would be opened in the second half of the year after the priorities are implemented.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The commentary says:   The South Korean authorities have paid no heed to implementing them,  casting a gloomy shadow over the prospect of the talks.\r\n   They are floating a string of lies intended to create the impression that something has been settled between the north and south while  advertising that the north withdrew priorities. This is  nothing but a selfish  assertion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The north  proposed to the South Korean authorities the priorities for the purpose of removing the obstacle and holding substantial dialogue for reunification with them.   These priorities are pending implementation.   We make it clear once again that the priorities should be implemented unconditionally.   The South Korean authorities should rescind a wrong thought to use the issue of inter-Korean dialogue, which is vital to the nation, for achieving their sinister political aim.   The whole nation is closely following their attitude. \r\n\r\n"

In a year back the President Kim Il Sung called officials to his residence  who happened to have a lunch together. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe officials  were surprised to see food on the table.   The menur included only boiled uncrushed maize and soup of dried radish leaves prepared with bean paste.   An anti-Japanese revolutionary fighter, who sat at the same table, asked the President why he was taking such a simple meal when it was neither the time of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle nor the wartime.   The President answered that he was recalling the past arduous days while he was frequently eating boiled uncrushed maize.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The President, who regarded \"to believe in the people as in heaven\" as a maxim and shared sweets and bitters with the people, never  allowed any privilege and preferential treatment.   During the arduous anti-Japanese armed struggle, he took the same meal as that of the ordinary soldiers and went in the same uniform as they did.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He distributed equally to his soldiers parched rice powder that had been offered as his own share and ate it together with them. This is a story of \"bowl of parched rice powder\"  widely known among the Korean people.   Besides, the President took simple meals like an ordinary man, saying he should take cooked millet as the ordinary people did even after the liberation of the country and in the post-war period.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   General Secretary Kim Jong Il, who is identical to the President in boundlessly humble and popular personality, is leading the same frugal life as that of the people, who are undergoing temporary trials caused by the recent natural disasters for several consecutive years and by the isolation and suffocation moves of the imperialists.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He is always wearing a humble suit of jumper on his ceaseless on-site guidance. During his trip he usually takes rice balls or boiled potatoes as his meals. He unreservedly eats simple meals together with  soldiers of the people's army.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAs they are led by the great leader, who is pulling through trials and difficulties always together with the people, the Korean people are filled with conviction and optimism with which they are marching cheerfully although their path is thorny. \r\n  \r\n"
