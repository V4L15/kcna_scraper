Terming this another anti-DPRK smear campaign, Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article says it is nothing but a manifestation of sinister attempts to cover up their crimes in violating the human rights of the south Korean people and the woeful human rights record in south Korean society.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people's dignity and sovereignty are wantonly trampled upon in south Korea dominated by the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The human rights problem in south Korea is directly linked with the U.S. imperialists' policy of subjugation. The successive south Korean regimes which have been no more than tools of the colonial rule of the U.S. have mercilessly trampled underfoot the independent rights of the people by heinous acts of flunkeyist treachery and fascist repressive rule. The working people, therefore, are undergoing misfortunes and sufferings, denied all the rights man should enjoy, from the right of social and political life to the right to existence, the most elementary right in human life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The right to genuine political life can be said to be the rudiment of the human rights but the working people in south Korea are barred by law from free participation in political life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean working people are languishing in non-rights and poverty. Such being the case, south Korea has not yet cleared itself of the shameful stigma of \"a grave of democracy\" and \"a barren land of human rights\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is, in fact, the very one which has caused the serious human rights record in south Korea and the U.S. imperialist aggression troops stationed in south Korea are the chief criminal in it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article calls upon the south Korean people to drive away the U.S. imperialist aggression troops forcing political non-rights and monstrous slavery on them and maltreating them like beasts and make the south Korean society independent and democratic.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But, dissatisfied with the judgment, he said he would visit the shrine in the future, too, protesting that he could hardly understand why it was against the constitution when he paid the visit according to his individual faith.\r\n In this regard, Rodong Sinmun in an article today notes that the Japanese reactionaries are going to instill the conscience of aggression deeply into the Japanese and get support from them by highly honoring and respecting the war criminals through the visit to the shrine and thereby realize their wild ambition for overseas aggression at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present Japanese ruling quarters are the most reactionary and ultra-right conservative defenders and revivers of militarism among the successive forces in power in Japan. Typical proof of this is that they have sped up the creation of institutional devices for the conversion of Japan into a military power and overseas aggression with greater zeal than ever before, enacted various war-related laws in disregard of the \"peace constitution\" and dispatched \"SDF\" troops to combat zones for military operations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is very ill-boding that the Japanese reactionaries are scheming to put the visit to the shrine on a regular, formal and mass basis. This is, in essence, the building of the foundation of militaristic idea for overseas aggression and agitation of a war. The fiercer the wind of the visit to the shrine, the wilder the moves for militarization, building of a military power and overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The danger of a war by Japan is daily growing and peace and security are facing a grave threat in Asia. The Asian people should put up a stiff fight to block the Japanese reactionaries' visit to the Yasukuni Shrine and their moves for overseas aggression.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
