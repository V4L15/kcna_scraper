Korea\r\n Pyongyang, August 8 (KCNA) -- A spokeswoman for the Central Committee of the Democratic Women's Union of Korea (DWUK) released a statement Friday denouncing the sexual slavery committed by the U.S. imperialist aggression troops in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t The Wall Street Journal in its recent article said that sex stations have been installed and operated in villages of U.S. military bases in south Korea at tacit connivance of the puppet government, the statement noted, and continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The majority of the women taken to the stations were those driven into dire poverty or those who were abducted by gangsters and sold off. They can not walk out of the villages once they go into them. The south Korean puppet government directly controls the villages and mobilizes police to prevent women from running away. It called the women in the villages \"patriots\" and told them not to cause any trouble with GIs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Comfort women for the U.S. forces\" are said to number thousands in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sexual slavery for the U.S. imperialist aggression troops is little short of the hideous sexual slavery enforced by the Japanese imperialists against Korean women in the past. This is an intolerable insult to the Korean women and a wanton encroachment upon the dignity of the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Central Committee of the DWUK brands the sexual slavery committed by the U.S. imperialist aggression troops against south Korean women as one of the unpardonable, most hideous human rights abuses of modern version.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since they set their foot in south Korea, GIs did not hesitate to commit all kinds of abnormal and shuddering crimes against women and this was connived at and encouraged by the U.S. and the south Korean puppet authorities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nothing has changed in the miserable situation of the south Korean women since the present chief executive took office in Chongwadae but shuddering sexual assaults against women have become all the more undisguised.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is no such despicable group of traitors like the south Korean puppet forces as they behave so cowardly as to offer fellow women as sexual slaves for the foreign occupation troops and shield their sexual slavery.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As long as the U.S. aggression troops are present in south Korea and the group of pro-U.S. lackeys stay in power, the history of shame will go on and south Korean women can never get rid of the sexual slavery.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the puppet forces should apologize for the sexual slavery for the U.S. forces in south Korea and own full responsibility.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korean women and other people of all social standings should actively turn out in the struggle to drive the U.S. aggression troops, the root cause of misfortune and pain of Koreans, out of south Korea and settle accounts with the U.S. imperialists, the sworn enemy of the Koreans."

This was the driving force which ushered in the June 15 era of reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At a time when the 20th century was replaced by the 21st century, the north-south summit was provided for the first time in the history of national division and the June 15 joint declaration, the milestone of reunification common to the nation, was adopted. This would be unthinkable without his Songun politics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He led the struggle for defending socialism and nation minus gunfire to one victory after another with invincible Songun politics in the most trying period, put the DPRK on the status of the world's military power and provided favorable environment for achieving the country's reunification. These were the greatest feats of the national historic significance performed by him."

Against this backdrop there was harsh criticism at a hearing of the Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs under the International Relations Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives that the lazy policy of the administration called \"strategic patience\" is being torn to pieces and the U.S. is waiting for north Korea to beg for negotiations, how long will the policy of the strategic patience last and should we be patient for hundreds and thousands of years.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. \"strategic patience policy\" toward the DPRK is bound to go bust for its vulnerable and reactionary nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After its emergence the Obama administration adopted it as its reactionary foreign policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK, pursuant to the \"strategic patience policy\", a replica of the preceding government's hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pursuant to this \"policy of waiting\", the U.S. has escalated its moves to stifle the DPRK while pressurizing it to \"dismantle its nukes first\" and isolating it in military, economic and diplomatic fields.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Denying the legitimate right to develop space of a sovereign state, the U.S. instigated the UN Security Council to adopt a \"resolution on sanctions.\" It has perpetrated high-handed hostile acts against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Being steeped in antagonism toward the DPRK to the marrow of its bone, the U.S. turned down all its constructive proposals to settle the unstable situation on the Korean peninsula as well as broad-minded offers made by it to discuss various issues including the denuclearization of the peninsula and the rest of the world. Moreover, the U.S. has persistently escalated blockade and military pressure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Staging offensive and aggressive joint military exercises non-stop, the U.S. has steadily made nuclear blackmail against the DPRK while increasing the frequency and scale of those exercises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Due to the U.S. moves to stifle the DPRK, it was compelled to have access to nukes under the grave situation in which the supreme interests of the country were encroached upon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK ranked itself among the nuclear weapons states and had access to powerful nuclear strike means. The responsibility for this development entirely rests with the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With the passage of time, the DPRK is demonstrating its might as a political power, military power and a nuclear weapons state capable of countering the U.S. nuclear blackmail with more powerful nuclear strike means and an all-out attack with all-people resistance of justice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. policymakers failed to calculate the consequences to be entailed by the \"strategic patience policy\". This was a serious mistake made by them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A senior researcher at the Cato Research Institute, U.S. said American leaders are plunging themselves into a quagmire as regards north Korea policy. In fact, Obama administration's north Korea policy is beset with danger of causing the worst results.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is ridiculous for the Obama administration to continue pinning hope on the bankrupt \"strategic patience policy.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Wasting time with this strategy would only help put the DPRK's powerful nuclear deterrence on a more elite basis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Foolish, indeed, are those who are handling the U.S. DPRK policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. had better judge the situation with a cool head and make a political decision in line with the trend of the times."
