All the political parties, groupings and people from all walks of life should rise up to put an end to the U.S. military occupation and colonial rule over south Korea in the same spirit as they displayed to win the victory in the \"general election\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should make the year 2005, the 60th year since the U.S. occupation of south Korea, the year the U.S. troops will be forced to withdraw from south Korea so as to put a definite end to the U.S. domination over it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Every political party and grouping and all the people from all walks of life in south Korea should convert the \"cooperation with the U.S.\" into the national cooperation and thus take an active part in the nation-wide struggle to build the structure of the entire Korean nation's confrontation with the U.S. under the banner of the Korean nation-first spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The appeal expressed the belief that the south Korean people would demonstrate the national spirit and wisdom to the whole world to build a new society without the presence of U.S. troops and make a new history of independence and reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the North Headquarters of the Nationwide Special Committee for Probing the Truth behind GIs' Massacres issued a statement on May 13 in which he denounces the deceptive and hypocritical plan of the United States to erect a \"memorial monument in Rogun-ri\" in south Korea as a mockery of and intolerable insult to the dignity of the entire Korean nation.\r\n He said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In July 1950 the U.S. imperialist murderers herded at least 400 defenseless civilians and refugees in Yongdong County, North Chungchong Province, promising them to take them to a \"shelter\" and summoned a flying corps by radio to indiscriminately strafe them, then drove them under an arch bridge and fired machine guns at them, killing them in cold blood. This is what is called \"the case of massacre of civilians in Rogun-ri\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The murderers say they will erect a \"monument\" in Rogun-ri, south Korea, the very site of massacre, to the memory of the victims. This cannot but be an impudent farce that can be staged only by Yankees and cannibals in human skin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is greatly mistaken if it thinks that it can lull the pent-up grievances and wrath of the south Koreans and their anti-American sentiments with such burlesque as erecting a \"memorial monument.\" The Korean nation will never forget the hideous massacre committed by the U.S., but will certainly force it to pay for its crimes a thousand times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should promptly stop such farce and frankly apologize and compensate for its shuddering atrocities in Rogun-ri and take its aggression forces to their den from south Korea right away. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement expressed the expectation that the organizations and people of all strata in south Korea will resolutely foil the U.S. policy of aggression toward Korea and vigorously turn out in a just struggle to accomplish the cause of the independent reunification of the country through national cooperation under the banner of Korean nation-first spirit.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Tok Islet, Inalienable Territory of Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- Members of a right-wing organization of Japan attempted to land on Tok Islets, on May 4 with Japanese politicians claiming that they belong to Japanese territory.\r\n This shows what extent Japan's ambition for territorial expansion has reached. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Korea has had the islets in possession from more than 1,500 years ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"The Chronicles of Three Kingdoms\", \"Geography in the True Records of Sejong,\" \"Account of Expedition to Korean Land\", \"Taedongyo Map\" (Korean Map) and others clarify that Tok Islets belonged to the State of Usan which had been under the rule of Korea from 500 A.D. ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to \"The History of Koryo,\" \"The True Records of the Ri Dynasty\" and others books, since the appearance of the State of Usan the islets had been recorded as Usan Islets, Sambong Islets (1476), Kaji Islets (1794) and Tok Islets (after 1881). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such geographical books and historical documents as the \"Territory Map,\" \"New Account of Expedition to Korean Territory\" and \"Newly Supplemented Reference Book\" write that Tok Islets, along with Ulrung Island, belong to Uljin Hyon (sub-county), Kangwon Province. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Different materials of Japan also clearly prove that Tok Islets belong to the Korean territory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The report on survey of Korea written by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in May 1870 notes that Song Islets (Tok Islets) are neighboring islets of Juk Island (Ulrung Island). Director of the Recording Department Watanabe and Director of Meritorious Officials Department Tanabe of the Foreign Ministry in their recommendations in December 1878 said that the islets called Song Islets in Japan belong to Ulrung Island of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Korea's Hydrographic Book\" (1908), \"Hydrographic Book on Korean Coasts\" (1923 and June 1945), \"Traveling Expenses and Expenditure Calculation\" (December 1938), the Modern Map (1951) attached to textbooks for Japanese schools and other books and materials published in Japan after 1905 correctly record Tok Islets as part of the Korean territory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean Government issued royal ordinance No.41 dated October 25, 1900 to reconfirm the dominium over Tok Islets to suit the then international legal system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Defying this stark reality, however, Japan is resorting to every despicable means, asserting that Tok Islets belong to Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One of the \"legal grounds\" for its assertion is the \"Incorporation of Tok Islets into Shimane Prefecture\" according to \"Shimane Prefecture's Announcement\" No.40 in 1905. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The announcement legally \"confirmed\" and \"recognized\" Japan's dominium over the islets, alleging that it had been possessed by nobody until Japan found them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This document was neither issued in the government's official gazette nor open to other countries. It was carried only in a prefectural official gazette. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes totally against the principle concerning prior occupation reflected in traditional international law. It can neither be the Japanese state's external notice nor law on occupation of and sovereignty over the islets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This illegal document which had been concealed was brought to public by Japan as a \"legal ground\" for its claim to Tok Islets after the defeat of the Japanese imperialists in World War II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will never tolerate the brazenfaced Japanese reactionaries for their persistent, illegal claim to Tok Islets.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The world greeted the new century and old generation is replaced by a new generation but there should not be any change in the class consciousness and fighting tradition of the revolutionary ranks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Everybody should judge and treat all issues arising in the revolution and construction from the viewpoint of the anti-imperialist class struggle as required by the Songun idea and deal merciless blows at the U.S. imperialists hatching sinister plots to gnaw at the ideology and system of the DPRK and destabilize it. The servicepersons and people should have bitter hatred for the reviving Japanese militarists and strong ideological awareness and determination to revenge themselves on the Japanese militarists, the sworn enemy of the Korean people, at any cost and give vent to their pent-up grudge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should live and struggle in a revolutionary and militant manner with the firm stand and viewpoint that they should wage a do-or-die battle with the U.S. and Japanese imperialists any time and they emerge victorious in it without fail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to learn from the staunch anti-imperialist class consciousness and revolutionary and militant spirit displayed by the People's Army standing firm guard over the anti-imperialist military front, the main front of the Songun revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The editorial calls for always maintaining high revolutionary vigilance against the imperialists' ideological and cultural poisoning and psychological offensive, thoroughly reject and oppose them, firmly defend the ideology and system of the DPRK, the Korean style political mode, economic management system and way of living and give full play to their vitality.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
