After the liberation of Korea he grew up to be an able official under the benevolent care of the Party and the leader and held important posts of the Party and the state for years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He worked for years as vice department director, department director and secretary of the Central Committee of the WPK from Juche 57 (1968) and vice-premier, first vice-premier and premier of the Administration Council from Juche 64 (1975) and chief secretary of the Jagang Provincial Committee of the WPK from Juche 81 (1992). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He worked as a deputy to the DPRK Supreme People's Assembly from Juche 56 (1967) and was elected member of the DPRK National Defence Commission at the first session of the 10th SPA in September of Juche 87 (1998).

Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary. It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is allowing some countries to go without any trouble even after failing to fulfill their commitments under the NPT, while pressurizing other countries to remain true to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has connived at and even cooperated with Israel in its development and production of nukes and kept mum about Japan which has stepped up its moves to emerge a nuclear power after stockpiling plutonium more than what it actually needs, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently the U.S. has become evermore undisguised in its policy of double standards. To cite a few examples, it promised those countries outside the NPT to transfer nuclear technology to them and expressed its \"willingness\" to permit some countries' nuclear activities for peaceful purposes on condition. In the final analysis, the U.S. stand on the nuclear issue depends on whether a country is its ally or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its approach towards the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula is a typical example of its double standards. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK demands that the U.S. take measures and treat the former as it does those countries which possess nukes outside the NPT. The U.S. words that it respects the DPRK's sovereignty as a member of the United Nations can be proved in practice only when it behaves so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. persistently clings to its double standards over the nuclear issue, lending no ear to the DPRK's demand, this behavior will only result in paralyzing the worldwide nuclear non-proliferation regime and disturbing the world stability.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

S. and south Korean warmongers to invade the DPRK it will bolster its deterrent for a just war both in quality and quantity, holding high the banner of Songun, a treasured sword for defending the nation.
