            "content": "Rodong Sinmun revela peligrosidad de alianza militar tripartita\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPyongyang, 1 de diciembre (ACNC) -- El diario Rodong Sinmun difundio en su edicion de este jueves un articulo individual revelando la peligrosidad de la alianza militar tripartita entre EE.UU., Japon y el Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde finales de octubre hasta principios de noviembre, se libraron en la zona maritima en torno a la Peninsula Coreana los ejercicios conjuntos militares entre EE.UU. y Japon y entre EE.UU. y el Sur de Corea, comienza el articulo y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto muestra que la alianza militar tripartita existe realmente y esta en funcionamiento activo aunque no se ha proclamado en el Nordeste Asiatico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn estos momentos Japon y el Sur de Corea agravan mas la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana. Se hacen frecuentes las visitas entre los interesados de las \"Fuerzas de Autodefensa\" de Japon y los del ejercito titere surcoreano y se planean los ejercicios militares conjuntos entre ellos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstos ejercicios belicos significan el ultimo manejo para la formacion de la alianza militar tripartita y muestran que se intensifican las maniobras encaminadas a ponerla en practica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. intenta fortalecer la confabulacion militar con el Sur de Corea y Japon con el fin de utilizarlos como carnes de canon y brigadas de choque en el \"tiempo de emergencia\" de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa se ha unificado el sistema de operaciones y mando militares de las fuerzas armadas de EE.UU., Japon y el Sur de Corea y se ha establecido el plan de operaciones conjuntas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe esta manera, el imperio pretende tomar sin dificultad la hegemonia en la region de Asia-Pacifico donde se disminuye su influencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa alianza militar tripartita encabezada por EE.UU. toma a la RPDC como su blanco principal. He aqui la peligrosidad y gravedad de esta alianza militar. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido a la confabulacion militar de EE.UU., Japon y el Sur de Corea, la Peninsula Coreana se encuentra en la crisis que pueda convertirse en la guerra en cualquier momento."
