The DPRK will in the future, too, make every possible effort to root out terrorism and realize peace and security for all. A DPRK delegate said this in a speech made on Oct. 20 during the discussion of the agenda item 148 (step for combating international terrorism) at the meeting of the Sixth Committee of the 59th UN General Assembly.\r\n The struggle against terrorism should not serve the political purpose of any party but should be aimed to defend the sovereignty and the right to development of the countries and the nations, guarantee a free and stable life of the people and promote world's peace and stability, he said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unilateral and chauvinist policy of anti- terrorism, the unjustified anti-terrorist war, is only causing a vicious cycle of terrorism. Terrorism rampant in different parts of the world is attributable to the unethical foreign policy of repressing other nations through arrogant and arbitrary practices, encroachment upon the sovereignty of other states and social inequality, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n True international relations based on equal sovereignty cannot be established anytime and escalated terrorist acts cannot be prevented unless unilateral and high-handed acts, new obstacles to the international relations, are stopped. In the final analysis it is impossible to prevent the recurrence of the tragic bloodshed that happened in Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He called upon all the UN member nations not to allow the pressure and sanctions unilaterally imposed upon the sovereign states and the use of force against them under the signboard of \"anti-terrorism\" but respect the equal sovereignty, each other's ideology, system, culture and custom and promote the international cooperation to achieve the common development and prosperity.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Taking this as a golden opportunity of realizing its ambition for overseas aggression, Japan is busying itself to make preparations for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its move to ease the three principles of arms exports is aimed to shift its work to establish an interceptor missile system to the stage of its deployment from that of joint research in a bid to develop the cooperative relations between the two countries in this field. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Nowadays the Japanese reactionaries are openly revealing their intention to delete what they called \"clauses on Far-East\" referring to the aim of the presence of U.S. troops in Japan from the \"Japan-U.S. Security Pact\" and \"Japan-U.S. Joint Security Declaration.\" If this happens, the SDF will be able to conduct any joint military operation with the U.S. forces in any place of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No country in the world wishes to see the revival of militarism in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan truly wants to do something helpful to humankind, it should liquidate its crime-woven past, to begin with. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to face up to the trend of the times towards peace and development and give up its ambition for military reinvasion without delay.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S. is going to force the DPRK, the only country in the hostile relationship of confrontation with it, to fall victim to its strategy in a bid to contain and overpower its surrounding countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Had the DPRK not increased its military deterrent force, it would have been swallowed up by the U.S. long ago and forced into slavery and Northeast Asia including the Korean Peninsula would have turned into the second Iraq and the second Mideast. It is thanks to the Songun politics and strong deterrent force of the DPRK that such abnormal incident has not occurred in Northeast Asia and the present status quo is maintained. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush group had better clearly understand the DPRK's Songun politics and the might of its deterrent force and drop its despicable wild ambition to realize its strategy of domination over East Asia at the sacrifice of the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
