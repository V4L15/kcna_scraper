This is an unpardonable anti-national deed of opposing national unity and reunification and inciting confrontation between \"two states\" even in international sports games. Such assertion is very dangerous as it is intended to use sports for political propaganda.\r\n The secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland said this in its information bulletin no. 824 on Sunday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north and south of Korea have already agreed that their teams will enter together the places of the opening and closing ceremonies of the Pusan Asiad with the unified flag. The agreement is now enjoying full support of all the fellow countrymen and the world public as the affirmative agreement inspires the Koreans with the desire for national unity and reunification, the bulletin noted, and further said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the GNP alone is dead set against the agreement, claiming that \"there is apprehension that sports might be used for political propaganda\" and \"the north side's demand has been accepted unilaterally.\" this reveals its dark intention to spoil the mounting atmosphere for dialogue and cooperation between the north and south of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for the agreed joint entry of the two sides in the Pusan Asiad, it is not only in accord with the basic spirit of the June 15 inter-Korean joint declaration but also is quite natural as there is a precedent already set in previous international games. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the GNP is seeking to kill the north-south agreement and put the games in turmoil with an anti-national, anti-reunification logic. It is, indeed, a group of villains who do not hesitate to do anything to gratify their greed for power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that if such a group comes to power, the inter-Korean relations would be driven into a danger. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP should promptly stop inciting division and confrontation among the fellow countrymen.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

But the DPRK is demonstrating its might as a dignified powerful country which fully exercises its sovereignty in the international arena, meeting the challenge of the imperialists, who style themselves the only superpower in the world, with the might of the army-based policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il has turned the DPRK into a dignified independent powerful state that no formidable enemy can dare provoke, foiling all the moves of the imperialists with the army-based policy, the most effective political mode in the world history of politics. These are the immortal feats performed by him on behalf of the country and its people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is widely known as an example of socialism and as a fortress of socialism as it is the country where the desire of humankind has come true. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary spirit cherished by Kim Jong Il represents the spirit of the red flag and his lifelong mission is to accomplish the cause of socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the period of trial when socialism collapsed in various countries, he published famous works including \"Socialism is a Science\", clearly proving the validity of the cause of socialism and injecting fresh energy into the world socialist movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the DPRK is led by Kim Jong Il, the brilliant commander of Mt. Paektu and the outstanding leader of the cause of socialism in the present era, it is shining as Kim Jong Il's Korea which enjoys the highest international prestige in the world.\r\n\r\n"
