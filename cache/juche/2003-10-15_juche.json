            "content": "KCNA Assails Japan's Decision to Dispatch Troops to Iraq \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 14 (KCNA) -- The Japanese government recently decided to dispatch its ground \"Self-Defense Force\" to southern Iraq within December on the basis of the so-called \"law on the special measure to help rehabilitate Iraq\".\r\n An advance detachment made up of some 150 soldiers is supposed to leave by a transport ship of the marine \"SDF\" to be followed by the departure of the main unit comprising 500-600 soldiers early next year. And it was reported that the air \"SDF\" would send 3 \"C-130\" transport planes to Iraq and its neighbouring country at the end of the year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is stipulated in Article 9 of Japan's \"peace constitution\" that \"it shall not keep ground, marine and air forces and other combat power and the right of the state to belligerence shall not be recognized.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It makes no sense to assert that the Japan \"SDF\" to be dispatched to Iraq will not be involved in battles as they are a daily and hourly occurrence, claiming casualties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan was bound to the \"peace constitution\" after being legally branded as a war criminal state in the wake of the defeat of militarism in the middle of the last century. But it has plunged itself into a war, \"illegally discarding the constitution.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has gradually ditched the \"peace constitution\" since the end of the Cold War through the institution of the \"law on cooperation in UN peace-keeping operation\" in 1992, the \"law on the revision of the guidelines for the U.S.-Japan defence cooperation\" in 1997, the \"law on emergency in the surrounding areas\" in 1999, the \"special law on measures against terrorism\" in 2001, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan rendered its \"peace constitution\" defunct by passing the \"bill to cope with the event of armed attack\", the \"bill on the revision of the law on the SDF\" and the \"bill on the revision of the law on setting up a security council\" through the meeting of the Japanese House of Representatives on May 15. Now Japan has gone to the lengths of sending its army equipped with sophisticated weapons to battlefields of an unjust war in the Mideast under the blood-stained Sun flag. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the U.S. that instigated and helped Japan rush headlong into reinvasion though it has not yet shaken itself off the ill-fame of a war criminal state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to use Japan, a defeated state in the East as a servant and shock force in realizing its ambition for world domination, the U.S. has actively encouraged Japan's rearmament and helped it act as an \"ordinary state.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As regards the dispatch of the SDF to Iraq, a senior official of the U.S. government welcomed it, when interviewed by Tokyo Shimbun on Oct. 12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should redress its unprecedentedly hideous crimes committed against the Korean and other Asian peoples and the rest of the world through honest reflection and compensation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBut it is as clear as a noonday that Japan will repeat its past aggression and plunder as it has opted for emerging a military giant through a sleight of hand and brazen-faced moves. The army and people of the DPRK are closely following every move of the Japanese reactionaries with the hatred and grudge pent up for nearly a century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese people should be well aware that a miserable destruction will be entailed by the moves to turn the society into the ultra-right and the reckless militarisation of the country spearheaded by the reactionary ruling quarters and come out in a campaign to check them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S. described the rehearsal as intended to \"defend the Pacific\" and \"prevent the spread of mass destruction weapons\" in a bid to cover up its danger. Rodong Sinmun today notes this in a signed article, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This assertion is nothing but a jugglery of words to mislead pubic opinions at home and abroad and such a trick cannot conceal the aggressive and provocative nature of the war game. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S.-led multinational naval exercise was an anti-DPRK military drill chiefly aimed to intercept, search and capture its ships and planes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The military rehearsal proves that the U.S. imperialists' blockade operation to form an international encirclement ring around the DPRK and tighten pressure on it has entered a full-dressed practical stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their blockade operation against the DPRK is designed to lay a higher economic hurdle before the DPRK, take the initiative in the solution of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S.  and, moreover, prevail over the DPRK by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has so far increased offensive international pressure upon the DPRK on the plea of the DPRK-U.S. nuclear standoff. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHowever, it had not dared to form a united front with its allies and satellite forces and even stage a collective military blockade operation against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. imperialists wantonly violate and ditch international law and the Korean Armistice Agreement, the waters off and air above the Korean peninsula and the rest of the world will be plunged into in a grave crisis and a state of war. Herein lies the serious point of the recent multinational sea inspection exercise. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should ponder over the grave consequences to be entailed by the inspection racket against the DPRK and discontinue such act.    \r\n\r\n"

It was a right action. Minju Joson today says this in a signed commentary.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula does not allow Japan to interfere in it in the light of the circumstances of its occurrence and nature. The DPRK, however, did not care about the format of talks to seek the earliest possible solution to the nuclear issue as the U.S. asserted the multi-lateral talks and Japan was strongly desirous of its participation in the negotiations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But Japan opted for using the nuclear negotiations for achieving its sinister political purpose, regarding the outbreak of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. as a golden opportunity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has persistently pursued the hostile policy toward the DPRK even after the end of the six-way talks, instead of drawing a lesson from the fruitless talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the real purpose of the Japanese reactionaries to realize their wild ambition to stifle the DPRK at any cost, taking advantage of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. and the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries also seek to step up the moves to turn Japan's domestic policy to the Right and militarize it under the pretext of the nuclear issue and mislead the public in a bid to create an atmosphere favorable for the safe upkeep of their power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In a word, Japan is working hard to compound the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. and thus fish in the troubled waters to meet its selfish purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That was why the DPRK branded Japan as a disturber of the settlement of the nuclear issue and decided not to allow it to interfere in the nuclear negotiations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is none other than Japan which drove the situation to such phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A poisonous herb should be rooted out in the bud. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has blindly toed the U.S. line, failing to face up to the trend of the times. It is well advised to seriously look back on its base diplomatic posture before deploring over its miserable position.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
