He highly appreciated the feat they have performed by creating a treasure of lasting value through the display of patriotic devotion and popular heroism. He extended warm thanks to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He stressed that the structures in the era of Songun now under construction in various parts of the country are the brilliant fruition of the inexhaustible mental power of the servicepersons and people single-mindedly united around the Party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is very good that the builders have contrived and introduced many new technological proposals and construction methods into the project by fully displaying wisdom and enthusiasm, thus increasing the speed of the project while economizing large quantities of materials including iron and steel materials, he noted, praising them for their creative and innovative work-style. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is very difficult for the province to build such a modern power station by its own efforts but the party and working people's organizations in the province have successfully carried out the project by enlisting the efforts of party members and other working people, he said, adding that their experience clearly proves the truth of the WPK's work style that there is nothing impossible when masses' energies and wisdom are properly enlisted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He underscored the necessity to ensure the best quality of the construction to win even the admiration of posterity as the power station is the nation's precious treasure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the construction of hydropower stations is not only economically beneficial but the shortest cut to satisfactorily meeting the ever-increasing demand for electricity, he called for continuing to implement to the letter the WPK's policy for building minor power stations in a bid way along with large ones.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The Maritime Bureau of Shandong Province and the maritime rescue centers of Yantai City and Weihai City and a unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in the relevant area took emergency measures and sent dozens of rescue ships to the scene of the disaster. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Despite strong wind and wave, the local government there and the above-said army unit mobilized thousands of people and servicemen for a large-scale rescue operation. A large quantity of goods was provided to the distressed crewmen to protect them from cold and a medical team was sent to sincerely treat the rescued crewmen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a result, 20 sailors of the 23 crewmen of the wrecked ship were rescued and returned home. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An operation is going on to search for and rescue the sailors reported missing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The sincere rescue operation conducted by the Chinese side for the distressed sailors of the ship was a clear manifestation of the traditional DPRK-China friendship which is favorably developing with each passing day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We feel very thankful to the government and local people of China on sincerely rescuing and treating our distressed sailors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will join the Chinese side in displaying the fine traits of helping each other in hard times in the future, too, and make positive efforts to boost the DPRK-China friendship.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Paektu teems with chars which move in shoals, adding beauty of the place. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dr. Kim Ri Thae of the Zoological Institute of the State Academy of Sciences told KCNA: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There was no fish in Lake Chon when it took shape. Only microbes and aquatic organisms lived there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Korean ichthyologists carried out a preliminary survey of the area of Mt. Paektu in Juche 47 (1958) and made a test in transferring silver carp of Lake Samji and char of River Tuman to the lake, the first test of its kind in the natural history of Mt. Paektu, on July 30, 1960. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the later days, they released five species of fish in the lake including several hundreds of chars, Pseudor asbora parva and Moroco oxycephalus on several occasions.\r\n This brought into being a new aquatic ecological system in the lake with char in the apex of the food chain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A mother char (15cm) and a fry (2.5cm) were discovered in the water of Lake Chon by the expedition team of the lake in July 1987, which proved for the first time that chars had been habituated to the conditions of the lake and gone into self-reproduction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Informed of this, leader Kim Jong Il personally named the fish \"char of Lake Chon\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In August 1994 scholars again went up to the lake and made morphological, ecological and taxonomical researches on char of Lake Chon and gave wide publicity to it by attaching it the scientific name \"Salvelinus malmam. chonjiensis KIM\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a special char differentiated into a new lake char from river char which adapted itself to the ecological circumstances peculiar to grim climatic and hydrologic conditions in scores of years after it was transferred to Lake Chon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ordinary size of char of Lake Chon is 40-50 cm (the maximum length is 85 cm and weight is 7.7 kilograms). Thus it is incomparably larger than the river char (15-20 cm in length and 100-150 grams in weight). Its jowl and mouth is protruding and long. The number of the teeth fanning out in gill, a digestive organ, is two or three less and the number of the pyloric caecum is three or four more than the river char. It is considered to be a variation phenomenon connected with the feed condition of the water of Lake Chon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Not all the chars of Lake Chon living in the depth of the lake have been surveyed. It presumed that even bigger chars may inhabit the lake. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Char of Lake Chon is the noted fish inherent to Mt. Paektu. It is preserved as an object of special protection of an international biospheric sanctuary.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It should honestly admit and reflect on and redress them as early as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Sunday urges this in a signed article dedicated to the 102nd anniversary of the fabrication of the \"Ulsa (1905) Five-point Treaty\" for aggression by the Japanese imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"treaty\", which the Japanese imperialists used as a \"legal ground\" for turning Korea into their colony, was an illegal and invalid one as it was cooked up and unilaterally made public by them in wanton violation of the requirements and principles of international law, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"treaty\" was a product of their policy of aggression towards Korea as it was forced upon Korea by the Japanese imperialists in total contravention of international law and norms of international relations after their aggressor forces put the royal palace under a manifold siege at the point of bayonet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was an illegal one in every sense as it lacked any elementary form as a treaty and failed to go through legal procedures. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At that time King Kojong resolutely turned down the Japanese imperialists' demand, declaring that he would never consent the conclusion of the treaty even if he might quit his throne and die for the country at the ancestors' shrine because it would mean the ruin of the country\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"treaty\" had only the seal of Pak Je Sun who was not appointed as a representative with full mandate and that of Konsuke Hayashi, the then Japanese minister in Seoul. It was neither signed by King Kojong nor stamped by the royal seal of the Ri Dynasty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was, therefore, an illegal false document as it lacked the state's approval of its conclusion and it was neither officially signed by a representative with full mandate nor examined nor ratified nor signed by the chief executive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists enforced unprecedentedly harsh colonial fascist rule over Korea for more than four decades after illegally occupying it by force of arms on the strength of the \"treaty.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the period of their military occupation and rule over Korea, they took away at least 8.4 million Koreans to shambles of war of aggression and sites of slavery labor, forcing them to meet tragic deaths. Moreover, they forced 200,000 Korean women into sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army. Over one million Koreans were killed by the Japanese imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They plundered Korea of its natural resources and properties lock, stock and barrel. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The crimes committed by them in Korea were organized state-sponsored ones because they were perpetrated at the instruction of the Japanese government and with its approval.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The single-minded unity of the people in the DPRK around the headquarters of revolution is the one in which all of them are united as one being attracted by his comradeship and the most durable and mighty one produced by his ardent comradeship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean revolution is making steady progress to a new higher stage under the Songun leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea. The unity based on the comradeship is a real picture of Songun Korea and a source of its inexhaustible strength. It also provides a sure guarantee for all its victories. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This unity serves as the most powerful fortress of devotedly defending the headquarters of revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the army and people in the DPRK have become ardent comrades of Songun revolution to resolutely defend the headquarters of revolution. \"Let us share intention with Kim Jong Il to the last.\" This is the unanimous desire and will of the army and people of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unity based on the revolutionary comradeship also serves as a basic source of invincible might of the Korean People's Army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The whole army is united based on the comradeship and has achieved successful unity with the people based on it. As a result, the KPA is always in high revolutionary and militant spirit and displays invincible might as strong revolutionary army which takes full charge not only of the country's defence but of socialist construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unity has become a motive force giving an impetus to performing fresh miracles and feats in building a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The single-minded unity based on comradeship serves as a lifeline and eternal foundation of Songun revolution as it gives a steady continuity to the nation's history of victory and prosperity, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, November 17 (KCNA) -- Political circles in south Korea are now becoming increasingly critical of Ri Hoe Chang's run for \"presidential elections,\" according to press reports. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A spokesman for \"Chongwadae\" said Ri's failure in the last two \"presidential elections\" was not only a defeat but a moral punishment he faced, adding that his declaration of candidacy for the election despite his earlier frustrations is tantamount to an insult to and mockery of the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Grand National Party held an \"emergency meeting of its leadership,\" a press conference, etc. at which it strongly accused Ri of \"backpedaling his promise to retire from the political circle without the least justification and procedure\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The New Democratic Party for Great Unity noted that Ri's extreme greed for power is nothing but an insult to the people and the desperate frenzy of the diehard reactionaries, ultra-right Cold War-minded forces to stem the trend of the history and bring back the era in which they could embezzle truck loads of money. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Democratic Party said Ri Hoe Chang had better clarify how he spent the balance of the illegally embezzled truck loads of money for \"presidential elections\" in the past before running for \"presidential elections.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe Creative Party noted that Ri Hoe Chang again declared his candidacy for the elections though he was eliminated from the political scene due to irregularities and corruption including the embezzled truck loads of money and Sephung scandal, adding that this is little short of an action to bring the politics of this land back to that a decade before. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Democratic Labor Party said it is quite inappropriate for Ri to run for \"presidential elections\" as an independent politician, stressing that he should be tried by the people again for accumulating illicit money for \"presidential elections.\"     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
