MacArthur in a secret meeting with Syngman Rhee in February 1950 ordered him to invade north Korea before July. Dulles, who flew to south Korea as a special envoy of Truman on June 17, 1950, issued a secret order to spread misinformation that north Korea invaded the south Korean army first and, at the same time, invade the north all of a sudden.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. took full measures for camouflage and deception on the eve of the war. It choreographed the movements of high-ranking officials on the pretexts of weekend, trip, dinner, etc., trying to conceal its true colors as a provoker of the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Korean war was started by the U.S. This is proven by the confession made by a staff officer of the 17th Regiment of the south Korean puppet army in those days.

On the night of June 24 they received a secret order to start a military action against north Korea by crossing the 38th parallel at the dawn of June 25.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. instigated the south Korean army to start a surprise invasion of north Korea at the dawn of June 25, 1950.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is how the Korean war (1950-1953) which was called the grimmest war since the Second World War was started."
