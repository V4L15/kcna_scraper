He recalled the proud history of the unit, looking round a  monument to the on-site guidance of President Kim Il Sung and the spring well that the President personally discovered in February, Juche 60 (1971).          \r\n   Kim Jong Il heard a report from the unit's commander on the situation and learned about how the unit was performing its mission and training itself.                             \r\n   He noted with deep satisfaction that the unit's soldiers have made tremendous achievements in the efforts to fulfil the President's on-site instructions. He gave the unit important tasks to increase its fighting efficiency.         \r\n   He praised the soldiers for trying hard to make their post and motherland beautiful with intense patriotism. This revolutionary spirit of soldiers and noble patriotism can be displayed only by the KPA, that is the army of the leader, the party and the revolution, he added.                      \r\n   He then looked round the unit's education room, bedroom and other facilities for cultural education and logistics and showed appreciation for the spirit of loving the soldiers that was highly displayed in the unit.              \r\n   He learned about supply service of the unit and taught the unit how to improve supply service by making use of the geographical features.                                       \r\n   He earnestly called on the officers to pay primary attention to supply service and provide best living conditions to the valuable soldiers.                         \r\n   Expressing belief that the unit's soldiers will perform feats in the noble work to defend the motherland, he gave them a pair of binoculars and an automatic rifle as gifts and had a picture taken with them.                                \r\n    \r\n  \r\n"

The continent has one third of the global land  and over a half of the global population.\r\n   It has also abundant natural resources and favourable conditions for economic and cultural development.\r\n   The Asian people must contribute to the cause of the world independence by making Asia independent.\r\n   To realize the independence of Asia, they should not tolerate  arbitrariness and interference of the imperialists but firmly maintain an independent stand in solving the continent's problems.\r\n   Especially, they must not follow the policy of aggression and interference pursued by the imperialists to dominate, control and plunder Asia.\r\n   It is very important for them to abolish the aggressive military bases, legacies from the cold war, and get foreign troops out of the Asian region and make a durable and  lasting peace in the region.\r\n   Differences of Asian countries in idea, system and religious belief are not obstacles to achieving  their unity and cooperation. If the Asian people firmly unite and closely cooperate with each other under the banner of independence, peace and friendship, they can surely build a new independent, peaceful and prosperous Asia free from domination, subjugation, aggression and war.         \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n"

In other words, it is precisely a wanton violation of the sovereignty of the DPRK.\r\n   It is very clear that the vicious anti-DPRK, anti-Chongryon hostility, which took place in Japan when the DPRK is making sincere efforts for the improved relations between the DPRK and Japan, was instigated and manipulated by the South Korean puppets.\r\n   The Japanese authorities must take a strong measure to prevent the recurrence of anti-DPRK, anti-Chongryon moves in Japan.         \r\n\r\n"
