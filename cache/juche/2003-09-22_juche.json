The U.S. imperialists should clearly know this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are approaching the U.S. imperialists' bribing operation with high vigilance. The more desperate U.S. moves will only harden the Koreans' revolutionary determination to foil the enemy's anti-DPRK bribing operation. \r\n\r\n"

Prime Minister Sharon gave instructions to the military to prepare an expatriation operation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a violation of Palestine's sovereignty and state-sponsored terrorism ignoring international law and usage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Arafat was elected president of Palestine by the Palestinian people in 1996 and has enjoyed their full support. Intolerable is Israel's decision to expel him from the Palestinian territory of even kill him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The decision has been strongly condemned by state leaders, governments and organizations of many countries in their statements and press releases. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the adoption of the decision, however, Israel has sent tanks and armored vehicles to Ramallah City, the West Bank, backed by fighter jets, to hold all the buildings around Arafat's office in its hands and fire at demonstrators supporting him. On Sept. 14 Israel's deputy prime minister said killing Arafat was a definite choice of the Israeli government. \r\n Israel's moves to expunge Arafat from the political arena are not a thing that happened only yesterday or today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Israeli government has severed relations with Arafat from December 2001, defining him as an \"obstacle to peace\" and threatening to eliminate him. Since March 2002 it has confined him to his office. And it ordered a special unit to make full preparations to abduct him two years ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such moves of Israel have been patronized by the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From the very outset, the Bush administration has pursued a pro-Israel policy for its Middle East strategy, keeping aloof from Arafat. It has also threatened that there would be no conference to solve the issue with Israel unless Palestinians select their new leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It, for the purpose of isolating Arafat, even excluded him from the summit conference for Mideast peace held on June 3. \r\n The U.S. intention to eliminate the Palestinian leader is clearly illustrated by the \"road map to the Middle East peace\" made public on April 30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"road map\" calls for assigning all the security agencies of Palestine to the new prime minister and disarming the \"terrorist\" groups. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind the scheme is an ulterior purpose of the Bush administration to leave the incumbent president of Palestine without any real meaning and turn the Palestine-Israel confrontation into that between the Palestinian authorities and \"terrorist\" groups. So it was the then Prime Minister Abbas, not Arafat, that represented Palestine in the Mideast peace process based on the \"road map\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. policy of splitting and alienating the Palestinians has caused a divergence of view in the Palestinian leadership and made Israel all the more arrogant so it has fully revealed its true colors again as an aggressive and unilateral terrorist nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Middle East situation has been further aggravated owing to Israel's wrong policy motivated by the U.S. Middle East strategy for isolating and weakening anti-U.S. nations with Israel as its shock brigade and with pro-U.S. Arab nations as its allies.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
