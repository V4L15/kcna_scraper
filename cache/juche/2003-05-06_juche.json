Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 5 (KCNA) -- A memorial service for Kim Se Jin and Ri Jae Ho, martyrs of national liberation, took place at the plaza of Seoul National University on April 28, according to a news report.\r\n Kim and Ri, postgraduate and student of Seoul National University, burnt themselves to death at the Sinrim crossroads of Seoul on April 28, 1986, chanting \"no war, no nuke, Yankees, go home\" in protest against the U.S. moves to make South Korea its nuclear base. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ra Chang Sun, chairman of the south headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification, in a memorial address said: Now that the U.S. imperialists' moves for war are being escalated, we should not forget the slogan for national reunification against the U.S. shouted by the martyrs but turn out in the struggle to achieve independence and peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A memorial poem was recited and a performance on the subject of \"Yankees, listen\" was given at the memorial service. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then the participants held a meeting on the situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the meeting speakers said that in this land workers have been reduced to wage slaves, peasants to debt slaves owing to the U.S. pressure on market opening and the failure in agricultural policy, the poor in towns to slaves of living and youth and students to war slaves. Which was caused by the U.S. escalating war moves and undisguised economic aggression, they said.    \r\n\r\n"

They went to the lengths of asserting that the matter of bringing the \"nuclear issue\" of North Korea up for discussion at the un security council again to make it adopt a statement critical of the DPRK is on an anvil. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These facts go to prove that the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK and its sinister intention to isolate and stifle the DPRK remain unchanged even after the DPRK-U.S. talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the talks arranged with much effort the DPRK set forth a new bold proposal to clear up the bilateral concerns of the DPRK and the U.S., the parties concerned with the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, prompted by the desire to prevent a war on the Korean Peninsula and achieve durable peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., however, repeated its old assertion that the DPRK should \"scrap its nuclear program before dialogue\" without advancing any new proposal at the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will mobilize all its potentials to bolster the war deterrent force in every way as long as the U.S. keeps pursuing its hostile policy toward the DPRK. If the U.S. does not positively respond to the DPRK's bold proposal, it will be held accountable for scuttling all efforts for dialogue and seriously straining the situation.    \r\n\r\n"

It also strengthened as a pan-national organization with its branches at home and abroad and thus made a great contribution to achieving the cause of national liberation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea of the great unity of the whole nation advanced in the 10-point programme of the fatherland restoration association is reflected in the three principles of national reunification, the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the country and the proposal for founding the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo. It has pushed ahead with the Korean people's cause of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The precious tradition of great national unity still inspires all the Koreans in the north, south and abroad who value the interests of the nation and want the country's reunification to unite as one and turn out in the efforts for the reunification of the country, irrespective of the difference in ideology, political view and ism.    \r\n\r\n"

This only shows how preposterous the DPRK policy of the bush administration is. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is universally known that the U.S. has employed a trite trick to militarily stifle those countries, which incur its displeasure, by listing them as \"state sponsors of terrorism\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the intention of the U.S. to \"Americanize\" the world by unhesitatingly committing such state terrorism as unethical, anti-Islamic Iraqi war under the pretext of \"anti-terrorism\" in disregard of international law and the united nations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the U.S. is seriously mistaken if it thinks its practice will go down with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite foolish of the U.S. to try to hurt the DPRK under the pretext of \"terrorism\" as it is the country where the leader, the party and the masses are single-heartedly united in thinking, purpose and the sense of moral obligation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. smear campaign against the DPRK will only make the settlement of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. more complicated and aggravate the situation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S. is going to apply such brigandish tactics to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is kicking up an anti-DPRK nuclear racket, saying that North Korea's nuclear proliferation is troublesome and its nuclear development program is hurting international stability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSome time ago, it brought the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula to the UN. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"threat\" ballad is a reversed slogan of aggression and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has long been persistent in the moves for war under the pretext of the non-existent \"threat of southward invasion\" by the DPRK. The U.S. is now seeking to ignite a new war of aggression in the Korean Peninsula under such slogans as \"anti-terrorism\" and \"nuclear and missile threat\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality calls for countering the U.S. talk about \"threat\" with high vigilance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Iraq war gives a lesson that a powerful physical deterrent force is necessary for us to cope with the anti-DPRK nuclear racket of the U.S. imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will build up the self-defensive capability still further under the banner of the Songun policy.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
