            "content": "Kim Kwan Jin Will Never Escape S. Koreans' Punishment: CPRK\r\n Pyongyang, August 16 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) Saturday made public information bulletin No. 1072 denouncing Chongwadae of south Korea for employing all sorts of sleight of hand to calm down the resentment of the people, far from punishing Kim Kwan Jin who is chiefly to blame for the killings of puppet army soldiers.\n\t\t\t\t\t Opposition parties and people from all walks of life in south Korea are strongly demanding the severe punishment of traitor Kim Kwan Jin, the then minister of Defense and incumbent chief of the security office of Chongwadae, as he was chiefly to blame for the hideous human rights abuses within the puppet army and the killing of private first class Yun, in particular.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As soon as he held the post of the minister in 2010, Kim undisguisedly fostered bestial torture and harsh actions and violence, crying out for establishing military discipline within the puppet army in order to turn it into combat forces capable of prevailing over the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Openly blustering \"violence is the basic means for controlling army\", gangster Kim reduced his military inferiors and soldiers to maniacs keen on confrontation with fellow countrymen and infused into them extreme misanthropy and brutality. He thus became the arch criminal who made such human rights abuses as the killing of Yun commonplace in the army. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The big disasters in the puppet army which shocked south Korea, ranging from the shooting spree in the puppet marine corps in 2011 to the case of the death of private first class Yun, occurred when Kim Kwan Jin was holding the post of defense minister.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural for various circles of south Korea to hold Kim responsible for the disasters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present regime of south Korea is the one abusing human rights and a man-killing one as it appointed such murderer as Kim as  chief of the security office of Chongwadae and is protecting him under her wings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If Chongwadae persistently patronizes Kim as now, it will have its image tarnished, further foster hideous human rights abuses in the puppet army and put greater spurs to the fascistization of south Korean society. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t People's mindset represents the will of Heaven and those going against the mindset are bound to be punished by Heaven."
