The South Korean authorities must act with discretion, mindful that no \"vote\" can be held in our area.\r\n   We will never tolerate their scheme for \"absentee \"vote\" in our area,  and if anyone involved in the LWR project acts against the DPRK-KEDO agreement,  we will take decisive measures against it.     \r\n\r\n"

General Assembly Session on Korea. \r\n   Now that structure of the Cold War has been destroyed and great changes have taken place in correlations among countries, the U.S. troops' military occupation of South Korea cannot be justified by anything, he said, and stressed: \r\n   For successful \"four way talks\" in Geneva, the U.S. should, before anything else, discard the anachronistic way of thinking and take practical steps for ensuring a lasting peace in the Korean Peninsula with its independent viewpoint and judgement.\r\n   He expressed the belief that divided Korea will be reunified under the banner of the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo under the wise guidance of General Kim Jong Il.     \r\n\r\n"
