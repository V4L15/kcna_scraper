Then, the bottom line is, where does the legal basis for these \"resolutions\" lie?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t UN member states should, as a matter of course, thoroughly assess the lawfulness of these resolutions before getting down to implementing the \"sanction resolutions\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"sanctions resolutions\" cooked up by the U.S. with the help of UNSC are an epitome of double standard and a product of the anti-DPRK hostile policy of the U.S. and its strategy for world dominance which aim at dominating the entire Korean peninsula and realizing world dominance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's reason for never recognizing the UNSC's \"sanctions resolutions\" and rejecting them as illegal documents is founded on this legal basis of international laws.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  As long as the U.S. persists in arbitrariness and high-handedness, interference in others' internal affairs and acts of aggression, scorning and antagonizing other countries' political systems with unilateral standards and notions, the goals set forth in the Post 2015 Development Agenda for the welfare of mankind can never be attained.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK government will continue to fulfill its duty towards ensuring the unity of G77 to establish a new international economic order based on justice, equality and fairness by strengthening solidarity with all countries that advocate independence under the banner of independence against imperialism."

            "content": "CC del Partido Chondoista Chong-U condena al viejo loco Trump\r\nPyongyang, 26 de septiembre (ACNC) -- En su declaracion publicada el dia 25, el Comite Central del Partido Chondoista Chong-U subrayo que la historica declaracion del Mariscal Kim Jong Un, publicada en relacion con el disparate del mandatario estadounidense pronunciado en la Asamblea General de la ONU, es la severa sentencia de la caida final de EE.UU., imperio del mal, y su caudillo Trump.\n\t\t\t\t\tIgualmente, constituye la declaracion de justicia mas noble y patriotica que parte de la voluntad de defender firmemente el destino de la patria y el pueblo y el futuro eterno de la nacion coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La historia registra a los dementes que se divertian con oprimir y agredir a otras naciones. Pero, ningun gangster fue tan antietico e imprudente como Trump quien expuso abiertamente en el oficial escenario internacional su intencion de exterminar un pais, un Estado y una nacion, condeno el documento y prosiguio:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Se hace cada dia mas fuerte el revanchismo de todos los militares y habitantes coreanos decididos a aniquilar a los enemigos vibrando de indignacion por el chisme de Trump que revelo sin tapujos su intento de hacer sufrir al pueblo coreano los desastres de guerra nuclear ofendiendo atrevidamente la dignidad de la Direccion Suprema de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  No se puede aguantar ante las bestias que tratan de destruir a la RPDC, paraiso que significa nuestra vida que no podemos cambiar por nada ni perder nunca.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Los chondoistas, quienes desde la fundacion de su religion, vinieron continuando la tradicion de amor a la patria y a la nacion bajo la bandera de \"rechazamiento a la invasion de los europeos y los japoneses\" y \"proteccion del pais y la tranquilidad del pueblo\", se levantaran junto con todos los militares y habitantes en la lucha general antiyanqui por hacer pagar sin falta y mil veces mas caro a Trump su chismografia que insulto de la peor manera a nuestra nacion negando a nuestro Estado sagrado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ese viejo loco no podra eludir el castigo divino."
