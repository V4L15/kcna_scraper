The adoption of the June 15 joint declaration the keynote of which is the idea of \"By our nation itself\" and the October 4 declaration, a programme for implementing it, is a brilliant fruition of the idea and line of the WPK for national reunification, Songun politics. After the publication of the June 15 joint declaration the national reunification movement made a steady advance along the road of independent reunification, peace and prosperity and brought about signal successes in the development of the north-south relations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSongun politics shines as a symbol of independence and dignity.

The nuclear threat to the Korean people is by no means an abstract concept. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee group's talk about \"nuclear threat from the north\" is a mockery of and insult to the Korean people and mankind who hope to see the Korean Peninsula and the rest of the world denuclearized. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is imperative to remove the nuclear threats from the U.S. and south Korea to substantially ensure nuclear security and peace in the peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe nuclear security summit should serve as a gathering for revealing the nuclear war strategy of the U.S. and south Korean authorities from historical point of view and for withdrawing nukes from south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWithout discussion of these matters, the summit will just turn to the theatre of an armchair argument and will increase nuclear threat in the peninsula."

Even the largest-ever landing operation exercise in history is scheduled to take place, targeting against main points of the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFew days ago, south Korean warmongers together with GIs ran amuck to launch a grave military provocation on Yonphyong and Paekryong islands again. Kim Kwan Jin, defense minister of south Korea, ordered its army units to fire at the north before getting permission when the north reacts. This shows how desperate they have become in their moves to ignite a war against the north. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis saber-rattling is particularly dangerous as they are kicking up an anti-DPRK smear campaign and intensifying their moves to escalate the confrontation on an unprecedented scale and making desperate efforts to seek a way out of a serious ruling crisis. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey run the whole gamut of intrigues to break the single-minded unity and destabilize the society of the DPRK, with groundless slanders as regards the great loss in the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey regard the present time when the people of the DPRK are still grieving over the greatest loss of the nation as a golden chance to realize their goal of aggression which they failed to do in over six decades. They are staging large scale war drills in a bid to rattle the nerves of the DPRK and lead it to counteraction and thus attack it on that pretext. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTheir frantic war exercises are the last-ditch efforts to scuttle the efforts of those countries concerned for detente, turn their position in the elections in their favor and thus get rid of the worst political crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe ongoing saber-rattling has brought the hypocritical nature of \"dialogue\" much touted by the U.S. imperialists and south Korean authorities into bolder relief. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey are going to test the will of the army and people of the DPRK through provocative saber-rattling but the DPRK has already clarified its resolute stand. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf they provoke a war against the DPRK, the consequences will be hardly imaginable. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf another war breaks out in Korea, war shambles will not be limited to the Korean Peninsula only as was the case with the last June 25 war and the aggressors will suffer an incomparably bitter defeat than what they sustained at that time and meet a miserable end. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe army and people of the DPRK will not miss the opportunity to wipe out the U.S. imperialist aggressors, the sworn enemy of the nation, and the Lee group of traitors who desecrated the great loss to the nation and rubbed salt into the wounds of the fellow countrymen. They will also achieve the cause of national liberation and reunification of the country at any cost, satisfying their pent-up grudge. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. and the south Korean puppet regime would be well advised to behave themselves, bearing deep in mind what severe punishment the invincible army and people of the DPRK will mete out to them when giving full play to their mental power."

publico el dia 29 una declaracion con motivo de las maniobras conjuntas de gran dimension \"Key Resolve\" y \"Foal Eagle\" iniciadas por Estados Unidos y las autoridades surcoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\tEl texto de la nota sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPese a las fuertes advertencias de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea y a la preocupacion y condena de la opinion publica interna y externa, los agresores norteamericanos y los belicistas titeres surcoreanos despliegan a partir del dia 27 los ejercicios militares conjuntos de gran dimension \"Key Resolve\" y \"Foal Eagle\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn estos dias, enormes fuerzas armadas de EE.UU. y el Sur de Corea realizan en suelo surcoreano esos ejercicios de guerra movilizando generalmente los equipos belicos sofisticados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEso demuestra claramente que los imperialistas norteamericanos y la camarilla de titeres surcoreanos son maniacos de guerra capaces de cometer cualquier cosa, sea cual fuera la situacion o la opinion publica interna y externa, para alcanzar sus objetivos agresivos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodo el mundo conocio el caracter agresivo y peligroso de la presente edicion de \"Key Resolve\" y \"Foal Eagle\", aunque aquellos los describen como \"entrenamientos anuales de defensa para hacer frente a la provocacion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. y los belicistas surcoreanos hablan publicamente que la presente edicion tiene por su meta prepararse a la guerra local y la total y a la supuesta \"situacion de emergencia\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPracticamente, los planes de operaciones correspondientes se implementan en el clima de combate de verdad y esta previsto hasta un ejercicio de la operacion de desembarco de maxima dimension en la historia en los simulados puntos importantes de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHace unos dias, los belicistas surcoreanos trataron de cometer otra grave provocacion militar en las islas Yonphyong y Paekryong con la ayuda de las tropas agresoras norteamericanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ministro de Defensa surcoreano Kim Kwan Jin instruyo a las unidades del ejercito surcoreano abrir el fuego sin esperar la orden en el caso de que el Norte de Corea reaccione.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstos hechos corroboran que ellos estan desesperados para desatar la guerra de agresion al Norte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas presentes maniobras resultan sumamente peligrosas porque coinciden con que los imperialistas norteamericanos y los titeres surcoreanos recrudecen mas que nunca su campana intrigante y conflictiva contra la RPDC y andan enloquecidos para buscar la salida de la extremada crisis de dominacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUltimamente, ellos recurren a todas las artimanas para abrir hueco en la unidad monolitica de la RPDC y desestabilizarla por adentro difundiendo unos chismes sobre el gran duelo nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTomando estos tiempos, en que el pueblo de la RPDC no se ha recuperado todavia de su maxima perdida (fallecimiento del Dirigente Kim Jong Il), como la oportunidad de oro para alcanzar las metas de agresion incumplidas durante mas de 6 decadas pasadas, ellos quieren atacar a la RPDC irritandola con las maniobras de guerra e induciendola a reaccionar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsos ejercicios significan el ultimo coletazo de la camarilla surcoreana para congelar los esfuerzos de los paises interesados por relajar la situacion al agravar la tension de la Peninsula Coreana y para salir de la peor crisis politica al invertir las desfavorables circunstancias electorales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIgualmente, evidencian el caracter hipocrita del \"dialogo\" pregonado por EE.UU. y sus lacayos surcoreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi bien ellos tratan de sopesar con \"Key Resolve\" y \"Foal Eagle\" la voluntad del ejercito y el pueblo de la RPDC, estos expusieron ya su posicion rotunda.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi EE.UU. y los belicistas surcoreanos incurren en la provocacion contra la RPDC, sufriran las consecuencias dificiles de imaginar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el caso de que se desate nuevamente la guerra en Corea, su escenario no se limitara a la Peninsula Coreana en contra de lo que ha pasado en la guerra coreana estallada el 25 de junio de 1950, y los agresores correran un destino tragico sufriendo una derrota incomparablemente grande que la de entonces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAprovechando esa oportunidad, el ejercito y el pueblo de la RPDC descargaran su acumulado rencor e ira al exterminar a los agresores norteamericanos, enemigos jurados de la nacion, y sus satelites, la camarilla del traidor Lee Myung Bak, salvajes que ofendieron el gran duelo nacional, y cumpliran asi sin falta la causa de liberacion nacional y la de reunificacion de la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. y sus satelites surcoreanos deben actuar con prudencia dandose cuenta de que seran sometidos a un castigo tan terrible cuando se manifiesten generalmente las fuerzas espirituales del invencible ejercito revolucionario del monte Paektu (Ejercito Popular de Corea) y todos los militares y civiles de la RPDC."

Pero, fue publicada la verdad por el primer secretario de aquel entonces de la embajada surcoreana en Japon el contenido concreto de las palabras de traidor Lee y la palabra del mismo secretario de \"haber sentido perfidia por el respecto\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa soberania del islote Tok es un tema agudo sobre el sagrado territorio de la nacion coreana heredado generacion tras generacion. Pues, no podemos dar ni un paso atras en ese tema. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, la banda traidora de Lee renuncio facilmente la soberania del islote Tok y prometio entregarlo a Japon en el tiempo oportuno. Tal acto traidor suscita la indignacion de toda la nacion coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDespues de tomar el poder, la banda traidora surcoreana vino instigando las maniobras de nueva agresion de los reaccionarios japoneses tolerando su intencion de usurpar el islote Tok con su diplomacia y sus actos vendepatrias y projaponeses. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPreconizo la \"diplomacia tranquila\" hablando de las \"relaciones con vistas al futuro sin cuestionar el pasado\" y la \"nueva era de cooperacion\" con Japon. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando los reaccionarios japoneses cometian los actos gangsteriles en cuanto al islote Tok, no lo cuestiono ni una vez diciendo que \"no debemos arrastrarnos por el conflicto\" y \"es necesario mantener la paciencia\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando el Instituto Maritimo del Sur de Corea trataba de instalar una universal base cientifica maritima sobre el islote Tok, le obligo omitir la expresion del islote Tok diciendo que esta palabra ofendera a Japon. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTal proceder projapones de la banda traidora surcoreana estimula la ambicion de Japon de usurpar el islote Tok. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapon actua mas arrogantemente para usurpar el islote Tok, parte de sagrado territorio coreano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn los ultimos anos en la \"carta blanca de defensa\", la \"carta azul diplomatica\" y otros documentos estatales, los libros que se distribuyen al extranjero y hasta las guias de manuales para nuevas generaciones anotan el islote Tok como \"territorio japones\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHace poco, el canciller japones Kenba, dijo abiertamente que \"dire si es necesario respecto al derecho a la soberania del islote Tok\", y el premier Noda le apoyo oficialmente diciendo que \"el expreso la posicion de Japon\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs invariable la ambicion agresiva de Japon de usurpar el islote Tok aunque pasa mucho tiempo y se sustituye el poder. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, la banda traidora surcoreana se enfrenta con armas a sus connacionales, pero obedece al enemigo jurado de la nacion entregando hasta el territorio patrio. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras que exista la horda de vendepatrias como el traidor Lee Myung Bak, toda la nacion coreana no puede evitar la desgracia."

Para esta nacion, la amenaza nuclear no es un concepto abstracto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda traidora de Lee habla de la \"amenaza nuclear del Norte\", lo que es una burla y insulto al pueblo coreano y el resto del mundo que desean la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana y el mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara asegurar realmente la seguridad nuclear y la paz en la Peninsula Coreana, debe ser eliminada radicalmente la amenaza nuclear de EE.UU. y los titeres del Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa Cumbre de Seguridad Nuclear debe ser una reunion para tomar las concretas medidas para  denunciar con datos historicos la estrategia de guerra nuclear de EE.UU. y la banda titere y eliminar las armas nucleares del territorio surcoreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin ella, la Cumbre sera una cita inutil y al contrario provocara el aumento de la amenaza nuclear en la Peninsula Coreana."
