The DPRK is the only country in the world which has been exposed to such long and most direct nuclear threat. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As early as in August 1950, just right after its start of the Korean War, the U.S. brought nuclear weapons to the Korean front and staged several exercises under the simulated conditions of dropping nuclear bombs over areas of the northern half of Korea during the war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After turning south Korea into the greatest nuclear powder magazine and nuclear outpost in the Far East, the U.S. posed an open nuclear threat to the DPRK, staging nuclear war exercises against it in south Korea and its vicinity every year by mobilizing lots of nuclear weapons. It was again the U.S. which listed the DPRK as one of the targets of preemptive nuclear attack in March 2002, seriously infringing upon its security, and openly singled out the DPRK as one of the targets of nuclear attack in its \"nuclear posture review\" in April this year. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What the association mentioned about the DPRK in its \"report\" is nothing but a despicable plot to weaken the DPRK's nuclear deterrence for self-defence and isolate it in the international arena as it was part of the U.S. nuclear policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is very ridiculous and foolhardy for the U.S. to dare label the DPRK \"a state threatening others with nukes\" as it has posed ceaseless nuclear threat to the latter. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In misleading the public opinion by floating the story about \"nuclear threat\" from the DPRK the U.S. seeks a sinister intention to cover up the hypocrisy of its loudmouthed \"nuclear disarmament\" and its ulterior motive lurking behind it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is now stepping up its moves to increase the number of strategic and offensive weapons and modernize nuclear weapons behind the facade of \"nuclear disarmament\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is getting feverish in its moves to develop conventional intercontinental ballistic missiles not carrying nuclear weapons and new type cruise missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads as a new type \"deterrent\" in a bid to make up for \"nuclear disarmament.\" It is, at the same time, getting busy securing strategic materiel necessary for coping with \"a contingency\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some days ago, the U.S. conducted a sub-critical nuclear test under the pretext of \"guaranteeing the security of nuclear arsenal.\" It plans to conduct three more similar tests till September next year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. which has stockpiled at least 20,000 nuclear warheads frequently stages such nuclear tests while spending a stupendous amount of funds for beefing up the strategic offensive weapons and modernizing the nuclear weapons. This is a serious nuclear threat to humankind. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the final analysis, the U.S. touted \"nuclear disarmament\" is nothing but a version of its call for bolstering its nuclear force and its theory of nuclear threat. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, the U.S. divided the world into those countries who are allowed to have nuclear weapons and those who are disallowed to have access to them and has insisted on putting international sanctions and pressure upon the latter. While shutting its eyes to the moves of its allies and followers to go nuclear, the U.S. is defending them and even encouraging them in these moves. It was thanks to the U.S. that Israel could develop and possess more than 200 nuclear warheads. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is the chieftain and arch criminal posing a nuclear threat to the world and proliferating nukes, seriously threatening and disturbing the world peace and security."

It is none other than the south Korean authorities who are much upset by the positive efforts made by the DPRK for north-south dialogue and the resumption of the above-said talks as they have been dead-set against those moves. It is precisely for this reason that they are playing a trite trick to get rid of their awkward position and wrest something from the DPRK while working hard to convince the public that the responsibility for the stalled six-party talks rests with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With no rhetoric can the south Korean authorities cover up their true colors as a disturber of the six-party talks."

The DPRK is now making every possible effort to bring about fundamental improvement in the north-south relations by giving momentum to the hard-won atmosphere of dialogue and cooperation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is clearly exemplified by the fact that the DPRK advanced reasonable proposals for normalizing the reunion of separated families and relatives and vitalizing humanitarian cooperation at the recent north-south Red Cross talks and proposed to hold the north-south working military talks to put under control the serious situation prevailing on the Korean Peninsula and pave the way for reconciliation and unity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now is the time for the north and the south to boost humanitarian cooperation and resume the tour of Mt. Kumgang and thus mend the deteriorated north-south relations at an early date by promoting dialogue with a sincere attitude and stand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities, however, maintain its attitude and stand toward the north-south dialogue quite contrary to those taken by the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are sticking to their insincere attitude and stand, chilling the unanimous desire of the nation for brisk dialogue and cooperation between the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is essential to stop all provocative acts against the dialogue partner in order to give momentum to the atmosphere of dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There still go on in south Korea anti-DPRK hostile acts which reached a reckless phase due to the conspiratorial case of warship sinking.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean warlike forces are staging ceaseless anti-DPRK war exercises under various codenames, while crying out for \"deterring provocations\" and \"taking up a posture to cope with them.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is imperative to remove as early as possible the stumbling block laid in the way of north-south dialogue by the south Korean authorities, the article concludes."

El director ejecutivo de esta entidad peroro tambien que el \"Norte de Corea sigue violando los reglamentos internacionales relativos a la proliferacion nuclear\".\n\t\t\t\t\t  A adelantar la conclusion, la RPDC no ha trasladado nunca las tecnicas nucleares y de misiles a otros paises ni chantajeado a estos con armas nucleares definiendolos como blancos de ataque nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Al contrario, durante varias decadas desde mediados del siglo pasado hasta la fecha, vivio bajo la constante amenaza nuclear proveniente de EE.UU. En este mundo no hay otro pais como la RPDC que ha sufrido la amenaza nuclear mas directa y larga.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ya en agosto de 1950, inmediatamente despues de provocada la guerra coreana, EE.UU. introdujo los artefactos nucleares en el frente coreano y realizo en varias ocasiones durante la guerra el ejercicio para lanzarlos en la extension de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Convirtio el Sur de Corea en el arsenal nuclear mas grande del Extremo Oriente y la base nuclear avanzada y ejercio la abierta amenaza nuclear a la RPDC desarrollando cada ano con muchas armas nucleares los ejercicios belicos en el Sur de Corea y su contorno.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Tambien, atento gravemente la seguridad de la RPDC al incluirla en marzo de 2002 en la lista de objetos de ataque nuclear preventivo y volvio a hacerlo al publicar en abril de este ano el \"informe de revision del estado nuclear\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Este \"informe\" elaborado y publicado por la Asociacion de Control de Armas deviene la continuacion de tal politica nuclear de EE.UU. sobre la RPDC y no pasa de ser una artimana sucia para debilitar el disuasivo nuclear de autodefensa de la segunda y aislarla en la escena internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  EE.UU. que da incesante amenaza nuclear a la RPDC trata de tildarla del \"pais amenazador nuclear\", lo cual resulta un acto muy absurdo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  EE.UU. engana la opinion publica hablando de la \"amenaza nuclear\" de la RPDC partiendo de su malsano intento de encubrir el caracter falso y verdadera meta de su cantinela de \"desarme nuclear\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Detras de la cortina de \"desarme nuclear\", EE.UU. acelera ahora el aumento de armas de ataque estrategico y la modernizacion de artefactos nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Como nuevo \"remedio disuasorio\" segun la teoria de \"desarme nuclear\", desarrolla con premura el misil balistico intercontinental convencional sin la ojiva nuclear y hasta el misil crucero de nuevo tipo capaz de cargarla.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Igualmente, asegura los materiales estrategicos de reserva necesarios al \"tiempo de emergencia\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Hace poco, realizo la prueba nuclear subcritica hablando de \"garantizar la estabilidad del arsenal nuclear\" y planea ejecutar 3 pruebas del mismo tipo hasta septiembre del ano proximo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  EE.UU., que posee mas de 20 mil ojivas nucleares, invierte fabulosos fondos en el aumento de armas de ataque estrategico y la modernizacion de armas nucleares e intenta desarrollar frecuentemente las pruebas nucleares, lo cual deviene grave amenaza nuclear a la humanidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En fin de cuentas, el \"desarme nuclear\" pregonado por EE.UU. significa en realidad la teoria de aumento de fuerzas armadas nucleares y de amenaza nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por otra parte, ese imperio divide a los paises en el grupo de los que pueden poseer las armas nucleares y en el que no puede hacerlo y aboga por aplicar la sancion y presion internacional contra el segundo grupo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por otra parte, ampara y hasta promueve el armamento nuclear de sus paises aliados y satelites.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Gracias a la pauta de doble rasero de EE.UU., Israel pudo desarrollar y almacenar mas de 200 armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  EE.UU., que amenaza y destruye gravemente la paz y la seguridad del mundo, es el culpable principal de la amenaza y proliferacion nucleares en el mundo."
