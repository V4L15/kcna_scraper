Por tanto, los derechos de los seres humanos se aseguran por unidad del pais y nacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos convenios internacionales y las actividades de organizaciones internacionales relacionados con los DD.HH. tambien se realizan por las politicas y regimenes de cada pais. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor esta razon, los reglamentos internacionales de DD.HH. definen las pautas y metas generales del aseguramiento de los derechos humanos a ser alcanzadas por cada pais bajo la condicion de respetar el Poder estatal. Esto significa que cada pais debe asegurar los derechos de las masas populares conforme a la realidad y al nivel de desarrollo de si mismo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, los imperialistas justifican la intervencion en los asuntos internos de otros paises bajo el pretexto de que \"No hay fronteras en los derechos humanos.\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa epoca actual no es la de ayer en que los imperialistas modificaban a sus caprichos las fronteras de otros paises usando canones y buques militares. Por eso, los imperialistas pretenden obtener sus objetos agresivos anteponiendo el \"problema de DDHH\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa divulgacion de la concepcion de valor y la \"pauta de DDHH\" al estilo norteamericano deviene el peligroso acto tendente a exterminar los derechos humanos en el mundo entero. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa campana de \"DD.HH.\" de EE.UU., imperio de misantropia y de violacion de DDHH que no tiene en cuenta las masas populares, ni los Estados soberanos, ni la ley internacional, no puede evitar el fracaso por su caracter reaccionario y su villania y adelantara el fin de la unica \"superpotencia\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras existan en este planeta las fuerzas antipopulares, los derechos humanos de las masas populares no pueden ser logrados por las palabras o la peticion. Todas las aspiraciones de las masas populares se realizan solo por la tenaz lucha e indoblegables esfuerzos."
