This is something ridiculous and reckless which can be done only by those dead to disgrace and shame. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK can neither pardon nor overlook Japan's any act of infringing upon its dignity and interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are desperately working to win the favor of Japanese and implant the poisonous militarist idea into their minds, advocating the \"theory of the excellence of the Yamato nation.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries consider it important in this regard to instill the idea of national chauvinism into the Japanese.\r\n There is already a clear sign of this in the Japanese society. This is evidenced by the fact that illustrated books bitterly defaming the DPRK and other neighboring countries are on sale in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Judging from all this one can draw a conclusion that the racket for inciting national chauvinism in Japan is part of its propaganda offensive and a prelude to aggression to set the stage for its militarist overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The same can be said of the on-going human rights racket kicked up by the Japanese reactionaries against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan seeks to push the relations between the DPRK and Japan to the worst phase in a bid to provoke a militarist war of aggression overseas. This is its scenario of war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK can never remain a passive onlooker to this as long as the Japanese reactionaries persistently pursue confrontation and war, quite contrary to the trend of the times towards reconciliation and cooperation.     \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This comes under fire by a signed commentary of Rodong Sinmun Tuesday. The news analyst says:\r\n This is evidenced by its behavior of shunning the proposed DPRK-U.S. direct talks to discuss the issue of lifting financial sanctions against the DPRK under this or that pretext. This only increases public skepticism about the possibility to resume the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order for the six-party talks to proceed smoothly in a sound atmosphere and make progress it is necessary for the participating countries to be discreet in their words and deeds in the direction of respecting each other and promoting the relations of confidence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. diplomatic chief, when interviewed by the U.S.A. Today shortly ago, openly blustered that there is no need to hold DPRK-U.S. bilateral talks over the lift of financial sanctions, hinting that the U.S. is pressurizing the DPRK in all aspects. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such behavior of the U.S. cannot be construed otherwise than a deliberate act to touch off anti-American sentiment among the servicepersons and people in the DPRK and deter the six-party talks from resuming. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is impossible to resume the six-party talks under such provocative sanctions applied by the U.S. upon the DPRK. This is the stand of the DPRK.\r\n The prospect of the six-party talks will depend on whether the U. S. works hard to build confidence with the DPRK on the principle of mutual respect and equality or persists in its self-justified and unilateral acts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. truly wants the resumption and progress of the six-party talks it should take practical measures to lift the financial sanctions against the DPRK at an early date as it committed itself to do so before the other five parties at the talks. Only then a prospect will be opened for the resumption of the six-party talks. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean Authorities Hit for Toeing U.S. Line \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 6 (KCNA) -- The south Korean authorities held a Cabinet meeting on Nov. 21 at which they decided to extend the term of the presence of its unit in Iraq for one year, that is, till December of the next year.\r\n Commenting on this, the press Tuesday brands this as a despicable and treacherous criminal act intended to offer young and middle-aged south Koreans as bullet shields for the U.S. imperialist aggression troops, yielding to the U.S. pressure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A news analyst of Rodong Sinmun recalls that not only the U.S. allies that dispatched their forces to Iraq but the United States driven into a tight corner for waging an unjustifiable war tend to reduce their aggression forces. It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present authorities of south Korea were known to be ready to do something great in the early days of their office, talking about \"horizontal relations\" with the U.S. But it was nothing but a ruse to serve the purpose of their propaganda. This is fully evidenced by the fact that they extended again the mission of their troops in Iraq to please the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a more serious attention is that such move of the south Korean authorities is no more than a product of the collusion between south Korea and the U.S. in a bid to ignite a war of aggression against the north on the Korean Peninsula. Through the above-said action the south Korean authorities seek to round off the preparations for a war against the north in collusion with the U.S. under the signboard of \"peaceful reconstruction\". This is an anti-national and anti-reunification crime as it goes against the unanimous will of the fellow countrymen for national reconciliation, unity and independent reunification and drives the inter-Korean relations to a phase of confrontation and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson in a signed commentary warns:  Such criminal act of the south Korean authorities as bedeviling the inter-Korean relations and increasing the danger of war while reading the face of the U.S. is little short of digging up their own grave. They should take a step to withdraw the \"Jaitun\" unit from Iraq.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"

The U.S. is meddling in the inter-Korean undertakings for reconciliation and cooperation and hamstringing them by hook or by crook. What is more serious is that it is driving the situation on the Korean Peninsula to the brink of a war through its moves to start a war of aggression against the DPRK. Equally persistent and vicious is anti-DPRK confrontational hysteria on the part of the GNP and other pro-U.S. conservative forces in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation should preserve the idea of \"By our nation itself\" to the last and thoroughly apply it in the movement for reunification. This idea, the basic spirit of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, is an idea of national independence as it calls for opposing and rejecting outsiders' domination and interference in the Koreans' movement for national reunification. It is also necessary to escalate the stand-off with the U.S. The U.S. which is directly responsible for Korea's division has nothing but a wild ambition to put Korea under its permanent domination by perpetuating its division.\r\n It is also imperative to stop the reactionary conservative forces in south Korea including the GNP from doing harm to national independence and beclouding the June 15 era of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article stresses the need for all the Koreans in the north and south and abroad to firmly maintain the principle of national independence, fully discharge their responsibility and role as masters responsible for national reunification and thus glorify the June 15 era of reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It has now totally stopped it. \r\n The U.S. has thus pulled out of the 1994 DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework (AF), causing huge economic losses to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The keynote of the AF is the U.S. commitment to provide LWRs to the DPRK in return for its nuclear freeze. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the AF the U.S. was obliged to provide two LWRs each with the generating capacity of 2,000 MW to the DPRK by the year 2003 and supply 500,000 tons of heavy fuel oil to it on an annual basis in return for its freeze of graphite moderated reactors, the first one with the generating capacity of 50,000 KW and the second one with that of 200,000 KW. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the conclusion of the AF the DPRK promptly took the measure to freeze its nuclear facilities, allowed the inspection of freeze and fully implemented its commitments such as the total lift of all sanctions it took against the U.S. within the date fixed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK, prompted by its willingness to settle the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. and build the relations of confidence with it through compliance with the AF, made a bold political decision to totally stop the project to generate 2,000 MW of nuclear energy and other major projects under construction due to be completed by 2003 under its plan to develop independent nuclear power industry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., however, has delayed the LWR construction from the outset under various pretexts and remained unchanged in pursuing the hostile policy toward the DPRK while maintaining economic sanctions against it. This was a systematic breach of the major provisions of the AF.\r\n It broke the ground for the construction of LWRs as late as in August, 1997, more than one year behind the date scheduled, and deliberately delayed the construction. A ceremony of concrete tamping was held as late as in August, 2002, shortly before the time the project was originally scheduled to be wound up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. increased its pressure upon the DPRK over its nuclear issue while spreading in a phased manner the fiction of \"enriched uranium program\" concocted by it. Finally on Nov. 14, 2002 it stopped the provision of heavy fuel oil and on Dec. 1, 2003 it suspended the construction of the LWRs.\r\n By bringing the LWR construction to a complete stop after delaying it under this or that pretext the U.S. totally scrapped the AF. \r\n All the facts go to clearly prove that the DPRK was entirely right when it called for observing the principle of simultaneous actions for the provision of the LWRs and the abandonment of the nuclear program, a physical basis for building confidence between the two sides. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any dealing with the U.S. should be based on the principle of simultaneous actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the construction of LWRs came to a total halt, the U.S. is obliged to own its responsibility for scrapping the AF and compensate for the political and economic losses caused to the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
