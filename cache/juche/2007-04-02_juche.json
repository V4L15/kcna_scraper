It was also the President who waged the steady struggle to foil the separatists' moves to make \"two Koreas\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the 1970s the first high-ranking political meeting was held between the north and the south and the historic July 4 joint statement was adopted. In the 1980s multi-faceted dialogues and negotiations were made between the north and the south, and an inter-Korean agreement and a joint declaration on denuclearization were adopted in the 1990s. All these achievements were unthinkable apart from the energetic leadership of Kim Il Sung who had wisely led the cause of the country's reunification under the uplifted banner of one-Korea policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The three principles for national reunification--independence, peaceful reunification and the great nation unity--agreed on and declared by the north and the south, the proposal for founding the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo, the ten-point program for the great unity of the entire nation and all other policies and proposals made by the Workers' Party of Korea for national reunification are consistent with the spirit of national independence and one-Korea policy reflecting noble patriotism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was thanks to the President's noble idea of great national unity and his energetic leadership that a great progress had been made in the struggle to organizationally rally the Koreans from all walks of life in the north and the south and abroad under the banner of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The June 15 era of reunification in Korea and miraculous achievements made in the movement for its reunification under the banner of \"By our nation itself\" are unthinkable without the one-Korea policy advanced and consistently maintained by the President.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

His wise guidance resulted in emergence of the invincible military power, the single-minded unity and solid foundation of the self-supporting economy and the most advantageous socialist system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people heroically and successfully concluded the \"Arduous March\", the forced march and built powerful war deterrence guaranteeing the prosperity for all the generations to come. These historic victory and national auspicious event would have been unthinkable without the feats performed by the President in building a rich and powerful country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His exploits are now successfully being carried forward under the leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Considering the President's lifetime intention as an absolute yardstick and giving priority to the work for glorifying his leadership exploits, Kim Jong Il has frequently visited those units honored with the President's on-site guidance while making an endless journey of inspection to frontline areas and guidance to different economic units. Such noble traits of his are the supreme representation of the revolutionary moral obligation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the \"Arduous March\" in the grim 1990s, Kim Jong Il firmly defended our idea, principle and revolutionary mode, the revolutionary heritages left by the President, and made a long journey for the Songun revolutionary leadership to defend the destiny of the country and the nation entrusted by the President.

The Japanese Ministry of Public Management, Home Affairs, Post and Telecommunications recently instructed NHK to continue handling the \"abduction issue\" as a major item in 2007, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Saturday carries a signed article in this regard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries should have knelt down and apologized to the Koreans for the abduction and forcible drafting of a great number of Koreans in the past, instead of denying the issue of \"comfort women\" for the imperial Japanese army and raising a hue and cry over the already settled \"abduction issue\", if they had had sound thinking power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Arrogant Japan, however, is impudent enough to insist on the \"abduction issue\" in a bid to mock the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is national chauvinism and the idea of regarding the Koreans with contempt that prompt the Japanese reactionaries to deny the abduction and forcible drafting of Koreans including the crimes related to the sexual slavery committed by the Japanese imperialists in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The persistent distortion of history by the reactionary ruling circles of Japan is not attributable to simple individual feelings or insufficient understanding of history.

All this is attributable to the moves of the anti-reunification conservative forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality urgently requires the south Korean people to frustrate the plot of the pro-U.S. flunkeyist traitors including the GNP to return to power in a bid to bring again a nightmare of the fascist rule and drive the nation to a miserable end and throw overboard them to the last man. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Given that the conservative organizations attempt to close their ranks organizationally in a bid to satisfy their greed for power with the \"presidential elections\" approaching, it is realistic and essential for all the progressive pro-reform and pro-reunification forces from all walks of life in south Korea to go united to prevail over them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unity is the key to all the victories.

Korean Authorities Urged to Retract Action Taken to Disconnect Internet Sites\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- The recent action taken by the south Korean authorities to disconnect Internet sites was a fascist action against democracy and human rights as it was aimed to blindfold the south Koreans and stop their ears and deprive them of even their right to enjoy the high civilization in the IT era and an act of treachery running counter to the basic spirit of the June 15 joint declaration. They should, therefore, retract the action at once. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A spokesman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland demanded this in a statement Saturday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that the Defense Security Command of the south Korean army recently announced that it detected more than 30 \"pro-north Internet sites\" and disconnected them through the ministry of Information and Tele-Communications, etc., the statement went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities termed the DPRK's Internet homepages including \"By our nation itself\" and homepages of the organizations for the reunification movement in south Korea \"undesirable or pro-north sites\" and have so far prevented south Koreans from directly connecting them or making a free use of them. They are even harshly suppressing those who posted articles supporting the Songun politics on Internet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is something shameful for the nation that Koreans are barred from getting in touch with each other over Internet at present when news and information are exchanged among countries through Internet irrespective of distance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fact that even the above-said command was involved in the operation to detect \"pro-north Internet sites\" reminds one of what the military fascists committed in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities would be well advised to remember that such action will only invite criticism and derision of the public at home and abroad.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Vence al unirse y se derrota al desunirse, lo cual es una verdad de la historia.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
