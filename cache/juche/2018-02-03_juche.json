Against this backdrop, high-ranking officials of its regime have gone so impudent and foolish to say that they would make the DPRK abandon its nukes in a perfect, verifiable and irreversible method.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries, who have taken the lead in the sanctions racket to stifle the DPRK to please their American master, always cunningly behaved to seek their interests.

This fact can never be changed by any force or by anything.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Today the international community is asserting that the U.S. will have to co-exist with the DPRK, saying the DPRK is a nuclear power and will consolidate the status.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This being a hard fact, the island country's regime is still talking about the abandonment of DPRK's nukes and pressure on it, seized with an anachronistic wild dream.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is just a last-ditch effort of the regime stunned by the emergence of the DPRK as a new strategic state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Moreover, it is just a revelation of Japan's sinister intention to put the brakes on easing tensions on the Korean peninsula and scuttle the efforts of the Koreans for their great event.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese regime is sadly mistaken if it thinks that its denial can ever change the tremendous national power and strategic status of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Abe group had better understand the changed strategic position of the DPRK and make a switchover in its policy toward the DPRK, though belatedly."
