            "content": "Kim Jong Un Visits Kyongsang Kindergarten \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, July 15 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, first chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission and  supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, visited Kyongsang Kindergarten.\n\t\t\t\t\t Smart children presented bunches of fragrant flowers to him, saying \"Thank you dear respected General Kim Jong Un very much.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He gently patted them on their cheeks, asking how old they were. He entered the playground, kindly taking them in his arms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"It is nice to see the playground covered with rubber mat\", he said, watching with a broad smile children merrily using amusement facilities: some were competing with each other with their knees bent and others were riding on swing boats, plane-shaped slides, rocket-shaped plane on the lawn. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He dropped in at the room dedicated to the history of the kindergarten. He praised the kindergarten for producing many music wonders, mentioning every artiste who learned music at the kindergarten.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching the children lost in playing, he was greatly satisfied with the good arrangement of the general playground. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLooking at Ri Kang Juk, head of the kindergarten, he said he revisited it because it is important to develop pre-school children's intellectual faculties and he wanted to project her doing her job well.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kyongsang Kindergarten could be modernly spruced up thanks to the help from the related units but it was largely ascribable to her work style. He gave her the highest appreciation by giving an instruction to widely introduce her and generalize her work style. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He visited the junior third class to watch the children drawing paintings with crayons and their skills, emphasizing the need to teach them well how to draw so they might acquire ability to observe things and phenomena from childhood.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching a notice board \"Who is more gentle\" full of red stars, he noted that using the board is a good educational method suited to the feelings of the children who wish to do more good things than others.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also saw the children of the senior fifth class making a composition entitled \"To boast my mother\" and smart children dancing in the rhythmic room.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then he dropped in at the physical training room and had a photo taken with the children, taking them in his arms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the piano room he was pleased to see the children playing pianos skillfully, saying they were good at finding harmonic intervals. He kindly took the hand of Kim Hyang Suk, head of the department for piano education, who has brought up a lot of juvenile music prodigies, expressing his hope for steady success in her future work.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then he visited the underground wading pool and learned about the temperature of water.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He enjoyed a performance given by the children of the kindergarten at the hall.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That day he presented Kyongsang Kindergarten with gifts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had a photo taken with the officials and teachers of the kindergarten.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Jang Song Thaek, member of the Political Bureau of the C.C., the WPK and vice-chairman of the NDC of the DPRK, Ri Jae Il, first vice-department director of the C.C., the WPK, and Pak Chun Hong, vice-department director of the C.C., the WPK."

            "content": "CPRK Secretariat Accuses S. Korean Regime of Bringing Inter-Korean Relations to Worst Phase (2)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, July 15 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea issued an indictment on Thursday accusing the Lee Myung Bak regime of south Korea of bringing the inter-Korean relations to a collapse through its grave politically-motivated military provocations against the DPRK and driving the situation on the Korean Peninsula to the worst phase since its seizure of power.\n\t\t\t\t\t The indictment said the Lee group made no scruple of blatantly challenging the dignified social system of the DPRK in gross violation of the north-south agreement on recognizing and respecting each other's ideology and social system. It went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As soon as he came to power in February 2008, traitor Lee declared \"no nukes, opening and 3 000 dollars\" as the \"policy toward the north\" and in November that year visited the U.S., his master, where he openly cried out for confrontation of systems in the very eyes of the world, blaring that it is the final aim to unify the country under the system of liberal democracy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group set in motion all the puppet plot-breeding organs including the Ministry of Unification and the Intelligence Service in 2009 and faked up the very provocative \"emergency ruling plan-Puhung\" under the simulated conditions of \"contingency\". In July that year Hyon In Thaek, the then puppet minister of Unification, begged the U.S. to make earlier involvement in the event of the \"contingency in the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Addressing \"the meeting for marking August 15 (Korea's liberation anniversary)\" in 2010, traitor Lee Myung Bak peddled so-called \"unification tax\" and in June last year revealed his ulterior intention for confrontation of systems, making preposterous remarks that \"unification can come at midnight like a thief\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group made no scruple of slandering the dignity and system of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In a special lecture given in April this year, Lee found fault with the living of the people in the north and, not content with this, said that \"the north should make a regime change,\" talking about \"land reform\" and \"wind of change.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group persistently kicked up an anti-DPRK human right racket with the ulterior intention for confrontation of systems.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t While taking issue with the DPRK over its non-existent \"human rights issue\" in March 2008, Lee said that \"he would say what he has to\" and \"he would handle the issue in cooperation with the international community\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group took the lead in cooking up \"a resolution on human rights in the north\" together with the U.S. and its followers at the 63rd UN General Assembly session in November 2008. In April and May of 2011 the group staged a burlesque called \"week of freedom for the north\" with riffs-raffs of the U.S. and Japan involved, hurting the DPRK's dignity and social system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group tried to resume psychological false broadcasting against the DPRK in the areas along the Military Demarcation Line which had been suspended since the publication of the June 15 joint declaration. It let human scum spread leaflets on and on.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Blaring that it is necessary to send leaflets to the north and intensify broadcasting against it in January last year, Lee undisguisedly revealed his intention to strengthen the moves for a psychological war aimed at undermining the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The crimes of Lee who sought the confrontation of systems through most despicable and vicious politically-motivated provocations can never be concealed."

Korea, Arch Criminals of Nuclear Crisis: Rodong Sinmun\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, July 15 (KCNA) -- The U.S. and the south Korean puppet group are arch criminals who have stoked the nuclear crisis  in the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia century after century, says Rodong Sinmun Sunday in a bylined article.\n\t\t\t\t\t After declaring that the U.S. forces present in south Korea would start going nuclear on July 15, 1957, the U.S. made it a fait accompli to ignite a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula and has massively deployed strategic and tactical nuclear weapons in south Korea and staged frantic nuclear war exercises under various codenames for verifying the efficiency of preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK, the article notes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It cites facts to prove that the Korean Peninsula is becoming the most dangerous region as the U.S. singled it out as the next target of nuclear strike after Hiroshima and Nagasaki of Japan and has never changed the plan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In 2008, the first year of his office the Lee Myung Bak group changed Reception, Staging, Onward Movement and Integration (RSOI) into Key Resolve and continued staging it with Foal Eagle as it did before. At the same time, it began to carry out OPLAN 5029 and OPLAN 5012, dangerous nuclear war scenarios. When the Cheonan warship sinking case and the Yonphyong Island shelling case occurred, it introduced U.S. nuclear aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines into the waters off the Korean Peninsula and got hell-bent on the move to mount a preemptive attack on the DPRK by means of nuclear strike in south Korea. In November 2011 it staged the exercise for operating the extended deterrence with the U.S., its master, at the U.S. Strategy Command in Nebraska State, for the first time, keen on getting a mastery of the \"tailored deterrence strategy\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the Korean nation suffered the great loss, the group, touting the \"contingency\", worked hard to do harm to the DPRK by staging Key Resolve and Foal Eagle nuclear war exercises in league with the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet conservative politicians are now letting loose ceaseless spates of nuclear remarks such as \"examination of redeployment of tactical nuclear weapons of U.S. forces to cope with north's nukes\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Historical facts eloquently prove that the U.S. is the very one who produced the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula, and the nuclear threat comes to the north from the south in which the Lee Myung Bak belligerent group reigns."
