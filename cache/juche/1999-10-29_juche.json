By doing so, they smashed the imperialists' sophism that Korea would not be rebuilt in a century and carried out the historical tasks of industrialization in a matter of 14 years, demonstrating the greatness of the country to the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The recent situation of Korea was more difficult than in the postwar period. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The imperialists' moves for isolation and suffocation and years of natural disasters exerted a great effect on the national economy as a whole. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   General Secretary Kim Jong Il personally kindled the fire of the second grand Chollima march to break through these severe difficulties as early as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people are waging a vigorous drive to make this year a year of turning point in building a powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Chollima, the stamina of Korea, has spread its wings again to make a leaping progress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The energetic efforts of the working people are bringing about a steady improvement in different sectors of the national economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Industrial output value in the third quarter of this year increased 9 percent as against the same period of last year= electric power 9 percent,  pig iron 7 percent, rolled steel 40 percent and machine tools 16 percent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Monthly assignments higher than last years, were over fulfilled by the Songjin Steel Complex, the February 8 Jikdong Youth United Coal Mine, the Sungri General Motor Works, the Huichon General Machine Tool Plant and other units and local industry factories. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Many minor power stations have been commissioned while the building of large-scale power stations including the Thaechon Power Station is being stepped up. \r\n\r\n"

It is aimed at starting the second Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The joint military drill of the \"Self-Defense Forces\" of Japan and the U.S. forces started on Wednesday, timed to coincide with the \"Foal Eagle.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Meanwhile, the madcap \"99 Hwarang\" exercise was launched in South Korea on Monday with over one million forces including 20,000 soldiers, the \"homeland defence reserve forces\" and \"civilian defence forces\" involved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Earlier, the U.S.-Japan joint naval drill, the Japan-South Korea joint naval drill, flying exercise of the U.S. forces present in Japan and various other joint military exercises were staged almost every day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All this  goes to prove that the hostile forces have gone to extremes in their military tie-up and insolent moves to stifle the north by force of arms.

            "content": "U.S. massacre in Korea denounced\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Pyongyang, October 29 (KCNA) -- The DPRK Institute of National Reunification on October 27 issued memorandum accusing the U.S. aggressor troops of their hair-raising massacre and unethical crimes committed against Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Recalling that the recent disclosure of fractional part  of the massacre of civilians  committed by U.S. aggressors in the Rogun-ri area, Yongdong county, North Chungchong Province, during the Korean War touched off a strong condemnation across South Korea, the memorandum says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   After the disclosure of the massacre in Rogun-ri, many South Koreans  who have been forced to keep silence on it  for scores of years due to the  suppression by the U.S. and the South Korean authorities  are coming out to testify to the crimes one after another. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    As a result, the whole story about their atrocities is brought to light as the days go by. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    On August 15, 1946 more than 2,600 workers of the Hwasun Coal Mine, South Jolla Province, were on their way to Kwangju to participate in a rally protesting against GIs' plunder. Seeing them, U.S. soldiers bayoneted and shot to death hundreds  of them. The dead bodies remained on the scene for one week as the workers were not allowed to carry them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   On August 3, 1950 they blew up Toksung bridge in Koryong county, North Kyongsang Province, killing hundreds of civilians and also  blasted Waegwan bridge in Chilgok county, leaving hundreds of people dead. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  American massacre of  civilians was also reported   in south Chungchong and south Kyongsang provinces and in the area along the River Raktong and other areas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is just the tip of the iceberg of the massacres committed by the U.S. aggressor troops. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their killings of Koreans  have a history of more than a hundred years. They began invading Korea aboard the pirate ship general Sherman more than 130 years ago. They killed Koreans as they hunted natives in Americas.  Typical of their massacre in the early period of their aggression on Korea was their killing of over 350 guiltless people after their reinvasion of Kanghwa Island in 1871. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S.'s killing of Korean people became more brutal  after their military occupation of South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   When the popular resistance broke out on Jeju Island in April 1948, the U.S. shot and  stabbed  people to death or put them to death by hanging or buried them alive and threw them into the sea, killing them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Even the \"UN temporary committee on Korea\" could not but admit in a report on the  tragedy  on Jeju Island that the U.S. forces killed more than 35,000 people or over one fourth of the population of the island, in the period from April to October 1948 under the direct command of Robert, head of the U.S. military advisory group. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At least 109,000 people of South Korea were killed by the U.S. in 1949 alone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. committed shocking massacres after igniting the Korean War of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They killed  as many as one million civilians across South Korea in one year after the outbreak of the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They killed more than one million civilians during their temporary occupation of some areas of the north.    In Sinchon county, South Hwanghae Province, alone they killed more than 35,380 people or one fourth of its entire population in a little over 50 days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Lording it over South Korea after the war, they ruthlessly killed people as their hunting and shooting targets and playthings  and for pleasure, regardless of men and women, young and old. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The number of the cases of atrocities committed by them in South Korea  since the August 15, 1945 liberation of the country  is more than 270,000 and these took the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, counting only these reported after the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The gravity of their massacre of Koreans lies in that this was a state organized crime committed in pursuance of the U.S. hostile policy toward the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Even according to the recent AP report, the massacre in Rogun-ri was not committed by GIs alone but on the order of the far eastern U.S. forces command and the 8th U.S. army command and it was spearheaded by military officers ranging from company commanders to division commanders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Thousands of South Koreans were killed during the Kwangju Popular Uprising in May 1980. Gleysteen, the then U.S. ambassador to South Korea, in his message to the U.S. State Department said that the U.S. agreed to the South Korean authorities' use of forces under the combined forces command. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is clear evidence that their massacre of Korean people was an organized crime committed in line with U.S. policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This notwithstanding, the U.S. ruling quarters refuse to admit their crimes and are employing a crafty plot to evade their responsibility for them. Moreover, the South Korean authorities are resorting to a clumsy trick to conceal the U.S.'s atrocities at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The historical facts and lessons  go to prove that as long as the U.S. persist in their moves for aggression and their troops remain in South Korea, the South Korean people can neither live in peace even a moment nor can  even a day pass by without seeing the blood shed by Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States should honestly admit its crimes and unconditionally apologize and compensate  to the Korean people for the damage done to them for so many years. \r\n\r\n"
