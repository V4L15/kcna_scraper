Even after the war it has left no stone unturned to carry the plan into practice.\r\n   Japan is now ready to produce a large number of nuclear weapons any moment when it is determined to do.\r\n   It is capable of using nuclear weapons as well.\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries are now raising a hue and cry over the fiction of \"north Korea's nuclear development\", as well as \"threat of proliferation of nuclear weapons\" allegedly caused by the  nuclear testing of India and Pakistan.\r\n   Their allegations are a smokescreen to justify their militarist nuclear policy.\r\n   Japan's scenario has reached a stage of practice. In particular, Japan regards the northern half of Korea as the first target of offensive in its policy of overseas expansion. We, therefore, cannot remain a passive onlooker to Japan's moves for a nuclear power. We cannot but take a self-defensive countermeasure.\r\n   If the Japanese reactionaries dare provoke us in reliance upon military strength, we will punish them mercilessly.\r\n   The world peace-loving people, including the Korean people and other Asian people, will never tolerate any nuclear aggression  moves by Japan.    \r\n \r\n\r\n"
