This is arousing a maximum degree of vigilance of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to stop acting rashly, mindful that the Korean peninsula is not Afghanistan. \r\n\r\n"

The message represented their resolution to exert all efforts to increase the combat capability of the KPA true to his army-based revolutionary leadership and thus consolidate the military bulwark of the Korean revolution and brilliantly record this significant year as a year of a fresh leap forward in building a powerful nation in the history of our party and revolution. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
