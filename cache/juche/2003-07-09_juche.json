In 1997 the defence agency set up an intelligence headquarters analyzing and dealing with information gathered by satellites. On the basis of such careful preparations Japan launched two H-2A to put spy satellites into orbit on march 28 this year and it is now making preparations to launch two more spy satellites. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also stepping up the nuclear weaponization, another goal of its moves for a military power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From 1967 to 1970 Japan conducted basic researches into a nuclear policy and since 1995 it has carried out in real earnest researches into the nuclear weaponization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There were at least 50 nuclear power plants in Japan as of the end of 1998 which are churning out nuclear waste capable of producing a huge amount of plutonium every year. As if it were not enough with it, Japan has shipped huge plutonium from Britain and France for years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to information released by officials concerned of green peace, Japan has stockpiled 38 tons of plutonium and would possess 110 tons of it by 2020. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is aiming to store 400 tons of plutonium in the future enough to produce 60,000 nuclear weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that the final aim of Japan's moves to become a military giant and go nuclear is to launch expansion overseas, reinvasion of Asia and Korea is its principal target. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK can not but be vigilant against Japan as it is working hard to establish the MD acting as a shock brigade in carrying out the U.S. strategy for a preemptive attack, a strategy for a nuclear war to destroy the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should ponder over the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by its bellicose acts of infringing upon the dignity and the sovereignty of the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"
