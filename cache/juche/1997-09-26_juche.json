            "content": "Medical treatment of pows called for\r\n Pyongyang, September 26 (KCNA) -- Ri Song Ho, Acting Chairman of the Central Committee of the DPRK Red Cross Society, sent a letter over radio today to Jong Won Sik, President of south Korea's Red Cross, at the news that Kim In So, an unconverted long-term prisoner of war detained in south Korea, is in a very critical condition and Kim Yong Thae, who is attending to him, is also on the verge of collapse.\r\n   It is reported that Kim In So can never move and falls unconscious sometimes with the sequela of cerebral hemorrhage aggravating.\r\n   Kim Yong Thae, who is attending to Kim In So at sick bed, is also a sick man. He is hardly eking out a living and the only eye left is losing sight.\r\n   The letter recalls that the DPRK side had already proposed reasonable measures to treat the serious illness of Kim In So, but the south side unreasonably turned down the humanitarian proposals and made no reply.\r\n   The letter continues:\r\n   \"What makes us more indignant is that your authorities subject him to harsh political persecution by extending the period of 'surveillance for public peace' and intensifying surveillance.\"\r\n   \"If your side is truly a Red Cross organisation with humanitarian mission, you must pay attention to the medical treatment of Kim In So, though belatedly, and send him, Kim Yong Thae and ham se Hwan back to the north where their families wait for them anxiously.\"\r\n   \"If their repatriation is not realised and any misfortune falls on them, your side will be wholly to blame for that.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
