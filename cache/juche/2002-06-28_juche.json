The U.S. imperialists set up the \"American empire\" through aggression and wars and have deployed their aggressor forces in different parts of the world to commit mass killings, acts of destruction and arsons in a bid to conquer the world. Such crime-woven history of the U.S. imperialists proves that they are the incarnation of evil and the worst rogue state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bush had the DPRK in mind when he cried out for a \"fight against the evil\" and a preemptive attack. \r\n The DPRK cannot but regard his reckless remarks as a blatant provocation and a serious threat and blackmail against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. imperialists ignite a war against the DPRK, it will result in entombing the U.S., the empire of evils.    \r\n\r\n"

But they did not give in to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the unique army-based policy and wise leadership of Kim Jong Il they have turned out to build a powerful socialist nation.\r\n The DPRK is now demonstrating its might as a great and dignified country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Visiting Panmunjom, she realized how bitterly the Korean people are suffering from the national division, she said, and stressed: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Korea should be reunified into one. The June 15 North-South Joint Declaration is a landmark of Korea's reunification, which declared that the Korean nation would solve the reunification issue by themselves in an independent way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We sincerely hope Korea will be reunified according to the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will strengthen solidarity with the Korean women and always support the Lorean people's struggle for national reunification.     \r\n\r\n"
