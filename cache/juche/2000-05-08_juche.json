Through such moves, the U.S. and the South Korean authorities intend to distort the nature of the last Korean War, prevent the war-weariness and evasion of conscription, which are prevalent in South Korea, and, in the event of contingency, collect mercenary troops from different countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We will never overlook such criminal moves of the U.S. and the South Korean authorities distorting the history of the Korean War with a huge amount of fund and many war criminals involved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is our unshakable determination and will to bring to the stern court of history and punish those criminals who provoked the Korean War and make them pay due compensation for it. \r\n\r\n"

It steadily developed in the period of Kojoson (ancient Korea) and the age of the three kingdoms (Koguryo, Paekje and Silla). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As early as in 692 there appeared a physicians training school where medical science, including the art of acupuncture and moxa cautery, was taught. Not a few books on good experience gained in treating diseases were brought out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Ancestors singled out most sensitive parts of a human body as regions of acupuncture and moxa cautery and successfully treated troubles by means of acupuncture and cautery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   On this principle acupuncture was used in the treatment of various diseases such as paralytic diseases, diseases causing pains, inflammation and digestive trouble. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This treatment method of Koryo is in wide use not only at home but in other countries. \r\n\r\n"
