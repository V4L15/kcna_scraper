            "content": "ACNC critica palabras de Park Geun-hye en busca de enfrentamiento fratricida\r\nPyongyang, 22 de septiembre (ACNC) ? Ahora, la Peninsula Coreana se encuentra en la peor situacion que puede dar lugar a la guerra nuclear en cualquier momento.\n\t\t\t\t\tEstados Unidos, culpable de la escalada de la campana de guerra nuclear contra la RPDC, desarrollo este ano tambien los ejercicios militares conjuntos Ulji Freedom Guardian de mayor dimension en la historia y emplaza en el Sur de Corea y su contorno 3 tipos de bombarderos estrategicos nucleares y otras propiedades estrategicas nucleares agravando al extremo la situacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHacer frente a la creciente amenaza de guerra nuclear de EE.UU. con el incremento de fuerzas armadas nucleares constituye el ejercicio del derecho a la autodefensa por parte de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo problematico es que la banda de Park Geun-hye actua con imprudencia en esta tierra donde las armas nucleares de justicia confrontan agudamente con las de opresion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tElla libra casi todos los dias los ejercicios de guerra nuclear contra la parte connacional introduciendo los pertrechos belicos de EE.UU. y lleva al climax el enfrentamiento tras romper las relaciones Norte-Sur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSobre todo, intenta realizar desde mediados de octubre los ejercicios combinados para dar el \"golpe preciso a la Direccion Suprema\" de la RPDC introduciendo en el Mar Oeste y el Mar Sur de Corea hasta la flotilla del portaaviones nuclear Ronald Reagan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn estos dias, pronuncia sin vacilacion alguna los disparates tan belicosos como \"destruccion total de Pyongyang\" y \"eliminacion de la comandancia de guerra\" abogando abiertamente por el \"cambio del poder norcoreano\".  Esto insinua que llega al estado incontrolable la fiebre conflictiva de la traidora Park.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSu politica de enfrentamiento fratricida puede ser en un futuro cercano el detonante de guerra nuclear en la Peninsula Coreana.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido a la camarilla de Park Geun-hye que no hace caso del destino de decenas de millones de habitantes, no se sabe cual terrible desastre se impondra al Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo es casual que los habitantes surcoreanos maldijeran asi: \"Park Geun-hye es la fuente de guerra\", \"ella lleva al pueblo a la crisis de guerra\" y \"no pueden vivir tranquilos por culpa de ella\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay que eliminar a tiempo la causa de desagracias."
