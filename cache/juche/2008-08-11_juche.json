Paektu Marked \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samjiyon, August 9 (KCNA) -- A national meeting was held in the holy land of the sun on Saturday to mark the 20th anniversary of the on-site guidance to the secret camp in Mt. Paektu by President Kim Il Sung and General Secretary Kim Jong Il and the 20th anniversary of the naming of \"Jong Il Peak\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President sent anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters several times to find out the secret camp in Mt. Paektu. In August Juche 75 (1986) he personally toured the area of Mt. Paektu and instructed officials to conduct the survey of Sobaeksu Valley. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On August 10, 1988 the President visited the secret camp in Mt. Paektu that was restored to its former glory, recollected what had been there half a century ago one after another, thus comprehensively ascertaining all findings to be valuable revolutionary relics. He said in an excited tone that it would be good to call the peak behind the old home of Kim Jong Il \"Jong Il Peak\" and carve those letters there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The august name of Kim Jong Il was thus carved on natural granite stones on the peak towering more than 1,790 meters above the sea level. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present at the meeting were Kim Yong Chun, Kim Il Chol and other senior officials and leading officials of the party and armed forces organs, working people's organizations, ministries and national institutions, KPA servicepersons, members of the June 18 Construction Shock Brigade and officials and working people in Ryanggang Province and Samjiyon County. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Ki Nam, secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, in a report said that the on-site guidance provided by Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il to the secret camp in Mt. Paektu in August 1988 marked a historic event of great significance in glorifying the revolutionary traditions of Mt. Paektu and developing the Korean revolution aimed at accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche generation after generation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Jong Il Peak is not only a historical witness to the undying revolutionary feats performed by the President and anti-Japanese war hero Kim Jong Suk, which are associated with the secret camp in Mt. Paektu, but a historic peak towering as if to guard the birthplace of the bright star over Mt. Paektu and convey the glorious event of the nation to the whole world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The carving of letters \"Jong Il Peak\" on the peak reflecting the spirit of Mt. Paektu increased the significance of Mt. Paektu. It also made it possible to add shine to the revolutionary battle sites and revolutionary historic sites centering around the secret camp in Mt. Paektu to ensure that they would serve as a fountainhead of the Korean revolution, a centre for effective education in the revolutionary traditions and treasures of eternal value to be handed down to posterity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During his field guidance to the secret camp in Mt. Paektu on August 18, 1988 Kim Jong Il clarified principled matters arising in sprucing up the revolutionary battle sites in the area of Mt. Paektu and indicated tasks to be carried out to preserve those sites and convert the area into a center for effective education in the revolutionary traditions and an attractive tourist destination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over the past two decades since the on-site guidance to the secret camp in Mt. Paektu by the President and Kim Jong Il the appearance of the area of Mt. Paektu and other revolutionary battle sites and revolutionary historic sites in Ryanggang Province has changed remarkably. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter underlined the need for the army and people of the DPRK to firmly protect and preserve the revolutionary traditions of Mt. Paektu and successfully carry forward them under the banner of Songun in order to give a steady continuity to the Juche revolution, overcoming manifold difficulties and ordeals.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Nevertheless, it cooked up on August 8, 1953, 12 days after the AA came into effect, the \"mutual defense pact\" which stipulated that the U.S. has the right to deploy its armed forces of three services in south Korea and its vicinities for an indefinite period allegedly to cope with \"communist threat\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a result, huge U.S. troops have always been stationed in south Korea to lord it over there though there is no foreign serviceperson in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Keeping its armed forces in south Korea for an indefinite period under this \"pact\", the United States has used them as a lever to seize the lifeline of politics, military affairs, economy, culture and all other fields of south Korea and intensify the domination and control over it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As shown by the circumstances of the fabrication of the \"pact\" and the developments after that, it is impossible for the Korean nation to escape misfortunes with the aggressors and traitors left intact. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n So, to conduct a vigorous struggle against the U.S. and Lee Myung Bak is the way for preserving and displaying the national sovereignty, defending peace from war and achieve the independent reunification of Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
