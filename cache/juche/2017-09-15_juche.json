            "content": "U.S. Slammed for Trying to Deploy Tactical Nuclear Weapons into S. Korea\r\n Pyongyang, September 15 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Institute of American Studies, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the DPRK, gave the following answer to a question raised by KCNA on Friday in connection with the fact that the Trump Administration is publicizing through the media the \"possibility of redeploying tactical nuclear weapons\" into south Korea and developing up-to-date miniaturized nuclear bomb.\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently, NBC and other American press reported that the Trump administration is currently examining various plans of developing up-to-date miniaturized nuclear bomb of low intensity to deal with nuclear threats posed by countries like the DPRK and Russia, and it will not rule out the option of redeploying tactical nuclear weapons into south Korea in case the south Korean \"government\" so requests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The fact that the deliberate leakage of the information about tactical nuclear weapons by the Trump administration coincides with its moves to impose heinous sanctions, pressure and military threat on the DPRK, raises the alarm about the intention of the U.S. to unleash an actual nuclear war in the Korean peninsula\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has generated the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula by deploying more than 1,000 nuclear weapons into south Korea since 1950s and turning it into the front-line base for nuclear war, and imposed constant nuclear threat on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the early 1990s, as the international support for the just anti-nuclear, peace policy and sincere efforts of the DPRK increased, the U.S. declared the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from south Korea, but it never stopped blackmailing and threatening the DPRK with its nuclear assets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Explicitly speaking once again, continuous nuclear threat and vicious hostile policy of the U.S. towards DPRK are the very reason the DPRK gained access to nukes and strengthened its nuclear force for self-defense.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Besides, the redeployment of the tactical nuclear weapons, which are meant to be used for actual warfare beyond the purpose of mere deterrence, into the Korean peninsula vividly reveals the vicious aim of the U.S. to wage a nuclear war on this land.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The attempt of the U.S. to deploy tactical nuclear weapons into south Korea and develop up-to-date miniaturized nuclear bombs is targeted at its strategic rivals in the region as well as the DPRK, and it will increase the tension in the Korean Peninsula and the region and instigate intense arms race.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nuclear threat of the U.S. which is growing more vicious propels the DPRK to continuous development of all means of counterattack including tactical nuclear weapons to the highest level at a maximum speed and to faster deployment of these means ready for battle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. which gave rise to the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula and pushes the nuclear confrontation between the DPRK and U.S. towards the brink of explosion, shall be held responsible for all catastrophic consequences to follow."

            "content": "Portavoz de IAN critica intento de EE.UU. de introducir de nuevo armas nucleares tacticas\r\nPyongyang, 15 de septiembre (ACNC) -- A la pregunta formulada por la ACNC en relacion con que la administracion Trump publica en la prensa la \"posibilidad de reubicacion de armas nucleares tacticas\" en el Sur de Corea y el desarrollo de la ultramoderna mini-bomba nuclear, el portavoz del Instituto para Asuntos Norteamericanos del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea dio el dia 15 la siguiente respuesta:\n\t\t\t\t\tEn estos dias, la cadena NBC y otros medios de prensa estadounidenses informan que la administracion Trump esta revisando varios proyectos de desarrollo de la mini-bomba nuclear ultramoderna de baja intensidad para hacer frente a la amenaza nuclear del Norte (de Corea), Rusia y otros y tiene la posicion de no descartar el plan de reubicar armas nucleares tacticas en el Sur de Corea si lo pide el \"gobierno\" surcoreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa administracion Trump divulga en la prensa el problema de armas nucleares tacticas justamente cuando aplica la sancion y presion mas brutales contra la RPDC amenazandola en lo militar, lo que deviene un movimiento peligrosisimo que prenuncia la provocacion real de guerra nuclear en la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde la decada de 1950, EE.UU. introdujo mas de un millar de armas nucleares tacticas en el suelo surcoreano convirtiendolo en la base avanzada de guerra nuclear y causo asi el problema nuclear de la Peninsula Coreana comenzando a chantajear y amenazar con esos artefactos a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA principios de la decada de 1990, anuncio la retirada de armas nucleares del territorio surcoreano ante la crecida del apoyo internacional a la justa politica antinuclear y por la paz de la RPDC y a sus esfuerzos sinceros a tal efecto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAun despues de ese anuncio, nunca ha dejado de amenazar y chantajear con sus propiedades nucleares de diferentes tipos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tVolvemos a dejar en claro que la incesante amenaza y chantaje nucleares y la brutal politica de EE.UU. contra la RPDC son el factor que obligo a esta a poseer e incrementar las fuerzas armadas nucleares de caracter autodefensivo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl intento de introducir nuevamente en la Peninsula Coreana el arma nuclear tactica tomando como premisa su uso en el combate real por encima de la etapa de mera disuasion demuestra directamente la mala ambicion de EE.UU. de desatar a toda costa en esta tierra la guerra nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl proposito de EE.UU. de desplegar de nuevo ese armamento en suelo surcoreano y desarrollar la bomba arriba mencionada agravara aun mas la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana y la region y causara la renida carrera armamentista porque entre sus blancos figuran no solo la RPDC sino tambien los rivales estrategicos de la region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa creciente amenaza nuclear de EE.UU. hace a la RPDC desarrollar sin parar y en el maximo nivel y la maxima velocidad el arma nuclear tactica y otros medios de reaccion y desplegarlos con prisa para el combate real.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU., autor que causo el problema nuclear de la Peninsula Coreana y lleva al borde de explosion la confrontacion nuclear RPDC-EE.UU., sera responsable de todas las consecuencias catastroficas."

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun condena ejercicios de agresion a ultramar en Japon\r\nPyongyang, 15 de septiembre (ACNC) -- Tuvieron lugar en la base aerea norteamericana en Yokota y la otra militar del mismo pais en Iwakuni de Japon los ejercicios de despliegue de PAC-3 que fueron repetidos seguidamente en el enclave de Misawa.\n\t\t\t\t\t La supuesta \"amenaza de misil\" proveniente de la RPDC ha sido el pretexto que utilizaron los astutos reaccionarios japoneses para justificar esas maniobras militares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Al respecto, el diario Rodong Sinmun publico este viernes un comentario individual que sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Es un secreto bien conocido que el sistema de misil interceptor PAC-3, de que disponen las \"Fuerzas de Autodefensa\" de Japon, forma parte del sistema antimisiles de EE.UU. para doblegar a las potencias regionales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Al paralelo del entrenamiento de ubicacion de misiles interceptores, Japon emprende las acciones militares ofensivas en las aguas en litigio del Mar Sur de China.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Segun trascendidos, ese pais debatio el tema de librar ejercicios militares conjuntos involucrando hasta a Gran Bretana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Sigue invariable la ambicion de Japon de realizar sin falta su anejado sueno de establecer la \"esfera de coprosperidad de la gran Asia Oriental\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Japon viene consolidando la base politico-militar de la agresion a ultramar bajo el amparo de EE.UU. y como parte de los pasos para ponerla en practica, dinamiza las operaciones militares en las aguas en litigio del Mar Sur de China.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Insatisfecho de la ayuda de EE.UU., intenta ahora endurecer la presion militar con el apoyo de Gran Bretana y otros paises europeos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La realidad demuestra que la \"amenaza de misil\" de la RPDC, de que no se cansan de hablar los reaccionarios japoneses, es un cartel falso para ocultar la ambicion de los fanaticos de militarismo de retomar el camino de agresion a ultramar en el Nordeste Asiatico."
