            "content": "KCNA Dismisses Resolution of IAEA Meeting \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 23 (KCNA) -- A \"resolution\" on the issue of the DPRK was reportedly adopted at the 47th meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency on Sept. 19.\r\n The resolution demanded the DPRK \"return to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) and scrap its nuclear program in a verifiable manner.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK can never recognize but declares invalid such \"unreasonable resolution\" as it was adopted in disregard of the nature of the nuclear issue, a product of the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK, and the status in which the DPRK is no longer bound to the NPT. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This resolution does not deserve even a passing note as the DPRK is no longer legally bound to the NPT because it is not committed to implement it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already known, it is not the first time that the IAEA adopted such unjust resolutions against the DPRK under the manipulation of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On November 29, 2002 and January 6, 2003 it adopted unilateral resolutions demanding the DPRK scrap its \"nuclear program\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. used the IAEA for internationalizing the campaign to stifle the DPRK thus eliminating even the last possibility of peacefully settling the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nUnder this situation the DPRK government issued a statement on January 10, 2003 declaring that the withdrawal from the NPT, which had been temporally suspended took effect automatically and immediately. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK thus completely pulled out of the NPT on January 11, 2003. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With the withdrawal from the NPT the DPRK was completely free from the binding force of the Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA according to Article 3 of the NPT. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite unacceptable to anyone that the IAEA meeting discussed the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and adopted a resolution attacking the DPRK though it is not a signatory to the NPT. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact the DPRK has nothing to do with the IAEA. Therefore, the resolution is being denounced and ridiculed by everyone as its adoption is a senseless act reminding one of a dog barking against the moon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is that the IAEA is still acting a henchman and spokesman for the U.S. to serve the purpose of its hostile policy toward the DPRK to disarm it and destroy its system by forcing it to scrap its \"nuclear program\" before dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This time, too, the IAEA said nothing of the U.S. which has grossly violated the NPT and the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework but pressurized the DPRK, a victim, to give up its right to self-defence, thus fully disclosing its true colours as a political waiting maid of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was quite natural that a delegate of a member state that attended the meeting dismissed the resolution as an \"unbalanced one\". This was proper criticism of the partial resolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It would be better for the delegates of those countries which supported the resolution to take a walk and drink coffee than sitting idle for unproductive discussion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK once again keenly realized what a beneficial step it took to protect its right to existence and dignity when it terminated its relations with the unfair and partial IAEA which is in the clutches of the U.S. and withdrew from the NPT. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The IAEA and its member states are well advised to behave themselves for their own sake.    \r\n\r\n"

The U.S. even staged maritime inspection exercises targeted against the DPRK ships by mobilizing its followers.\r\n Minju Joson today carries a signed commentary, which reads in part: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Sanctions and military threat and blackmail never work on the army and the people of the DPRK. The U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK aimed at stifling it is a pipe dream that stands no chance of realization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and the people of the DPRK have so far advanced unswervingly along the road they chose despite the U.S. persistent sanctions and military threat and blackmail. They will remain invariable in this stand in the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should drop its anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK and its attempt to stifle it. This is urgently needed for the improved bilateral relations, for the development of the international situation as a whole and for the U.S. itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. persistently clings to the hostile policy toward the DPRK, it will be held fully responsible for all the ensuing consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Option is not the monopoly of the U.S. The DPRK also has the freedom of choice. The U.S. should clearly see the reality and stop such foolish act at once.    \r\n\r\n"
