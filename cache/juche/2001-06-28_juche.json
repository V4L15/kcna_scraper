            "content": "Rodong Sinmun calls for strengthening armed forces \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 28 (KCNA) -- A nation with a weak army is bound to lose its country and become slaves of imperialists but a nation with a strong army can defend its country and enjoy an independent life, says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article.\r\n The article goes on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n President Kim Il Sung enunciated the proposition that \"people are bound to become slaves when rifles get rusty.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This explains the idea of giving priority to the army which should be maintained in the revolution and construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to defend independence of the working people it is necessary to strengthen the armed forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The independence of the popular masses is guaranteed by the army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a powerful force to crush the counter-revolutionary forces and emerge victorious in the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The force of arms should be countered by the force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the only way of preventing people from being reduced to slaves and achieving independent development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If armed forces are ideologically disarmed, a country is bound to go to ruin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rifles in the hands of those forces are worse than wooden sticks and an army disloyal to the cause of independence of the popular masses can never defend its country and nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a lesson and truth grasped by the army and people of the DPRK in the acute confrontation with imperialists that the most right way of protecting the destiny of the country and nation is to give priority to the army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people have been able to decisively counter the reckless military offensives of imperialists because they have more tightly held rifles in hands. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is absolutely impossible to defend socialism by begging the enemy or making concession to him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Army-first politics is the main political mode maintained by leader Kim Jong Il in the revolution and construction.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people have defended national independence and averted a war on the Korean peninsula despite ceaseless moves of the imperialist allied forces to stifle and isolate the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This proves the great vitality of the army-first politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the countries of the world desirous of independence and peace should always hold fast to the idea of giving priority to the army and keep their armies strong.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA on U.S.-proposed resumption of DPRK-U.S. negotiations \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 28 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry on June 18 clarified its stand on the U.S.-proposed resumption of the DPRK-U.S. negotiations and asked the U.S. if it has a political will to seek negotiated settlement of the issue of renouncing its hostile policy towards the DPRK and the issue of compensating for the loss of electricity caused by the delayed provision of light water reactors (LWR) in particular, at the DPRK-U.S. dialogues to be held in the future.\r\n The spokesman for the U.S. State Department, however, said that the U.S. wants the DPRK side to \"honour its commitments under the agreed framework including nuclear inspection\" and it can not find any special ground to make compensation as regards the \"DPRK-proposed compensation for the electricity loss,\" saying that \"It has implemented the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework and will continue to do so.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These are, in essence, nothing but brazen-faced sophism intended to evade its responsibility for the compensation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though the U.S. side makes an oft-repeated assertion that \"It will implement the agreed framework if North Korea honours it\" or \"North Korea should implement the agreed framework as it will honour the AF,\" the reality is quite contrary to its claim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the DPRK has repeatedly clarified, it has fulfilled its commitments under the AF 100 percent including the freeze of graphite-moderated reactors and its related facilities and the disposal of spent fuel rods. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite unreasonable and far-fetched for the U.S. to urge the DPRK to remain true to the AF. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of implementing the AF turned out to be such a complex one as now entirely due to the U.S. side's failure to observe its commitment to provide LWRs to the DPRK by the year 2003. \r\n It is preposterous, indeed, for the U.S. to assert that it has honoured its commitments under the AF. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. side has not yet finished even the ground levelling project for the construction of the LWRs, an article the U.S. side committed itself to implement, although it is nearly seven years since the adoption of the AF between the two countries. Therefore, it is by no means fortuitous to hear the story that the U.S. side is implementing the AF only 10 per cent while the DPRK side has done it 100 per cent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., however, is proposing the issue of inspection which can not be construed otherwise than a broad trick to shift onto the other the responsibility for the delayed provision of the LWRs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The project to provide the LWRs to the DPRK is not making any progress which can not be interpreted otherwise than the outcome of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK. There is even a suspicion of the possible U.S. deliberate delay in the LWR construction in a bid to bring the DPRK to collapse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The keynote of the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework is for the U.S. to provide LWRs to the DPRK in return for the latter's freeze of nuclear activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK held off its plan for the production of electricity from the graphite-moderated reactors in consideration of the U.S. \"security concern,\" suffering a huge loss of electricity. \r\n A scrutiny of the real state of the lwr construction makes it clear that the LWRs are not likely to be completed by the year 2003 and even by the year 2010 far beyond 2008. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK can not sit idle over this loss because electricity is essential for pepping up its economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's repeated call for compensation for the loss of electricity is not intended to pressurize or threaten the U.S. nor aimed to secure a stronger position in the dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Electricity is vital to our existence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If no measure is taken for the compensation for the loss of electricity the DPRK can no longer keep its nuclear activities in a state of freeze and implement the AF. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is responsible for settling this issue. It is also to blame for the delay in the LWR project in view of the former U.S. President's letter of assurance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. loudmouthed \"security concern\" about nuclear and missile and other issues resulted from its hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Therefore, a precondition for the settlement of these issues should be the U.S. renunciation of its hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the DPRK has already clarified its principled stand towards the U.S.-proposed resumption of dialogue, it is the U.S. turn to kick the ball.    \r\n\r\n"

Its essence is, therefore, defined by the aim sought by them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their social movement is aimed to achieve and defend their independence free from all social and natural fetters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Independence is an essential attribute of man who is desirous of living as the master of the world and his own destiny free from all those fetters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history of the social movement is that of the masses' struggle for independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The character of the social movement lies in that it is a creative movement of popular masses to transform the nature and society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their activities for an independent life assume a creative nature. Because creativity is one of the essential attributes of a social being and masses of people always demand something new and have a creative ability to realize it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Society develops thanks to their creative activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n the course of their creative struggle is the process of growing to be stronger. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history of the development of social productive forces is the history in which the creative power of man who conquers nature has grown strong and the history of social revolution is the history in which the revolutionary ability of the people who transform society has increased. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The socio-historical movement further develops according to the increase of their creative ability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This Juche-oriented understanding of the essence and character of the social movement comes to a conclusion that if masses of people are to successfully carve out their destiny, they should firmly maintain the independent and creative stands in the revolution and construction at all times.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
