To this end, it is stepping up the purchase of ultra-modern Stealth fighter F-35 and the introduction of take-off and landing technology from the U.S. and Britain.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Earlier, the Japan government decided to deploy the U.S. interceptor missile defense system Aegis Ashore on the land of Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As proven, Japan's arms buildup being pushed forward under the signboards of \"exclusive defense\" and \"re-organization of defense forces\" is clearly the indication of increased nature of attack and aggression of the SDF.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Due to the moves to turn Japan into a military giant that have long been pushed forward, the SDF has undergone remarkable qualitative and quantitative change as perfect attack forces, after going beyond the level of defending the Japan proper.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This year alone, Japan decided to spend the biggest-ever budget for defense running at 5.1911 trillion yen and even hinted at a budget for long-range cruise missile, preemptive attack weapon, only to touch off controversy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In March, the general ground command providing uniform control over all the ground SDF units was formed and amphibious task force was established as a special team for landing operation under the pretext of \"defending a remote island in the southwest\". All this has been carried out as an extension of the moves to revive the \"imperial army\" system which earned an ill fame for aggression and plunder.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Furthermore, the Abe group is thinking of specifying the existence of the SDF in Article 9, a key point of the \"pacifist constitution\", in order to grant the attack forces legality and provide them with legal ground for an aggression war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts highlight the danger and severity of the modernization moves of the SDF which is dashing headlong into realizing the ambition for overseas expansion and this has touched off serious concern of the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A press spokesman for the Defense Ministry of China at a weekly press conference on March 29 said that Japan's tendency in the field of military security has aroused concern of neighboring countries in Asia and the international community for historical reason and other reason in light of reality, adding its tendency to develop attack means which exceeds the need for \"exclusive defense\" arouses increased vigilance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Russia, too, expressed high vigilance against Japan which is getting keen on introducing the U.S. interceptor missile defense system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present times are no longer what they used to be in the past when Japan provoked Sino-Japanese War and Russia-Japanese War at will to contain regional big powers by force and go roughshod over in Asian countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries should clearly face up to the high vigilance of the international community and should not follow in the footsteps of their predecessors who were put to shame.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The SDF can never evade the fate of the Imperial Japanese Army unless it changes its purport of modernization."
