In other words, they seek to gain an unchallenged nuclear advantage and contain \"adversaries\" by the nuclear strong arm and thus gratify their ambition for world supremacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The frantic nuclear war moves of the U.S. aimed at world supremacy backed by strength are the catalyser accelerating the global nuclear arms race and creating the danger of a thermonuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., the most heinous nuclear criminal, has neither qualification nor face to say this or that about other's \"nuclear issue\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration should renounce their reckless moves to fan a nuclear war and nuclear arms race, instead of raising outcries over the fictitious \"nuclear threat\" of other countries.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's Energy Diplomacy Debunked \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 16 (KCNA) -- Japanese Prime Minister Abe, some time ago, made a trip to Mideast countries, leading a large economic and trade delegation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In major oil-producing countries in the Mideast, he agreed to provide them with fund and technology in exchange for a long-term and preferential oil supply. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard a Minju Joson analyst Wednesday says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind the Mideast junket of Abe is an important political purpose transcending economic issues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The oil resources are rapidly drying up worldwide and the Mideast situation has become unstable. Such being the situation, the powers are locked in a fierce competition for protecting their interests, vying with each other to meddle in the Mideast issues.  Japan feels deeply uneasy and concerned over this. It is overwhelmed with the apprehension that, at the slightest slip, it may lose its voice and influence in the Mideast region and get not a drop of oil from there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For this reason, Japan is craftily scheming to allure the Mideast countries with fund and technology as the bait and tightly bind them to economic fetters and thus draw water to its mill. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Timed to coincide with this, the Japanese minister of Economy and Industry, leading a large delegation of businessmen including energy company bosses, flew to Kazakhstan to discuss the issue of economic cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is very covetous of the inexhaustible uranium resources of Kazakhstan. What Japan seeks is to monopolize oil and nuclear energy resources including uranium and take the post of the leader of Asia at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With nothing can the Japanese reactionaries cover up their sinister intention to seize the major regions of strategic resources under the veil of energy diplomacy and put into practice its aggressive policy of unbridled looting.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
