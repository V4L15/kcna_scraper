The nuclear carrier strike group is going to kick off a naval operation for tackling the contingency on the Korean peninsula together with the already deployed Ronald Reagan nuclear carrier strike group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Against this backdrop, the U.S. brought its B-1B formation stationed on Guam to the sky above south Korea on June 20 to stage a mock nuclear bomb dropping drill. It is blustering that it will let its strategic bombers make sorties toward the sky above the peninsula more than once a month routinely.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It also brought long-range air-to-surface missiles to its airbase in Kunsan, North Jolla Province of south Korea in a bid to strike Pyongyang, the capital city of the DPRK, and other major strategic objects. And it let the commander of the Second Division of its army present in south Korea call for \"scaling up south Korea-U.S. joint drills\" in a public appearance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is just a risky and reckless military move driving the already acute situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of a nuclear war and a blatant challenge to all Koreans and other peace-loving peoples in the world aspiring after peace and security on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What merits more serious attention is the fact that the U.S. is hyping its outrageous military pressure on the DPRK through media, continuously bringing its lethal hardware for a nuclear war to the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This shows that the U.S. military scenario to ignite a nuclear war on the peninsula at any cost has gone beyond the red line and the Trump administration's advertisement for the exclusion of military option from the \"maximum pressure and engagement\" policy is no more than a sly trick to cover up their scenario for a war against the DPRK including a preemptive nuclear strike.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Trump administration should not run riot, thinking twice about the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by its foolhardy military moves. It should properly understand the spirit and will of the Korean army and people to annihilate the enemy and finally conclude the standoff with the U.S."

The designated defence minister unhesitatingly made reckless remarks that \"he would make the battle front proceed northward so that the units can fight in north area\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In particular, the south Korean chief executive talked about \"high-pitched growth of the north's missile provocation\" and said that \"it is possible to have dialogue in case they have strong military capability\" while personally inspecting the test-fire of ballistic missile aimed at the DPRK on June 23. The south Korean puppet authorities and conservative media are expressing this as a \"warning message to the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a blatant challenge to the DPRK's sincere call for defusing the military tension between the north and the south and a traitorous criminal act of joining in the U.S. war moves against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Moreover,  the south Korean regime which was deprived of its military sovereignty by the U.S. is working hard to fight against the DPRK, repeating the word \"independent national defense\", unaware of where it stands.
