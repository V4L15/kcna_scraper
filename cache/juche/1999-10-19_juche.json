They  are watching for a chance to provoke a new Korean war while escalating their military pressure upon the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The establishment of sort of \"multi-party security cooperation system\" is out of question now that the belligerent relations, the hostile relations between the DPRK and the U.S., Japan and South Korea are further aggravating and there are no state and official relations that may guarantee such  cooperation in the issue of security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the Korean nation who should solve its issue in a responsible manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   The issue of Korean reunification should be  settled by the parties concerned independently through  dialogue and negotiations.  In spite of this, an attempt  to build a \"multi-party security cooperation system\" is to  evade responsibility as a party concerned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK will neither subscribe to the projected \"multi-party security cooperation system\" in northeast Asia nor  allow the Korean issue to become an object of discussion. \r\n   \r\n"

They are a natural outcome of the U.S. colonial rule over South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Over the last more than half century  since the U.S. aggressors' occupation of South Korea they have enforced a vicious colonial enslavement policy, pursuing harsh repressive,  predatory and war policies and committing all manner of brutalities against  the South Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   To thoroughly probe the truth of U.S. aggression forces' atrocities and punish the killers  will be the first step towards making them pay for their crimes committed against the Korean people during the last 50 odd years, the commentary stresses.    \r\n\r\n"
