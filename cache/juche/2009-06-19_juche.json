            "content": "Lee Myung Bak's Pro-U.S. Remarks Blasted\r\n Pyongyang, June 19 (KCNA) -- Traitor Lee Myung Bak, while inspecting the south Korean \"Air Force Operational Command\" recently, uttered that \"cooperation\" with the United States would help \"deter\" a war. This is nothing but brazen-faced sophism intended to evade the responsibility for having pushed the situation on the Korean Peninsula to the brink of a war by toeing the U.S. policy. \n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson Friday says this in its signed commentary.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The commentary cites facts to prove that Lee has staged ceaseless large-scale war exercises targeted against the DPRK and pushed forward the moves for arms buildup in collusion with the U.S., crying out for \"tightening alliance\" with it from the day he came to power and has been busy with diplomacy to put additional \"sanctions\" upon the DPRK in \"cooperation\" with the U.S over the former's launch of a satellite for peaceful purposes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A particular mention should be made of the fact that the group of traitors declared its full participation in the PSI, a mechanism for a war of aggression against the DPRK, which was cooked up by the U.S. against the DPRK, thus pushing the tense situation on the peninsula to the brink of a war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such rhetoric about \"cooperation\" and \"deterrent\" let loose by the traitor is no more than a shameless jargon reminiscent of a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\" It only brings to light the ulterior intention of Lee, a wicked sycophant and traitor and confrontation-minded maniac, to realize his ambition to invade the north in league with foreign forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The same can be said of the call made by Lee Myung Bak for \"close cooperation\" with the U.S. while dining and winning with brass hats of the U.S. forces and their wives at the \"Chongwadae\". Lurking behind this is his sinister intention to cover up the true nature of the south Korea-U.S. \"alliance\", an alliance of aggression and war against the DPRK, and reinforce it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nothing is more foolish than the calculation of Lee that he can gain something through such confab with the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK will shatter in a twinkle the \"alliance\" with the U.S. and its promise of a \"nuclear umbrella\" on which Lee Myung Bak pins so big hope, the commentary warns."

partido del gran Lider, camarada Kim Il Sung\" y \"Priorizar la labor ideologica es requisito indispensable para el cumplimiento de la causa socialista\", en las cuales declaro solemnemente al interior y exterior del pais los principios revolucionarios y la posicion firme del PTC para llevar a  feliz termino la causa socialista del Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En el periodo de la

Estado y el pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  A base de eso practico la original politica de Songun (priorizacion militar) y publico las obras \"La linea revolucionaria del Sogun es la gran linea
