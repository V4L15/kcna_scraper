It is, however, challenging the people by making a mockery of their mindset and public opinion, far from atoning for its wrong doings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group's loudmouthed \"adhering to the principle\" is nothing but a clumsy excuse to cover up its crimes against the nation, democracy and reunification and justify its moves to escalate the confrontation with fellow countrymen and launch a war of aggression against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The theory of \"adhering to the principle\" advocated by the puppet group is very nonsensical sophism and theory of confrontation against reunification in the light of its contents, essence and objective. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters, above all, is the \"principle\" calling for subordinating the inter-Korean relations to the relations with the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an open denial of the national sovereignty and an extremely harmful sycophantic and traitorous idea devoid of an elementary view and standpoint on the inter-Korean relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In insisting on the \"theory of giving priority to the south Korea-U.S. relations\" the puppet group seeks, in the final analysis, to leave south Korea as a permanent colony of the U.S. and, furthermore, expand it to the northern half of Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is preposterous, indeed, for the puppet group to assert that it would not promote the inter-Korean relations unless the nuclear issue of the north is settled and regard this as a \"principle.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group’s accusation against the DPRK over its nuclear issue is nothing but a ridiculous artifice to force it to dismantle its powerful nuclear deterrence at any cost and join the U.S. in more desperately pursuing the moves for a nuclear war against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet conservative group's description of the inter-Korean relations which had steadily advanced since the publication of the June 15 joint declaration as \"the lost decade\" is an intolerable mockery and insult to the desire of the nation for reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The aim sought by the puppet group is to bring to naught the successes achieved between the north and the south after the publication of the June 15 declaration and push the inter-Korean relations back to those in the past era of confrontation in denial of the north-south joint declarations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This group is now crying out for \"adhering to the principle,\" terming the bedeviled inter-Korean relations \"proper south-north relations\" and the \"south-north relations put on a normal track\" even though it pushed them to a catastrophe.
