Korean warships fire at KPA navy warships\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 15 (KCNA) -- South Korean warships bumped against warships of the navy of the Korean People's Army and fired bullets and shells at them and sank one of them on the north side's territorial waters southeast of Ssanggyo-ri, Kangryong county, South Hwanghae Province.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This morning again, the enemy infiltrated 12 warships into the north side's territorial waters. They ordered the warships to stage an offensive operation by bumping against the northern warships at 08:56.   The enemy warships began moving in offensive formation at 09:05, deliberately bumped against northern warships at 09:12 and fired some 150 shells and more than 7,000 machine-gun bullets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The enemy's reckless armed provocation gravely threatened the lives of sailors of the Korean People's Army, and a warship of the north sank and three others heavily damaged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The armed provocation committed against our warships by the South Korean authorities, who have aggravated the situation in the territorial waters of the north side in the West Sea of Korea almost every day from June 4, is an unbearable insult and military challenge to us.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is entirely thanks to the high patience and self-restraint of our people's army soldiers that the enemy's armed provocations in the west sea of Korea have not developed into an overall war.\r\n   As we have already clarified, the reckless military provocations by the South Korean rulers are deliberate and planned ones aimed at driving the situation of the Korean peninsula to the brink of war.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean rulers must immediately apologize for the serious consequences of their armed provocations.\r\n   They must not run amok, clearly mindful that if military provocations are continued, they will meet a thousand-fold retaliatory blow. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "DPRK-U.S. general officers' talks\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Panmunjom, June 15 (KCNA) -- As already known, there has been created a dangerous situation  in which a war may break out any time in Korea because of the reckless military provocations of the South Korean rulers in the north side's territorial waters off the West Sea of Korea.    It was against the background of  this touch-and-go situation  that talks between Ri Chan Bok, chief delegate of the Korean People's Army side, and his U.S. military counterpart took place at Panmunjom today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n     For over ten days from June 4, the South Korean rulers infiltrated warships of the navy deep into the territorial waters of our side southwest of the Kangryong peninsula, South Hwanghae Province, and tried to block our peaceful boats from their routine fishing while threatening the safety of our fishermen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Ignoring the self-defensive measures of the KPA navy patrol boats  against the provocations of the South Korean Navy, the enemies called warships of various types out to bump against those of our navy on purpose several times. They went the length of firing bullets and shells at our warships.   The provocations were a wanton violation of the Korean armistice agreement. They were  deliberate and premeditated ones to bring the situation on the Korean peninsula to the phase of war.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At the talks the chief delegate of the U.S. forces side tried to shift the blame for the incident on to our side,  by  claiming our warships first intruded into the waters of South Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The incident was entirely attributed to the intrusion into the north's territorial waters of the warships of the South Korean Navy and their provocations.   The South Korean \"Defense Minister\" and the \"chairman of the joint chief of staff\" huddled together to hatch a plot for the incident. On June 9 they invented what they call an offensive operation through collision and told their warships to bump against the patrol boats of the Korean People's Army on a routine duty. They directly commanded the collision on the spot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The main responsibility for the incident rests with the South Korean rulers.\r\n   The above-mentioned provocations were committed at the connivance of U.S. hard-line conservatives who were trying to aggravate tensions on the Korean peninsula. So, the U.S. cannot flee from the responsibility. Furthermore, the U.S. that has the prerogative of the supreme command  over armed forces in South Korea is now joining the South Korean rulers in spreading the rumour that there was \"southward invasion.\" The anti-DPRK diatribe cannot be pardoned at all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The chief delegate of the KPA side held that the \"northern boundary line,\" fixed by South Korea at will, could never be accepted as only five islets on the West Sea of Korea belong to it under the armistice agreement.   The grave provocations committed on the west sea are deliberate and premeditated ones aimed at igniting a new war in Korea at any cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is an open secret that the United States has already worked out \"5027-98\", an aggressive operation plan for a preemptive attack on the DPRK.\r\n   Under this plan,  the U.S. forces side recently introduced into South Korea AC-130 ground attack planes, FA-18 fighter-bombers and additionally deployed scores of F-15 fighter-bombers belonging to the third wing based in Alaska and hundreds of pilots.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They also put on the alert the U.S. marines in Okinawa, Japan, and a tactical plane battalion and electronic warfare planes in the U.S. mainland. Meanwhile, unmanned planes, precision guided bombs and other sophisticated weapons and war equipment were deployed in reinforcement for the U.S. troops present in South Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It was against this backdrop that military provocations have been committed in the north side's territorial waters off the west coast of Korea and it is clear what they were aimed at.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe provocations with an involvement of scores of South Korean battleships are timed to coincide with the end of the U.S.-led war of aggression on Yugoslavia. This fully reveals the U.S. intention to unleash a war finally.   As he could no longer insist on his assertion, the chief delegate of the U.S. forces side proposed simultaneous withdrawal of warships of both sides.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The chief delegate of the KPA side held that the South Korean battleships must be withdrawn at once because they infiltrated into the territorial waters of  the north side, stressing:   We will fully exercise our inviolable sovereignty in our territorial waters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean People's Army will not in the least pardon anyone violating the sky, ground and seas of our country even 0.001 mm but mercilessly punish provokers with strong self-defensive blow.   We are fully prepared for both dialogue and war. If an opportunity presents itself, we will not miss it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States and South Korean rulers must clearly understand the will of the Korean People's Army,  immediately withdraw all battleships which infiltrated into the territorial waters of  the north side and apologize for this. And they  must put an end to the false propaganda  aimed at misleading  public opinion and take full responsibility for the consequences of the provocations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As he could no longer insist on his far-fetched argument, the chief delegate of the U.S. forces side stood up abruptly at around 11:45 and left the room quite contrary to the  precedent for agreement between both sides.\r\n\r\n"

The Federation of South Korean Trade Unions also held an \"extra national congress of deputies\" that day and vowed to hold a general strike of limited hours on June 16 and go on an all-out general strike from June 26.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Meanwhile, the opposition \"Grand National Party\", availing itself of the public protest, set in motion its president and more than fifty \"national assemblymen\" to conduct street propaganda activities demanding probe into the truth behind all suspected cases including the case of \"inducement to strike\" and an introduction of a special prosecution system in the five central streets in Seoul.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   That day the opposition party distributed among passers-by 20,000 copies of literature carrying the above-said contents, the report said. \r\n\r\n"
