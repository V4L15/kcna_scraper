This sharply reduced the indentation of the shoreline of Yomju County and Cholsan County of North Phyongan Province.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a result, there appeared salterns and fish breeding farms along with a big socialist farm in the nation's leading reclaimed tideland. Thanks to tide embankments seashore farms and villages in various counties are completely freed from the damage by tidal waves and salty seawater and a long ring road linking Tasa Workers' District, Yomju County to Jangsong Workers' District, Cholsan County was built along the strong dykes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The project as huge as the West Sea Barrage in terms of size and the volume of work and equivalent to the undertaking to obtain the same arable land as that in a lowland county required the fullest display of mental power as it was Herculean task to create things from nothing, harnessing wild nature at a time when everything was in short supply.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t President Kim Il Sung matured a grandiose plan for reclaiming tideland on the West Coast while waging bloody battles against the Japanese imperialists and formed a group for surveying tideland when the war was at its height, exploring the path for great nature-harnessing projects for the eternal prosperity of the country. General Secretary Kim Jong Il possessed of the iron will to accomplish the patriotic cause for eternal prosperity initiated by the President visited tideland reclamation sites two times when the above-said projects were making dynamic progress. He highly appreciated the successes made by officials and workers there and clearly indicated the way to be followed by them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the severest tidal waves in hundreds of years hit the whole area along the west coast of Korea on August 21, Juche 86 (1997), the builders there waged a persevering struggle, rebuilding broken sections of Breakwater No.1 between Taedasa Islet and Kacha Islet and Breakwater No. 2 between Kacha Islet and Soyondong Islet and finally relinking Breakwater No. 3 on June 11, Juche 94 (2005) and finishing the first-phase damming up project.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By July Juche 96 (2007) the builders successfully completed Breakwaters Nos. 2 and 4 and completed Breakwater No.1 on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They built Breakwater No. 3 covering hundreds of thousands of square meters with feldspar through their patriotic devoted drive.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to the patriotic enthusiasm and heroic struggle of the builders, such inner network project as installation of draining gates and building of embankment in the middle and lower reaches of a river were simultaneously carried out, turning thousands of hectares of tideland into a fertile land. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Taegyedo Tideland Reclamation Project was finally completed with the completion of Breakwater No. 3 ahead of schedule."

En esas ocasiones, el Dirigente evaluo de altos los exitos de lucha de los funcionarios y los obreros e ilumino claramente el camino a seguir por ellos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Cuando el rompeolas fue destruido seriamente por el maremoto mas grande de varios siglos que azoto el 21 de agosto del 86 (1997) de la Era Juche toda la zona costera del Mar Oeste de Corea, los constructores reconstruyeron trabajando duro el dique no. 1 entre las islas Taedasa y Kacha y el no. 2 entre las islas Kacha y Soyondong. El 11 de junio del 94 (2005) de la Era Juche, lograron por fin empalmar de nuevo el dique no. 3 y terminaron la obra de contencion del mar de la primera etapa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHasta julio del 96 (2007) de la Era Juche, ellos completaron con exito la construccion de los diques no. 2 y 4 y lo hicieron con el dique no. 1 en visperas del 60o aniversario de la fundacion de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea (el 9 de septiembre de 2008).\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Gracias a su lucha abnegada, heroica y patriotica, quedo levantado un solido terraplen de piedra en la vasta area de cientos de miles de metros cuadrados del dique no. 3.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Al mismo tiempo, se llevo a cabo la obra interna como la instalacion de compuertas y la construccion de diques intermedio y bajo, de modo que miles de hectareas de marisma se convirtieran en arrozales fertiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La roturacion de la marisma de la isla Taegye termino por fin al acabarse con adelanto la obra del dique no. 3."
