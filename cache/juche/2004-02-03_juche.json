Ryongak, Mangyongdae District, Pyongyang. They bear witness to the time-honored history and brilliant culture of the Korean nation whose history spans 5,000 years.\r\n A group of researchers of the Faculty of History of   Kim Il Sung University conducted a survey of the area which resulted in discovering 112 dolmens dating back to the period of Ancient Korea and 19 earthen stone tombs dating back to Koguryo and one mural painting tomb belonging to Koguryo and 3 brick tombs. They also unearthed the site of \"Ryongak Temple\", a temple believed to have existed in the period of Koryo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Tile pieces belonging to the period of Koguryo were also found on Popun Rock. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Discovered inside the dolmens were stone daggers, stone arrowheads, stone axes and pieces of earthen jars and human bones and many other relics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent discovery of many dolmens in the area of Mt. Ryongak in the wake of the finding of dolmens in Pyongyang including Kangdong, Sangwon and Taedong Counties proves once again that Pyongyang was the center of the ancient civilization of the Korean nation, according to researchers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Excavated in the earthen stone tombs which belong to the period of Koguryo were iron axes, iron arrowheads, earthenware, a metal scale on a piece of armor and other relics that had been used by the people in that period. The ancient mural painting clearly shows a high level of cultural development at that time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The discovery of the site of \"Ryongak Temple\" that has so far been recorded only in an ancient document materially proves that the temple had actually existed in the area of Mt. Ryongak in the period of Koryo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The new discoveries of ancient relics dating back to different historical periods ranging from Ancient Korea, Koguryo to Koryo in the area of Mt. Ryongak in Pyongyang bring national pride and joy to the Koreans.    \r\n\r\n"

A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry said this in an answer given to a question put by KCNA Monday.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fund is now letting loose a string of sophism describing this crime as \"humanitarian support\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The abduction may be painted as such in Japan, a country whose moral vulgarity and shamelessness have reached their height. But the international community will never tolerate this ruse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK provided groups or individuals with every possible condition for humanitarian support through the settlement of bank accounts or postal remittance or shipping service despite the Japanese government's pursuance of its invariable hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the fund, prompted by its sinister political purpose, ignored such legal channels and secretly took Korean citizens to Japan, thus separating happy families from each other overnight and preventing them from hearing from each other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that the Japanese authorities have talked much year after year about the cases of several Japanese abducted, an issue that had already been settled, the spokesman pointed to the ulterior aim they sought in defending this organization, turning a blind eye to its abduction of DPRK citizens  He continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan, which had brought an unspeakable misfortune and pain to the Koreans in the past, is now violating the sovereignty of the DPRK and adding to their bitter pain in the new century, too, instead of redeeming its past crimes. The DPRK will certainly force Japan to pay for this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities should ponder over the consequences to be entailed by the abduction. They should ferret out those responsible for it and investigate the case, sternly punish the criminals and return victims to their families without delay. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will closely follow the future attitude of the Japanese authorities.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

What is ridiculous is that Japan hopes for the DPRK's concession through the adoption of the bill. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But Japan has made a big mistake. The DPRK Government and people, who consider the sovereignty of the country as their life and soul, will never be frightened by pressure and sanctions of such a war criminal state as Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should be held entirely responsible for all the consequences to be entailed by its wanton violation of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has nothing to expect. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In another interview with KCNA Vice-Minister of Agriculture Hong Myong Ryol said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history of humankind has never known such a brazen-faced and untrustworthy nation as Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It is only little more than a year ago that Japan's chief executive came to Pyongyang and admitted, in a spirit of humility, facts of history that Japan caused tremendous damage and sufferings to the Korean people through its colonial rule in the past, and\r\nexpressed deep remorse and heartfelt apology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But Japan is now threatening sanctions, far from making an apology. This reveals the craftiness and vulgarity of the Japanese-style ethics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will never remain a passive onlooker to Japan's acts of infringing upon the sovereignty of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n I would like to remind the Japanese authorities of the fate of a tiger moth.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
