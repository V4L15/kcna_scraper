This marked an important turn in thoroughly eliminating poverty on a global level and in encouraging the struggle for the development and prosperity of humankind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The last two years' efforts of the international society for achieving sustainable development goals require to pay more attention to fully implementing the sustainable development goals in such complicated situation and to make collective and practical responses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The creation of peaceful environment, the fundamental basis for the sustained development, is a matter of critical importance in achieving the sustainable development goals in a comprehensive way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the deceptive signboard of \"war on terrorism\", \"human rights\" and \"democracy\", the U.S. continues to seek regime changes in sovereign countries without any hesitation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such actions of the U.S. that are rampant worldwide are open challenge to the fundamental spirit of the sustained development goals that seek common development and prosperity of all countries without any prejudice against a particular country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. even withdrew from the Paris Convention on climate change, which is one of the sustainable development goals, in a direct challenge to the desire and will of the international society. This illustrates the negative stand of the U.S. towards the sustainable development goals.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To achieve the sustainable development goals, set to promote the well-being of humankind, first, we should immediately obliterate the high-handed measures of the U.S. including the sanctions imposed on the developing countries and promptly terminate the U.S. measures against humanity and civilization that are trying to destroy modern civilization and plunge this world into the medieval darkness.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the same time, the implementation of these goals should be the process of destroying the monopolistic position of a few specific countries in international monetary and trade system and of establishing the equal, fair and new international economic relations on the principle of fully ensuring the representative rights of developing countries including the newly emerging economic powers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK government will in the future, too, exert great efforts to abolish the old international order and establish the new international economic relations based on justice, equality and impartiality and also make active contributions to international efforts to accomplish the sustainable development goals."

This palpably shows the true nature of the U.S. as the main culprit behind terrorism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The inveterate disapproval of other countries and nations, the extreme impertinence, interference into internal affairs and use of force aimed at regime changes and state-sponsored terrorism of the U.S. are the root cause of terrorism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this regard, the international community should define the root cause of terrorism and every country should maintain sharp vigilance not to fall victim to the \"war on terror\" conducted by the U.S. in rampant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international laws.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a consistent stand of the DPRK government to oppose all forms of terrorism and any support to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK government has acceded to several international conventions on counter-terrorism including the \"International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism\" and \"United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK government will continue to fulfill its responsibility to root out all forms of terrorism and to preserve peace and security of the Korean peninsula and the world."
