Korea\r\n  Pyongyang, December 29 (KCNA) -- The secretariat of the committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland issued information bulletin no. 776 on December 27, nearly one year after the emergency of the current \"government\" in South Korea, stressing there has been no change in South Korea during the period.\r\n   The bulletin says:\r\n   On the contrary, the South Korean ruling quarters have turned South Korea into a wasteland of independence and democracy and plunged its economy into crisis. They also laid new serious obstacles in the way of the north-south relations and national reunification.\r\n   From the first days of taking office they openly revealed their pro-American and pro-Japanese nature.\r\n   The South Korean ruling quarters have channeled huge amounts of money into keeping up the U.S. army in South Korea, though South Korea is in severe economic crisis, and put the South Korean economy at the tender mercy of the United States under the veil of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). \r\n   Bowing to the IMF demands, they have been carrying on \"economic restructuring\" which costs bankruptcy of over 50,000 enterprises this year alone.\r\n   In his tour of Japan in October this year, the South Korean chief executive whitewashed past crimes of the Japanese imperialists. He totally lifted the ban on importing Japanese culture which his predecessors dared not to do.\r\n   On September 25, he sold off the Tok islet, an inseparable part of Korea's territory, and handed Japan great part of territorial waters of South Korea.\r\n   Before taking office, he often called for the repeal of the \"National Security Law\"  and removal of the \"Agency for National Security Planning.\" but soon after taking office he, against his calls, has maintained  them and \"readjusted\" repressive institutions for the worse.\r\n   The South Korean authorities, planning to build 17 new prisons by the year 2001, have suppressed the students and people more brutally.\r\n   Their confrontation moves against the northern half of Korea have been further escalated with their incessant arms beef-up and war drills against the north.\r\n   \"'98 Hoguk,\"  \"Ulji Focus Lens,\"  \"'98 Foal Eagle,\"  \"'98 Hwarang\" and other war exercises have been staged almost every day.   \r\n   The past one year shows there is nothing to expect from the current South Korean ruling quarters.    \r\n \r\n"

They are living examples of mass heroism displayed this year.\r\n   A number of heroes and heroines were produced among officials and worker innovators who made exploits in the building of a powerful socialist country as well as among intellectuals who contributed to the development of science, education, literature and art of the country.\r\n   Among them are officials who have been working at important posts of the party and state for a long time devoting themselves to the development of the party and rendering services  to raising the external dignity of the country and to shoring up different sectors of the national economy.  Also among them are 8 scientists and technicians who contributed to the successful launch of an artificial satellite \"Kwangmyongsong 1\" and ordinary colliers of the Anju area coal complex.\r\n   This is a result of the benevolent politics of Kim Jong Il.\r\n   He leads all the Korean people to heroic exploits, saying that most worthwhile life of an independent human being is to live heroically and become heroes.\r\n   Heroism of the Korean people which traces its origin to the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle has been inherited in the arduous revolutionary struggle generation after generation.   It is being fully demonstrated today when the DPRK is making the forced march of socialism.\r\n   Now, all the Korean people are glorifying their honor in the socialist forced march for final victory, inheriting the spirit of heroes, creators of exploits and models of the times.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n"

At that time, he had promised that he would ensure employment if he took office.\r\n   \"Restructuring plan\" is not only an instrument of surrender to the U.S.-led international monetary capital but also a death warrant against the South Korean workers.\r\n   Since he took office, the South Korean ruler, advertising the ruinous \"introduction of foreign capital,\" has sold off  enterprises, banks, buildings and even land to foreign monopoly capitalists and destroyed the economy as a whole with super-retrenchment and high-interest policies and \"economic restructuring\" program as demanded by the IMF. As a result, streets of South Korea are crowded with jobless people and many people commit suicide, unable to endure extreme destitution.\r\n   If the \"restructuring\" of top conglomerates which hold an overwhelming proportion of the South Korean industry is forced, it will reduce the South Korean workers and people to more miserable fates.\r\n   This is the criminal consequence of the loud-mouthed \"commitments\" made by the present South Korean ruler who, styling himself \"prepared president,\" loudly promised that he would tide over the economic crisis.\r\n   This reality is patent proof that the South Korean rulers are a group of truculent traitors who ruthlessly trample underfoot the vital rights of workers and people in league with outside forces if it is for the maintenance of power. \r\n \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. and S. Korean authorities are to blame for suspension of Kumgang Mountain Tour\r\n  Pyongyang, December 29 (KCNA) -- The Kumgang Mountain Tour, a non-governmental undertaking which began under an agreement between the Korean Asia-Pacific Peace Committee and the Hyundai Business Group of South Korea, is now facing a grave obstacle with the new year at hand as a result of the obstructions of some forces at home and abroad.\r\n   On December 28 the Japanese Yomiuri Shimbun reported that while visiting South Korea early in December, the U.S. coordinator of North Korean policy, Perry, said as regardsg for the reunification of the country and that the Kumgang Mountain tour that  a huge amount of money remitted to the north may be exclusively used as military spending and so the South Korean authorities are keeping the Hyundai Business Group from making a remittance.\r\n   Earlier, a South Korean radio said the South Korean authorities accepted an application file from the Hyundai Business Group on the payment for the Kumgang mountain tour on December 23, but they said it is difficult for them to permit it within this year because it they say will take a month to go through formalities and the file is insufficient.\r\n   What matters as regards the tour is to define the period of the right to use the sightseeing facilities as three decades. When the problem was raised by the Hyundai business group, we made clear the position that the definition is a \r\n   Serious political issue related to the prospects for the reunification of the country, that if the period is defined as three decades, it may disappoint the Korean people who are longin for this reason we cannot approve it at all. We have since maintained the position.\r\n   The Korean Asia-Pacific Peace Committee and the Hyundai Business Group had understanding of this matter and other issues and reached a satisfactory consensus. The historic Kumgang Mountain tour, a non-governmental cooperation work, began on November 18 amidst the expectation and interest of the whole nation. It has proceeded well up to this date.\r\n   With a view to achieving the great national unity, helping even a bit realise the reunification of the country, the supreme task of the Korean people, and realising the desire of the South Koreans for sightseeing the famous Kumgang Mountain of the nation, we agreed to a document on the Kumgang Mountain tour for  realising the non-governmental tour program with the hyundai business group and gave the Hyundai Business Group a document of the  DPRK government guaranteeing the undertaking and made every possible effort for the successful program.\r\n   Mt. Kumgang is adjacent to the Military Demarcation Line. \r\n   The DPRK is in acute military confrontation with the U.S. and South Korea with the MDL in between. Despite the situation we approved the Kumgang Mountain tour program and took other compatriotic steps. We have given full play to great magnanimity and patience for  the successful promotion of the program in the face of the escalating tensions triggered by the never-ceasing provocation manoeuvrings of the U.S. and the South Korean authorities.\r\n   The U.S. and the South Korean authorities, however, described the program as a \"success\" of their North Korea policy. While using the program for their sinister political purpose, they left no stone unturned to block the successful promotion of the program.\r\n   The U.S. President, Clinton, visited South Korea in late November, a few days after the beginning of the tour. He made provocative remarks against the north at U.S. military bases, rendering the situation strained on purpose.\r\n   The South Korean authorities, dancing to the tune of the their U.S. master, brought the situation to the extreme pitch of strain through the medium of large-scale military manoeuvres.\r\n   As foreign newspapers reported and recongnised, the U.S. and the South Korean authorities are putting the brake on the program, clamouring about the period of the tour when the program, based on the compatriotic stand, is smoothly proceeding. The U.S. and the South Korean authorities went so far as to link the payment for  the program with military spending in a far-fetched manner.\r\n   The U.S. and the South Korean authorities will be held responsible entirely for the ensuing consequences of the possible suspension of the Kumgang Mountain tour and other undertakings for economic cooperation between us and the Hyundai Business Group.    \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"
