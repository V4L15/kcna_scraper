Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says this in an article. \n\t\t\t\t\t The revolutionary spirit of Paektu is the roots of the Korean revolution and the spirit of defending the country displayed in the 1950s serves as a powerful mental weapon which helped make a history of great victory in the war of Songun Korea as it means its brilliant succession, the article says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The spirit of defending the country displayed in the 1950s is, indeed, the most precious mental legacy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said spirit represents the noble spirit of patriotic loyalty, a combination of the belief in the excellence of our leader, patriotism, the outlook on the leader and the country. Herein lie tremendous vitality of the spirit of defending the country displayed during the war and truth of patriotism to be inherited by posterity. The defenders of the country in the 1950s proved in practice truth that protecting the leader means the greatest patriotism. Their feats will go down in the history of the country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The spirit of defending the country displayed in the 1950s which was created and given steady continuity under the leadership of President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il is being successfully carried forward as the DPRK has Marshal Kim Jong Un at the helm of the Korean revolution. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The spirit displayed in the 1950s to bring earlier the day of victory in the war thanks to the united might of the servicepersons and people always lives on. They are advancing like the wind, holding Kim Jong Un in high esteem as the center of the leadership and unity and sharing thought, breath and pace with him. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is sure to win the final victory in the standoff with imperialism and the U.S. as there are the wise leadership of Kim Jong Un, Songun brilliant commander of Paektu, and the service personnel and people of the DPRK who are equipped with the above-said spirit."
