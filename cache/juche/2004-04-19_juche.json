These outcries are nothing new to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It considered Cheney as a mentally deranged person steeped in the inveterate enmity towards the system in the DPRK long ago as he�@is the boss of the neo-conservative forces in the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBut if it was true that Cheney officially made such reckless remarks representing the stand of the U.S. administration, this would�@be not a simple matter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has no right to pull up the DPRK, not a defeated country, over its nuclear issue. It is ridiculous enough for the U.S. to�@force an \"irreversible dismantlement\" upon the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has no idea of dealing with the U.S. any longer if the latter insists on the disgusting CVID. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has already made it clear that it would consider the U.S. economic sanctions against it as a declaration of a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is its irreversible stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite understandable that the U.S. can not sleep in peace, terror-stricken by \"Al Qaeda\", but its unreasonably linking the�@DPRK to such organization is an expression of total ignorance and nothing but a far-fetched attempt to justify its hostile policy�@towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Action is inevitably followed by reaction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is seriously contemplating a measure to counter the U.S. off-repeated demand that it scrap its nuclear program first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Hits Japanese Reactionaries' Anti-DPRK Moves\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 17 (KCNA) -- The Japanese reactionaries' moves to stifle the DPRK have reached their height.\r\n As already reported, the Liberal Democratic Party and the New Komeito Party of Japan recently presented the \"bill banning the portcalls of specified foreign ships\" to the House of Representatives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  In this regard, Abe, LDP secretary general, said at a press conference that he would seek the adoption of the bill irrespective of \"negotiations between Japan and the DPRK\". Earlier, he confessed that this \"bill is targeted against ships of north Korea\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries have recently passed the \"amendment to the law on foreign exchange\" through the Diet, thus adopting it as a state policy to apply economic sanctions against the DPRK. Now they seek to expand the sphere of these economic sanctions by adopting the above-said bill. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This clearly proves that their moves to stifle the DPRK have reached their height as they are vicious hostile moves diametrically running counter to the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration. It is clearly stipulated in the declaration that both sides shall abide by international law and stop doing any act of threatening the security of the other side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Foreign reports commented that Japan's perfidy to the Pyongyang declaration was prompted by its deep-rooted and mean policy of submitting to the U.S. This seems to be a proper comment, judging from the fact that the Japanese reactionaries never forget to take umbrellas with them when the sky above Washington gets cloudy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n I t is an invariable wild ambition of the Japanese reactionaries to isolate and stifle the DPRK backed by the U.S. Last year they invited representatives of more than 10 countries including the U.S. to Tokyo and tried to work out a scenario of multi-national military exercises to intercept and search DPRK's ships and planes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' moves to adopt the bill mean a phased escalation of their reckless hostile moves to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are so foolish as to calculate that they can bring down the socialist system in the DPRK by putting political and military pressure and economic sanctions upon it. But this is no more than a reckless attempt of those who are politically too thick-headed to face up to the reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For all their desperate bid their wild ambition to isolate and stifle the DPRK can never come true. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has powerful revolutionary armed forces capable enough to wipe out any aggressors and the potential of the self-reliant national economy that has remained undeterred by the imperialist allied forces' persistent sanctions and blockade for over half a century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK are shaking with the pent-up wrath and grudge against the Japanese reactionaries who are adding to their crimes committed against the Korean nation for the last one century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will take a resolute countermeasure if the Japanese reactionaries infringe upon its dignity and the sovereignty even a bit.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
