It is not hard to guess the aggressive nature of his description. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are bitterly angered by his provocative remarks encroaching upon the sovereignty and dignity of the DPRK without hesitation and malignantly slandering its system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What draws a serious attention is that his remarks mirror the invariable ambition of the U.S. to destroy the social system of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even shortly ago the U.S. talked about a \"peaceful settlement of the Korean issue\" several times. Yet, his policy speech proves that the U.S. seeks to destroy the state and system of the DPRK, still refusing to recognize its political system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From the very beginning of its office, the Bush administration designated the DPRK as part of an \"axis of evil\" out of its undisguised hostility toward the socialist system in the DPRK. It also listed the DPRK as a target of its preemptive nuclear attacks, persistently pursuing the hostile policy toward the DPRK. It was against this backdrop that he made a declaration of aggression against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is chiefly to blame for the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. However, it is describing the DPRK as a \"nuclear criminal,\" doggedly refusing to sign a non-aggression treaty with the DPRK. It behaves so because it is not interested in peace and stability on the peninsula, but keen to gratify its wild ambition to destroy the system of the DPRK by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should think twice over what consequences will be entailed by its groundless mud-slinging at the dignified system of the DPRK which was chosen and built by the people themselves and is regarded by them as their life and soul. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will work hard to increase the defence capabilities to defend its system in view of the U.S. declaration of aggression. \r\n\r\n"
