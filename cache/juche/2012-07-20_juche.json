It said:\n\t\t\t\t\t As already reported, a man who infiltrated into the DPRK to demolish a statue and monument in the DPRK, holy ones for its people, under the back-stage manipulation of the U.S. and south Korean puppet regime was arrested.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His testimonies proved that the U.S. is being deeply involved in the conspiratorial plan which the south Korean regime worked out by putting to use defectors to south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a token of the extremely vicious act of hostility against the DPRK prompted by the intention to stir up the people's mindset, break the single-minded unity and overthrow its social system in the end, a vivid expression of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. rallies hostile elements of the countries which incur its displeasure and prods them to the actions of undermining and disturbing those countries and uses the ensuing social confusion as pretexts for military interference and war of aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a typical method the U.S. has employed in recent years to overturn social systems in other countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is an open fact that the U.S. has a special item in its state budget to fund the conspiratorial organizations against the DPRK every year to escalate the anti-DPRK psychological warfare and the operation to disturb it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The envoy of the U.S. State Department for the human rights issue in north Korea who visited south Korea in mid-June this year announced that the U.S. would offer 10 million U.S. dollars to the conspiratorial bodies active for the \"disturbance of north Korea\" this year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is not just co-coincidental that the terrorist was arrested in the DPRK soon after the announcement. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This incident is just a simple example of sabotage against the DPRK being conducted by the U.S. Even at this moment, the hostile elements bribed by the U.S. are hatching the second and third conspiratorial plans according to the U.S. scenario.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hostile act aimed at demolishing the statues of the peerlessly great persons of Mt. Paektu amounts to the most undisguised insult to the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and the mental mainstay of its people, and physical attack on it. Thus it is a war action as serious as the armed invasion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prevailing situation proves that the U.S. has totally backtracked from the main points of the October 12, 2000 DPRK-U.S. joint communique in which it stated that it has no hostility toward the DPRK as well as those of the September 19 joint statement in which it confirmed its stand not to attack or invade the DPRK and promised to respect the DPRK's sovereignty and co-exist with it in peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently the U.S. authorities are often saying that it has no intention to take any act of hostility against the DPRK, but the situation clearly shows that the U.S. DPRK policy to antagonize its idea and social system and stifle it remains unchanged.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The consistent hostile policy towards the DPRK pursued by the U.S. is giving rise to the evil cycle of confrontation and tensions on the Korean Peninsula, making the prospect of denuclearizing the peninsula all the more gloomy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation compels the DPRK to totally reexamine the nuclear issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Without the U.S. fundamental repeal of its hostile policy toward the DPRK first, it will be completely impossible to settle the issue of ensuring the lasting peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula."

            "content": "MINREX de RPDC censura a EE.UU. por instigacion de terrorismo\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPyongyang, 20 de julio (ACNC) -- El portavoz del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea hizo publica el dia 20 la siguiente declaracion:\n\t\t\t\t\tLa cada dia mas recrudescente politica hostil de EE.UU. sobre la RPDC se realiza en la etapa extremadamente imprudente de instigar las acciones hostiles especiales tendentes a insultar la maxima dignidad de esta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo se informo ya, hace poco fue descubierto y arrestado un elemento hostil que habia infiltrado en la RPDC con el objetivo de destruir nuestra mas sagrada estatua de bronce y el gran monumento conmemorativo bajo el auspicio de EE.UU. y la banda titere del Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA traves de la declaracion del criminal detenido, quedo esclarecida la verdad de que EE.UU. se intervino en esa conspiracion planeada por la camarilla titere del Sur de Corea instigando a huyentes  norcoreanos al Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto resulta un atentado peor tendente a desviar nuestra opinion publica, desintegrar la unidad monolitica y derrocar al fin nuestro regimen, y la demostracion de la politica hostil de EE.UU. sobre la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. suele agrupar a los elementos malignos de los paises que no le agradan y les instigan a descomponer el interior de estas naciones, y  toma la confusion social como  pretexto de la intervencion militar y la guerra agresiva de las fuerzas extranjeras, lo que deviene el metodo preferido por EE.UU. para derrocar el regimen de otro pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa esta conocido el hecho de que cada ano EE.UU. inserta los articulos especiales en los presupuestos estatales y suministra enormes fondos a las entidades intrigantes para ampliar de manera escalonada las operaciones psicologicas y de desintegracion del interior de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA mediados de junio ultimo el llamado \"enviado especial encargado de los derechos humanos del Norte (de Corea)\" del Departamento de Estado norteamericano viajo al Sur de Corea cuando declaro que el imperio ofrecera este ano diez millones US$ a las entidades de conspiracion para fines de \"la desintegracion del interior del Norte de Corea\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo es casual que haya sido arrestado un terrorista en la RPDC poco despues del viaje  al Sur de Corea del enviado especial norteamericano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl presente incidente no pasa de ser un ejemplo de las maniobras de complot anti-RPDC de EE.UU. y ahora tambien los elementos hostiles sobornados  por el dinero de EE.UU. traman otras conspiraciones especiales  segun el guion de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTales acciones hostiles encaminadas destruir las estatuas de bronce de las grandes hombres sin pares  devienen el insulto mas abierto a nuestra maxima dignidad y el alma de nuestro pueblo y una accion  belica igual a la agresion armada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los hechos comprueba que EE.UU. revolco completamente el comunicado RPDC-EE.UU. aprobado el 12 de octubre de 2000, segun el cual el imperio declaro  no tener  la voluntad hostil a la RPDC, y los articulos principales de la Declaracion Conjunta del 19 de Septiembre, segun la cual EE.UU. afirmo no tener intencion de atacar ni agredir a la RPDC y ambas partes firmaron el acuerdo de respetar la soberania reciproca y coexistir en paz.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPese a que en estos dias las autoridades norteamericanas suelen decir que no tienen la voluntad hostil a la RPDC, la realidad muestra que no se ha cambiado nunca la politica hostil de  EE.UU. tendente a odiar la idea y regimen optados por nuestro pueblo y aplastarla a toda costa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido a esta politica hostil de EE.UU. se repiten en la Peninsula Coreana el circulo vicioso de la confrontacion y la agravacion de tension y se dilata mas la desnuclearizacion de esta region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodas las condiciones nos obligan reexaminar de manera universal el problema nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin eliminar primero y radicalmente la politica hostil de EE.UU. a la RPDC, no se resolvera nunca el problema de asegurar la paz y la estabilidad duraderas de la Peninsula Coreana."
