Kim Jong Un called on the plant to remodel the room for education in the revolutionary history into the revolutionary museum so as to convey their undying leadership feats to posterity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He looked round the monument to the revolutionary activities of peerlessly great persons of Mt. Paektu newly erected in the compound of the plant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that the monument was built well and it was the fruition of the noble ideological and mental world of the officials and employees of the plant who are determined to live and work, always thinking of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. He praised its workers for having always remained loyal to the party with signal production achievements.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round different places of the plant to learn in detail about development of new products and production there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching machines newly produced at the plant, he expressed great satisfaction over the fact that its workers successfully developed efficient machines by devoting their creative wisdom and enthusiasm.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The plant has a very important duty to perform for developing the country's machine-building industry, he noted, setting forth the tasks to be fulfilled by the plant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An important task before the plant is to wage a dynamic drive to overfulfill its national economy plan for this year and, at the same time, simultaneously push ahead with the project to expand its production capacity, he stressed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that it is necessary to have in place not only modern machine-processing equipment but also testing and measuring equipment based on the cutting edge technology in order to meet the growing needs for precision machines and raise the quality of products.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He instructed the plant to build welfare and service facilities to be impeccable while updating it and construct a scientific and technological disseminating room as required by the age of knowledge-based economy to thoroughly implement the party's policy for educating all the people to be well versed in science and technology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round bedrooms, a dining hall and reading room of the workers' hostel newly built at the plant, he said that it should meticulously manage and operate the hostel to provide the hostellers with best conditions so that they might not feel any inconveniences in their living.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The supply service is the important policy issue consistently emphasized by the party and if the supply service is proven successful and the level of cultural and emotional life is high, the employees' attachment for the plant and their enthusiasm for production will naturally grow strong, he noted, urging the officials to always use their brains and make strenuous efforts to provide the employees with better conditions for production and living. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed belief and conviction that the officials and workers of the plant would continue to add shine to the honor of being a model plant in devotedly implementing the party's policy by fully displaying the revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu and the spirit of the blizzards of Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then he had a photo session with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Han Kwang Sang, department director of the C.C., the WPK, Ri Pyong Chol, first vice department director of the C.C., the WPK, and Kim Yo Jong and Hong Yong Chil, vice department directors of the C.C., the WPK."
