A nation-wide anti-epizootic campaign is being dynamically undertaken in accordance with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe ministries, national institutions and the provincial, city and county people's committees are bringing the harmful influence of the bird flu and prevention methods home to the employees and inhabitants so as to turn out in the campaign as one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe Central Epizootic Prevention Centre and the provincial epizootic prevention institutions have established an epizootic prevention system in accordance with the world avian epidemiology and set up more than 1,600 watch posts in east and west coastal areas, the main courses of seasonal bird migration. As a result, they are surveying the movement of birds, main propagator, in detail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThey are grasping closely the habitats of seasonal birds to take measures against any abnormal phenomena in time. People are allowed to raise poultry only in yards to prevent them from the contact with seasonal birds and relevant organs are testing excrements of migratory birds and dead birds. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAll the poultry-raising units are intensifying disinfection and control over those coming in the farms and greater efforts are being directed to the anti-epizootic work in the chicken and duck farms where the bird flu may break out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn particular, the poultry are vaccinated against avian influenza in some areas of North and South Hwanghae and Kangwon Provinces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nKeeping contacts with international organizations, we are regularly providing the world-wide epidemiological information and technological data arising in the bird flu prevention work to the epizootic prevention institutions of all levels. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nOn the other hand the State Administration for Quality Management and General Custom Bureau are doing the quarantine work in borderline posts, airports and ports with responsibility.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The association embodied in an all round way the idea of the great national unity which calls upon all the classes and strata to put the demand and interests common to the nation above all and firmly unite as one irrespective of the difference of idea, political view and religious belief, property status and social position. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe foundation of the association made it possible to closely rally the broad sections of patriotic forces including workers and peasants and firmly build up the internal force of the revolution in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThanks to the wise leadership and devoted efforts of the President the Korean people defeated the Japanese imperialists and accomplished the historical cause of national liberation with their efforts, united as one under the revolutionary banner of the Ten-point Programme of the ARF. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBasing himself on the brilliant successes and abundant experience in solidly uniting the broad sections of patriotic forces through the formation of the ARF, the President put forward the \"10-point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the Reunification of the Country\"(April 1993). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe tradition of the great national unity provided by the President is successfully carried forward by General Secretary Kim Jong Il on higher level. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHe made public various works including \"Let Us Carry out the Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung's Instructions for National Reunification\" (August 1997) and \"Let Us Reunify the Country Independently and Peacefully through the Great Unity of the Entire Nation\" (April 1998), thus providing a weighty guideline for implementing the President's instructions for national reunification with concerted efforts of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHe also provided historic north-south summit meetings on two occasions to open the June 15 reunification era, in which the people are turning out in the efforts for achieving the reunification \"By our nation itself\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThrough the history and reality, the Korean people have born deep in their minds the immutable truth that the long-cherished reunification of the country will be certainly achieved only when they uphold the brilliant idea and tradition of the great unity of the whole nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is what he did during the recent junket. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lee Myung Bak group had slandered the cooperation between the fellow countrymen as \"drain on resources\" under the signboard of \"pragmatism.\" Nevertheless, he committed such humiliating and sycophantic treachery as selling off the interests of the south Korean people and the nation during the junket. This is now arousing the indignation from among the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had long sought to impose upon south Korea the expenses for relocation of the U.S. forces present there aimed at realizing \"strategic flexibility.\" In March last the commander of the U.S. forces in south Korea said that south Korea should bear the bulk of expenses for the transfer of the U.S. military base in Ryongsan and its total expenses would amount 10 billion U.S. dollars and that it is the U.S. stand to make up the transfer expenses with the share of the upkeep for the U.S. forces. And he openly threatened that the U.S. would raise this matter at the negotiations on share of the upkeep if south Korea did not agree to this demand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After all, Lee agreed to such demand in return for the \"cost\" for some days of his stay at Camp David. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the junket, he also agreed to open the market to American beef, thus driving the stockbreeding of south Korea and 87 percent of its stock-raising households into collapse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people have termed the total permission to import of American beef an act of introducing \"time bomb,\" denouncing it as a policy of selling off to the U.S. the lives of the people and their quarantine sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Korea is being further reduced to a colony of the U.S. in political, military, economic and all other fields of society by such sycophantic traitors as the Lee Myung Bak gentries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today south Korea is in such disgraceful position that it has to offer land as the U.S. military bases, dispatch to Afghanistan and Iraq in wars its youths as cannon fodder and bear even huge amount of expenses for the upkeep of the U.S. aggression forces and their war moves against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After all, this is the results of the \"alliance\" with outsiders and \"pragmatism\" much touted by the Lee group. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With such sycophantic and traitorous forces calling for the \"alliance\" in disregard of the nation's interests left intact, it is impossible to expect independence and democracy in south Korea, to say nothing of the security of the nation and reunification of the country.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

As shown above, Lee Myung Bak committed in Japan such traitorous deeds as selling off the dignity and interests of the nation only, with nothing to gain from it. He meanly asked the Japanese king to visit south Korea but received only response as good as refusal. This proves that the traitor is not worth even a penny and his diplomacy of offering tributes is unavoidable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lee Myung Bak is No.1 traitor who ingratiates himself with the foreign forces and does not hesitate to sell off the destiny and interests of the nation for them.\r\n The south Korean people and all other Koreans will never pardon the Lee Myung Bak gentries who are rushing headlong towards the road of treachery while valuing the foreign forces much more than the fellow countrymen and colluding with them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The conservative ruling forces of south Korea, who have not an iota of consciousness of national independence, are hell-bent on confrontation with the DPRK, zealously following the U.S. imperialists' hostile policy toward it. Advocating \"priority to relationship\" and cooperation with outsiders, the Lee Myung Bak group is getting evermore undisguised in its moves against the fellow countrymen and reunification. In this way it seeks to totally block the north-south relations, overturn all the achievements made in the era of June 15 reunification and leave Korea as a whole to the tender mercy of outsiders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the anti-reunification forces at home and abroad are allowed to commit such moves contrary to the principle of national independence, it will be impossible to expect either the development of the inter-Korean relations or progress in the movement for independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The inter-Korean relations should be developed on the principle of national independence as this is an internal issue of the nation to be settled by the united efforts of the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation has favorable conditions enough to develop the north-south relations and the reunification movement on the above-said principle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans, who are stronger in national identity than any other people, are fully capable of solving the matters of the north-south relations and the national reunification independently on the basis of the spirit of national independence.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

But it is stipulated in the \"OPLAN 5029-05\" that the U.S. forces present in south Korea can exercise the rights to command all military operations under \"specific circumstances.\" This shows that they can provoke a war against the DPRK any time on their own initiative according to their own decision. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They seek to finally examine and round off the war plans to invade the DPRK mainly aimed to create war circumstances and actively spark off military conflicts in the Korean Peninsula.

Korean Authorities' Unreasonable Policy on Education under Fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 5 (KCNA) -- The South Headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification issued a statement on May 1, denouncing the unreasonable policy on education of the south Korean authorities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement held that the \"plan for promotion of campus autonomy\" touted by the Lee Myung Bak group would not only eliminate the public nature of education and fuel corruption and human rights abuses but turn the campus into a place of exploiting manpower. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The dream, future and even personality of students are being violated under the Lee regime as it has neither correct view on education nor any responsibility for it, the statement added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the sit-in hunger strike for an indefinite period and rallies, etc. being staged by teachers, students and their parents in demand of the withdrawal of the authorities' unreasonable policy on education, the statement stressed that the headquarters would wage a struggle against the said plan of the authorities in solidarity with the south Korean Teachers Union.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 5 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialist warmongers and their followers are staging madcap war exercises targeted against the DPRK while deploying their armed forces for aggression in south Korea, according to a military source. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A nuclear-powered guided missile submarine and guided missile destroyers of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces staged frantic submarine operations and guided missile launching exercises in waters off Tokjok Islet in the West Sea of Korea and areas around it in late April. They have since frantically staged anti-DPRK joint war exercises in the South Sea of Korea and in waters off Phyongthaek and Ulsan in coordinated operation with warships of the south Korean puppet naval force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Timed to coincide with this, a nuclear-powered submarine of the U.S. imperialist naval aggression force conducted frantic joint anti-submarine exercises and exercises of commanding joint operation under the simulated conditions of an actual war in league with warships of the south Korean puppet naval force in the South Sea of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some days ago, an information-gathering ship and a warship of the French navy staged madcap information gathering exercises and coordinated operation with the south Korean puppet navy in waters off Phyongthaek in the West Sea of Korea for nearly ten days with the said waters as an operational theatre. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, the U.S. imperialists let strategic bombers, fighter-bombers and pursuit assaults make long flights from overseas bases to a shooting range in Sangdong, Nyongwol County, south Korean Kangwon Province and fly back to the bases after bombing targets almost every day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A few days ago, the units of special warfare of the U.S. imperialists aggression forces in south Korea and air-borne units for special warfare under the \"command of special warfare\" of the south Korean puppet army staged exercises of calling flying corps, mounting precision attack and providing close air support with the areas of south Korean Kangwon Province as an operational theatre being supported by A-10s belonging to the 51st regiment of fighters of the U.S. 7th Air Force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The warmongers of the south Korean puppet army already introduced at least 30 F-15Ks into south Korea from the U.S. They now seek to purchase 20 more F-15Ks and hundreds of latest air-to-ground cruise missiles to go with them in the coming years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Due to the above-said frantic arms buildup and war exercises, dangerous situation when a war may break out any moment is being created on the Korean Peninsula.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
