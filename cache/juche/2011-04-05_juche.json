It is an inevitable consequence of the south Korean ruling forces' anti-DPRK confrontation policy and part of it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe failure of south Korea's \"policy towards the north\" was clearly proved in the past three years. Nevertheless, its authorities insist on this confrontation policy, persistently refusing to make a switchover in it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is well evidenced by the fact that they still raise it as a precondition for warming up the north-south relations to take \"responsible measure\" over the \"Cheonan\" case, even though one year has passed since the case, and are staging madcap anti-DPRK confrontation and war maneuvers under this pretext.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf the south Korean authorities have a bit of willingness to patch up the north-south relations, they should no longer link the case with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTheir persistence in the case will only show their black-hearted intention to push the north-south relations to total bankruptcy by labeling their fellow countrymen as a \"provocateur\" and inflict a disaster of nuclear war upon them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey should opt for improvement of the north-south relations as soon as possible, squarely seeing the aspiration of all Koreans desirous of improved north-south relations, stability and peaceful reunification of the Korean Peninsula and co-prosperity of the nation as well as the trend of the times. The improvement of the north-south relations and peace of the peninsula entirely depend on the south Korean authorities' attitude."

It was a dangerous war conspiracy intended to further strengthen the cooperation system for aggression on the DPRK with the aggravated situation of the Korean Peninsula as a chance and thus bring about disaster of nuclear war at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThat is why the U.S. has massively hurled huge armed forces and latest military equipment into the ongoing Foal Eagle maneuvers and frantically conducted various forms of military exercises to cope with any possible circumstances at wartime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDue to the U.S. imperialists' war moves, clouds of nuclear war are now hanging over the Korean Peninsula and peace of the peninsula and Northeast Asia is exposed to a grave threat.
