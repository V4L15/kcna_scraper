            "content": "Working Contact for Joint Research into Volcano on Mt. Paektu Held\r\n Pyongyang, April 12 (KCNA) -- The second inter-Korean working contact for the joint research into the volcano on Mt. Paektu was held in Kaesong on April 12.\n\t\t\t\t\t At the contact the north side stressed again that the working contact was aimed at discussing technical issues of pushing forward the joint researches into the volcano on Mt. Paektu and put forth a proposal concerning the timing and venue of an academic symposium on the joint research and a field study and their scope and modality and contents, etc. It proposed adopting an agreement on them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south side talked about \"mode of access\", \"principle\" and \"a phased plan\", while acknowledging the necessity of the joint researches into the volcano on Mt. Paektu. It made an absurd assertion that sixth months are required for a preliminary study and more than two years for a full-dress study and it is necessary, therefore, to hold an academic symposium at the next phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It repeatedly insisted that the north side should pass data on the indications of the volcano on Mt. Paektu on it, to begin with.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After making a serious note of the unreasonable attitude on the part of the south side, the north side explained that if the proposed symposium and field study are put into practice, the exchange of data would automatically take place. It repeatedly urged the south side to accept the draft agreement. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the south side wasted a lot of time, groundlessly insisting that the data on the indications of the volcano on Mt. Paektu be handed over to it, first of all. Then it came out with what it called a \"MOU\" making a long explanation about \"mode of access\", \"principle\" and \"a phased plan\" without any binding force, deliberately throwing a hurdle in the way of discussion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Finding its far-fetched assertion no longer workable and it was held accountable for the breakdown of the contact, the south side walked out of the venue of the contact. It wasted a total of four hours till it received an instruction from the Seoul authorities. Finally it was compelled to sign the draft agreement put forth by the north side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The agreement said that the north and the south share the understanding of the need to promote the joint research into the possible eruption of the volcano on Mt. Paektu and decided to open the symposium in Pyongyang or in a place convenient for both sides early in May, make a joint field study of the possible volcano on Mt. Paektu in the middle of June and discuss specific technical matters related to those events by cooperating with each other."
