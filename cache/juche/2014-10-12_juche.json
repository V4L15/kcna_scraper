Korea Warned against Reckless Acts to Chill Atmosphere of Improving Relations\r\n Pyongyang, October 12 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the north side delegation to the north-south high-level contact released a statement on Sunday in connection with the fact that an anti-DPRK leaflet-scattering operation was conducted in south Korea at a time when the second round of the north-south high-level contact is high on the agenda in the wake of the contact made between the high-ranking officials from the north and the south in Inchon on October 4.\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities have hurled dirty human scum into another leaflet-scattering operation defaming the dignity and social system of the DPRK since Friday.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To cope with the on-going situation, frontline units of the Korean People's Army launched actions to frustrate the operation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Far from drawing a due lesson from the leaflet-scattering operation foiled by the KPA units' operation to shoot down balloons and deeply reflecting on it, the south Korean authorities groundlessly let the south side chief delegate to the north-south general-level military talks dare trumpet that the KPA side perpetrated such a provocation as showering bullets for no reason and this was a blatant violation of the UN charter, the armistice agreement and north-south basic agreement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is, indeed, nothing but a height of impudence, the statement said, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Even the chief executive of south Korea pulled up again the DPRK over its nuclear issue and took the lead in the smear campaign, uttering that \"the north is taking double attitude of provocation and appeasement.\" And Ryu Kil Jae, minister of Unification, who should be more responsible for the improvement of the inter-Korean relations than anyone else, was so ridiculous as to bluster that south Korea could not give up its \"principle\" while having dialogue and the north should show its \"sincerity\", to begin with. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement termed this a disgusting behavior of the south Korean authorities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their persistent sinister behavior and coarse invectives would only prove that their talk about \"regular dialogue\" and assertion about \"proposal for unification\" are nothing but a cunning artifice of the chief executive to improve her image and safely spend the remaining tenure of her office.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should clarify, though belatedly, before all Koreans their true intention whether to mend the north-south relations with their sleeves rolled up after breaking with the inglorious past or to while away time, alluring and deceiving the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should stop the reckless acts of chilling the hard-won atmosphere of improving the inter-Korean relations, properly understanding the sincere efforts of the DPRK to make a new history of improving the inter-Korean relations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As long as such grave provocation as leaflet-scattering goes on, the retaliatory action of the army and people of the DPRK to cope with it will develop into more deadly physical strikes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is still a chance of choice. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should not forget even a moment that all Koreans are sharply watching their moves."
