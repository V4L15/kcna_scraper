He praised the workers of the factory for such spirit of serving people as working hard to improve the standard of people's living. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He made the rounds of the newly built dining-room of workers and supply service facilities to take care of their living as their real father would do.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The signal successes made by the factory in recent years are attributable to the fact that its officials have scientifically conducted the overall management of the factory including production, development of technology and supply service on the principle of profitability in keeping with the principle of the socialist economic management, he noted, adding that it is of weighty importance in speeding up the advance for a great surge for the officials to scientifically and minutely conduct the economic operation and business activities. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed great expectation and belief that the workers of the factory would bring about uninterrupted innovations and leap forward in the van of the drive for effecting a revolutionary surge in the efforts to build a thriving nation under the uplifted red flag of the revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Kwak Pom Gi, chief secretary of the South Hamgyong Provincial Committee of the WPK, Kim Ki Nam and Hong Sok Hyong, members of the Political Bureau and secretaries of the C.C., the WPK, Kim Kyong Hui, member of the Political Bureau and department director of the C.C., the WPK, Jang Song Thaek, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the C.C., the WPK and vice-chairman of the NDC, Pak To Chun and Thae Jong Su, alternate members of the Political Bureau and secretaries of the C.C., the WPK."

This right can never be a monopoly of a few countries. All the countries of the world should be allowed to exercise this right.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters is that some Western forces are applying such partial double standards as slapping pressure and sanctions against those countries which incur their displeasure over their nuclear activities for peaceful purposes.

It invents \"human rights issues\" to use them as pretexts for interfering in internal affairs of other anti-imperialist independent countries and raises them as leverages for justifying its moves for aggression and war against the sovereign states and toppling their governments. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The noisy human rights racket kicked up by the U.S. only lays bare its brazen-faced, base and despicable nature.
