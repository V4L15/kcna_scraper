            "content": "KCNA Blasts Some Congressmen for Standing in Way of Six-Party Talks \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 12 (KCNA) -- Some lawmakers from the Republican Party of the United States recently introduced a bill to Congress urging the U.S. not to de-list the DPRK as a sponsor of terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, member of the House of Representatives, who sponsored the bill, put up in the bill such unreasonable conditionalities as putting an end to cooperation in the field of development of banned military equipment and cooperation in the nuclear field with Syria, insisting that the U.S. policy toward the DPRK should not be based on the hope that it would honor its commitments but based on its actual performance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is nothing but reckless remarks beclouding the prospect of the talks as they are intended to stem the trend of the times toward detente over the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and put a brake on the process to advance the six-party talks and warm up the DPRK-U.S. relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK cannot overlook the brazen-faced remarks made by the U.S. chief executive against his dialogue partner on the international arena, timed to coincide with the introduction of the above-said bill by U.S. conservative hard-liners. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He, addressing the UN General Assembly on Sept. 25, went so reckless as to mention some countries including the DPRK and call them \"brutal regimes\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The renewed accusation made by him against the DPRK was nothing but a foolish ploy to tarnish the DPRK's dignity and authority rising on the international arena as the days go by, which the servicepersons and people of the DPRK will never tolerate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  When judging this as the viewpoint of the U.S. chief executive, one can hardly guess the ever-changing U.S. view on the DPRK and talk about the bilateral confidence, the key to making progress at the six-party talks and the development of the bilateral relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Confidence building is vitally required by the countries participating in the six-party talks as the negotiated settlement of the nuclear issue is a very sensitive political issue related to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and the Asia-Pacific region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is by no means fortuitous that the international community is expressing concern and uneasiness about the moves being taken by the U.S. conservative hard-liners at a time when the six-party talks are progressing and the DPRK-U.S. relations are developing at a certain level. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They invented various pretexts to lay hurdles in the way of the talks whenever there was some progress in them in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nA lot of time has been wasted since the start of the talks. This was entirely attributable to the wrong view of the U.S. on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to pay attention to and ponder over the factors of adversely affecting the progress at the talks and the settlement of the nuclear issue and be consistent in its policy toward the DPRK, though belatedly.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Paektu over the past 60 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Il Sung gave field guidance to the Mangyongdae Revolutionary School more than 110 times throughout his great life, setting it as a basic mission of the school to train reserve cadres of the People's Army and leading it with warm loving care. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Suk, woman general of Mt. Paektu, even postponing the visit to her native place, saw to it that all the bereaved children of the comrades-in-arms who fell in action were brought to the school and a statue of the President was erected at the school for the first time in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il left immortal footprints at the two schools dozens of times since that historical day when he visited the Mangyongdae Revolutionary School to participate in its inaugural ceremony 60 years ago, energetically leading them to effect a fresh turn in education. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Mangyongdae Revolutionary School and Kang Pan Sok Revolutionary School have been developed into reliable centers for carrying forward the revolutionary traditions replete with the spirit of devotedly defending the leader and the spirit of the red flag of Mt. Paektu and model schools for bereaved children of revolutionaries equipped with modern amenities for education and living, the reporter noted, adding that this is entirely thanks to the wise guidance and warm fatherly love shown by the three generals of Mt. Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter called for bringing about a fresh turn in education of the schools true to the Songun leadership of the Party and thus making a positive contribution to achieving the reunification of the country and accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Speeches were made at the meeting.     \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It has such awful virus as doing harm to the socialist way of life. This is because they eye aspects of everyday life of people which can easily be afflicted with the bourgeois way of life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This way of life finds its way to aspects of everyday life of people bit by bit and develops with its roots taken, gnawing at the socialist life itself and making it corrupt and degenerate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historical experience goes to prove that grave consequences will be entailed by the failure to strictly guard against the infiltration of all unsound ways of life by the imperialists and wage a dynamic struggle against it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Bush censuro sin ton ni son a la contraparte del dialogo en la escena internacional. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  No podemos pasar por alto las palabras descaradas del gobernante norteamericano.\r\n�@En su discurso pronunciado el 25 de septiembre en la Asamblea General de la ONU, el gobernante norteamericano califico de \"Poder barbaro\" a ciertos paises incluyendo la RPDC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Esto deviene un absurdo acto para denigrar la dignidad y la autoridad de la RPDC que se elevan de dia en dia en la escena internacional. Por lo tanto, el ejercito y el pueblo de Corea no lo perdonaran jamas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Si es asi el punto de vista del hombre en autoridad suprema de EE.UU. sobre la RPDC, ?como podemos evaluar la posicion de EE.UU. sobre Corea, que se cambia frecuentemente?, y ?como podemos hablar de la confianza reciproca que es el problema clave para el avance de las conversaciones a 6 partes y de las relaciones bilaterales?. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La solucion del problema nuclear mediante las negociaciones a 6 bandas es un problema politico muy agudo para la paz y la estabilidad de la Peninsula Coreana y la region de Asia-Pacifico. Por lo tanto, la confianza de los paises participantes resulta la vida para dar solucion al problema. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  No es casual que la sociedad internacional se preocupa de estos actos de las fuerzas ultraconservadoras norteamericanas que se toman precisamente cuando se logra un cierto avance de las conversaciones a 6 bandas y de las relaciones RPDC-EE.UU. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Tambien, en el pasado, cada vez que se lograba un avance del dialogo, las fuerzas ultraconservadoras norteamericanas salieron con diversos pretextos para poner obstaculos en la marcha de las conversaciones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Transcurrio mucho tiempo desde el inicio de las conversaciones a 6 bandas hasta la fecha sin cosechar resultado, lo cual se debe enteramente a la erronea posicion de EE.UU. con respecto a Corea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Aunque ahora, EE.UU. debe reflexionar de los factores que ejercen influencias negativas sobre las conversaciones a 6 partes y el proceso de la solucion del problema nuclear y mantener la coherencia en su politica hacia Corea.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
