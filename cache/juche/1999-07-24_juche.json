Korean people's struggle against Japan's nuclear arming hailed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 24 (KCNA) -- Two Japanese transport vessels loaded with a big quantity of plutonium were reported to have left an European port and are expected to reach Japan via Korean straits. A widespread protest campaign is under way in South Korea these days.  Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The struggle of the federation of environmental movement, civic organizations and the people from all walks of life in South Korea to halt Japan's sea transportation of plutonium is not just a struggle against environmental pollution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is a righteous and justifiable struggle to foil Japan's move for nuclear weaponization and becoming a military giant, defend the security and interests of the nation and, furthermore, to safeguard the peace and security of the Korean peninsula and Asia.   It goes on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The U.S. and the South Korean authorities are turning a blind eye to the dangerous stock piling of plutonium by Japan, but persistently slandering the DPRK with outcries over its nonexistent \"nuclear threat\" and \"missile issue.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As South Korea has turned into the biggest nuclear arsenal of the U.S. in the far east, the Korean peninsula has been exposed to the constant threat of a nuclear war. To cap on it, the Japanese militarists are madly stepping up nuclear arming. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In consequences, the Korean peninsula will become the world's biggest hotbed of thermo-nuclear war. \r\n   The Japanese reactionaries should stop at once their move to transport plutonium through Korean straits. \r\n\r\n"

It decided to impose retaliatory tariff on products of those companies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nOn July 21 it included South Korea in the objects of anti-dumping duty  imposition and passed a preliminary anti-dumping judgement on the Dong Guk Steel Co., Ltd.
