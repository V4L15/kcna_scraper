            "content": "KCNA blasts Blair's remarks against DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 9 (KCNA) -- U.S. warmongers are now vying with each other in making reckless remarks against the DPRK. Blair, commander-in-chief of the U.S. Pacific Command, is one of them.\r\n He made such a war outcry as calling for \"Strongly dealing with the DPRK\" during his recent visit to Japan. And after flying into South Korea he let loose the sheer sophism that \"North Korea is a state posing a potential threat to the world security.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This disclosed the bellicose intention of the United States to stifle the DPRK disobedient to it, after getting upbeat over its \"war against terrorism in Afghanistan.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fact that he flew into South Korea at a time when many stories about \"preemptive attacks\" on the DPRK are floated in the United States cannot but draw a serious attention and arouse the DPRK's precaution against Washington. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His tour of South Korea is aimed at examining preparations for this attack on the spot and giving the green light to actions to invade the north. \r\n His remarks about non-existent \"threat\" of the DPRK are nothing but a subterfuge to cover up the U.S. attempt at this attack and a dastardly ruse to spread the fiction of \"axis of evil\" which is little short of a \"declaration of war\" against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As historical facts prove, the DPRK has neither invaded nor threatened anyone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. talk about \"threat\" from the DPRK is preposterous and an outright challenge to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The prevailing situation where the U.S. has become evermore undisguised in its military moves, threatening the DPRK by force of arms compels it to get fully ready to wipe out aggressors at a single blow. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK loves peace but is not afraid of a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the United States starts a war defying the DPRK's warnings the DPRK will not lose the chance but wipe out all the aggressors by returning fire for fire.    \r\n\r\n"

The summit meetings and talks are of special significance in the history of the bilateral relations of friendship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the bilateral relations are favorably developing in the interests of the peoples of the two countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il's visit to the Russian embassy here in January is a clear proof of developing DPRK-Russia relations of friendship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are good signs in the bilateral relations thanks to the great concern and activities of the leaders of the two countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The development of the bilateral relations is of weighty importance also in preserving the peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The efforts of the Russian people to build strong Russia and those of the Korean people to build a powerful nation of Juche have things in common, which promises a rosy future of the bilateral relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will as ever make sincere efforts to boost the relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson says that there is no change in the stand of the DPRK government that values the friendly and cooperative relations with the Russian Federation, a neighboring country, and wants to steadily boost them.    \r\n\r\n"

The U.S. is the very one who creates complexity in the present international relations and a biggest gangster state that tramples down justice and truth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The seizure and search of the Syrian cargo ships is a revelation of the U.S. policy to stifle Syria under the pretext of \"anti-terrorism.\" The U.S. moves can never be pardoned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK bitterly denounces the united states for its piracy against the Syrian cargo ships. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-imperialist independent position taken by Syria so far is just. The United States should stop putting pressure on and threatening Syria by base means. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The cause of the Syrian people is just and nothing can stifle it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
