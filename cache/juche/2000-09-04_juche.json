It is watching for a chance to launch a new war after deploying huge aggressor forces in and around South Korea. It is keen on reckless military actions to put into practice the \"Operation Plan 5027-98,\" a war scenario for the second Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is preposterous for the U.S. to try to justify its adventurous plan to establish the \"missile defence\" system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"missile defence\" system for whose establishment the U.S. is spending a colossal amount of fund is not aimed to cope with the \"missile threat from the DPRK\" but to contain other big powers and hold military supremacy in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. description of the Military Demarcation Line that bisects Korea as a \"border\" is touching off bitter wrath among the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S., the main architect of the split of the Korean nation which has lived in harmony for thousands of years in the same territory and disturber of reunification, is trumpeting about a \"border\" at a time when the desire for reunification is mounting in the north and south as days go by. This is aimed to vitiate the atmosphere for reunification and realise its intention to keep South Korea under its permanent occupation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   However, it is nothing but a pipe dream. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   With no spate of sophism can the united states cover up its true colours as a chief criminal who is laying obstacles in the way of Korea's reunification and bringing dark clouds of war into East Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. should face up to the reality, drop its improper attitude towards the DPRK and stop pursuing its anachronistic policy towards it.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Popular education system in DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 4 (KCNA) -- All the children in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea receive eleven-year compulsory secondary general education until they reach the working age and all forms of education are free.\r\n   Education was very poor in Korea under the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Nearly half school-age children were denied an opportunity to go to school and at least 2.3 million adults were illiterates. In particular, young people could hardly go on to universities and technical colleges owing to the Japanese imperialist policy of keeping the Korean people in ignorance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Under this situation, schools at all levels were set up in a short span of time, a well-organized democratic educational system was established and popular educational policies were enforced one after another in the country after liberation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Even under the difficult post-war conditions where everything was destroyed during the three-year-long Korean War (June 25, 1950-July 27, 1953) provoked by the U.S. imperialists, the state enforced the universal compulsory primary education from Juche 45 (1956) and abolished tuition at primary schools. It was followed by the introduction of the universal compulsory secondary education in Juche 47 (1958).           Tuition was abolished at the middle schools. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Universal free schooling came into force at all the educational institutions from April of the next year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the DPRK today children, one fourth of its population, study at over 11,000 schools at all levels. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The theses on socialist education was published on September 5, Juche 66 (1977), which said that the fundamental principle of socialist pedagogy is to equip people with the revolutionary communist idea and, on this basis, ensure that they equip themselves with profound scientific knowledge and have strong bodies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Since the publication of the theses, the country has improved the quality of the universal compulsory eleven-year education and contents of education in general and basic subjects. especially, a well-organised genius education system from the level of common education to the level of higher education has been established to bring talents of distinguished schoolchildren into full bloom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Meanwhile, the country has improved contents of higher education in general in keeping with the trend of the development of modern science and technology and achieved great progress in the education in ultra-modern science and technology and computer science. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The country's overall economic life still remains very difficult owing to the imperialists' moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK and natural disasters of consecutive years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But, the state, regarding education as an important issue related to the future destiny of the nation, has invariably enforced free education and strengthened and developed the popular educational system in the direction of improving the quality of education. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Korea's prospect of education is optimistic.    \r\n\r\n"
