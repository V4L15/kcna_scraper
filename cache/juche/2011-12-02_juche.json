            "content": "Minju Joson revela intencion de \"GPN\" en aprobacion del TLC\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPyongyang, 2 de diciembre (ACNC) -- El periodico Minju Joson divulgo en su edicion de este viernes un comentario individual senalando que el \"Tratado de Libre Comercio\" (TLC) es igual a la condena a muerte para los habitantes surcoreanos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl tratado esta penetrado por el contenido avasallante y vendepatria tendente a intensificar la dominacion colonial y la subyugacion de EE.UU. sobre el suelo surcoreano, destaca el comentario y continua: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa vigencia del TLC beneficia no a la poblacion surcoreana, sino a las fuerzas extranjeras y al \"poder\" conservador y la minoria de plutocratas financieros del Sur de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEntonces, ?por que los compinches del \"Gran Partido Nacional\" aprobaron de modo forzado el \"proyecto de consentimiento de aprobacion del Tratado de Libre Comercio\" que ocasionara el repudio de las masas?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo es conocido por todos, el \"GPN\" esta en aprieto muy critico. Se alzan las voces de los habitantes de distintos estratos en demanda de someter al juicio al \"gobierno\" conservador por su politica antipopular. Por otra parte, tras fracasarse en  las elecciones de alcalde de Seul dentro del \"GPN\" no cesan las disputas entre los grupos bajo el rotulo de la \"reforma\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn esta circunstancia, si EE.UU. le da espaldas al \"GPN\", este no tendra donde apoyarse, \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPues, aprobo en la \"Asamblea Nacional\" el \"proyecto de consentimiento de aprobacion del Tratado de Libre Comercio\" con el objetivo de evadir la crisis de dominacion y realizar la ambicion de retomar el poder ganando el apoyo de su amo norteamericano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras que los traidores vendepatrias colmados de servilismo a los yanquis tomen el poder, la poblacion surcoreana no podra liberarse nunca de la dominacion y subyugacion de las fuerzas extranjeras, sino sufrira aun mas sufrimientos y desgracias."
