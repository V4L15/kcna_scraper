Their moves can never be overlooked.\r\n   He also said there is no just reason and pretext for the U.S. troops to  remain in South Korea now and that the United States must withdraw its troops and nuclear weapons from South Korea at once.\r\n   Turning Korea's reunification issue into a worldwide one is a very timely question at present, he noted. \r\n   The world federation of democratic youth will actively support and encourage the Korean people and youths in their struggle to reunify the country, he added.\r\n   Charge d'affaires ad interim of the Syrian embassy here Bassam Al-Haji Hussein who is a delegate of the revolutionary youth of Syria, and Jose Ramon Rodriguez Sisilia, a delegate of the union of young communists of Cuba, in their speeches expressed full support to and solidarity with the Korean people, youths and students in their struggle to pull down the concrete wall and achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the country.\r\n   A joint friendly gathering with the members of the delegation took place on the same day.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "We cannot overlook U.S. military moves = KCNA statement =\r\n Pyongyang, July 25 (KCNA) -- The Korean Central News Agency was authorized to release the following statement today denouncing the United States for deploying huge aggressor forces on the sea off the Korean peninsula:\r\n   Recently, the United States announced that nuclear-powered carriers including Carl Vinson belonging to the U.S. Pacific Command, some 20 nuclear-powered attack submarines, various types of warplanes and troops were being deployed on the sea off the Korean peninsula.\r\n   It also reportedly decided to issue an alert order to all operational areas of the U.S. Pacific Command including the Korean peninsula as an emergency step to intensify intelligence and lookout for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\r\n   South Korean media and local and foreign public have described the ill-boding military moves as \"unprecedented\" and \"exceptional.\"\r\n   The United States never massed such huge nuclear military equipment and forces on the sea off the Korean peninsula even when the \"Pueblo\" and \"EC-121\" incidents occured and when a political vacuum was created and popular uprisings took place in South Korea. Any situation and conditions on the Korean peninsula donot require the deployment of such sophisticated war means.\r\n   In the DPRK all the people and servicemen are vigorously accelerating the forced march  for the final victory with a high degree of political zeal for the historical election to the 10th Supreme People's Assembly. Koreans at home and abroad are busy preparing the August 15 Grand Festival for National Reconciliation, Unity and Reunification.\r\n   The U.S. military moves are very dangerous military actions which can be seen only on the eve of war. They are an undisguised military provocation and a reckless war declaration against the DPRK and unpardonable crimes challenging all the Koreans' desire for the peace and peaceful reunification of the country.\r\n   It is nobody's secret that the united states would start aggression on and interference in other countries with moving of huge sea operational forces. It is illustrated well by the Persian Gulf War.\r\n   In view of this trite method, the deployment of huge armed forces near the Korean peninsula makes the world people suspect that it is the dispatch of an advance contingent for the provocation of a nuclear war on the peninsula. \r\n   Such military movement of the United States is doubtless an open violation of the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework in which it promised not to use its nuclear weapons against us  nor pose nuclear threats to us.\r\n   We cannot remain a passive onlooker to its wrong attitude toward us.\r\n   This year alone, it has reorganised its armed forces present in South Korea into a wartime system and frantically staged large-scale military exercises in various names in and around South Korea. When viewed with this fact, the on-going movement of huge armed forces predicts that the situation will be rendered more serious.\r\n   We bitterly denounce, in the name of all the Korean people, the reckless provocative moves of the United States to press the button of a nuclear war after tensioning the situation on the Korean peninsula with armed forces equipped with nuclear weapons.\r\n   The situation like the eve of war created by them with this military movement to the sea near the Korean peninsula is designed to threaten with strength the Korean people who are dynamically waging the forced march for the final victory of socialism with the might of singlehearted unity and to check with the help of armed forces the explosive crisis of its colonial government in South Korea which is worsening with the economic bankruptcies  and political confusion.\r\n   Military threat and pressure, however, can never be omnipotent.\r\n   Our people and people's army under a great iron-willed brilliant commander are not frightened by any aircraft carrier or nuclear weapon.\r\n   Their revolutionary stamina is characterized by response to strength with strength and war with war.\r\n   Though the United States avoids fulfilling the unavoidable framework agreement with the DPRK and tries to make up for it with strength, we can never tolerate it.\r\n   When the U.S. wields a stick, we also have the right to wield a stick.\r\n   The U.S. must not think the military option is its monopoly. \r\n   It is a matter of course that when the offender has the right to choose, the victim also has the right to choose.\r\n   The U.S. must stop the arrogant military threat at once, withdraw their aggressor forces and ensure peace on the Korean peninsula.\r\n   The South Korean puppets must not act rashly.\r\n   Attempt to hurt fellow countrymen with the backing of foreign aggressors is a treason and leads to suicide. The anti-national efforts of the puppets who brand the fellow countrymen as \"main enemy\" and beg for help of outside forces will face a thousandfold retaliation and end in disgraceful ruin.\r\n   We will make the South Korean puppets pay dearly for their treacherous acts.\r\n   if the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets encroach on the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK even a bit, our army and people will pour bullets, shells and bombs on the aggressors and traitors even if the earth may break, so as to wipe them out and reunify the country.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
