The 17th-term NA�@should be one for a progressive reform to entomb what is old, a�@reunification-oriented NA contributing to the development of inter-Korean�@relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The forces for progressive reform in the NA should frustrate the�@treacherous maneuvers of the conservative forces to meet the aspiration and�@demand of the people and daringly conduct supra-partisan legislative�@activities helpful to the new policy and the development of inter-Korean�@relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Those bent on turning the NA into a scene of fight for the interests and�@stratagem of a party are a handful of diehard pro-U.S. conservatives and�@their anachronistic folly can not evade a stern judgment by history.�@&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The NDFSK, jointly with the people of all strata desirous of progressive�@policy and independent reunification, will invigorate the struggle to�@resolutely smash the last-ditch moves of the pro-U.S. conservative forces�@swimming against the will of the people and the trend of the times and bring�@earlier a new policy for independence and democracy, a new land of�@reunification desired by the whole Korean nation, free from outside forces�@and traitors. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This shows they are going to extremes in their moves to stage a comeback to Korea and impede the implementation of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have so far resorted to hectic moves to turn Japan into a military power and launch into overseas expansion on the plea of the non-existent \"missile threat\" and \"nuclear threat\" of the DPRK by zealously banking on the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In trying to attach the tag of \"terrorism\" to the DPRK, the Japan Defense Agency is pursuing a very sinister and dangerous aim to justify its scheme to stage a comeback to Korea and attain ground for turning Japan into a military power and go over to overseas expansion by joining the United States in branding the DPRK as a \"criminal of terrorism\". The talk of the Japanese reactionaries about the DPRK's \"large-scale terrorism against Japan\" is a total fiction and a malicious insult and challenge to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Despicable and shameless are the Japanese reactionaries who have invented the fiction of \"terrorist threat\" of the DPRK which has nothing to do with terrorism and, under this pretext, seek to attain their dishonest aim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The outcries of the Japan Defense Agency over \"large-scale terrorism\" and its working out of the \"plan for combating terrorism\" are a grave provocation contradictory to the basic spirit of the Pyongyang declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries should discontinue the foolish acts of obstructing the implementation of the Pyongyang declaration and bedeviling the DPRK-Japan relations, ignoring the demand of the public sentiments at home and abroad.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
