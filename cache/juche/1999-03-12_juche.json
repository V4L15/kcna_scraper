            "content": "Kim Jong Il guides land rezoning again\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 12 (KCNA) -General Secretary Kim Jong Il directed land rezoning in Kangwon Province on the spot again on Thursday.   He learned about the process of land rezoning in the province and expressed deep satisfaction and highly praised the provincial people, shock brigade members from other provinces, soldiers and leading officials for having finished the difficult and vast project in good quality.   As a result of vigorous land rezoning, Kangwon Province has acquired a lot of arable land and can do all farm work with machines, he said, very glad that President Kim Il Sung's wish to free the farmers totally from arduous and toilsome labor could be put into practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He said the world-startling change in the province would enable the Korean farmers to do farming with machines on fertile fields as they had wished for centuries.   He said the great change in the province is a clear demonstration of the politico-ideological might of the army and people wholeheartedly united around the party and the leader as well as the solid independent national economy. It also represents the firm will of the Korean people to build a powerful, thriving state in Korea in the glorious age of the Worker's Party at any cost, full of confidence in victory and optimism and in high spirits, he added.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He called for holding fast to the party's agriculture-first policy and concentrating national effort on agricultural production for its rapid increase, the most important factor in the building of a powerful nation.   He urged all other provinces, all cities and all counties to learn from the experience of Kangwon Province in land rezoning and finish this project in a short span of time. In order to increase agricultural production while saving labor and working in an easy way, he said, priority should be given to land rezoning and thus conditions should be provided for comprehensive mechanization of agriculture.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He called for supplying the rural communities with rational farm machines and fertilizers sufficiently and in time so that land rezoning may pay off in practice.   He called on the soldiers and civilians to unite and decorate this year, a year of great turning-point, with bumper harvest.    He was accompanied by vice-chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission Ri Yong Mu, secretaries of the Worker's Party of Korea Central Committee Kim Kuk Thae and Kim Ki Nam and general officers of the Korean People's Army. \r\n    \r\n"

            "content": "\"Missile issue\" of Korea which allows no concession\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 12 (KCNA) -- The U.S. is mistaken if it thinks that it can \"check\" the DPRK missile development   through \"cooperation\" with other countries, and it should not dream the kind of dream. The \"missile issue\" of Korea is a make-or-break matter of principle which allows no concession.   The spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK made the remarks in an interview with KCNA in the wake of Albright's urging for \"cooperation\" of China in the efforts to \"check\" the \"missile program\" of the DPRK during her visit to China.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He called attention to the statement of China that it opposes any attempt to use the missile issue of Korea in increasing defence capabilities.   He further said:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   It was not long since the U.S. cooled the relations with China down, groundlessly blaming China for \"transfer of missile technology\" to the DPRK. The U.S. urge for China's \"cooperation\" in the efforts to \"check\" the missile program is the height of ridicule and shamelessness.   The U.S. tries hard to establish \"TMD\" system, persisting in spreading the fiction of \"missile threats\" from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt seeks in this to dampen the desire of big countries for multipolar East Asia, gain overwhelming military predominance and hegemonistic position and, furthermore, put the strategy of world supremacy into practice.   That was why from the outset the U.S. moves to set up \"TMD\" system invited a strong protest and condemnation from China and the neighboring countries as well as their deep concern and caution.\r\n   The U.S. deception and fiction aimed to justify its moves to set up the \"TMD\" system cannot go down with anyone at all.   As for the \"missile issue\" on the lips of the U.S., it is a matter which belongs to the sovereignty of the DPRK from A to Z, as it repeatedly clarified.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   For the DPRK, the only one belligerent party of the U.S., it is make-or-break matter of principle which allows no concession.   The DPRK is not a country which makes missiles or stops its development on orders of others. So the U.S. acts of slandering it over this issue and peddling  it cannot be construed otherwise than an interference in the internal affairs of the DPRK and a serious violation of the sovereignty. \r\n\r\n"

On display at the museum are data and relics on the brutal massacre committed by U.S. aggressors in Sinchon county when the Korean People's Army was making a temporary strategic retreat during the Fatherland Liberation War.

This is clearly evidenced by the U.S.'s ceaseless murders in South Korea, he said, adding:&nbsp;\"Crossing swords with the U.S. with whom we can not live under the same sky, we will fight to the end and make them pay a thousand-fold price for the massacre in Sinchon and give vent to the pent-up resentment of the 70 million fellow countrymen.\" \r\n \r\n"

This is a manifestation of a very dangerous, criminal intention to realize \"reunification through northward invasion\" on the strength of outsiders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As is known, at a joint meeting held some time ago we proposed to the south to have wide-range dialogues between the two sides.   This proposal is an expression of the will for reconciliation, peace and reunification and clearly proves that the we has no intention of \"southward invasion\" or \"use of armed forces.\"   We will never tolerate such rude and arrogant remarks of the South Korean authorities who wield a sword against the fellow countrymen who are offering a hand of reconciliation. \r\n\r\n"

The DPRK is considered by the United States to be a biggest obstacle in realizing its ambition for world supremacy.

A \"war plan\" which will serve as a basis for military actions of the United States and Japan is being worked out in top secrecy in accordance with the \"bill on U.S.-Japan defense cooperation guidelines,\" the paper says, and continues:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S.-Japan joint plan review committee held three rounds of secret talks last year through which it pushed ahead with the drafting of the \"war plan.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nInvolved in the committee, high-ranking officers of the Japan \"Self-Defense Forces,\" the U.S. troops present in Japan and the U.S. armed forces in the pacific would review a \"plan for joint operation,\" \"a plan for mutual cooperation\" and an \"outline on common norms and enforcement\" in top secrecy.   Having extended the sphere of activities of the U.S.-Japan military alliance to a broad area of the Asia-pacific region including Northeast Asia through the updated \"guidelines,\" the United States and Japanese reactionaries plan to openly commit aggressive joint military actions by exercising the \"right of collective self-protection.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We cannot but take a serious view of the fact that the integration of joint operations and combat actions of the U.S. troops and the \"Self-Defense Forces\" has been stepped up on a full scale in parallel with the drafting of the \"war plan.\"   The integration of the U.S. troops and the Japanese \"SDF\" is being accelerated also in aspects of command, control and intelligence.    There is no doubt that if Japan adopts a law on emergencies in its vicinity on the basis of the new \"guidelines,\" the aggressive U.S.-Japan joint operation will be a reality.

People throughout the country are out in planting trees. Under plans to create woodland and greenery laid out in line with the party's policy on turning the whole country into forests and gardens they are planting lots of trees on mountains, in fields, parks and pleasure grounds, streets and villages.   Some 555.15 million trees are expected to be planted this year, including Pyongyang poplar and acacia.   March is also the \"month of adjusting riversides\".   During the month the state plans to improve 84 km of banks of rivers Amnok, Tuman and Chongchon and adjust 1,500 km of medium riversides.   Such trees as bush clover will be planted in areas of 6.5 million square metres on banks as part of the work to prevent flood damage.   The state is actively pushing ahead with dredging river-beds, improving water channels and building sluices.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In April, the \"herb-cultivation month\", herb-cultivation farms, herb-cultivation sub-work-teams of co-op farms, hospitals, clinics, schools and neighbourhood units take part in planting herbs on mountains, fields, in parks and even in open spaces of pleasure grounds in order to increase sources of traditional Korean medicine.   In the months of conserving beneficial birds, wild animals and fishery resources, people build nests, arrange feeding sites and shelters for animals and provide good habitat to them in the period of egg-laying and breeding.   Fish ways are made at barrages and dams and researches into raising and propagating beneficial animals are now under way.

The chief executive of South Korea, at a recent press interview with the former chief of the Tokyo bureau of News Week, said in this regard \"the north should sensibly approach the millenium problem\". Earlier, the \"Minister of National Defence\" of South Korea, Chon Yong Thaek, made imprudent remarks that South Korea is ready to give \"technological support\" for the prevention of the \"year 2000 computer bug problem\" of the north's weaponry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean ruling quarters have gone the length of saying that as the north's army introduced weapon system of the former Soviet Union, \"computer malfunction\" may happen and  begging Russia for its cooperation in preventing the \"bug\".   This is nothing but a scream of those who are extremely  terrified at the self-defensive forces of the north powerful enough to destroy any formidable enemy at one stroke, and the last-ditch efforts of a drowning man.   It is not difficult to guess the dark intention of the South Korean authorities who are noisy about the \"computer malfunction\" of the north's weaponry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is intended to create the impression that the quality of the north's military equipment is low and its control system outdated so as to impair the international prestige of the north's army. This only betrays their mental derangement caused by an abnormal way of thinking.   As recognized by the world's military circles, the Korean People's Army is equipped with the indigenously produced modern means of attack and defense and Korean-style command and control systems and capable of coping with any situation with its own initiative.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We are fully ready to teach anyone slandering our armed forces a bitter lesson.   Repentance always comes late. There is no use in making repentance after paying a very high price.   The South Korean rulers are well advised to mind their own business before imprudently slandering others.   It is well known a fact that such serious problems as Y2K problems confront none other than the South Korean authorities. This is clearly evidenced by a recent missile accident, fighter crash and so on in South Korea. It is a tragedy that the millennium bug threatens South Korea which relies on outdated military equipment and control system from the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities are floating the rumour about the north's fictitious \"bug\" in order to shift onto the north the blame for irretrievable accidents to be caused by the \"bug\" in their military system.   It must not go unnoticed that a country said it would multilaterally cooperate with the countries concerned including the DPRK and South Korea.   Whoever is truly interested in ensuring peace on the Korean peninsula should not seek his selfish aim first but squarely see the core of the problem, act with reason and refrain from groundlessly getting on the nerves of the other party. \r\n\r\n"
