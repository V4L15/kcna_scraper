And 1.47 million tons of grain is still short of its minimum requirement. So the appeal called on the international community to give humanitarian aid worth about 260 million U.S. dollars for the rehabilitation of agriculture and health and other fields in the DPRK including more than 610,000 tons of food. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The spokesman said that the U.N.'s appeal for humanitarian aid is a manifestation of the international community's concern for the DPRK for which it feels thankful. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The humanitarian aid rendered by the U.N. to the DPRK in recent years has encouraged the Korean people in their efforts to overcome temporary difficulties caused by natural disasters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK expresses the hope that the international community will continue to render support and aid to the Korean people in their efforts to eradicate the aftermath of the natural disasters and bring the people's living to normal in response to the U.N. appeal for humanitarian assistance. \r\n The DPRK will continue to closely cooperate with the world food program and other U.N. organizations, non-governmental organizations and donor countries which are offering humanitarian aid to the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"

And it should be reformed so that those countries, which can speak for the will of developing countries that have been neglected at the UN in the past, may be elected SC member states according to the unanimous agreement of the UN member states. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The UN should play a leading role in solving the issue of terrorism which is now being hotly debated in the international arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It should never be allowed to label those countries calling for equal sovereignty as \"terrorism-sponsor states\" and to infringe upon sovereignty with unilateral military interference and sanctions and inflict untold pain upon people, allegedly to oppose terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any war killing innocent civilians or harassing regional situation and stability cannot be justified in combating terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the DPRK principled and consistent position to oppose all forms of terrorism and any support to it, the article declares, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Arbitrariness of some forces behaving like international police in dealing with international disputes is a dangerous one that may degrade the un prestige and, furthermore, reduce the UN to a mere name. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will discharge its noble mission and duty as a UN member state and make positive efforts to enhance the UN role in the international arena as in the past.    \r\n\r\n"

They ransacked the Chongryon central headquarters, while groundlessly linking this issue with the Chongryon central standing committee.\r\n The Japanese authorities have full responsibility and obligation under the international law to legally guarantee Chongryon's activities and respect the democratic national rights of the Koreans in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the Japanese authorities groundlessly pulled up Chongryon, the dignified organization of overseas citizens of the DPRK, and ransacked its central headquarters. This is a high-handed criminal act and an intentional political suppression of Chongryon and Korean residents in Japan, which can never be justified. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities are recklessly suppressing the Koreans in Japan, the direct victims of Japan's forcible drafting in the period of its occupation of Korea, and Chongryon, their legitimate organization, though they have not yet redressed its crime-woven past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is, in fact, a double crime. This was the first undisguised political suppression since the formation of Chongryon and the campaign was launched at a time when Japan is putting its ambition for overseas expansion into practice in real earnest taking advantage of the anti-terror war. The DPRK cannot but follow this development with particular vigilance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The suppression of Chongryon constitutes an infringement upon the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will never tolerate the outrageous acts of antagonizing and slandering it and any violation of the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK and Chongryon but will strongly react to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities should stop at once the political suppression of Chongryon, make an apology for it and unconditionally and immediately release the unreasonably arrested people.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
