In south Korea all social life, ranging from the mode of politics, the language, written and spoken, to the way of life, has been Americanized, Japanized and westernized, foreign forces are lording it over, and the national character and dignity are being wantonly violated and obliterated.\r\n   The soul of the nation and beautiful manners and customs are now vanishing root and branch in south Korea.\r\n   Kim Young Sam's clamour for \"internationalisation\" and \"globalisation\" brings profits to foreign forces and comprador businesses and does harm to the south Korean people.\r\n   Indelible is the crime of Kim Young Sam justifying outside domination and plunder of south Korea with clamour for \"internationalisation\" and \"globalisation\" and remaining in power with outside backing. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
