It was brought to Pyongyang from Wonsan and is now anchored in the River Taedong just in front of the monument to the sinking of the U.S. pirate ship \"General Sherman.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The hearts of the visitors are burning with hatred against the U.S. aggressors and the determination to take revenge upon them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Ri Tong Sop, a collier of the Kujang United Coal Mine, said that if the U.S. invade this land again, oblivious of the lesson in the past, the Korean people will not pardon them but throw them into the sea to the last one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Ri Hung Gyong, a member of the Kuup co-op farm, Thongchon county, Kangwon Province, said: It seems that the yankees who were hit hard by the capture of \"Pueblo,\" have not yet come to their senses.  The U.S. should stop acting rashly, aware that our strike is merciless, he added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Song Il, an officer of the KPA, had this to say: \"At that time only one spy ship was captured but in future, the whole land of the U.S. will be destroyed if it invades us again.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Foreign delegations on visit to our country are invited to see \"Pueblo.\" \r\n\r\n"

This is evidenced by the fact that the U.S. is escalating its military moves against the DPRK, refusing to pull back its forces from South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is clamoring about peace, having deployed huge aggressor forces in South Korea and staged madcap war exercises targeted against the north. This is an ostrich policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is opposed to the establishment of peace mechanism, one of the important conditions for defusing tensions and ensuring peace on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Armistice Agreement provides for temporary cease-fire only, not lasting peace. It should be replaced by new peace mechanism if war is to be averted and lasting peace ensured on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A signatory to the Korean armistice agreement, the U.S. can never flee from its responsibility for the signing of a peace agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Pointing to the U.S. effort to justify its aggressive policy towards the DPRK on the absurd pretext of \"military threat\" from it, the article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is expanding the sphere of its domination,  escalating its war of aggression against anti-imperialist, independent countries. The DPRK is made the next target of its aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the U.S. continues to pursue its policy to stifle the DPRK, going against the trend of the times, it will meet only defeat and death in face of our retaliation. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "S. Korean rulers denounced for shielding American murderers\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 12 (KCNA) -- Yun Song Sik, permanent member of the Consultative Council of Former South Korean Politicians in the North for the Promotion of Peaceful Reunification, in his interview with KCNA on November 11 condemned the South Korean rulers for covering up the atrocities committed by GIs in South Korea for many years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Recalling that American massacres in Chilgok, Riri, Masan, Uiryong, Haman and Tanyang were brought to light one after another in the wake of AP disclosure of GIs' massacre in Rogun-ri, he said: The so-called \"people's government\" is hell bent on protecting the U.S., its master, lending a deaf ear to the protest of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The present chief executive talked nonsense that a probe can be conducted into the accusations of killing made against GIs but in a way \"not to harm the friendly relations with the U.S.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The successive rulers of South Korea have been keen on protecting the criminals of the U.S. forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   According to data available, the number of cases of atrocities committed by GIs in South Korea for the last 54 years since 1945 reached more than 100,000. This means 2,000 cases on annual average. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Yun cited a few examples of what he witnessed or heard before his coming over to the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As already reported, in late October, 1992, a U.S. soldier belonging to the U.S. second infantry division raped a woman called Yun Kum I residing in Tongduchon, Kyonggi Province, and struck her on the head with a weapon, killing her. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Moreover, the killer thrust a glass bottle into her womb and an umbrella holder into her anus. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   These shuddering brutalities are disclosed one month or three months or half a year or a year after their occurrence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   When a U.S. soldier named Steven strangled a woman called Ri Ki Sun to death after failing to rape her in Tongduchon in September, 1996, the South Korean authorities could not utter even a word in protest against the atrocity but clinched the case under the name of \"prosecution without detention.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is only part of the U.S. outrage and servile attitude of the South Korean authorities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In February, 1995, the South Korean police office received a letter of request from the U.S. forces command demanding a strict news blackout regarding GIs' crimes and conveyed it to 13 local \"police offices\" across South Korea, instructing them to carry it out, as requested. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is by no means accidental that the South Korean rulers are working hard to cover up GIs' massacres in Rogun-ri and other areas on the pretext of \"friendly relations with the U.S.,\" Yun said, and stressed: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities' act of shielding the criminals of the U.S. forces in South Korea is an unpardonable treachery. \r\n\r\n"
