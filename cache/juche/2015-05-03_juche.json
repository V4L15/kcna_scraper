            "content": "Kim Jong Un Visits Newly-built General Satellite Control and Command Centre\r\nPyongyang, May 3 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, first chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army (KPA), inspected the newly-built General Satellite Control and Command Centre of the National Aerospace Development Administration (NADA).\n\t\t\t\t\t The successful construction of the centre as a monumental edifice in the era of the Workers' Party provided a solid springboard for continued launch of various working satellites essential for the country's sci-tech and economic development and national defence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Commanding a panoramic view of the centre with a broad smile on his face, Kim Jong Un said with great pleasure that it is a splendid edifice, fresh and peculiar in style.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe went to the room for the education in the revolutionary history at the centre. The great Generalissimo Kim Jong Il is a peerless patriot who ushered in the new history of space development and brought about the greatest event of satellite launch in the Korean nation's history of 5,000 years, he said, adding: We should dynamically conduct a drive of breaking through the cutting edge with intense loyalty and noble sense of moral obligation to further glorify the DPRK as a space power and thus hand down the undying feats of the Generalissimo to posterity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then he went round different parts of the centre to learn in detail about its construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He noted that the main room for real-time display of satellite launch, auxiliary display and control room and optical observation room were splendidly built to meet the scientific and technological requirements and the visitor's room is very convenient to watching satellite launch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t E-library, lounge, conference room, offices, dinning room and bedrooms are well built to provide the scientists and technicians with enough conditions for their research and living, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He called for putting all the facilities of the centre on a more scientific and modern basis and preferentially treating the space developers and taking warm care of their work and life in order to fully ensure the manufacture, launch and control of working satellites.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed the need to provide more cutting-edge facilities for the centre, build a base in which satellite test can be done in the same circumstances with outer space and erect something symbolic of the centre.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The site of the centre is not so high above sea level but it is the most dominant in the world as it comprehensively represents the dignity of the Korean nation, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He gave thanks in the name of the KPA supreme commander to the servicepersons of KPA Unit 963 for having successfully built the center.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has developed into a full-fledged satellite manufacturer and launcher, he noted, saying: Peaceful space development is an option taken by our Party and people and a legitimate right of Songun Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The status of the DPRK as a satellite producer-launcher remains unchanged though the hostile forces deny it and its space development can never be abandoned, no matter who may oppose, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Satellites of Juche Korea will as ever be launched into outer space at the time and locations set by the Party Central Committee, he added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed great expectation and belief that the scientists and technicians of the NADA would bring about a fresh turn in space scientific research and satellite launch."
