He highly appreciated the achievements made by the university, saying that the university, a \"pedigree\" establishment for training naval cadres, has a long history and glorious tradition as it has greatly contributed to accomplishing the Juche-based cause of army building by training competent naval commanding officers fully prepared politically and ideologically and in military technique including dozens of heroes of the Republic and labor heroes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The President had made indefatigable efforts and devoted all his wisdom to building a modern naval force till the last moments of his life since right after the liberation of the country, Kim Jong Il noted, adding: As a result, the Korean people, who had no warship to defend their country and seas for a long period, came to have a-match-for-a hundred powerful navy capable of beating back any formidable enemy's invasion at a single strike. The immortal revolutionary feats the President performed in building the navy will shine forever in the history of the country, he stressed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He acquainted himself in detail with the education, making the rounds of various rooms of the combined military research centre modernly furnished to give sufficient military education as required by a modern warfare.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the navy of the DPRK, a maritime country surrounded by seas on three sides, has a particularly important role to play not only at present but in the future, he advanced highly important tasks which would serve as guidelines for further bolstering up the naval force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then he looked round various places of the university and took warm care of the education and living of its students as their real father would do. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He noted with great satisfaction that Candidate Academician, Prof. and Dr. Pak Wan Ju and other teachers of the university have worked with all their revolutionary enthusiasm and wisdom at the military educational institution for years, training many competent commanding officers firmly equipped with Juche-based war methods. He appreciated their efforts and extended warm regards to them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by KPA Vice Marshal Kim Yong Chun, minister of the People's Armed Forces, KPA General Ri Yong Ho, chief of the General Staff of the KPA, KPA General Kim Jong Gak, first vice director of the General Political Bureau of the KPA, and other commanding officers of the army."

Through the activities of a unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai right after liberation the drama teaches a serious lesson that it is impossible to defend even the triumphant revolution when infected with \"sweet-smelling trend\" of capitalism and truth of history that if one is to make a revolution, one should have transparent working class awareness and should never lay down the weapon of the class struggle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t President Kim Il Sung appreciated the drama twice with Premier Zhou Enlai during his historic visits to China and made sure that it was created and performed in Korea, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il gave instructions to the State Theatrical Troupe to recreate the drama and briskly perform it this year, the \"year of the DPRK-China friendship\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The drama was acclaimed by the audience for rich ideological contents and high artistry. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He highly appreciated the successful performance and extended thanks to all creators and artistes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Noting that a drama, one of the forms of art with a long history, serves as an important means for the ideological and emotional education of people, he set forth highly important tasks which would serve as guidelines for the troupe's art creation and performing activities. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the unchangeable will of the WPK and people to develop and consolidate the long-standing precious DPRK-China friendship provided by the President and the leaders of the elder generation of China, he noted, stressing that cultural and art exchange plays an important role in promoting the friendship between the two peoples. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Among the audience were Vice Marshal of the KPA Kim Yong Chun, minister of the People's Armed Forces, KPA General Ri Yong Ho, chief of the General Staff of the KPA, KPA General Kim Jong Gak, first vice director of the General Political Bureau of the KPA, and other commanding officers of the KPA, Thae Jong Su, chief secretary of the South Hamgyong Provincial Committee of the WPK, Choe Thae Bok and Kim Ki Nam, secretaries of the C.C., the WPK, department directors of the C.C., the WPK, Kang Sok Ju, first vice-minister of Foreign Affairs, and other leading officials."

This brought the SDF's nature of continental aggression into bolder relief. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has become obvious that Japan is seeking a war, not peace and keen to achieve its aim in the near future. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries would be well advised to stop ballyhooing about \"threat\" from someone, which can convince no one but roll back at once their policy of overseas aggression bound to lead to self-destruction."

            "content": "Consciousness of Being Master of Land\r\n Pyongyang, August 12 (KCNA) -- It was in March Juche 35 (1946) when Kim Jong Suk, an anti-Japanese heroine, visited a rural village in Taedong County, South Phyongan Province.\n\t\t\t\t\t Then peasants told their joy of land distribution to her who sowed seed and unreservedly conversed with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At that time someone asked her if they could become the master of the land forever, with uneasiness at the rumor that they should give up the land again.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She said that it was a false rumor spread by the liquidated landlords whose land was confiscated, the peasants became the master of land forever and no one could rob them again of the land distributed by President Kim Il Sung.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Telling impressively them the story about the people in the guerrilla bases who had fought in defence of the land during the anti-Japanese armed struggle, she said to the following effect: The more desperately the enemy tries, the more firmly we should unite around General Kim Il Sung to defend the land distributed by him to the end and to lay a solid foundation for nation-building by doing farming well. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through her speech, they clearly realized that the question whether the peasants become the permanent master of land or they are deprived of the land by the enemy entirely depends on themselves."
