In February this year the joint meeting of the DPRK government, political parties and organizations proposed to repeal the evil law as one of the three priorities for inter-Korean dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Countries in Asia, Europe, Africa and other regions and international organizations issued statements, messages and resolutions for the repeal of the \"security law\" Even the U.S. government is crying for its repeal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is a shame and misfortune of the nation that such a medieval evil law as the \"security law\" still remains in force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities still refuse to totally abrogate the law, engaging themselves in partial \"revision\" such as changing a few phraseologies when the 20th century is drawing to the end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is an unpardonable mockery of and challenge to the people at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The medieval \"security law\" of South Korea must unconditionally be abolished at once.  \r\n\r\n"

This is a very regrettable thing which is contrary to the aspiration and desire of the peoples of Korea and Japan, we think. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Recently voices crying for the liquidation of the unfavorable past and improvement of relations between the two countries are ringing out from Japan. Statesmen should not turn their back on this. It is a good thing that the delegation of Japanese political parties came to our country in the hope to improve DPRK-Japan relations at the end of the 1900s, we think. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the invariable desire of the peoples of the two countries to make a clean sheet of the past unhappy history between them and develop relations of good neighbourhood and friendship on the principle of independence, equality, non-interference in other's internal affairs and reciprocity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Tomiichi Murayama said in his speech that abnormal relations between Japan and Korea have existed for more than 50 years since the second world war and that there are great many hurdles in the bilateral relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He said Japan and Korea are neighbors separated each other by a thin strip of water, adding that they came to Pyongyang with a will to work toward the improved atmosphere between Japan and Korea and create an environment for full-dress authority-to-authority dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He expressed hope that their visit would be the first step forward for the establishment of new relations of trust between the two countries. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
