More than 2 million people from all walks of life participated in the resistance for three months since its start and at least 3,200 demonstrations and riots took place by the end of that year, he added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Koreans' ardent desire for the national sovereignty and independence could be achieved as President Kim Il Sung led the struggle for national liberation to victory, he said, adding that the great revolutionary exploits of the President who established the most advantageous Korean-style socialist system centering on the popular masses and illuminated the road of national reunification will be immortal in the history of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The revolutionary cause of Juche pioneered by the President is being successfully carried forward by General Secretary Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il formulated the President's revolutionary idea as the integral system of ideology, theory and method of Juche in his early days and declared the modeling of the whole society on the Juche idea as the greatest programme of our party and has wisely led the revolution and construction for a long period in keeping with the idea and intention of the President.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il has trained the People's Army into invincible revolutionary army of Mt. Paektu and turned the DPRK into invincible power through his seasoned and experienced Songun leadership and thus ushered in a new era of prosperity of Songun Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to his noble intention and will, the three principles of national reunification, the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation and the proposal for founding the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo advanced by the President were formulated as the three charters for national reunification. And the five-point policy of the great unity of the nation, the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration and other landmarks of reunification common to the nation were provided and all Koreans could dynamically advance along the road of independent reunification under the banner of \"By our nation itself.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We are facing weighty and urgent tasks to build a great prosperous powerful socialist nation of Juche and accomplish the historic cause of national reunification, the cherished desire of the nation, as soon as possible under the Songun revolutionary leadership of Kim Jong Il, said the reporter, elaborating:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Koreans and all other Koreans from all walks of life at home and abroad should wage dynamic struggle to reject dependence on foreign forces and defend sovereignty of the nation and thus mete out stern punishment to the group of traitors keen on serving outsiders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will never tolerate the treachery of the south Korean conservative authorities hell-bent on escalating confrontation with fellow countrymen in collusion with outsiders in utter disregard of the destiny of the country and the nation but mercilessly punish the group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should immediately stop anachronistic anti-DPRK racket and reckless moves for a war of aggression against the DPRK, stop hindering peace and reunification of Korea and withdraw its aggression forces from south Korea at once taking with them war means.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. warlike forces opt for reckless military confrontation and provocation of a war of aggression against the DPRK, defying the repeated warnings issued by it and its principled stand, the latter will mercilessly stamp out aggressors with powerful Songun arms which know neither mercy nor forgiveness and achieve the historic cause of national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Should the Japanese reactionaries persistently maintain hostile policy toward the DPRK and the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan and the moves to stage a comeback to Korea, quite contrary to the just requirements of the Korean nation and the times, the army and people of the DPRK will give vent to their pent-up hatred and wrath and certainly force Japan to pay a high price.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe reporter called upon all the people to more strenuously struggle for the prosperity of the socialist country, the accomplishment of the revolutionary cause of Juche and the independent and peaceful reunification of the country, rallied close around the headquarters of the revolution headed by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tKim Jong Il."
