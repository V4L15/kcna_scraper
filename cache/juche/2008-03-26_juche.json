Failure to achieve unity would give foreign forces a pretext for interfering in its internal affairs. Whenever there was a sign of favorable development of the north-south relations there broke out a variety of cases in the past, throwing hurdles in the way of the struggle to accomplish the cause of reunification. This was attributable to outside forces' plots and tricks. Even today when the June 15 joint declaration is in the process of implementation the U.S. is still standing in the way of the Koreans' struggle for independent reunification, displeased with Korea's reunification. This is evidenced by the madcap Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military exercises staged by the U.S. imperialists in collusion with the south Korean warmongers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"By our nation itself\" serves as an engine for accelerating the movement for independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans have achieved great successes in the efforts to improve the inter-Korean relations and develop the reunification movement under the uplifted banner of \"By our nation itself\" over the past several years. The idea of \"By our nation itself\" was accepted by all Koreans and a series of substantial projects were undertaken to embody it in the reunification movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When all Koreans at home and abroad enshrine the idea of \"By our nation itself,\" a sure guarantee for accomplishing the cause of independent reunification, as their faith and embody it, the moves of the foreign forces against reunification and for confrontation and war are bound to go bust and the movement for independent reunification will make a more dynamic advance.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In the meantime some American politicians are letting loose all kinds of nonsensical lies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on the fact, a news analyst of Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says that Bush's labeling the DPRK as \"rogue state\" revealed his chronic hostile attitude towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is more preposterous is that the U.S. has justified its scheme to build missile shield in Europe under the pretext of \"threat\" from the DPRK, the analyst says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has not turned against European countries and will never do. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. is persistently spreading the fictitious rumor about \"threat from north Korea\" without any scientific evidence or authenticity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this course it is trying to make a pretext and ground to justify its moves for bolstering nuclear and missile armament and building missile network worldwide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' sinister intention is to militarily surround and contain big powers and realize their ambition for world supremacy with military edge by building missile shields in Northeast Asia and Europe under the pretext of \"threat\" from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another one of their major aims is to prolong the U.S. military presence in south Korea. By doing so, the U.S. authorities intend to delay the settlement of the nuclear issue and other pending issues between the DPRK and the U.S. for an indefinite period and ignite a war against the DPRK at any time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the U.S. is vociferating about \"threat from north Korea\" more loudly than ever before, the Korean people will bolster their counteraction with heightened vigilance toward it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
