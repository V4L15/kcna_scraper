The workers of the complex have changed its appearance as required by the new century under so difficult conditions by fully displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance in response to the slogan \"When the Party is determined we can do anything!\", making it possible to give fuller play to the might of the Juche-based industry, he said, adding that this signal success clearly proves the inexhaustible mental power of the Korean people ready to flatten even thousands of mountains when called for by the party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He set forth tasks to be carried out by the complex, noting that the position and role of the complex are very important for the building of a great prosperous and powerful nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  When the second-phase project for technological updating of the complex is completed, it will have all processes for turning out varieties of goods with intermediary vinalon produce, making it possible to bring about a signal turn in the chemical industry, he noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He praised the workers of the complex for conducting a bold and big operation for setting up new processes with a loyal determination to glorify the leadership exploits of President Kim Il Sung, the founder of the vinalon industry, down through generations and showed such profound loving care for them as personally unraveling knotty problems.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The complex can complete the second-phase project for technological updating in a brief span of time as it has workers intensely loyal to the party and the revolution, the existing solid economic foundation and ranks of able technicians, he said, indicating the orientation and ways to do so.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The second leg of his guidance was the Ryongsong Machine Complex.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round a compressor shop, an iron casting shop now under construction and other production processes, he acquainted himself in detail with the production and construction of the complex and warmly encouraged the workers in the dynamic drive to boost production.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed great satisfaction at the fact that the workers of Ryongsong are making continued leap forward, after learning in detail about the mechanism, efficiency and principle of operation of new type compressors and other modern machines standing in rows at large workshops.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the admirable success that the workers of Ryongsong faithful to the idea and leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea overfulfiled their production plan even in the period of the \"Arduous March,\" the forced march, and contrived and manufactured machine products of the latest type by their own efforts and with indigenous technology by giving full play to the revolutionary spirit of fortitude, the do-or-die spirit, he said, highly appreciating their feats and extending greetings to all workers, technicians and officials of the complex.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We could successfully realize the socialist industrialization in so short span of time and rapidly augment the nation's economic potential thanks to many powerful and large machine-building bases such as the complex demonstrating the might of the independent national economy, he said, adding: We are optimistic about the successful building of a great prosperous and powerful nation as we have such tremendous potential.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that the complex plays a very important role in opening the gate to a thriving nation, he advanced highly important tasks to be carried out by it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Many more machines and custom-built equipment are required by every sector of the national economy than ever before today when the final charge is going on in full gear to build a great prosperous and powerful nation, he noted, urging the workers of Ryongsong to make continued innovation and progress with the same vim and vigor as they displayed to produce large-size machines with nothing after the war, thus startling the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The WPK's expectation for the complex is very great, he said, stressing the need for its workers to devote all their wisdom and zeal to making a great leap forward again in the production of machines, including custom-built equipment necessary for updating the key industries."

            "content": "Kim Jong Il dirige sobre terreno la Granja Cooperativa de Tongbong\r\nPyongyang, 4 de febrero (ATCC) -- El Dirigente Kim Jong Il, Secretario General del Partido del Trabajo de Corea y Presidente del Comite de Defensa Nacional de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea dirigio sobre el terreno la Granja Cooperativa de Tongbong del distrito de Hamju.\n\t\t\t\t\t  Le acompano el secretario del CC del PTC Kim Ki Nam.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Primeramente, el Dirigente recorrio el monumento a la direccion sobre el terreno del Presidente Kim Il Sung y la sala de presentacion del historial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Tras recordar con profunda emocion la orgullosa trayectoria recorrida por la granja, senalo que gracias a la sabia direccion y el minucioso cuidado del Presidente esta granja que en el pasado se llamaba la tierra esteril y un lugar desfavorable a vivir, se ha convertido en un paraiso de felicidad  en que ondea abundante cosecha.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Al escuchar la explicacion ante el plano de la aldea de granja se entero de los detalles del estado de construccion de esta aldea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Viendo las modernas viviendas alineadas al pie del monte Tongbong, la escuela, el jardin infantil, el hospital del pueblo, la casa cultural, la tienda y otras instalaciones de cultura e intendencia levantados arreglada y limpiamente, se mostro  muy satisfecho de que esta aldea se convirtio en una hermosa ciudad rural.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Al recorrer la tienda de Tongbong situada en el pleno centro de la aldea hizo conocimiento del estado de suministracion de mercancias a los campesinos e ilumino el rumbo y medios para mejorar la labor de suministracion de mercancias en el campo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Sostuvo cordial charla con Mun Kum Nyo, benemerita de la epoca del Songun (priorizacion militar) y elogio altamente los esfuerzos de ella quien cumplio  fielmente  con su deber de la jefa de equipo de trabajo durante decenas de anos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Enseno que el problema mas importante para abrir las puertas a una gran potencia prospera es aumentar la produccion agricola y presento las tareas que se presentan ante la granja.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El factor principal de que esta granja podia aumentar bruscamente en los ultimos anos la produccion de productos agricolas reside en que se materializo cabalmente la orientacion de la revolucion de semillas, senalo y destaco que hay que promover continua y energicamente la introduccion de buena variedad conveniente a la clima y el suelo de la granja al poner de manifiesto activo la  facultad creadora de los funcionarios y otros trabajadores agricolas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Anadio que en la realidad de nuestro pais en que esta limitada el area cultivable, es importante aumentar decisivamente el rendimiento de la cosecha por hectarea para resolver el problema alimentario y subrayo que para este fin es preciso elevar la fertilidad de tierra y, a la vez, cultivar la tierra conforme a las razones cientifico-tecnicas segun el metodo de cultivo autoctono.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Asevero que hay que realizar la mecanizacion combinada para resolver satisfactoriamente el problema de mano de obra a medida que se eleva el nivel de intensificacion y cientifizacion de agricultura y tomo una medida de enviar a la granja los medios mecanicos necesarios al respecto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El Dirigente senalo que en los ultimos anos en que debian superar grandes dificultades se desplego activamente en todos los lugares del pais la lucha por la construccion rural y, por  resultado, se ha echado la firme base capaz de aumentar de un salto la produccion agricola y destaco que tales exitos vertiginosos sirven de una firme garantia para entrar dignamente en las puertas a la gran potencia prospera al resolver finalmente el problema de agricultura, el de campesinado y el rural de nuestro pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Se promueven energicamente en el campo rural las tres revoluciones ideologica, tecnica y cultural, se fortalecieron el apoyo al campo y la direccion estatal a las granjas cooperativas,  gracias a lo cual se realizaron  con rapidez la claseobrerizacion de los campesinos y la industrializacion de agricultura y la fisonomia del campo se cambia cada dia mas y asi se disminuyo notablemente la diferencia entre la ciudad y el campo, destaco y apunto que esto es la clara manifestacion de la justeza e inagotable vitalidad de la tesis sobre el problema rural socialista presentada por el Presidente y del ventajoso regimen de la economia rural  socialista en nuestro pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La lucha por la construccion rural es la labor sagrada para convertir nuestro rural en el campo socialista rico y civilizado basado en la moderna tecnica, dijo y subrayo que hay que prestar gran atencion al respecto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Destaco que el sector agricola es uno de los sectores principales para construir una gran potencia prospera y senalo que todo el pais y todo el pueblo deben producir el viraje trascendental en la produccion agricola concentrando de continuo las fuerzas generales en la agricultura."
