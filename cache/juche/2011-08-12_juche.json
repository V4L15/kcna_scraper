However, they are persisting in the conspiratorial moves, claiming that gun report was actually heard and they confirmed the points of impact through sound detecting devices.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis reminds one of the saying that fear gives wings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the past the puppet group described the blasting for the construction of a power station in Ryanggang Province of the DPRK as \"mushroom cloud\" and \"nuclear test\" only to be shamed. It also called a timber floating in the East Sea of Korea as a submarine of the north and let warship and flying corps shell and bomb it only to be ridiculed by the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLast year when the warship sinking case occurred, it announced that it detected a submarine of the north on its way back from duty by a radar only to be ridiculed after it was proven to be a flock of birds. Some days ago, it misjudged its passenger airline as \"enemy plane\" and fired at it, astonishing people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe current shelling case is nothing but an extension of such burlesque.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe puppet group did not discern the blasting from the gun report as it was greatly engrossed in escalating confrontation and breeding plots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is unbecoming for the puppet military warmongers not to discern the blasting at the construction site of the Ryongmaedo Tideland within call from Yonphyong Island which is far from the depth of the DPRK though they were closely watching round the clock the areas of the DPRK side with the latest war means and detecting devices they brought from their U.S. master.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey even blustered that they confirmed through sound detector the DPRK's shells dropping near the \"northern limit line\" even though they were not fired at all. This is ridiculous enough to provoke side-splitting laughter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe current case clearly proved that all the \"cases\" for which the puppet group blamed the DPRK in the past were fabricated in such a manner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe rackets kicked off by the puppet warmongers fully show how much they have been engrossed in intrigues, provocation, confrontation and war moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRecently the puppet group kicked off conspiratorial rackets over \"spyring case\" and \"dispatch of assassination team\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIts provocative conspiratorial moves are aimed at faking up another shocking case in the wake of that of last year to chill the atmosphere for the improvement of the inter-Korean relations running higher day by day on the threshold of August 15, maintain the confrontation policy, divert elsewhere the public attention from the internal crisis and stymie the efforts to defuse the tension on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe current case should never go unnoticed as it indicates that even a blasting for the peaceful construction can lead to a war in the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNow that the puppet military warmongers granted the frontline units the \"right to fire without asking\", it is as clear as noonday that the situation on the peninsula can turn into a war phase in a moment if they fire at random in the future, self-frightened like this time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf the U.S.-made detecting devices the puppet army is equipped with are poor ones which do not discern blasting from shelling, it is also very dangerous.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSome days ago, it was found in the command control computer system of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the puppet army that dozens of its units in the areas along the Military Demarcation Line are described as being stationed in the areas of the north side. This has sparked off a big furor. Such things can never go unnoticed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is, indeed, horrible to think about the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by the ridiculous conspiratorial and confrontation rackets of the puppet group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNow the puppet warmongers seem to become insane, engrossed in persecution mania plus confrontation mania.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf the puppet group does not want self-destruction, it had better cool its head overheated with confrontational ambition, act with discretion and give up the foolish anti-DPRK conspiratorial moves and reckless moves for a war against the DPRK."

Y calificando un tronco, que flotaba en el Mar Este de Corea de un submarino del Norte, hicieron canonearlo y bombardearlo movilizando los buques de guerra y la aviacion. Esto produjo gran risa de todo el mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando se hundio la corbeta surcoreana \"Cheonan\" en el ano pasado, publicaron que hayan detectado con radar el \"submarino del Norte\" que regresaba tras cumplir su mision, luego fue confirmada una bandada de pajaros, lo cual produjo irrision de todo el mundo.
