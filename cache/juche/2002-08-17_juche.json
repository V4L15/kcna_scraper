What remains to be done is to implement the agreed points. \r\n Rodong Sinmun says this in a signed commentary Saturday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the points are to be implemented to meet the expectation and demand of the fellow countrymen, the south side should have the stand of national independence, a patriotic stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n So more achievements could not be made in the inter-Korean relations and the movement for national reunification in the past owing to the attitude of the south side that regards \"cooperation\" with outsiders more important than national cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As it is clear from this precedent, if the agreed points are to be implemented in the reunification movement, it is urgent for the south side to stop slandering the north and coming out against it but seek cooperation with compatriots. It is necessary to depend on the nation. The south side should make a proper understanding of the real meaning of \"by our nation itself\" and have the patriotic stand of national independence, the sincere stand of doing good things together, getting reconciled and united with the compatriots in the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the good achievements have been made at the talks, we urge the south side not to repeat the inglorious things done in the process of implementing the agreed points in the past but to sincerely implement all the points the sides agreed upon at the talks with the will to implement the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will make every possible effort to successfully implement the agreements reached at the talks.    \r\n\r\n"

It is publicly known that each war drill resulted in creating a touch-and-go situation on the Korean Peninsula and each time the U.S. imperialists painted the war manoeuvres as a \"commanding staff drill\" and \"annual drill\" in a bid to escape from public censure at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saber-rattling cannot go with dialogue.  The U.S. policy to stifle the DPRK has become more undisguised since the emergence of the present administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. warmongers are keen to destroy the DPRK by force of arms, but this is a day-dream. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is ready for both dialogue and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists will sustain even more disgraceful defeat than what they did in the 1950s if they dare ignite a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should drop their anti-DPRK hostile policy, stop the north-targeted war exercises in south Korea and pull all their aggression forces out of it at once.     \r\n\r\n"
