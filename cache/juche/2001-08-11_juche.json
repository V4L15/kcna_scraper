It is our legitimate sovereign right to carry out peaceful missile program. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the DPRK's unshakable stand and will to reciprocate good will and react to a hard line with a super hard line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No one has a right to fault the DPRK for it.    \r\n\r\n"

He walked into the field and examined maize ears to know if they were ripened and how heavy they were. Holding a handful of earth, he told officials to prospect the area, saying that there might be an apatite deposit for sure, as maize was doing well in the sloping field. Later prospecting officials surveyed the place where the car stopped, confirming the area as an apatite deposit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This was how a big apatite mine came into being in the DPRK where apatite was considered as not available before. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is another anecdote about him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One summer day in Juche 49 (1960), he happened to meet an angler by the side of the Sunhwa River flowing at the foot of Mangyong Hill. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Praising his angling skill, he asked about his occupation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Feeling ashamed, the man told the president that he was working as a barber at a school. saying that his job was very good, the president told him how gratifying he would feel to stroke down pupils' hair as a barber as he himself has no time to pat all the pupils on the head. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He repeatedly asked him to take good care of pupils, the treasure and future of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another anecdote about him says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One day in Juche 35 (1946), an old man working for a democratic political party visited his office and made a rare request to him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The man told Kim Il Sung that he married a woman shortly ago only to be \"maltreated\" as he was old. So he asked the president to help him get some tonics such as wild Insam (Ginseng) and young antlers of the deer. Laughing hearty laugh, the President promised to help him so that his wife might not despise him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A year later the 70 years old man became father of a son. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Later the president spared time to attend a feast given in celebration of his son's 100 days after birth.    \r\n\r\n"
