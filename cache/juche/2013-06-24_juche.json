The U.S. imperialists let the puppet combat police and defence guards units conduct armed provocations for 454 times in an attempt to seize important heights in the areas north of the 38th parallel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFrom 1948 they intensified anti-DPRK armed provocations. That year witnessed more than 930 cases of provocations involving 6,030 armed bandits as well as various sorts of sabotages conducted by the group of 1,074 terrorists infiltrated into the areas north of the 38th parallel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn 1949 the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppet forces deployed four divisions and one regiment of the puppet army in the areas along the demarcation line while reinforcing combat police units there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAccording to data available, there were 2,617 cases of armed provocations involving 67,398 servicepersons in the period. The depth of their attack was 2~17 kilometers and the depth of action for \"special units\" about 60 km.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey had also committed ceaseless armed provocations in the sea and sky 69 times and 79 times respectively in 1949.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTheir armed provocations in the areas along the 38th parallel got evermore pronounced in 1950. While speeding up war preparations, they committed as many as 1,147 armed provocations till the outbreak of the Korean War from January.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs seen above, those armed provocations directed by the U.S. imperialists were evidently deliberate military actions for a total war and a prelude to the Korean War."

It divided the Korean nation into two parts, escalating confrontation between Koreans and imposing all sorts of misfortunes and sufferings upon them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAlready more than a century ago the U.S. defined it as its state policy to invade Korea, gateway to the Asian Continent. In February 1845, the U.S. ruling quarters presented a \"bill for forcing Korea to open\" to its Congress and left no means untried to invade Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. embarked upon the road of invading Korea with the intrusion of its aggressor ship General Sherman in 1866 as an occasion, but it was repulsed by the struggle of people in Mangyongdae and soldiers and people of the Walled City of Pyongyang. Then followed ceaseless U.S. aggression such as the intrusion of the warships Shenandoah and China in 1868 and the large-scale invasion in 1871 in a bid to conquer the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFrom August 10 to 15 of 1945, the U.S. imperialists cooked up the 38th parallel under the pretext of \"the line for sharing responsibility\" for receiving the surrender of the Japanese Army. Their forces occupied south Korea under the mask of \"liberator\" from September 8 to the end of October. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOn Sept. 7, 1945, the U.S. imperialists declared U.S. military administration across south Korea through Proclamation No. 1 of the MacArthur Command. It unreasonably brought the issue of Korea to the UN and cooked up a \"decision\" on holding separated elections in south Korea and set up a pro-U.S. regime opposed to communism through suppression and fraud and swindle. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter the emergence of the puppet regime in south Korea the U.S. imperialists frantically stepped up preparations for invading the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey built a puppet army to be used as a shock brigade for carrying out the war of aggression and rapidly beefed up its strength. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey sent a 500-strong U.S. military advisory group, the biggest in the world at that time, to south Korea for the purpose of establishing a commanding system, forming units of the south Korean puppet army, etc. in the same way as done at the U.S. forces and making it undergo military trainings under the command of the group. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe real aim sought by the U.S. imperialists in preparing the war of aggression was fully revealed by their process of working out and rounding off the war scenario.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTheir scenario had three phases.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIts phase A was to launch the Korean War, its phase B was to escalate the war into China and its phase C was to intrude into Siberia. The U.S. envisaged 1949 as the year to start the operation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn order to verify the feasibility of the war scenario the U.S. imperialists drove the south Korean puppet army keen on \"northern expedition\" to armed provocations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tConsequently, such battles reminiscent of a real war continued in areas along the 38th parallel even on the eve of the Korean War which broke out on June 25. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. hatched a crafty and base plot to evade the responsibility for the provocation of the war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn October 1949, it cooked up at the 4th session of the UN General Assembly \"the 3rd UN Commission on Korea\" whose mission was to cover up the truth behind the outbreak of the Korean war and make profound confusing of right and wrong under the pretexts of monitoring and reporting \"the military dispute in Korea\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the meantime, it had already worked out \"basic documents\" and \"resolutions\" to be presented to the meeting of the UN Security Council and the sessions of the UN General Assembly after the outbreak of the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDulles inspected positions of the south Korean puppet army along areas south of the 38th parallel after flying into Seoul in June 1950 and finally examined the war scenario, looking at operation maps and a model board showing the operational theaters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the wake of his trip to Seoul the then defense secretary and the then chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff visited the MacArthur Command in Tokyo. Their Tokyo visits were aimed to decide on the issue of hurling U.S. units in the Far East into the battlefields of the Korean war whose outbreak was an established fact and examine the readiness to go into an action on the spot.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. imperialists provoked that criminal war of aggression by hurling south Korean puppet units at 4 a.m. on June 25, 1950.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMacArthur, who played a main role in igniting the Korean war, said that the war was his plan, admitting the provocation of the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. should not forget its disgraceful history in which it was compelled to sign a document of surrender before the Korean  people though it mobilized huge armed forces and latest military hardware for the war, warned the memorandum."

Y tenia previsto desatar la guerra en 1949.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara revisar la eficiencia de ese guion, lanzo al ejercito surcoreano a cometer provocaciones militares contra la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor consiguiente, en los alrededores del paralelo 38o no cesaron hasta el 25 de junio de 1950 las batallas que hicieron imaginar una guerra de verdad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl imperialismo norteamericano promovio tambien un complot taimado y sucio para eludir la responsabilidad del estallido de guerra. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el cuarto periodo de sesiones de la Asamblea General de la ONU, sesionado en octubre de 1949, EE.UU. fabrico la tercera \"comision de la ONU para Corea\" cuya mision estuvo en encubrir la verdad de estallido de la guerra coreana e invertirla bajo el rotulo de \"vigilar\" e \"informar\" el \"conflicto armado en Corea\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor otra parte, se trazaron con antelacion los \"documentos basicos\" y los \"proyectos de resolucion\" a ser sometidos a la consideracion del Consejo de Seguridad y la Asamblea General de la ONU despues de que estallara la guerra coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn junio de 1950, Dulles arribo a Seul e inspecciono en el terreno los puestos militares del ejercito surcoreano en las inmediaciones del paralelo 38o y reviso finalmente el plan de guerra examinando la maqueta y el mapa operacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCoincidiendo con la visita de Dulles a Seul, el secretario de Defensa y el presidente de la Junta de Jefes de Estado Mayor de EE.UU. visitaron la comandancia de MacArthur en Tokio con el fin de decidir la incorporacion de las fuerzas norteamericanas estacionadas en el Extremo Oriente en la guerra coreana y revisar en el terreno la disposicion de combate. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA las 4 de la madrugada del 25 de junio de 1950, el imperialismo norteamericano lanzo a las unidades militares surcoreanas a la guerra criminal y agresiva contra la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMacArthur, quien jugo el papel de protagonista en el estallido de guerra, confeso su crimen diciendo: \"esa guerra fue mi plan\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor ultimo, el documento advierte a EE.UU. que no olvide su antecedente vergonzoso de haberse rendido ante el pueblo coreano, pese a que ha movilizado enormes efectivos y armamentos sofisticados en la pasada guerra coreana de la decada de 1950."
