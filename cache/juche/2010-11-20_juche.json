It was a typical example of politicizing human rights that EU, which pursued dialogue with the DPRK over human rights, unexpectedly became \"a sponsor of the anti-DPRK resolution on human rights\" in pursuance of the U.S. policy of confrontation.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The West is being condemned by the world community for its racial discrimination, maltreatment of immigrants, violence against women and ill-treatment of prisoners and all other human rights abuses. Yet, it adopted UN \"resolutions\" on \"human rights issues\" of only some countries including the DPRK like a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\" This is the most striking example of the selectivity and double-standards in handling \"human rights issues\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK vehemently and totally rejects the recent \"resolution\" as it did in the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It will steadily strengthen and develop the Korean-style socialist system which fully protects the human rights and comprehensively promotes them."

Esto es un buen ejemplo de la politizacion de ese tema.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El Occidente es condenado por el mundo por sus criminales actos en violacion de DDHH, inclusive la discriminacion racial, el acoso a emigrantes, las acciones violentas contra la mujer y el maltrato a los reos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, partiendo de su logica de bandido, aprobo como \"resolucion\" de la ONU solo el \"problema de DDHH\" de unos paises incluyendo la RPDC, lo cual es el climax de la selectividad y la pauta de doble rasero en el trato de este tema. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Como de siempre, la RPDC rechaza categoricamente la presente \"resolucion\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La RPDC seguira fortaleciendo el regimen socialista al estilo coreano donde los DDHH se defienden con mas firmeza y pueden ser fomentados en todos los aspectos."
