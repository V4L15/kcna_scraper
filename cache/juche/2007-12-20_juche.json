This is well known a fact. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This guy again busied himself with the presentation of the bill, as if he had nothing else to do, a foolish bid to stop the administration from lifting sanctions against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He seems not to know what the DPRK-U.S. agreement means and what the U.S. strategic interests are. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Irony is that such political imbecile as Mr. Brownback claims to be a senator although he does not know even where he stands. It is not hard to guess what the level of the U.S. politics is. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Explicitly speaking, the DPRK has remained unfazed despite the anti-DPRK sanctions applied by the U.S. for several decades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. lifting of the sanctions is, therefore, not what the DPRK has craved for. There would be no change for it whether the U.S. persisted in the sanctions against it or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such conservative hardliners as Brownback calculate they can throw a hurdle in the way of the process of the six-party talks and the DPRK-U.S. relations through such \"sanctions\". Nothing is, however, more foolish than this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With no desperate effort can the U.S. conservative hardliners stem the trend of the times towards detente over the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Stressing that this policy failure is unavoidable, the article goes on: This year Japan has intensified more frantically than ever before its smear propaganda and diplomatic offensive against the DPRK and the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) and tightened sanctions against the DPRK in a bid to impair their prestige and dignity over the abduction issue. It, in collusion with the U.S., has worked hard to put the DPRK under the military siege and stage a comeback to Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reckless hysteria of the Japanese reactionaries was nothing but the desperate wriggling of political dwarfs and ferocious militarists driven into a dilemma, as they are at a loss to find a right path for the state to follow in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's pursuance of extreme hostile policy toward the DPRK this year could not help stem the trend on the Korean Peninsula toward detente, reconciliation and cooperation. In the meantime, the DPRK's prestige and dignity have been exalted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has left no means untried to put a brake on the process of improving the DPRK-U.S. relations but in vain. There occurred changes as evidenced by multifaceted dialogue and contacts between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan, on the contrary, has found itself deep in the mire of international isolation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Serious differences surfaced in the Japan-U.S. relations, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's moves to lay an international siege to the DPRK and tarnish its prestige and dignity have proved futile this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The failure of Japan's hostile policy toward the DPRK this year is attributable to the fact that Japan blindly followed the U.S. without independence and behaved impertinently guided by the militarist way of thinking.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
