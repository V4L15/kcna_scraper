Mohan had an interview with the KCNA correspondent to India on April 8 on the occasion of the birth anniversary of the President Kim Il Sung and praised his exploits for the cause of national reunification.    He said:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President advanced the three principles of national reunification -- independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity -- which were jointly confirmed by the north and south of Korea and recognized by the international community and the proposal for founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo, their embodiment, and the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   By doing so, he indicated principles and ways to accomplish national reunification at the earliest possible  date.   The principles, the program and the proposal are the great charter for national reunification which could be set forth  only by President Kim Il Sung, who devoted his whole life to the sacred cause for the country and nation and to the cause of national reunification to the last moment of his life.   The reunification of Korea will surely be achieved because General Secretary  Kim Jong Il has creditably inherited  the cause of the President. \r\n\r\n"

This is an epochal measure for putting a period to the tragic history of national division that lasted for over half a century and powerfully encouraging the entire fellow countrymen to the just struggle for bringing about a new phase of national unity and reunification, says Minju Joson today in a signed commentary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The paper goes on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflected in the slogans are all ideas and policies clarified by General Secretary  Kim Jong Il in his celebrated work \"Let us reunify the country independently and peacefully through the great unity of the entire nation,\" which was published last year.   The entire fellow countrymen are firmly convinced that the great unity of the nation will be achieved and a turning phase be opened for national reunification when they adhere to the five-point policy for great national unity laid down in the work. That is why Koreans in the north, south and overseas have turned out as one in the patriotic struggle to implement the policy under its banner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The release of the slogans is a very timely measure because the separatist forces within and without are intensifying the moves for aggression, war and national split more viciously than ever before.   The idea carried in the slogans is a militant banner that should be upheld by everyone who hopes for the removal of root cause of war in Korea, improved inter-Korean relations and lasting peace and peaceful reunification, the paper stresses, calling upon the entire fellow countrymen to rise in a nationwide struggle to achieve the historic cause of national reunification. \r\n\r\n"

The song and dance \"Song of praise for sun presented by 70 million Koreans in Japan\"  performed by the Korean art troupe in Japan  represented well the overseas compatriots' will to hold the President in high esteem forever and their best wishes for a long life and good health of the Marshal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The chorus and dance \"We will hold Marshal in higher esteem\" and the song \"My Motherland\" staged by the overseas compatriot art troupes truly  mirrored their desire to live under the care of the Marshal.

The day had been annually marked as the greatest  national holiday in Korea before the instituting of Sun's Day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In April Juche 63 (1974) Kim Jong Il told officials  that the Korean people had many significant holidays. But, if they had not had the President, such historical events as national liberation and the founding of the Worker's Party of Korea and the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea  would have been unimaginable, he added.   We should  make it a tradition to mark the birthday of the President as the greatest national holiday and the happiest event of the Korean nation every year from this year, he stressed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Therefore, such colorful functions as national meetings, seminars on his exploits, art performances and sports games have been held traditionally around April 15 to commemorate his birthday as the greatest national holiday.   The Tower of the Juche Idea and the Arch of Triumph, the world famous monuments unique in their themes and styles, were erected under the guidance of Kim Jong Il on the occasion of the 70th birthday of the President to glorify his immortal revolutionary exploits generation after generation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He saw to it that the April Spring Friendship Art Festival was held in Pyongyang, considerate of the ardent desire of the world revolutionary people to commemorate the April holiday as the common holiday of humankind.   Kimilsungia shows were held throughout the country and a national art exhibition and a 10-day film show have opened around Sun's Day. Besides, sports games, art performances and colourful events are being held. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nParticularly, the international art festival involving foreign artistes and overseas. Korean artistes from over 40 countries is now under way at famous theatres and halls including the Mansudae Art Theatre and the Pyongyang Grand Theatre. \r\n\r\n"

He said he was not taken prisoner, but voluntarily joined the People's Army.   He went on to say:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 1950 I served in the 35th regiment, the 5th division of the cursed Army of South Korea.  When I was taken to a battlefield, I thought I should survive.  So, I crossed the death line to join the People's Army in February 1951 and fought in the eastern sector of the front.   My defection was not a response to anyone's call. I crossed the frontline of my own accord to defect to the DPRK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   An Chol hong, 67, in Chongjin city, North Hamgyong Province, had this to say:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the war the army was bound to meet death in any case.   It was not until I joined the People's Army in November 1952 that I came to know well for whom I should fight.   The People's Army was, indeed, a genuine army of the people fighting for the party, the leader, the country and the people.   I was not subjected to any discrimination during my military service.   If I were taken prisoner, higher education I received under the care of the DPRK would not have been possible, much less military service.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim In Son and An Chol Hong were unanimous in saying that they defected to the DPRK voluntarily, not after they had been taken prisoner nor complying with the demand of anyone. The South Korean authority's insistence on \"exchange\" of unconverted long-term prisoners of the north origin for those defectors to the north is the height of impudence, they added. \r\n\r\n"

Korea-U.S. \"joint wartime reinforcement exercise\"\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 13 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK issued a statement today in the wake of the recent announcement of South Korea-U.S. \"combined forces command\" that there will be a week-long \"joint wartime reinforcement exercise\" under the conditions of a real war, beginning April 13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe statement says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The \"joint wartime reinforcement exercise\" reportedly  is mainly aimed at quickly hurling the U.S. forces to the Korean peninsula from the U.S. mainland and overseas military bases in case of \"crisis\" on the peninsula. Involved in the \"exercise\" will be the U.S. forces and the South Korean Army, more than 13,000 men in all.   According to the U.S.-drawn \"operation plan 5027\" for a war of aggression on the DPRK, the U.S. is supposed to bring 400,000 troops, 200 warships and 1,600 warplanes in and around the peninsula.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is now trying to practice it through maneuvers.   It has hitherto staged the exercise of introducing its reinforcement into the peninsula from overseas through a mock warfare by computer.   Now the United States is staging maneuvers of armed forces. This means the U.S., having defined the provocation of a war of aggression against the DPRK as an established fact, is putting operation and preparations for it into practice in real earnest.   The U.S. military scheme to stifle the DPRK by force of arms is getting pronounced as the days go by.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. held an exercise for evacuation of U.S. government and military  personnel to Japan from South Korea between March 25 and 28, simulating an \"emergency on the Korean peninsula.\" this move as ill-boding as the current exercise shows that the U.S. script of war of aggression has been finished and that its implementation is near at hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis is a flagrant violation of the New York joint statement and the agreed framework in which the U.S. promised not to use armed forces including nuclear weapons nor to threaten to use them against the DPRK.   With the Kosovo incident as an occasion, the U.S. is keeping its forces in South Korea and Japan on the alert and in preparedness for prompt action and staging the joint wartime reinforcement exercise, prompted by a foolish intention to put pressure and dispirit us.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is a mistake, indeed.\r\n   If the U.S. tries to test the logic of strength against the DPRK as it does in Iraq and Kosovo, it will be a reckless suicidal act leading to irrevocable disgrace and destruction.   Our army and people who regard the dignity and sovereignty of the nation as their lifeblood are firmly determined and fully prepared not to miss the opportunity again, if the aggressors unleash war. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
