She urged the Japanese authorities to roll back immediately their policy to stifle the DPRK which may lead to its self-destruction and make an honest apology and adequate compensation for the crimes Japan committed against the Korean people in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Speaking next, head of the delegation and a representative of the liaison council Sumiko Shimizu, deputy leader of the Social Democratic Party of Japan and a member of the House of Councilors, declared that Japan has to liquidate the past crimes if good neighborly relations are to be opened between the DPRK and Japan.  She expressed her support to the DPRK government statement issued in August. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   She said that the issue of \"comfort women for the army\" is a crime against the dignity of women and the responsibility for its solution rests with the Japanese government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese government is obliged to mend its wrongdoings in a responsible manner, she said, noting that if the Japanese government values its prestige and moral principle, it should resume the talks for the normalization of the relations with the DPRK and make every effort to make them fruitful and, at the same time, improve the legal status of  the Korean residents in Japan and guarantee  democratic national rights to them at an early date. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  She called upon the women of the two countries to firmly solidarize with each other to hasten the establishment of the good neighborly relations between the two countries and undertake a joint struggle for the Korean reunification and the peace in northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The meeting was also addressed by women of the two countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A resolution was adopted at the meeting to undertake a more dynamic solidarity movement demanding the Japanese authorities roll back their hostile policy towards the DPRK and make an apology and compensation for the liquidation of the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists in the period of their colonial rule over Korea. \r\n\r\n"

Her life was a noble and brilliant life of the most devoted loyalist to the leader, the greatest mother of revolution and the most ardent patriot of the nation in human history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   \r\n   She was born into a patriotic family in Hoeryong, North Hamgyong Province, on December 24, Juche 6 (1917). In hearty response to the President Kim Il Sung's line of liberating the country, she joined the Korean People's Revolutionary Army in September 1935, conducted political and military activities while fighting bloody battles against Japan for ten years and devoted her all to the building of a new country after liberation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   She was a brilliant paragon of loyalists who held high the banner of devotedly defending the leader in the van with absolute worship for President Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   During the anti-Japanese armed struggle she firmly safeguarded the headquarters of the revolution in many battles at the risk of her life. She uncovered and shattered the enemy's heinous moves to do harm to the headquarters of the revolution with a high degree of revolutionary vigilance and keen penetration, thus setting a brilliant example as a lifeguard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There are many anecdotes about her loyalty in protecting the President from danger during the anti-Japanese struggle and the building of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   She was an unquestioned advocate and a most faithful implementor of the revolutionary idea and line of the leader and an outstanding political activist possessed of distinguished organizational ability and seasoned leadership art. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   She was not only a communist revolutionary fighter endowed with the quality and traits as an outstanding political figure but a peerlessly great woman commander and a legendary heroine produced by the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Her life was the noblest revolutionary life replete with the finest virtues based on the ardent love for the revolutionary comrades and strong affection  for the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Her revolutionary life is throwing more brilliant rays on behalf of the era and history as she brought up the respected Kim Jong Il as the lodestar of Juche and gave steadfast continuity to the Korean revolution, the human cause of independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people should always extend most profound thanks and tribute to her immortal feats as she brought up Kim Jong Il as another leader, the sun of revolution, and thus enabled Kim Il Sung's nation to be blessed with the sagacious leader and commander down through generations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe whole party, the entire army and all the people should become human bombs like Ri Su Bok and be ready to die in suicidal explosion like Kil Yong Jo to devoutly defend  the great Kim Jong Il and make every effort for his safety and long life in good health under the uplifted banner of devotedly defending the leader, which is associated with her life and dyed with the blood of the forerunners of the revolution. \r\n\r\n"
