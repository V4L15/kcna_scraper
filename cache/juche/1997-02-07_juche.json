This immoral behavior is a challenge to the humanitarian idea and principle recognised by the international community.\r\n   Japan has let no chance pass by without calling for \"normal ties\" with the DPRK. This issue has not been settled entirely because the Japanese authorities have not renounced their hostile policy toward the DPRK and have not sincerely atoned for their past crimes.\r\n   Lurking behind the precondition raised by them this time is a sinister intention to avoid renouncing their hostile policy toward the DPRK and atoning for their past crimes by crafty means.\r\n   A war criminal state that committed heinous crimes against the Korean people, Japan still refuses to atone for the past, though it is more than half a century since the war.\r\n   Japan must set out on postwar settlement without delay, mindful that the normalisation of diplomatic relations is a matter of choice but the postwar settlement is an unavoidable issue.\r\n   If Japan continues resorting to crafty moves, dreaming a daydream, it will bring into bolder relief its political and moral vulgarity and will face criticism from the Korean and other Asian people. \r\n\r\n"

An analyst of the paper says:\r\n   Recently, South Korean mass media said the Carnegie Foundation had worked out a report to the effect that the U.S. would continue placing Japan and South Korea under its \"nuclear umbrella,\" which means the use of U.S. nuclear weapons in case of \"conventional attack\" on South Korea.\r\n   The voice of America also broadcast this news.\r\n   The report of the Carnegie Foundation reflects the high-handed attitude and nuclear policy of the U.S. toward the DPRK.\r\n   The continued placement of South Korea and Japan under U.S. \"nuclear umbrella\" indicates that the aggressive nuclear strategy of the U.S. remains unchanged in the post-Cold War period and is mainly targeted at the DPRK.\r\n   \"Conventional attack\" on South Korea is a groundless fiction.\r\n   It is very irresponsible for the U.S. to talk about the possibility of the use of nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula while the nuclear activity is frozen in the DPRK.\r\n   This is, in fact, as good as urging the DPRK to go its own way.\r\n   If the U.S. Does not intend to keep its commitment not to use nuclear weapons against the DPRK, we have no idea of keeping up our nuclear freeze. This is an issue that belongs to the exercise of our sovereignty.\r\n   If the implementation of the framework agreement and the moves for better ties between the DPRK and the U.S. are suspended due to the U.S. nuclear policy toward the DPRK, it will not be good for the U.S., either.\r\n   We will continue watching the U.S. attitude and act accordingly. \r\n\r\n"

Korea\r\n   Pyongyang, February 7 (KCNA) -- The propaganda department of the central committee of the National Democratic Front of South Korea (NDFSK) issued a document on January 27 on the truth behind the Kim Young Sam regime's secretive passage of evil laws, the Seoul-based radio voice of national salvation reported.  The document says in part:\r\n   The Kim Young Sam regime talks about \"legitimacy\" and \"inevitability\" of the revision of \"Labor Laws\" and \"Law on the Agency for National Security Planning\" in an attempt to calm down the public protests, but will not be able to conceal its sinister intention and the truth behind the criminal passage of the laws in the absence of opposition \"lawmakers.\"\r\n   The secretive passage of eleven \"bills\" including the disputed ones is linked with the serious government crisis of the Kim Young Sam regime. \r\n   Kim Young Sam ordered the \"government\" and the ruling party to step up the enactment of evil laws, with a view to bridging over the serious crisis with \"tough politics\" and winning conservative-minded voters over to the ruling camp in the upcoming \"presidential election.\"\r\n   Under his secret directive, the fascist \"New Korea Party\" railroaded eleven \"bills\" including the amendments of the two disputed laws under the chair of the \"deputy speaker\" in a predawn \"parliamentary\" session where \"speaker\" Kim Su Han and opposition \"lawmakers\" were absent.\r\n   Upon hearing the news about this secretive passage of laws, the opposition parties declared the evil laws null and void and announced that they would take strong legal and physical countermeasures. The labor interests including the \"Korean Confederation of Trade Unions\" and the \"Federation of Korea Trade Unions\" went on general strike, driving the \"government\" and the ruling party into a tight corner.\r\n   The international confederation of free trade unions and other international labor organisations issued statements of protest and all the South Korean people increasingly criticised the undemocratic enactment of evil laws. However, the heinous dictator, Kim Young Sam, endorsed and promulgated the evil labor laws on December 31.\r\n   The secretive passage of laws has not given a way out for the \"civilian\" dictatorship but will precipitate its ruin.\r\n   Whatever tricks Kim Young Sam's fascist \"New Korea Party\" may resort to, the people's struggle for democracy in society, the three rights of labor and national reunification will develop into a national uprising to destroy the \"civilian\" dictatorship, and Kim Young Sam will meet a more miserable end than the preceding dictators did for his heinous crimes against the nation and the people. \r\n\r\n"
