Giving details of the facts that this year the U.S. has persisted in their arms build-up and military threat in and around South Korea, taking issue with the DPRK over what it called \"suspected underground nuclear facility\" and \"missile and human rights issues,\" the article says. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK has always pursued the army-first policy, closely watching the enemies' even more undisguised moves to provoke  a new war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. instigated the South Korean warmongers to spark the west sea incident in a bid to test the DPRK's strength and combat posture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But, the heroic people's army soldiers meted out a severe punishment to the provokers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean People's Army clarified its resolute stand that it would never forgive anyone invading even an inch of the sky, land and sea of the DPRK but would strongly retaliate against them mercilessly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The KPA warned enemies that if they seek to intrude again into territorial waters of the west sea of the north, insisting on the \"Northern Limit Line,\" far from drawing a lesson from the west sea incident, the KPA would not stay calm but mobilize all necessary self-defensive means to throw them into the sea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. has worked hard to disarm the DPRK under the name of \"improvement of relations,\"  while escalating its military pressure upon the DPRK. However, the Korean people have taken firm and resolute measures against their moves, neither yielding to their military pressure nor being taken in by any appeasement and deception. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Noting that the Korean people are filled with the firm determination to defeat any strong enemies in the future, too, the article stresses that the DPRK has everything in place to win a sure victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the U.S. recklessly provokes the second Korean war, it will bring to the U.S. a military defeat more disastrous than what it suffered in the 1950s, the article warns. \r\n\r\n"
