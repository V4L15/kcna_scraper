Information Committee held in New York.\r\n Underscoring the need to pay due attention to establishing a fair and new information order in keeping with the development of new information and communication technology, he said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard, the developed countries, which control modern information and communication means, are required to recognize the importance of this issue and sincerely help the developing countries build their own information capacity through the transfer of technology and financial aid. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The main goal of U.N. information service is to widely introduce U.N. activities among the world people and thus enlist broad-based support to the United Nations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is most important for the U.N. to ensure that the principle of respect for sovereignty of each country and non-interference in other's internal affairs is strictly observed in the information service, too, as it is based on the principle of respect for sovereignty and equality of all its member states. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Objectivity and impartiality should also be ensured in U.N. information service. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And U.N. information service should be made to positively contribute to the settlement of issues related to economic and social development in developing countries and measures should be taken to transfer modern information and communication technology to developing countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The delegation of the DPRK positively appreciates the workshop held every year for information service in developing countries under the sponsorship of the U.N.

It resembles calabash not only in appearance but also in size. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is generally gray or dark gray. as its shape is unique and the surface is smooth, it gives a feeling of softness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Among this kind of pots, there are those whose bottoms are round, flat and pointed and those whose upper body is embossed with a belt pattern consisting of lines. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are two or four holds of various shapes as additional patterns, such as knob-shape, ring-shape, lip-shape and half-moon-shape. this gives an admirable symmetrical effect. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Calabash-shaped pot has been called Misongri-type pot, whose name was derived from Misong-ri, Uiju county, North Phyongan Province, where it was unearthed at a cave there for the first time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In and around Pyongyang, artifacts of three forms of calabash-shaped pot have been found and the small pot with a long neck, which is believed to be the origin of the pot, has been discovered only in the Pyongyang area. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is another evidence that Pyongyang is a time-honoured city which has existed since the period of Tangun's Korea. \r\n\r\n"
