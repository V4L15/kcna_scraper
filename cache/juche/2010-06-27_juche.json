Not content with this, they even sent to the DPRK's side a ridiculous notice proposing \"general-level talks\" in order to brief it on its \"results.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such behavior of the U.S. imperialists is a revelation of a sinister design to zealously instigate the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors to the confrontation and war with fellow countrymen and thus put into practice their policy of stifling the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this regard the head of the DPRK side to the DPRK-U.S. military general-level talks sent the following reply notice to the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces' side on Sunday:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is preposterous that they conducted the \"investigation\" by using the \"Military Armistice Commission\" though it was beyond its mandate and it was more absurd to put the \"results of investigation\" on the table of the talks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is as clear as noon that the \"results of investigation\" on the part of the \"MAC\" touted by the U.S. forces side will only represent \"the results of the joint investigation\" full of fabrications and plots announced by the south Korean puppet authorities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By origin our intention was to dispatch our inspection group to south Korea from the very day the authorities linked the case with us and then open north-south high-level military talks to discuss the results of the inspection. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We still remain unchanged in our stand to open the above-said military talks and probe the truth about the case. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean authorities respond to our proposal, we will promptly come out for a working contact for the opening of the military talks. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The working contact will discuss the issue of sending the inspection group of our National Defence Commission to the spot of south Korea for successfully ensuring the proposed high-level military talks, the time and venue for opening the talks, the composition of delegations of both sides and other working matters. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. forces side should no longer meddle in the issue of the north-south relations under the name of \"UN Forces Command.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its continued interference in this issue would only further increase our suspicions about the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists should bear in mind that it is the most reasonable way of settling the \"Cheonan\" case to accept this fair and aboveboard proposal of ours."

When the group suffered a heavy defeat in the \"elections to the local self-governing bodies\" despite what it called \"north wind\" raised by groundlessly linking it with the DPRK, it got more frantic in its racket for a war of aggression against it, crying out for \"punishment\" and \"resolute retaliation\" and the like. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality clearly indicates that the above-said puppet group is the most faithful servants of the U.S. imperialists and the ferocious warmongers unaware that they are digging their own graves."

It was reported that the incumbent south Korean \"president's\" visit to the \"cemetery\" was the first of its kind in 44 years. \n\t\t\t\t\t  Rodong Sinmun Sunday observes in a signed commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee's visit to the \"cemetery\", where his predecessors hesitated to go, was a foul deed that could be done only by a traitor steeped to sycophancy and treachery to the marrow of his bones and extremely keen on confrontation with fellow countrymen and war for invasion of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hideous crimes committed by the U.S. imperialists, mercenaries from its satellite countries and the south Korean puppet forces in the Korean War can neither be hid nor can the burning hatred of the Korean people for the killers and their determination to take revenge upon them be quelled no matter how much water may flow under bridge.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The cursed behavior of traitor Lee is an intolerable insult to the people mercilessly killed by the aggressors and a blatant challenge to all Koreans who vow to take revenge upon the murderers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In April last when he visited the United States, the traitor talked about \"sacrifice and devotion of the war participants\", asserting that the U.S. aggression on Korea was \"a motive force\" for \"development\". Recently he made such a disgusting show as expressing \"thanks\" through leading media of those countries which participated in the last Korean War, toeing the U.S. line, and sending \"letters of thanks\" to the former mercenaries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This goes to prove that his visit to the \"cemetery\" was by no means fortuitous but it was designed to beautify the last war of aggression against the DPRK and provoke another Korean war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is as clear as noonday that the Korean nation can never escape the repetition of the June 25 tragedy in case such reckless anti-DPRK provocative farces of the south Korean puppet authorities are allowed to go on.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Every sin brings its punishment with it.
