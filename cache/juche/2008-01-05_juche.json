            "content": "DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman on Issue of Implementation of October 3 Agreement \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 4 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK released the following statement Friday as regards the delay in the implementation of the October 3 agreement made at the six-party talks: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is beyond Dec. 31, 2007, the deadline set in the Oct. 3 agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is regrettable that points agreed there remain unimplemented except the disablement of the DPRK's nuclear facilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The disablement started early in November last year and all the operations were completed within the \"technologically possible scope\" as of Dec. 31. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At present, the unloading of spent fuel rods scheduled to be completed in about 100 days is underway as the last process. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the delivery of heavy fuel oil and energy-related equipment and materials to the DPRK, commitments of other participating nations, has not been done even 50 per cent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The schedule for the monthly delivery of heavy fuel oil as well as the delivery of energy-related equipment and materials and relevant technical processes are being steadily delayed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has not honored its commitments to cross the DPRK off the list of \"sponsors of terrorism\" and stop applying the \"Trading with the Enemy Act\" against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Looking back on what has been done, one may say that the DPRK is going ahead of others in fulfilling its commitment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the nuclear declaration on which wrong opinion is being built up by some quarters is concerned, the DPRK has done what it should do. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK worked out a report on the nuclear declaration in November last year and notified the U.S. side of its contents. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It had a sufficient consultation with the U.S. side after receiving a request from it to have further discussion on the contents of the report. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the U.S. side raised \"suspicion\" about uranium enrichment, the DPRK allowed it to visit some military facilities in which imported aluminum tubes were used as an exception and offered its samples as requested by it, clarifying with sincerity that the controversial aluminum tubes had nothing to do with the uranium enrichment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the fiction about nuclear cooperation with Syria is concerned, the DPRK stipulated in the October 3 agreement that \"it does not transfer nuclear weapons, technology and knowledge\". This is our answer to this question. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This was also done in line with the prior discussion with the U.S. side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts go to clearly show what is the reason behind the delayed process of the implementation of the October 3 agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Consistent in all agreements reached at the six-party talks including the September 19 joint statement is the principle of \"action for action\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that other participating nations delay the fulfillment of their commitments, the DPRK is compelled to adjust the tempo of the disablement of some nuclear facilities on the principle of \"action for action.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK still hopes that the October 3 agreement can be smoothly implemented should all the participating nations make concerted sincere efforts on the principle of simultaneous action.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In other words, they are again demanding the DPRK dismantle its nuclear weapons first. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The method of settling the pending issues between the DPRK and the U.S. claimed by the U.S. hardliners may serve the purpose of satisfying their self-respect, but it will result in nothing but completely scuttling the process for the denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula and driving the bilateral relations to the lowest ebb. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson Friday warns the U.S. of this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has honored its commitments under the October 3 agreement as it is evidenced by its embarkation upon the phase of disablement in the wake of freezing of nuclear facilities in Nyongbyon under an agreement reached at the six-party talks. Recently the DPRK was compelled to take a measure to slow down the disablement operation due to the delay made by those countries concerned with the six-party talks in honoring the commitments they are obliged to do on the principle of \"action for action\" in step with its process of disablement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts go to prove that whether the goal of the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is attained or not entirely depends on whether the countries concerned including the U.S. honor their commitments or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This notwithstanding, the U.S. hardliners are insisting the DPRK dismantle its nuclear weapons first. This cannot be construed otherwise than a deliberate move to scuttle the process for the denuclearization of the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. hardliners had better behave themselves, bearing deep in mind what a dear price they will have to pay for their thoughtless behavior at this sensitive time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An opportunity is not always available.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
