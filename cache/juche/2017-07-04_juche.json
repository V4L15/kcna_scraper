The forces submitting and kowtowing to the U.S. while going against the nation's aspiration and desire for the earliest reunification of the country under the uplifted banner of national independence should be wiped out of this sacred land.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The deplorable situation, in which outsiders lord it over half of the land of the country and inflict all sorts of disaster and sacrifice on the Korean nation although more than 70 years have passed since the division of its territory at the hands of outsiders against the nation's will, eloquently proves that the road of independence is the only way out for the reunification and the national prosperity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That's why we Koreans, never tolerated the traitors who sacrifice the nation's dignity and interests in pursuance of outsiders, being subservient to the U.S., but dealt heavy blows on them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present south Korean chief executive who is leaving the records of submission to the U.S., while abusing the power granted to him by the candlelight demonstrators, being oblivious of this lesson of history, should clearly understand that he can never be exceptional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What dialogues can be exchanged and how will it be possible to hold hands for the solution of the reunification issue with those who are so much worried about courting displeasure of his master and who take every careful step even on their own land so that their steps would not fall out of their master's steps.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how many times the regimes in south Korea are replaced and whoever holds power, nothing can be expected and can change unless the policy of dependence on foreign forces is replaced by the policy of giving priority to the nation and the old concept of submission and flunkeyism toward the U.S. is replaced by the idea of prioritizing the nation. This is a serious lesson we have drawn once again.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 2. We have to deal heavy blows at the warmongers inside and outside who are bringing escalated tension and crisis of a nuclear war to the Korean peninsula through reckless military actions, in defiance of the fundamental principle of peaceful reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet warmongers, who turned south Korea into the biggest powder arsenal in the Far East and an advance base of a nuclear war for threatening and blackmailing the fellow countrymen with nukes, in defiance of the nation's cherished desire for peaceful reunification, are making desperate efforts to shift the responsibility for the escalated tension on to the DPRK side, faulting its measures for bolstering the capabilities for self-defence whenever opportunity presents itself and shelving their own cursed crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should not run amuck, clearly understanding what catastrophic consequences will entail in case they are inveigled into the outsiders' attempt for a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We have got ourselves fully ready including the ability to mount precision strike to target even the eyes of all sorts of enemies, after putting in place the deterrence for showering the U.S. with bullets and shells of justice any moment. Yet, we are making all possible efforts for the peaceful reunification of the country as we do not want to see the land of the nation getting enveloped in the flame of war and the whole nation getting embroiled in the holocaust of a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The starting point for the genuine peace on the Korean peninsula is the aggressor U.S. imperialists' withdrawal from south Korea with all lethal weapons with them, not the DPRK's \"nuclear dismantlement\", and the first step toward the peaceful reunification is for the south Korean authorities to lay down the arms leveling at the DPRK and responding to the DPRK's measure for defusing military tension. They should pay heed to this advice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 3. The whole nation should pave a wide avenue to reunification by its concerted efforts after resolutely doing away with the evil practices of confrontation and hostility that block the nationwide trend toward the great national unity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even though differing ideologies and social systems have existed in the north and the south for scores of years, there can not be any reason for them not to get united if they put the national commonness and co-interests above all, and the north and the south can certainly hold hands as companions in the road for reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The difference between the ideology and social system can not be a reason for the same fellow countrymen to distrust and stand in confrontation and isms and interests of classes and strata can never be an obstacle preventing the nation from achieving unity. This is our principled stand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the south Korean authorities, shunning such good faith and effort shown by the DPRK, hold their hands with outsiders standing against national reconciliation and unity and incite mistrust and stand-off while faulting the north over the nuclear force, tantamount to a treasure common to the nation, and the non-existent \"human rights issue\". How can the smooth development of the north-south relations be expected?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The great national unity is a short-cut to reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Invariable is the will and faith of the DPRK to open up the new horizon of independent reunification in closer unity, however desperate the separatist forces at home and abroad may get.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will hold hands with anyone who values the nation and courageously turns out for the solution to the reunification issue, but we will neither compromise nor pardon those who still take to the path of treachery, not away from the old concept of sycophancy toward the U.S. and confrontation with the fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement stresses that the DPRK will as ever fulfill its noble mission and responsibility in improving the north-south relations and achieving the independent reunification in line with the requirements and interests of the nation, while consistently holding fast to the three principles of national reunification and their embodiments north-south joint declarations."

Pomminryon will wage a brisk campaign for realizing the solidarity and unity of Koreans of various circles in the north and the south and abroad under the uplifted banner of great national unity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If all Koreans in the north and the south and abroad get firmly united, irrespective of ideology and ism, political view and religious belief, social system and region, that precisely means national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pomminryon will achieve solidarity and unity with all political parties and organizations respecting the three principles of national reunification and the north-south declarations and open the gate to reunification together with them by placing national reunification, the great cause of all Koreans, above all."

Y el movimiento pannacional para la misma causa pudo avanzar con pasos firmes por las coordenadas de victoria frustrando las maniobras obstruccionistas de toda indole de los divisionistas internos y externos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCualquier persona que este preocupada por el futuro de la nacion y desee el nuevo futuro de la patria reunificada, no debe observar con brazos cruzados la realidad de las relaciones Norte-Sur caidas en la peor coyuntura de ruptura y tension sino levantarse con mas coraje sosteniendo como bandera invariable los principios arriba mencionados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsumiendo la importante responsabilidad por el destino de la nacion y recogiendo el deseo de todos los coreanos sobre la mejora de relaciones intercoreanas y la reunificacion del pais, el CC del FDRP expone la siguiente posicion:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Debemos aniquilar a las fuerzas sumisas a Estados Unidos, que se oponen a la aspiracion y demanda de toda la nacion de lograr cuanto antes la reunificacion de la patria bajo la bandera de independencia nacional, de modo que ellas no puedan sobrevivir ni un momento mas en el sagrado territorio patrio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA pesar del transcurso de mas de 70 anos desde la separacion artificial del territorio patrio por las fuerzas foraneas, estas ocupan todavia la mitad e imponen todas las calamidades y sacrificios a los coreanos actuando como duenas. Esta realidad deplorable demuestra elocuentemente que el camino de independencia es la unica via de reunificacion y prosperidad nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor esta razon, la nacion coreana nunca perdono y castigo duro a los traidores vendepatrias que vendieron la dignidad e intereses de la nacion dedicandose al servilismo a las fuerzas extranjeras y a la sumision a EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl actual mandatario surcoreano, quien deja primero las huellas de sometimiento a EE.UU. olvidando esa leccion de la historia y abusando del poder que ha ocupado gracias al apoyo de los manifestantes con velas encendidas, debe conocer que el tampoco puede ser una excepcion.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo habria nada que comunicarse ni se podria trabajar juntos para resolver el problema de reunificacion, aunque se reuna con los que tienen tanto miedo a la perdida de confianza de su patron gringo y andan con sumo cuidado, incluso en territorio propio, para no cometer actos contraproducentes con la idea y la accion de el.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras no se sustituyan la politica de dependencia de las fuerzas foraneas por la de dar primacia a la nacion y el anticuado dogma de servilismo a EE.UU. por la tendencia de dar importancia a la nacion, no hay nada que esperar ni cambiarse aunque se suceda muchas veces el \"poder\" en el Sur de Corea y sea quien fuera el que lo tome. Esto es la seria leccion que volvemos a aprender hoy dia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Hay que infligir un golpe demoledor a los belicistas internos y externos que en desafio a los principios fundamentales de reunificacion pacifica, exacerban la tension y crean la crisis de guerra nuclear en la Peninsula Coreana con sus aventureras acciones militares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin hacer caso del anhelo de los coreanos sobre la reunificacion pacifica del pais, los belicistas titeres surcoreanos convirtieron el Sur de Corea en el mayor polvorin del Extremo Oriente y en la base avanzada de guerra nuclear que amenaza y chantajea con armas nucleares a la parte connacional.  Haciendo vista gorda de su inaudito crimen, ellos intentan cinicamente atribuir a la RPDC la responsabilidad de la agravacion de tension cuestionando las medidas de incremento de las fuerzas de autodefensa nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas deben actuar con prudencia al darse cuenta de cuales son las consecuencias destructivas que sufriran en el momento de sumarse al intento de guerra nuclear de las fuerzas extranjeras.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAunque la RPDC preparo el disuasivo capaz de abrir en cualquier momento el fuego de justicia a la manera de hacer llover bombas en las espaldas de EE.UU. y tiene hasta el poderio de ataque de superprecision contra los enemigos, realiza todos los esfuerzos posibles por la reunificacion pacifica porque no desea que el territorio patrio se envuelva en el nubarron de guerra y toda la nacion sufra las calamidades de esta contienda.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSeria bueno escuchar con seriedad nuestra advertencia de que la paz verdadera de la Peninsula Coreana debe comenzar no por la \"cancelacion nuclear\" de la RPDC sino por el regreso a casa de las tropas norteamericanas con todos sus armamentos mortiferos y de que el primer paso a la reunificacion pacifica se dara cuando las autoridades surcoreanas bajen el fusil apuntado a la parte connacional y respondan a sus medidas para aliviar la tension militar. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Es necesario eliminar todos los vicios de confrontacion y hostilidad, que bloquean la corriente pannacional hacia la gran unidad nacional, y abrir ancho camino a la reunificacion con las fuerzas unidas de todos los coreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi bien en el Norte y el Sur de Corea existen diferentes ideas y regimenes durante varios decenios, no hay motivo por el cual ambas partes no puedan unirse si anteponen la comunidad nacional y los intereses comunes y pueden marchar mano a mano como acompanantes de la causa de reunificacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa diferencia de ideologias y regimenes no puede ser el motivo de desconfianza y confrontacion fratricidas y las doctrinas e intereses de las clases y estratos tampoco podran ser el obstaculo para la unidad nacional. He aqui nuestra posicion de principios.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, las autoridades surcoreanas hacen vista gorda de tal buena fe y esfuerzos de nuestra parte y fomentan la desconfianza y enfrentamiento cuestionando las fuerzas armadas nucleares de la connacional RPDC, patrimonio comun de la nacion, y el inexistente \"problema de derechos humanos\" en confabulacion con las fuerzas ajenas que estropean la reconciliacion y unidad de la nacion. Entonces, ?como se podria esperar el desarrollo normal de las relaciones intercoreanas?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la gran unidad de toda la nacion hay el atajo a la reunificacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSon invariables nuestra voluntad y conviccion de abrir nuevo horizonte de la reunificacion independiente uniendose mas compactamente mientras se tornen mas desesperadas las maniobras de los divisionistas internos y externos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstrecharemos con gusto la mano con cualquier hombre que conceda importancia a la nacion y se levante con valentia para resolver el problema de reunificacion del pais. Pero, no nos conciliaremos ni perdonaremos ni en lo minimo a los tipejos que opten por el camino de traicion y vendepatria sin liberarse del anticuado dogma de sumision proyanqui y confrontacion fratricida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl igual que en el pasado, la RPDC mantendra invariablemente los Tres Principios de la Reunificacion de la Patria y las declaraciones adoptadas entre ambas partes coreanas, criaturas de aquellos, y cumplira con su noble mision y responsabilidad en mejorar las relaciones intercoreanas conforme a la demanda e intereses de toda la nacion y alcanzar la reunificacion independiente."

La APRP librara con mas audacia la lucha por defender la paz duradera de la Peninsula Coreana rechazando los actos belicos de las fuerzas extranjeras y sus satelites que intentan imponer a la nacion coreana los desastres nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesplegara vigorosamente en ambito pannacional el movimiento por la paz y contra la guerra con el objetivo de frustrar tajantemente las tentativas de EE.UU. de convertir todo el territorio coreano en un escenario de guerra nuclear sin tomar en consideracion el destino de la nacion coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDara mas auge a la lucha masiva por expulsar del suelo surcoreano a las tropas norteamericanas y todos los armamentos de guerra nuclear introducidos por las fuerzas extranjeras.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. La APRP intensificara la lucha por la solidaridad y la alianza de diferentes sectores del Norte, el Sur y ultramar levantando a lo mas alto la bandera de gran unidad nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa reunificacion de la patria es precisamente la unidad de todos los coreanos del Norte, el Sur y en ultramar por encima de las diferencias de ideas, ideales, criterios politicos, creencias religiosas, regimenes y regiones. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSujetando lo todo a la reunificacion de la patria, gran empresa comun de la nacion, la APRP se solidarizara y se unira con todos los partidos politicos y entidades dentro y fuera del pais, que respeten los Tres Principios de la Reunificacion de la Patria y las Declaraciones Norte-Sur, para trabajar juntos en el cumplimiento de esa causa nacional."
