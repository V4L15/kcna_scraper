            "content": "Obama Administration Assailed for Preventing Work to Unearth Remains of GIs\r\n Pyongyang, October 13 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Panmunjom Mission of the Korean People's Army issued the following statement on Oct. 13:\n\t\t\t\t\t It was the U.S. that suspended the unearthing of the remains of GIs which had been under way in the territory of the DPRK as part of the extremely hostile policy towards it, but the U.S. Department of Defense recently resorted to the base move to shift the responsibility for it on to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, addressing a ceremony of commemorating \"the day of POWs and missing persons in action\" on Sept. 19, asserted that it was the U.S. stand not to forget those missing GIs in action but find out them to the last one and make sure that they were handed to their families, while claiming that the DPRK was to blame for the failure to resume the unearthing of the remains of GIs in its territory. He talked such rubbish that this problem depends on the implementation of the resolution of the UN Security Council.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Earlier, the U.S. Department of Defense in its statement shamelessly passed the buck for the suspension of the unearthing to the DPRK by claiming as follows: Remains of 229 GIs had been unearthed in north Korea for nearly a decade since 1996 but the work of a U.S. group to unearth those remains was suspended due to the \"threat to the security\" of the group in 2005. It was agreed in October 2011 to resume the work, but the agreement could not be implemented because of the March 2012 ballistic missile launch and nuclear test by the DPRK and various other \"threats of provocations\" and \"the U.S. will maintain its present stance till north Korea shows its will and action to implement the resolution of the UNSC\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to the statement, the above-said work seemed to start and come to suspension at the request of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a matter of fact, the work started at the repeated and earnest requests of the U.S. administration keen to finally settle the issue of the missing GIs killed in the Korean War and the Korean War veterans organization and the bereaved families.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In consideration of the bitter grudge of the Korean people against the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces who inflicted untold misfortune and sufferings upon them at that time and their resolution to take revenge upon them, it was something unimaginable even in a dream for the DPRK to unearth the remains of hateful aggressor troops and hand them to their families.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was impermissible for soldiers of the hostile country to tour territories of the DPRK under the situation where the political and military tension between the DPRK and the U.S. reached an extreme phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the army and people of the DPRK, prompted by their viewpoint on the future, not on the inglorious past, made a broadminded and courageous decision to make sure that the unearthing kicked off in consideration of the earnest desire of the bereaved families to see even remains of their kith and kin who died in the Korean war and get them buried in their native places and the fact that the above-said work is a humanitarian one. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That's why the joint unearthing of the remains of GIs had been under way without any serious deviation for the nearly ten years since 1996 thanks to the unprecedented humanitarian magnanimity on the part of the DPRK even under the situation where the U.S. hostile moves against the DPRK persisted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As regards this, once the authorities including former American presidents, bereaved families and broad public organizations expressed deep thanks to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The said work was suspended not due to the DPRK but due to the U.S. brigandish and unilateral attitude of terming its satellite launch for peaceful purposes \"a provocation.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Consequently, remains of at least  7 800 GIs reported missing during the past Korean war now look like no better than stones as land rezoning and other gigantic nature-remaking projects made progress in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation clearly proves that the words of the authorities concerned of the U.S. that it is the firm stand of the U.S. to negotiate with the DPRK so that the American soldiers who died in overseas battle sites were brought back to the last one and the humanitarian work is a matter different from politics were nothing but a lie and hypocrisy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is long since the organization for surveying and unearthing remains operating in the DPRK was disbanded due to the unilateral measure of suspending the work, pursuant to the U.S. administration's unreasonable hostile policy towards the DPRK\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lots of remains of GIs are left here and there uncared and carried away en masse due to construction projects of hydro-power stations, land rezoning and other gigantic nature-remaking projects, flood damage, etc. These undesirable consequences are the reality today.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHistory will curse and condemn the American administration for its unethical acts of unreasonably scuttling even such humanitarian work as unearthing of remains of GIs agreed by the DPRK and the U.S. owing to its brigandish hostile policy towards the former.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Obama administration should not forget even a moment the proverb saying that even a skeleton cries out of yearning for the homeland."

En octubre de 2011, se logro otro acuerdo sobre la reanudacion de ese trabajo, pero este acuerdo fue incumplido debido al lanzamiento de misil balistico, la prueba nuclear y otras \"amenazas de provocaciones\" de la RPDC en marzo de 2012. Al final, el documento apunta cinicamente que mantendra la presente posicion de suspension hasta cuando el Norte de Corea demuestre la voluntad y acciones de implementar la resolucion del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn vista del tono con que habla el Departamento de Estado, parece que la busqueda de restos mortales norteamericanos fue iniciada y suspendida por la solicitud de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde el principio, ese trabajo comenzo a peticion encarecida y repetida de la administracion norteamericana, la entidad de veteranos de guerra coreana y los familiares de los muertos que deseaban resolver definitivamente el problema de efectivos norteamericanos desaparecidos y muertos en la pasada guerra coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi se tomaba entonces en consideracion el odio y el revanchismo que abrigaba el pueblo coreano contra los agresores norteamericanos quienes al invadir a la RPDC, impusieron incontables desgracias y penalidades, era inimaginable la devolucion de los restos mortales de abominables agresores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDado que llega al climax la confrontacion politica y militar entre RPDC y EE.UU., era inadmisible permitir a los militares del pais enemigo andar en el territorio jurisdiccional de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, tomando en consideracion con vistas al futuro el ardiente deseo de los familiares de los soldados norteamericanos caidos en la pasada guerra coreana de sepultar sus restos mortales en sus propias tierras natales y que el desenterramiento de restos mortales de efectivos norteamericanos era una labor humanitaria, nuestro ejercito y pueblo tomaron  la magnanima decision de iniciar el trabajo de desenterramiento. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe esta manera, aun en medio de las incesantes y tenaz maniobras hostiles a la RPDC de EE.UU., se realizo cerca de un decenio desde 1996 sin alguna dificultad el trabajo conjunto de desenterramiento de restos mortales de efectivos norteamericanos gracias a la magnanimidad humanitaria de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl respecto, expresaron el profundo agradecimiento los ex presidentes y otras autoridades, los familiares de los difuntos y las entidades sociales de EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta obra humanitaria fue suspendida no por la RPDC sino por la actitud gangsteril y unilateral de EE.UU. que cuestiono como \"provocacion\" el lanzamiento de satelite con fines pacificos de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo resultado, los restos mortales de mas de 7 mil 800 uniformados norteamericanos desaparecidos en la pasada guerra coreana vagabundean por el acondicionamiento de la tierra y otras labores para la transformacion de la naturaleza de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl hecho demuestra que no pasan de ser una mentira e hipocresia las palabras de las autoridades interesadas norteamericanas que  decian que es la firme posicion de EE.UU. buscar hasta el ultimo soldado norteamericano caido en los campos de guerra en ultramar y que la labor humanitaria no tiene nada que ver con la politica. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido a la suspension unilateral causada por la injusta politica norteamericana de hostilidad a la RPDC, disolvimos ya hace mucho tiempo el aparato de investigacion y desenterramiento de restos mortales, instituido en la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la actualidad ruedan por el suelo y desaparecen en montones los restos mortales de uniformados norteamericanos desenterrados por la construccion de centrales hidroelectricas, la transformacion de la naturaleza incluso el acondicionamiento de la tierra, las inundaciones, etc. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa historia denunciara siglo tras siglo el crimen de lesa humanidad de la administracion estadounidense que practicando la politica hostil a la RPDC, impide brutalmente hasta las labores humanitarias como el desenterramiento de restos mortales de uniformados norteamericanos, acordado por la RPDC y EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa administracion de Obama no debe olvidar ni un momento el proverbio: \"hasta los restos mortales anoran la tierra natal\"."

Esto revela una vez mas la naturaleza de EE.UU. como perturbador de la paz y estorbador de la reconciliacion y unidad entre ambas partes coreanas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Es una ilusion vana el intento de EE.UU. de alcanzar su objetivo hegemonico con la introduccion de fuerzas armadas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas fuerzas armadas revolucionarias de la RPDC estan preparadas para aniquilar de un golpe a cualesquier fuerzas agresoras. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl emplazamiento rotativo agravara la crisis economica de EE.UU. y adelantara su arruinamiento. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe evacuar cuanto antes a sus tropas del suelo surcoreano justipreciado la tendencia de la epoca y su situacion incomoda."
