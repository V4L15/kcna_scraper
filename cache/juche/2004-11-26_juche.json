It accused the Bush administration of having pursued the aggressive hostile policy toward the DPRK in a bid to isolate and stifle the country.\r\n Recalling the fact that the U.S. listed the DPRK as part of an \"axis of evil\" and openly threatened it with a preemptive nuclear attack, the statement noted: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present U.S. administration deliberately scuttled the DPRK-U.S. dialogue which was started by the Clinton administration with caution and the progress to normalize the relations with the DPRK and has pursued the policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK with fanatic bitterness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is ready to stand in all-out confrontation with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is bound to suffer a defeat in face of all Korean people who have risen up to implement the Songun policy pursued by leader Kim Jong Il, the statement stressed.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

He continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reactionaries are clinging to this law because they are afraid of the independent idea of the popular masses. They are resorting to the crackdown in a bid to cover up their stand of opposing reunification, justify the U.S. forces' presence and domination and send young people to the battlefield in a foreign country for useless sacrifices. The draconic nature of the NSL can never be concealed.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It should build a solid groundwork for the abolition of the NSL and south-north reconciliation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The government should positively opt for lifting the anti-reunification ban on the operation of Internet sites and totally repealing the NSL, mindful that it must deal with all the issues in favour of national reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This tragic reality is attributable to the south Korea-U.S. \"alliance,\" which forces slavish submission upon south Korea, he added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri Kyu Jae, vice-chairman of the South Headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification (Pomminryon), said in order to vent the slain young girls' spite it is necessary to build an independent and reunified country in this land free from the U.S. forces. He called for struggling, united close around Pomminryon under the uplifted banner of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Other speakers at the rally stressed that the anti-U.S. candlelights raised high by people in Kwanghwamun in protest against the verdict of not guilty for the Yankee murderers two years ago remain flaring up still today. They called for making 2005 a year of withdrawal of the U.S. forces from south Korea without fail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the end of the rally the participants marched towards the \"National Assembly\" building.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean Authorities' Action to Cut Off Internet Site Connections under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 25 (KCNA) -- An action taken by south Korea to cut off Internet site connections with the north is an act of going against the era heading for national reconciliation, unity and reunification after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration and a crime against the nation as it is designed to blindfold those south Koreans who wish to know well about the north and build confidence with it and stop their ears, says Rodong Sinmun Thursday in a signed commentary.\r\n As for those Internet homepages which the south Korean authorities have rendered disconnected, they have only disseminated the idea of national independence accepted by all Koreans and dealt with the matters related to reconciliation, unity and independent reunification and, therefore, there is nothing to pose any problem, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The action taken by the south Korean authorities against all Internet homepages related to the north goes to clearly prove that they have not yet gotten rid of an anachronistic conception of confrontation, the practice of negating and antagonizing whatever from the north for no reason. The on-going fuss indicates that the \"south-north reconciliation and cooperation\" much touted by the \"government for people\" in south Korea is nothing but sheer hypocrisy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The inter-Korean relations which have hit low will not be able to escape a total collapse if the south Korean authorities do not stop their acts against the nation and reunification which go against the trend of the times. The authorities are well advised to do soul-searching before talking about the \"opening\" of the north and immediately stop cutting off the above-said Internet site connections.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
