Security Council, professing to be an \"honest state\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through this policy the Japanese Defence Agency sought to calm down the Japanese public criticism of the increasing military burden upon them and divert the attention of the international community by creating the impression that the military spending is made to \"contribute to the improvement of the people's living\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The crafty nature of the Japanese reactionaries is clearly proved by their intention to militarize the civilian industry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their assertion that the application of military technology to the civilian industry can \"serve the purpose of improving the people's living and meeting the interests of economic circles\" is, in essence, nothing but a smokescreen to cover up their true intention to militarize all industries of Japan under a strategic plan and thus build an ecomomic system commensurate with militarization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  This is clearly evidenced by the fact that the defence agency plans to let civilian institutions use the technologies and materials now in use in the \"Self-Defence Forces\" (SDF) such as the guided missile system, missile integrated circuit, main bodies of portable equipment for its units, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is clear that its moves will lead to the expansion of Japan's munition industry and military aggrandizement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should drop its crafty evil practices to escalate the moves for its conversion into a military power, while making a mockery of the world people with sheer sophism, and put a definite end to the dangerous actions for militarization.    \r\n\r\n"

It put forward the slogan \"Let us live our own way \" as its main strategic slogan long time ago and worked out line and policies and established diplomatic relations with other countries guided by its idea and in concordance with its own political system and revolutionary mode, resolutely rejecting flunkeyism and dogmatism. The WPK, guided by the Juche idea founded by President  Kim Il Sung, put forward the single-hearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses as a key link in its efforts for the victory of revolution. it is carrying out the economic construction, pursuant to the line of building an independent national economy, building national defences in accordance with the line of self-reliance and conducting the movement for the country's reunification on the three principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great national \r\n unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The vitality and validity of the independent politics of the WPK were clearly proved by the reality of Korea in the 1990s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this period, temporary trials and difficulties lay in the way of its economic construction and, at the same time, political pressure, economic blockade and military threat of the imperialist allied forces reached a highest pitch. The WPK overcame all of them by carrying through the unique line of the army-first revolution set forth by leader Kim Jong Il. The stronger pressure of the imperialists and the dominationists was, the more firmly the WPK maintained its line and policies in defending the sovereignty of the country and national dignity and openning up a new signal phase in the development of external relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to the independent politics of the wpk the whole nation is optimistic about a bright future of a prosperous nation.     \r\n\r\n"
