There is nothing impossible in the world if people are set in motion ideologically. This is his steadfast will.\r\n   Ours is an invincible powerful state of Juche that is being built with the Marshal's idea of independence and by the idea of singlehearted unity.\r\n   The Korean people are now rallied as one in the great idea of Kim Jong Il and are fighting in the spirit of devotedly defending him. It is their revolutionary traits in building a powerful state.\r\n   Ours is a strong country that is built by his matchless grit and courageous will and a strong fortress of socialism that is set up in the anti-imperialist revolutionary spirit.\r\n   The Korean people's cause of powerful state building is his noble cause for the nation.\r\n   Our powerful state is where his idea of love for the country, nation and people is fully embodied and comes into full bloom.\r\n   The historic march of building the powerful state has already started.\r\n   No force on earth can block this dynamic advance of marchers wisely led by the great marshal. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n"
