            "content": "US-S. Korea Accountable for Derailing Process for Denuclearization \r\n Pyongyang, March 17 (KCNA) -- The reckless moves of the U.S. and the south Korean authorities to ignite a nuclear war have again torpedoed the process for peace and denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.  The Korean Central News Agency released a memorandum on Tuesday denouncing the U.S. for posing a threat of a nuclear war to the DPRK and pursuing a hostile policy toward it and the south Korean authorities for following a reckless policy, pursuant to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t The memorandum says:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military exercises being staged by the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces mean a total denial of the process for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula as they are a test nuclear war of aggression against the DPRK aimed at posing the biggest nuclear threat to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the south Korean authorities assert that the exercises do not pose any problem as they are \"annual ones\" and \"defensive ones\" being not of offensive nature. This is as ridiculous as claiming that even robbery becomes just if it is committed every year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This saber-rattling is the latest version of Team Spirit recorded in history as a test nuclear war for provoking the second Korean war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With nothing can the warmongers deny the aggressive nature of the above-said war maneuvers as a test nuclear war aimed at preempting a strike at the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite illogical for the DPRK to sit at the negotiating table with hostile forces to discuss the issue of dismantling the self-defensive nuclear deterrent as they are brandishing a nuclear sword to mount a surprise attack on it, while paying lip-service to dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The test nuclear war for posing a serious nuclear threat to the DPRK is an extension of the U.S. invariable policy to stifle the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Looking back on history, the U.S. has only pursued a policy to bring down the system in the DPRK, not seeking any solution to the issue based on the respect for sovereignty, as far as its relations with the DPRK are concerned. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. foolish policy to put into practice the policy to stifle the DPRK behind the scene of denuclearization got more undisguised during the Bush administration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. whipped up an atmosphere of international sanctions while describing the launch of Kwangmyongsong-2 as a missile launch. This convinced the DPRK that the present administration does not want to see things going well in the DPRK and it is little different from the preceding administration in pursuing the hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The U.S. maximized the nuclear threat to the DPRK by kicking off such test nuclear war as Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military exercises and is going in the direction of tightening the economic sanctions against the latter, taking issue with the activities of the Korea Taepung International Investment Group and the State Development Bank. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The process for denuclearization cannot make any progress unless the U.S. gives up its sinister intention to bring down the system in the DPRK and stifle its cause, wasting time behind the curtain of denuclearization. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The process for denuclearizing the peninsula has been put at a stalemate entirely because of reckless sycophancy of the south Korean authorities toward the U.S. and their moves to escalate the confrontation of systems as they have created confusion and hurdles in the way of solving the nuclear issue, asserting that \"the north should dismantle its nukes first\" as a servant executing the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even after the DPRK took a series of positive and bold measures to improve the inter-Korean relations recently, the puppet authorities put the above-said assertion as a precondition for warming the inter-Korean relations, scuttling the efforts to settle the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. and escalating the confrontation between the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of traitors declared \"liberal democracy\" as \"a principle and orientation for unification\" right after their seizure of power. They are cooperating with the U.S. in the efforts to realize their scenario to bring down the system in the DPRK and achieve \"unification of systems,\" while asserting that the north should dismantle its nukes first, pursuant to that \"principle.\"   \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The inter-Korean relations can never improve and there can be no environment for solving the nuclear issue on the peninsula as long as the south Korean authorities go mad with standing in the way of the process for denuclearization and kicking up a treacherous nuclear war racket, blinded with the wild ambition to achieve \"unification of systems,\" a sheer delusion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No settlement of the issue on the peninsula can be expected unless the most fundamental issue, ie a war or peace, is solved. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should take substantial steps to put an end to the state of war, hostile relations between the DPRK and the U.S., a military and political root cause of the nuclear issue and the nuclear threat, and build confidence between them."

This fact once again convinces the DPRK that the U.S. hostile policy toward it and Washington's scenario for preemptive nuclear attack remain unchanged.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The action taken by the U.S. can never go with the process for solving the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK was entirely just when it opted for bolstering up its nuclear deterrent for self-defence to cope with the U.S. increasing nuclear threat and its evermore undisguised attempt to attack the DPRK. The DPRK's war deterrent will steadily grow strong as long as the U.S. persistently follows its hostile policy toward the DPRK and escalates the moves for a preemptive nuclear attack on it."
