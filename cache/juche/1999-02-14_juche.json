The statement recalled that the U.S., Japan and the anti-reunification \"government\" of South Korea are resorting to reckless war moves against the DPRK, clamoring about \"suspected underground nuclear facility\" and \"missile threat.\"   It went on:   The U.S. should completely withdraw the \"operation plan 5027\" of aggression and sincerely implement the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework as it is committed to the north.   A peace agreement between the DPRK and the U.S. should be signed as soon as possible and the U.S. troops and nuclear weapons in South Korea,  sources of war, should be withdrawn at an early date, for a lasting stability and peace on the Korean peninsula. \r\n     \r\n"

Korean chief executive anxious to invite Japanese \"Emperor\"\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 14 (KCNA) -- The present South Korean chief executive in an interview with the head of Tokyo Shimbun said on Wednesday it was \"undesirable\" to postpone Japanese \"Emperor's\" visit to Seoul beyond the year 2002, feeling very anxious to invite the Japanese \"ghost\" to South Korea at an early date, according to a report of Tokyo Shimbun.   The Japanese side thinks \"there still remains an obstacle\" in the way of the \"Emperor's\" visit to South Korea in view of strong anti-Japanese feelings of South Koreans, but the South Korean chief executive insisted \"there was no big obstacle,\" the paper said.   Kim Dae Jung is such a man who can not even guess people's anti-Japanese feelings. No sooner had he come to power than he invited the Japanese \"Emperor\" to visit South Korea as his first \"protocol work.\"  During his visit to Japan last October he reinvited the Japanese \"Emperor\" to visit South Korea. He renewed this invitation while meeting the head of the newspaper.   He will certainly face denunciation from the entire nation if he brings the Japanese \"Emperor\" to South Korea, which the successive authority rulers did not dare to do.  \r\n\r\n"
