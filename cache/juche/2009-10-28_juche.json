Therefore, people in Satsuma called the street Koma Street (Koryo Street). Though hundreds of years have passed since then, the song for the memorial service is sung and technical terms used at the kiln sites are still spoken in Korean.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Arita-yaki\", \"hagi-yaki\", \"agano-yaki\" and other ceramics famous in Japan were also manufactured by the Korean porcelain artisans kidnapped to Japan during the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The porcelain culture of Japan is the one entirely based on stealing and kidnapping unprecedented in history."

Por mas grandes que sean esas diferencias Norte-Sur, no podran ser mas grandes que el interes comun de la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPuesto que no pueden existir las clases y capas al margen de la nacion, solo al defender los intereses comunes de la nacion es posible mantener tambien la dignidad e interes de cada integrante de la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ideal de \"Entre nosotros, los connacionales\", ideal de la independencia y la unidad nacionales es la fuerza espiritual que permite al Norte y el Sur  unir las fuerzas para promover la coexistencia, la coprosperidad  e interes  comun y lograr la causa de la reunificacion de la patria por encima de las diferencias de ideologias y regimenes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi absolutizan solo tales diferencias sin tomar en consideracion el interes de la nacion, es imposible mejorar las relaciones intercoreanas y realizar la reconciliacion y la unidad de la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos que quieren hacer aporte a la causa de la reunificacion de la patria apreciando el interes de la nacion con la conciencia nacional deben tratarlos en el principio de no preguntarles su pasado y tomar las manos con ellos. Esto es la invariable posicion de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los coreanos del Norte, el Sur y en ultramar desplegaran con mas vigor la lucha patriotica por lograr la reunificacion de la patria con la bandera de la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio y la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre en alto y no perdonaran ningunas acciones que impiden el mejoramiento de las relaciones intercoreanas y la reunificacion de la patria."
