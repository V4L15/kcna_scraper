Their dirty true colors will remain unchanged no matter how they vociferate about \"new right\" and \"old right\" after bringing together miserable renegades of \"the student movement\" and pro-U.S. hack writers who are prolonging their remaining days by trading off their thoughts and comrades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The league was inaugurated to be spotlighted by such pro-U.S. reptile papers as Chosun Ilbo, Chung-ang Daily and Dong-A Ilbo, but it is nothing but a group of political charlatans whose entity was not recognized even by neo-conservative forces. The position of the GNP and the pro-U.S. hack writers is so deplorable as to send applause to such rabble of imposters.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

Double standards should not be allowed if the nuclear proliferation is to be prevented. The nuclear weapons states should dismantle their nukes among other things as they are committed to doing so under the NPT. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some professors and doctors from various universities including the president of Shambhu Dayal University and the former vice-chancellor of University of Delhi in their speeches assailed the U.S. for standing in the way of nuclear activities of the independent countries for a peaceful purpose and interfering in their internal affairs under the pretexts of the \"nuclear nonproliferation\" and \"anti-terrorism war\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They said that the Songun politics pursued by leader  Kim Jong Il under the present complicated situation is a unique political mode, underscoring in unison the need to more actively organize the study and dissemination of the Juche idea and Songun idea and politics in the days ahead.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It also indicates the basic way of bringing about all-round efflorescence in all fabrics of social life including politics, economy and culture on the principle of giving priority to military affairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the great fruition of the Songun idea that the People's Army is projected as the core of the revolution and its main force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The People's Army is the revolutionary ranks that stand guard over the foremost lifeline of the Korean revolution and it is also the vanguard unit which bears the brunt of socialist construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary idea of Songun set out by Kim Jong Il serves as an immortal revolutionary banner for successfully carrying out new tasks before the era and fully meeting the people's desire and demand.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The greatest crime Japan has committed against the Koreans after Korea's liberation is that it has persistently obstructed the Koreans' efforts for national reunification, the article notes, and goes on:\r\n Had not the Japanese imperialists occupied Korea it would not have been divided. Japan, duly responsible for Korea's division, has persistently hamstrung the efforts for Korea's reunification siding with the U.S. imperialists, far from repenting of and apologizing for its crimes.\r\n To cite just a few examples, Japan has malignantly slandered and categorically rejected many policies and proposals for the independent and peaceful reunification of the country set forth by the Workers' Party of Korea and the DPRK government and their efforts for their materialization. Japan has perpetrated such obstructions in the international arena, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has left no means untried to perpetuate the division of Korea on the basis of its calculation that the continued partition of Korea is favorable in every aspect for attaining its sinister purposes such as economic enslavement of south Korea and reinvasion of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Precisely for this reason the Japanese reactionaries are still persisting in their moves to perpetuate Korea's division. This is proved by the fact that they have hamstrung the cooperation and the process to improve the relations between the north and the south by hook or by crook while pursuing a one-sided policy favorable for south Korea and a hostile policy toward the DPRK from a prejudiced stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation ardently wishes earlier reunification of Korea. The world peace-loving people also desire it. But the Japanese reactionaries are going against such mindset. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' vicious obstructions to the reunification of Korea are an intolerable challenge and double crime against the Koreans. They will have to pay a high price for those acts one day.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It also serves as the motive force of advancing the June 15era for reunification as it is the just and unique politics to meet the desire and interests of the nation and the requirement of the prevailing situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun politics gives a powerful impetus to the implementation of the joint declaration while beefing up the driving force of national reunification in every way. It also propels the movement for national reunification to make a dynamic advance along the orbit of national reunification without slightest deviation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun politics also helps widen the road of national reconciliation and unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is entirely thanks to the arms of Songun that the Koreans in the north and the south have widened the road of reconciliation and unity peacefully,\r\nnot sustaining the disaster of a war even under the acute situation that tension is being escalated and the dark clouds of a new war are being\tbrought by the imperialists, the article says, concluding that the prospect of the June 15 era for reunification is bright as long as there is theSongun politics.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
