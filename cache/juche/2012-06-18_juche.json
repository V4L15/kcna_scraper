He, talking about \"threat from north Korea\", said that the U.S. military would make its implementation a priority.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. Defense Department announced on June 13 that the U.S.-Japan-south Korea joint military exercises, first of its kind, would be staged from June 21 in the West and South Seas of Korea and a U.S. nuclear-powered carrier would take part in the exercises. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There took place in Washington on June 14 a military confab between American master and south Korean servants to discuss the issues of stepping up U.S. arms buildup in south Korea and making south Korea an advance base for the implementation of the U.S. strategy for domination over Asia. This is a wanton violation of the Armistice Agreement and an open provocation against the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is apt to vociferate about the \"provocation\" by the DPRK, but the facts prove that it is an arch criminal who escalates military tension by pursuing hostile policy towards the DPRK and making military provocations against it one after another. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The aim sought by the U.S. in intentionally aggravating the situation of the Korean Peninsula is to lay hurdles in the general advance of the DPRK for stepping up economic construction and improving people's living standard, and turn south Korea into a servant executing its war policy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. arms buildup moves in south Korea is a prelude to a regional war targeting not only the DPRK but also several Northeast Asian countries as they threaten the peace and security of the region, to say nothing of the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is watching with high vigilance the U.S. preparations for war being expanded in a phased manner. It will increase its self-defence capabilities in every way to protect sovereignty and dignity of the country and nation."
