That was why Japan's \"peace constitution\" after the Pacific War codified the renunciation of the right of belligerency based on the \"right to self-defense\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, Japan, which remains listed as an \"enemy state\" by the UN charter, is now letting its cabinet members call for the legalization of the war doctrine, claiming the face and right of \"normal state\" which is recognized by nobody. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan truly wants to be recognized by the world community as a normal state, it should make an honest repentance and apology for the crimes committed in the last century, far from calling for the aggressive \"right to collective self-defense\".     \r\n\r\n\r\n"
