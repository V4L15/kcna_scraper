Is it a peaceful and diplomatic solution?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. blustered that it would not rule out \"military option\" while making absurd assertion that the sanctions are a peaceful solution. This constitutes an open extortion against the international community as it implies that if they do not join the U.S.-led sanctions campaign against the DPRK, the U.S. will start a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The true intention of the U.S. is to appease the opposition from several countries against the escalation of tension and the outbreak of war in the Korean peninsula and the region and involve them in the sanctions and pressure campaign against the DPRK by all means.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Although the U.S. is acting so shameless and devious to justify the sanctions and pressure against the DPRK, it will not be able to delude even a single country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a foolish dream to hope that the sanctions could work with the DPRK while the sanctions have failed to stop it from becoming a full-fledged nuclear weapons state and making rapid progress in the building of an economic power for more than half a century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The increased moves of the U.S. and its vassal forces to impose sanctions and pressure on the DPRK will only increase our pace towards the ultimate completion of the state nuclear force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The countries joining the U.S. in imposing sanctions on the DPRK should start working on a good explanation for the day when an actual balance of power is established between the DPRK and the U.S."

Attempt to improve the DPRK-U.S. relations always \"failed\" due to the U.S. opposition. The DPRK came to a conclusion that the only way for escaping from the threat of aggression is to have access to nuclear deterrent and that's why the DPRK's access to practical and operational missiles tipped with nuclear warheads is the key to deterring outsiders from invasion and stabilizing the situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Indian paper Hindustan Times said Trump pursues sanctions and pressure from which his predecessors had already suffered a flop and in fact they are regarded as war action because they are all-out economic blockade of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The former professor at Dallas university of the U.S. said that sanctions which the U.S. used as a main tool to effect its foreign policy, are in fact a war action tantamount to dropping bombs over the heads of the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A Russian expert asserted that crisis historically occurred owing to the joint military drills staged by south Korea and the U.S. and, in a nutshell, the main blame falls on the U.S. and south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t British newspaper Daily Star, U.S. media Politico and other world media expressed concern over the fact that the U.S. is sending its cutting-edge military hardware to the Korean peninsula to step up its military muscle-flexing under the pretext of the DPRK's ICBM-ready H-bomb test.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What led to the DPRK's access to nuclear weapons? Who is chiefly to blame for the terrible situation on the peninsula which has reached an impasse today?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t World media and experts have offered answers to this question.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality has proved the DPRK was entirely just when it has taken a series of toughest measures to defend itself from the U.S. constant military threat and moves of aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The further the U.S. pursues military standoff with the DPRK, the worse its position will get.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Unless the U.S. renounces its anachronistic hostile policy and nuclear threat and blackmail toward the DPRK, the DPRK will more loudly beat the drum of victory declaring the ruin to the U.S. imperialists."
