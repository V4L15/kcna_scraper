Alejandro Cao de Benos, chairman of the Association for Friendship with the Korean People, said this in a letter sent to the chief of the Pyongyang Mission of the National Democratic Front of South Korea on Aug. 12.\r\n The south Korean people have long been deceived by the imperialists' propaganda that Korea's division is necessary for \"security,\" the letter noted and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But today they understand that the U.S. trumpeters are little different from the robbers aboard the U.S. armed pirate ship \"General Sherman.\" The U.S. imperialists keep south Korea under their occupation to vandalize culture of Korea, plunder it of its resources and use young and middle aged Koreans as cannon fodder. This can never be tolerated any more. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will never stop activities for solidarity with the Korean people till the last man of the U.S. aggressor troops has quit south Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is nothing but a criminal attempt to foil the probe into the truth behind the past history, stamp out what has been achieved by the movement for independence, democracy and reunification and bring back the old era of dictatorship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP far-fetchedly insisted that the issue of \"pro-north and pro-communism\" be included in the objects to be probed after reluctantly responding to the campaign for probing the truth behind the past history which enjoys full support and approval from people of all social strata. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people from all walks of life in south Korea should positively struggle to probe the truth behind the past history in order to sternly condemn the crimes of the traitorous party and decisively frustrate the pro-U.S. right-wing forces just as they punished the GNP during the presidential election and the National Assembly election for going against the mind-set of the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the present, they should brand the quislings of the Democratic Republican Party (DRP), the ancestor of the GNP, as the second group of traitors of 1905 as they received tens of millions of US dollars from Japan as a quid pro quo for signing the \"south Korea-Japan agreement\", a new fact disclosed these days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should lift their voices strongly demanding a thorough probe into the case and a severe punishment of them. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is triggering off deep concern and resentment among the world people desirous of a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue and the peace and security on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are standing further isolated internationally than ever before. It is by no means a temporary phenomenon but an inevitable product of the policy of aggression pursued by the successive U.S. governments, particularly, the policy of unprecedentedly bellicose high-handed practices, unilateralism and hegemony frantically followed by the Bush administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ours is the era of independence in which all the progressive people of the world are standing up against all sorts of domination and subjugation and many more countries are going in for independence. Even those capitalist countries, which once considered the U.S. as \"protector,\" \"savior\" and \"helper\", are opposed to the U.S. control and subjugation and aspiring after autonomy and independence. The anti-U.S. sentiment prevailing throughout the world has become an irresistible trend of the present times.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They spoke in excited tone of the benevolent fatherly love shown by Kim Jong Il for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Teaching staff and students attending the ceremonies hardened their determination to make big achievements in education and study, cherishing deep in mind the trust reposed by the party and the state in the younger generation and the advantages of the socialist educational system.
