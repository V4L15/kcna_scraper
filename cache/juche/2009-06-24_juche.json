At the same time, they worked out a prearranged plan to conceal the armed aggression after the outbreak of the Korean war in an attempt to shift the responsibility for the war provocation on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs seen above, the Korean war was a war of aggression started by the U.S. imperialists with full preparation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. magazine Life disclosed the fact that it was the first since the beginning of history that the Korean war had been fully prepared before its start.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe historical facts evidently show that the U.S. imperialists are the provoker of the Korean war and the heinous enemy who imposed dreadful holocaust upon the Korean people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNevertheless, they, who resorted to every conceivable trick to shift the responsibility for the outbreak of the Korean war to the DPRK while distorting the history, are running amuck to provoke another Korean war today.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe United Nations Security Council, at the instigation of the U.S., adopted a \"resolution on sanctions\" against the DPRK on June 12, taking issue with its second nuclear test.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is another foul product of the U.S.-led international oppression to disarm the DPRK and to suffocate it economically for forcing the Korean people to give up their idea and system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf the U.S. imperialists start another war, ignorant of the ignominious defeat they had sustained in the past Korean war, the army and people of Korea will determinedly answer \"sanctions\" with retaliation and \"confrontation\" with all-out confrontation, the counter-measure based on the Songun idea, wipe out the aggressors on the globe once and for all and achieve the cause of national reunification without fail."

It is chiefly to blame for seriously threatening and disturbing global peace and security. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present U.S. administration is loudmouthed about \"changes\" and \"multilateral cooperative diplomacy\" but is as keen on the arms build-up as the Bush administration which put spurs to it under the pretext of \"war on terrorism\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In case of the U.S. the increased military expenditure precisely means arms build-up and it is aimed to escalate the military actions for aggression.

            "content": "U.S. Urged to Draw Lesson from Its Defeat in Korean War\r\nPyongyang, June 24 (KCNA) -- The armed provocations perpetrated by the U.S. imperialists in areas along the 38th parallel were premeditated military actions to ignite an all-out war in the light of their scale, persistency and repetition, etc. and a prelude to the Korean war. The U.S. imperialists were the arch criminals who masterminded these provocations and with no rhetoric can they cover up the criminal nature of those actions. \n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says this in a signed article.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It cites facts to prove that the U.S. imperialists which had been greedy for the Korean Peninsula since long time ago occupied south Korea after the second World War, established a system of \"military rule\" and worked hard to provoke a war in a bid to dominate the whole of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The article goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The aim sought by the U.S. imperialists in perpetrating ceaseless armed provocations against the northern half of Korea in areas along the 38th parallel was to help the south Korean puppet army build actual combat capability so that it might be used as bullet-shields for them during the war of aggression against the north, weaken the defence by the Korean security forces stationed there and spy on the military forces of the north and their deployment. Through these acts they also sought the aim to aggravate the situation in an effort to create conditions favorable for launching a war and go over to an all-out war when their ceaseless armed provocations prove successful.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists started the Korean war while going busy with armed provocations against the DPRK at that time but drank a bitter cup of defeat. Instead of drawing a lesson from it, they are getting frantic with the moves to provoke the second Korean war, obsessed with their ambition for aggression of Korea, the article notes, and warns: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. imperialists misjudge the strength and will of the DPRK's army and people and ignite a new war at any cost, they will suffer a more disgraceful defeat than what they did during the Korean war in the 1950s."

The U.S. remains unchanged in its policy towards the DPRK aimed at antagonizing it and seizing it by force of arms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. ever-more undisguised scenario to invade the DPRK found a vivid manifestation in the facts that it is escalating its rackets of international \"sanctions\" and \"pressure\" upon the DPRK, malignantly slandering its launch of a satellite and nuclear activities for self-defence and made a promise to provide \"a nuclear umbrella\" to the south Korean authorities in \"contingency\" on the Korean Peninsula, hinting at its start of a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has become more apparent than ever before that lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula would be unthinkable without putting an end to the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK and its moves to isolate and suffocate the latter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. had better roll back as early as possible its hostile policy towards the DPRK, the leftover of the outdated era of confrontation, which runs counter to the trend of the times towards peace and reunification, concludes the article."

The Japan \"Self-Defense Forces\" have emerged leading aggression forces after growing in numerical strength and quality strong enough to fight any overseas war of aggression. Japan has emerged an aggression force and a war state equipped with perfect and modern offensive armed forces system. Not content with this, it is keen to have in place armed forces for aggression and attack by introducing new-type fighters and other military hardware from the U.S. in a craftier manner. This proves that its wild ambition for overseas expansion has reached an extreme phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries would be well advised to stop going reckless, well aware that their reckless moves to become a military power and launch overseas expansion would only throw Japan into an abyss of ruin."

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun califica a EE.UU. de amenazador a paz y seguridad\r\nPyongyang, 24 de junio (ATCC) -- Segun el recien publicado informe anual del Instituto Internacional de la Paz de Estocolmo de Suecia, Estados Unidos ocupo el primer lugar en el ano pasado en la cantidad de los gastos militares que alcanzo el 42 % de la totalidad de los fondos desembolsados por ese concepto en todo el mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esto demuestra que ese imperio es el mayor inversor en el area militar y \"campeon\" del incremento de gastos militares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Asi senala el periodico Rodong Sinmun en un comentario individual del dia 24 y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  EE.UU. es el autor que amenaza y destruye gravemente la paz y la seguridad del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Lo que no podemos pasar por alto es que la actual administracion norteamericana, que habla tanto del \"cambio\" y la \"diplomacia de cooperacion multilateral\",  recurre al aumento de gastos militares al igual que su antecesor ejecutivo de Bush que dio acicate al incremento de las fuerzas armadas bajo el pretexto de la \"guerra antiterrorista\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La crecida de gastos militares de EE.UU. significa precisamente el aumento armamentista para intensificar las acciones militares agresivas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Tomar la heguemonia mundial con la fuerza armada, o sea, a base de la absoluta superioridad militar deviene el objetivo estrategico y la invariable ambicion de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Tales movimientos del imperio devienen el acto antipaz que fomenta la carrera armamentista y la confrontacion militar en la arena mundial y agrava la situacion internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  EE.UU. recrudece la ofensiva de presion militar contra la RPDC, que marcha levantando a lo mas alto la bandera de independencia y la socialista, considerandola como la espina atravesada en su garganta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En particular, amenaza a la RPDC con desatar la guerra nuclear prometiendo al Sur de Corea y Japon la entrega del \"paraguas nuclear\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por lo tanto, es muy justo que la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea haya fortalecido su disuasivo nuclear autodefensivo para hacer frente a tal amenaza.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Bajo la critica situacion de hoy en que se exacerba la carrera armamentista y se destruye gravemente la paz, la RPDC consolidara mas y mas su disuasivo de guerra bajo la bandera del Songun (priorizacion militar) para defender el derecho a la existencia, la soberania y la seguridad del pais y la nacion."
