This is a dangerous military step taken by the Japanese reactionaries to carry out the plan for bombing the socalled \"missile base\" in the DPRK after examining it long ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarist forces are emerging as dangerous aggression forces as they are openly stepping up the preparations for overseas aggression after working out even the top-secret war scenario. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Japanese reactionaries are persistently opting for reinvasion of Korea, it will only lead them to destruction. \r\n\r\n"
