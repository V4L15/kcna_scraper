He was pleased with scenery, noting that words would fail to fully describe the beautiful and fascinating scene of the illuminated street.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round various construction sites of the street to learn in detail about the construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Learning that the outer walls of the 70-storeyed apartment house were successfully tiled in a short span of time in an impeccable manner by solving the scientific and technological issue arising in tiling outer wall in cold weather, he said that it looks very nice. It was a good idea to install solar panels on the sunny wall so that they may have decorative effect and generate electricity, he added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that not only skyscraping apartment houses but also multi- storeyed apartment houses have been built in such a peculiar style that they have their features, stressing that Ryomyong Street where both architectural structures stand in good harmony is an icon and standard of modern avenue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said he felt as if he were seeing the happy people who would settle in Ryomyong Street. He noted he was very pleased to think that he became able to keep the promise he made to people to complete the construction of the street till the Day of the Sun and that he would soon share again joy with them. He called for doing whatever difficult job under any circumstances, if it is favored by the people and if it is in their interests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He set forth tasks to be fulfilled to wind up the construction of the street.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ryomyong Street, which is under way with self-reliance and self-development as the dynamic force, will shine as a street reflecting the Party's plan to build a powerful country without fail despite vicious obstructions of the U.S. imperialists and other hostile forces, a street built with the might of a harmonious whole of the Party and the masses, a street at a high-level of socialist civilization, a street demonstrating the inexhaustible economic potentials of Juche Korea and a fairyland in the era of the Workers' Party, which tells the world it can do anything if it has a will and live better than others in its style, he stressed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said only 30 days are left before the Day of the Sun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He ardently called again upon all the builders to dash ahead like the wind towards the finish line and thus successfully build the street as a monumental edifice in the era of the Workers' Party and strikingly demonstrate the invincible national power of socialist Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accompanying him were Hwang Pyong So, Kim Jong Gwan and Ma Won Chun."

This notwithstanding, the United States with a view to overthrowing those unfavorable countries mobilized the UN Security Council to manipulate the sanctions resolutions one after another on Iraq in 1990, Yugoslavia in 1991 and Libya, Cambodia, Somalia, Liberia and Rwanda in 1992.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"sanctions resolutions\" of the UN against the DPRK are criminal documents devoid of legality, morality and impartiality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The UNSC started its scandalous path taking side with the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK by fabricating its \"Resolution 82\", \"Resolution 83\", and \"Resolution 84\" that \"legalized\" the aggression war of the U.S. imperialists against the DPRK in the 1950s and the participation of the \"UN forces\" therein.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The rackets of the UNSC adopting \"sanctions resolutions\" against the DPRK are reaching extremes today with a starting point of the \"Resolution 825\" railroaded to withhold its decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) in May 1993 and force it to return to cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Last year, too, the UNSC under instigation of the U.S. again committed the acts of arrogation and violation of the DPRK's sovereignty by manipulating the \"sanctions resolutions\" 2270 and 2321 while reviling the DPRK's H-bomb test and explosion test of nuclear warhead to safeguard its sovereignty as a \"threat\" to international peace and security.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches are just and righteous self-defensive measures to safeguard the sovereignty and right to existence to cope with the nuclear threat of the U.S. persisting for more than half a century and they do not run counter to any international law including Article 51 (right to self-defense) of the UN Charter. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A forum of international legal experts to clarify legal ground of the UN \"sanctions resolutions\" against the DPRK should be organized immediately.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The UN \"sanctions resolutions\" against the DPRK are not the issue confined to the DPRK alone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the UN history spanning more than 70 years shows, if the DPRK became the target of UN \"sanctions\" today, another state will become their target tomorrow.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prevailing reality fully shows that organizing the forum of international legal experts to investigate the legal ground of ''sanctions resolutions'' is all the more pressing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The forum of international legal experts is the place where the legality of \"sanctions resolutions\" can be clarified fairly from the international law perspective. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On March 13, 2017, the permanent mission of the DPRK to the UN proposed the UN Secretariat that governmental and non-governmental experts from all states and international legal organizations attend the forum as they wish and the agenda of the forum be agreed upon reasonably in full reflection of the wishes and opinions of the attendants.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The UN Secretariat should, in accordance with its basic mission of maintaining international peace and security, fulfill its responsibility before the international community by positively responding to this proposal on organizing the forum of international legal experts to clarify the legal ground of the ''sanctions resolutions'' against the DPRK."
