            "content": "Kim Jong Il gives on-site guidance to Jagang Province\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 17 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il directed the work in different fields of the national economy in Jagang Province.  Accompanying him were chief secretary of the Jagang provincial committee of the WPK Yon Hyong Muk, secretary Jon Pyong Ho and first vice department directors Pak Song Bong, Ri Yong Chol and Choe Chun Hwang of the WPK Central Committee. During his on-site guidance General Secretary Kim Jong Il inspected the Hyangha Revolutionary Site, large hydroelectric power stations, newly-built minor power stations, industrial establishments, co-op farms and other units.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He went to the Hyangha Revolutionary Site.   The Hyangha Revolutionary Site is a historic place where the President Kim Il Sung wisely commanded the counteroffensive operation in December 1950 in the period of the Fatherland Liberation War.\r\n   Kim Jong Il said that education in the site should be intensified to arm the servicemen and civilians more thoroughly with the revolutionary idea of the president.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHe also guided the work at the Jangjagang Power Station and the Kanggye Youth Power Station, the nation's giant electricity producers.    Noting that workers and technicians at the stations have done a lot of things over the past years to meet the nation's demand for electricity, he gave a high appreciation to them. Then he met innovators and pep-talked to them and posed for a souvenir picture with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAfter that he went round Janggang Kunmin Youth Power Station no.3, Pukchon Power Station no.2 and other minor power stations, which have been built by the province itself.    He expressed great satisfaction at those newly-built stations and highly appreciated the builders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nKim Jong Il guided the work at the Amnokgang Tire Plant and Kanggye Tractor Complex.\r\n   He was deeply satisfied to see various production processes and had a photograph taken with innovators there.   Then he visited the Kosan Co-op Farm in Mapho city, Janggang County Township Co-op Farm and Mapho Cocoon Farm to guide the work there.\r\n   While looking round the self-reliance center, greenhouse and fields of the farm, he highly praised agricultural workers for their devoted efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   After acquainting himself in detail with the overall economic performance in Jagang Province, he laid down on the spot highly important tasks which serve as a guideline in placing the national economy in the province on a new plane. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  He proposed tasks to further develop the power industry. He said that the existing large power stations should run at full capacity to fully meet the rapidly increasing requirements for electricity.   He underscored the need to improve the management of equipment and technical management so as to ensure full capacity generator operation and widely introduce new advanced technology to steadily raise the efficiency of water turbine generators.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Calling for the construction of more minor power stations as well as large power stations to increase the electricity production, he said:   It is very gratifying that in recent years Jagang Province built 332 minor power stations by itself to solve the electricity problem and it keeps building many power Stations to round off the electrical heating.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This stirring reality clearly proves the validity and vitality of the Worker's Party of Korea policy on extensively building minor power stations along with large ones.   As rivers and streams are found everywhere in our country, it is necessary to build economically efficient minor power stations in good quality as Jagang Province has done.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Jong Il also put forward tasks to keep production going at a high level.\r\n   He called for steadily boosting the production by actively tapping its potentials in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Saying that if officials meticulously organize economic performance in keeping with a high degree of enthusiasm of the masses, it is possible to significantly increase the production, he stressed the need to boost the production of manufactured goods for different  domains of the national economy and thus contribute to the building of a powerful nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He elaborated on the tasks to lift the production of grain, live-stock products, industrial crops and  consumer goods.   He set forth tasks to thoroughly establish cultured practices in both life and production and improve supply service for the working people.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At the end of his on-site guidance, he, together with workers, saw an art performance given by workers in Kanggye area.\r\n   He expressed great satisfaction at the art performance symbolic of worker's revolutionary and militant spirit and highly appreciated their successful performance. \r\n\r\n"

The question of preserving the national character is a matter  vital to the rise and fall of the nation.   Every nation should  hold aloft the banner of valuing and maintaining national character. Only by doing so can a nation survive and prosper.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the mental character of the Korean people that  they mercilessly  beat back the aggressors who encroach upon sacred national sovereignty and dignity even a bit.   The Korean people's spirit of national independence is  characterized by the spirit of devotedly defending the leader, the spirit of overcoming all difficulties  through self-reliance and the spirit of becoming human bombs and bullets.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  \"A man is strong if he trusts  in himself, weak if he relies on others.\"  \"He who relies on himself will prosper = he who  relies on others will perish.\" \"Live our own way fight our own way, create our own way.\" These are some of Kim Jong Il's aphorisms replete with  the spirit of national independence. These serve as the flesh and  blood  of the Korean people and the mainstay of their view on life and world outlook.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people are  looking upon Kim Jong Il as the supreme incarnation of national character as he  restored the legitimacy, eternity, purity and superiority of the history of the Korean nation.\r\n   Saying that the Korean people sing songs in their national melody, dance to the national tune, prefer to national style and live their own way,  the chairman stressed the exploit  performed by  Kim Jong Il by bringing national character into full bloom is immortal. \r\n\r\n"

This is a very ill-boding step.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   \"Hinomaru flag\" and \"Kimigayo\" were a  medium and symbol used by Japanese in aggression. However, the Japanese did not legalize \"Hinomaru flag\" and \"Kimigayo\"  as the national flag and anthem, though they had been  customarily used for a long time.    The present Japanese reactionary ruling quarters, however, are working hard to legalize them as the national flag and anthem, putting the Japanese imperialists into the shade.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This proves that the Japanese militarist forces are going to set out on an overseas aggression, flying \"Hinomaru flag\" and singing \"Kimigayo\" as the \"imperial army\" did in the past. It will definitely lead them to ruin.\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries are well advised to calm hysterics of suicidal aggression. \r\n\r\n"

Korean dance, a legacy of the Korean nation, which mirrors the people's life feelings, has served as a vigorous and sensitive medium of entertainment and recreation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In oriental dancing generally, the accent falls upon the movements of the upper part of the body, including arms, in contrast to the western form with postures usually accented on the lower half, such as the feet.   Oriental dance movements differ in various countries. Hand movements form the basic factor in southeast Asia.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In Korean dancing, the entire weight is brought upon arm movements by a judicious combination of feet movements. Harmonious bodily movement with an organic combination of the movements of arms and feet is one of the characteristics of Korean dance.   Another characteristic is correspondingly expressed in the flow or rhythm. The dance action is, in essence, soft, gentle and life-giving.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Its speed is moderate and its rhythm is delicate and charming.   All the movements, large and small, are well-coordinated. Every motion is not confined to a particular region of the body but the rhythm flows to all parts of the body--head, shoulders, hands, waist and feet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such rhythm is formed by bodily movements that arise from Korean noble character and emotion.   The Korean dance mainly adapted from traditional forms is now at its highest point of development. \r\n\r\n"
