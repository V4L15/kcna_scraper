Korea denounced\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, October 31 (KCNA) -- Kim Chol Min, a political critic of South Korea, published an article headlined \"Comment on call for 'U.S. troops' continued presence after Korea's reunification'\", the Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The call is aimed at the government \"security\" of the present South Korean chief executive, reunification under the \"system of liberal democracy\" and the realization of the U.S. \"dominationist strategy for unipolar world\", the article said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   After taking the \"presidential seat\" Kim Dae Jung called on his master, the United States, and said that the U.S. forces should remain in South Korea even after the reunification of Korea. This is because the U.S. forces present in South Korea are blocking the anti-\"government\" advance of the democratic patriotic forces with strength and supporting the \"security\" of his government power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Kim Dae Jung group, quickly mindful of the U.S. military strength in South Korea and its need for  permanent presence, advocated the \"continued presence of the U.S. forces after the reunification of Korea\" and thus curried favour with the master and concocted a plot for the escape from the crisis, \"security\" of the government power and maintenance of vested rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Against this background, the call for \"permanent presence of the U.S. forces after the reunification\" came into being. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The call is one for the anti-national flunkeyist treachery which is aimed at killing the fellow countrymen in the north with the help of the U.S. forces in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   By \"reunification,\" the Kim Dae Jung group means reunification under the \"system of liberal democracy\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His argument about \"three stages for reunification\" means to introduce \"liberal democracy\" and market economy in the north through exchange, instill bourgeois ideas into it, induce it to \"change for peaceful transition\" and thus achieve the \"reunification\" under the manipulation of South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such attempt for \"reunification\" sought by the Kim Dae Jung group is a dangerous act as it presupposes the help of the U.S. forces present in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The call for the independent reunification through alliance with the north is a manifestation of patriotism and a crystal of the consciousness of kinship and unity with fellow countrymen, whereas call for reunification under the \"system of liberal democracy\", dependent upon foreign forces, is a revelation of treachery and a product of hostile consciousness toward the fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The call for \"the permanent presence of the U.S. forces in South Korea after the reunification\" directly serves for the realization of the U.S. \"dominationist strategy for unipolar world,\" lays a stumbling block in shaping of the destiny of the Korean nation and aims to reverse the trend of global independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. policy-makers regard the Korean peninsula located in the crossroad in East Asia as a military and geo-political vantage point for U.S. supremacy in the 21st century and \"domination for unipolar world\" and claim that the U.S. forces should be kept in South Korea for an indefinite period after the reunification of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The call is also used for defending the U.S. ulterior intention to dominate and plunder not only the Korean peninsula but also the nations and peoples of all countries on the planet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Hence one can come to the following conclusion= firstly, the call is one for aggressive permanent occupation of South Korea which is directly serving for the U.S. military strategy for dominating the Korean peninsula and the strategy for unipolar  world= secondly, it is reactionary one which is aimed at emasculating the independent development of the Korean nation and people and reversing the trend of global independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Kim Dae Jung group must reflect on its arch crimes and step down at once. \r\n\r\n"

The planned stockpile of 100 tons of nuclear material by 2010 is for nuclear armament. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   \"Three non-nuclear principles\" are no more than nominal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This shows nuclear armament is obviously the state policy of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese authorities must act with discretion, mindful of what consequences their overseas aggression and nuclear armament will bring about. \r\n\r\n"
