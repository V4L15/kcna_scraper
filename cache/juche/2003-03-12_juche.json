            "content": "DPRK-U.S. direct talks called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 11 (KCNA) -- The nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula is not an issue to be solved through multilateral talks but it is quite possible to find a solution to the issue if the DPRK and the U.S. sit face to face for sincere discussion. Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says this in a signed commentary.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush group is insisting on multilateral talks, turning its face from the proposal for DPRK-U.S. direct talks. It asserted that \"the nuclear issue is not concerned with the U.S. and North Korea only but an issue affecting Northeast Asia and the whole world.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. much publicized multilateral talks are, in essence, aimed to evade its responsibility for authoring the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This issue should be solved between the DPRK and the U.S. it is none other than the U.S. that poses a nuclear threat to the DPRK. The U.S. is insisting on its far-fetched assertion that North Korea is posing a \"threat\" to the security of the U.S. It is the DPRK and the U.S. that stand in confrontation over the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By calling for multilateral talks the U.S. means letting other countries stand in its stead. This is not the stand and attitude to solve the problem but an act of evading its responsibility. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK-U.S. negotiations are neither a sort of reward to be given by one party to the other party nor a business dealing in which one party makes a profit while the other party suffers a loss. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. ever-increasing pressure on the DPRK to bring it to its knees by force would only make a clash unavoidable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. turns to a military option in the end, persistently turning down the DPRK principled proposal for direct talks it will lead to a catastrophic situation.    \r\n\r\n"

It is a height of folly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, a product of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK, it is an issue to be solved between the DPRK and the U.S. through dialogue and negotiations in view of its origin and the circumstances of its outbreak. Therefore, Japan has no justification to meddle in it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's much talk about the DPRK's \"nuclear issue\" only proves that it is behaving without any principle just to join the U.S. in its anti-DPRK nuclear racket. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such moves diametrically run counter to the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration and are anachronistic acts intended to justify the unprecedented crimes Japan committed against the Korean people in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the most urgent outstanding issue in normalizing the relations between the two countries for Japan to apologize and compensate for its past colonial rule over Korea. That's why the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration referred to this issue, among other things, and Japan admitted, in the spirit of humility, the facts of history that it caused tremendous damage and pain to the Korean people during its colonial rule over Korea and expressed its heart-felt apology and repentance of them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that the abnormal relations between the two countries can not be put on a right track unless Japan redeems its past, a key point of the Pyongyang declaration and a key link in normalizing the bilateral relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should refrain from breaking its faith with the DPRK in violation of the spirit of the declaration, toeing the U.S. line. It should not forget its commitment but opt for redressing its past, to begin with.    \r\n\r\n"

If the U.S. is really concerned over the DPRK's missile, why is it not opting to conclude a non-aggression treaty with the DPRK? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. does not want to conclude such a treaty because it considers it more important to steadily increase its pressure on the DPRK, while fanning up war hysteria. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. media are raising a hue and cry over the DPRK's missile test fire which has not been confirmed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. political circle does not deny that the war scenario against Iraq can be orchestrated in Korea, too.    \r\n\r\n"
