Calling on the plant to modernize the steel casting shop till the founding anniversary of the WPK this year under the strong backing of the party, he took a measure for doing so.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He set forth the tasks to be fulfilled by the plant, underscoring the need to dynamically push ahead with the modernization of all production processes under a long-range plan while carrying out the project for updating the steel casting shop.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed expectation and belief that the officials and workers of the plant would perform miracles and feats in producing modern highly-efficient machines and equipment as intended by the party, always bearing in mind they have a very important duty to fulfill in the drive for achieving the prosperity of the country. He had a photo session with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Ri Man Gon, vice-chairman of the WPK Central Committee, and Jo Yong Won, vice department director of the WPK Central Committee."
