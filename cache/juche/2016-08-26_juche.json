Against this backdrop, undesirable forces are moving to create an atmosphere of putting pressure on the DPRK over the test-fire.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and some other countries following it are accusing the DPRK of its SLBM test-fire and an \"urgent consultation\" concerning it was held at UNSC on Thursday.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and its followers, terming the DPRK's test-fire of SLBM that fully demonstrated the nuclear attack capability of Juche Korea \"violation of resolutions,\" brought it up to UNSC for discussion. This is just a hideous provocation reminiscent of the guilty party filing a suit first. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. staged Key Resolve and Foal Eagle 16 joint military drills only a few months ago, openly talking about \"occupying Pyongyang,\" after bringing hugest-ever nuclear strategic assets and troops to south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is now desperately kicking off joint military drills again to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK despite the unanimous denunciation and opposition of all Koreans and the world public.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A touch-and-go situation where a nuclear war may break out any moment is now prevailing on the Korean peninsula due to the war rehearsal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. outrageous nuclear intimidation only resulted in the steady increase of the DPRK's nuclear attack capability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The SLBM test-fire which was successfully conducted without any adverse impact on the security of neighboring countries was a vivid manifestation and a striking demonstration of the tremendous power and inexhaustible strength of Juche Korea firmly consolidated in the face of the tempest of history and all challenges by the enemy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The results of the test-fire proved in actuality that the DPRK joined the front rank of the military powers fully equipped with nuclear attack capability and the U.S. mainland and the operational theatre in the Pacific have come within the striking range of the DPRK, no matter how hard the U.S. tries to deny it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The service personnel and people of the DPRK would deal merciless blows at the U.S. with nuclear hammers of justice so that nails of injustice may not come out again, once an opportunity is given, now that the DPRK has in place all substantial means capable of standing up against the U.S. nuclear hegemony.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. rash acts of taking issue with the DPRK's SLBM test-fire will only precipitate its self-destruction.
