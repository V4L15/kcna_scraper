It is also important not to play into the hands of the present authorities who are resorting to a trick for reform.\r\n   The article calls upon trade unions and workers throughout South Korea to support with one another in firm solidarity for rights and interests common to them, develop struggle confined to industry and region into a joint struggle and foil the present rulers in their wicked plan to divide and disorganise the labor movement.\r\n   It also calls for tightening the ties between ten million workers and one million students to overthrow the colonial government of South Korea.    \r\n \r\n\r\n"

The Japanese government authorities are to blame for this.\r\n   Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article captioned \"What Japanese rulers seek in screening militaristic film\".\r\n   The article says:\r\n   The ongoing film show is by no means accidental but a product of the Japanese government authorities' wrong viewpoint of the past.\r\n   If they approach the past with correct viewpoint and position, want to draw a lesson from history and make a new start for peace, they should not have acquiesced and tolerated the film show.\r\n   The acquiescence and tolerance of the film show is their mute sympathy with and backing for the film. It can be said that they seek in this to bury the crime-woven past in oblivion of history or beautify it in order to avoid the responsibility for it and compensation. The Japanese rulers also seek to create an atmosphere favorable for overseas aggression in the society.\r\n   The film show is a product of Japan's policy and strategy concerning overseas expansion.\r\n   The Japanese authorities should have a good knowledge of the world public opinion and the trend of the times and stop the film show.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"
