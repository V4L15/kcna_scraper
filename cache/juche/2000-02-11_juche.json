Paektu, the holy mountain of the revolution, and grew up, hearing gun reports during the anti-Japanese war. In that course he nurtured an iron will and qualities as a brilliant commander and a strong and noble will to accomplish the Korean people's revolutionary cause of Juche. He went on to say: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Under his wise and seasoned leadership the Korean people have developed advanced technology and made such a miracle as launching a satellite on their own efforts despite manifold difficulties. This is a good example showing small countries what they should do to be free from the imperialist and colonial domination on their own efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Palestinian Arab people greatly treasure the friendly and cooperative relations with the DPRK. I am firmly convinced that the friendship between the two countries provided by President Yasser Arafat and our brother the President Kim Il Sung will further develop under the leadership of General Secretary Kim Jong Il, he stressed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nYang Hyong Sop, vice-president of the presidium of the DPRK Supreme People's Assembly, in his speech said that Palestinian friends' celebration of the February holiday with the Korean people is a manifestation of the Palestinian people's deep respect and reverence for Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We will make strenuous efforts to continue to develop the friendly and cooperative relations with Palestine on good terms, true to his intention, and stand firm on the side of the Palestinian people in their indomitable struggle to win back their legitimate national rights including the right to return to their homeland and the right to found an independent country, he emphasized. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAmong those present on invitation were Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun, department director of the Central Committee of the WPK Kim Yang Gon and other officials concerned. \r\n\r\n"

They manufactured various types of machines and equipment including excavators and water pumps on the ruins after the war and thus became well-known across the country for creating such miracles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Young workers of the plant, by carrying forward their style of work, made an oxygen plant with their own technology and efforts in the 1980s, thus demonstrating its tradition of self-reliance all over the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The plant, once a small factory, has been turned into a leading machine producer of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The torch held aloft by the workers of the plant is based on the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance displayed by people in Jagang province during the \"arduous march\" and the forced march and the Kanggye spirit which represents mass heroism. It was kindled after a torch was lit by the workers of the Songjin Steel Complex which gave origin to the same great chollima advance as that in the 1950s after the war in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The torch lit at the Rakwon Machine Plant will give a great impetus to the second grand chollima advance the Korean people are now making in the Kanggye spirit, following the torch lit at the Songjin Steel Complex.  \r\n\r\n"

We cannot but take a serious note of the fact that it is using this as a pretext for beefing up its military presence in South Korea.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite unreasonable that a small country that cannot be compared with the U.S., the self-proclaimed only superpower in the world, in terms of military potentials is posing \"threat\" to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We have never infringed upon the interests of the U.S. nor threatened its security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is insisting on the \"threat from North Korea,\" refusing to drop the outdated anti-DPRK hostile policy, in a foolish bid to achieve its military aim to overpower the DPRK by \"force.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What cannot be overlooked is the fact that as Shelton said, the U.S. is making full preparations to hurl its Okinawa-based marines into the Korean peninsula on a short notice and dispatch even its forces to it from its mainland, while beefing up its forces in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is a clear indication that the criminal moves of the U.S. to provoke a new war on the Korean peninsula have reached a very serious phase under a carefully worked out operation plan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What merits a serious attention is that all this is going on behind the curtain of dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We can never tolerate such U.S. behaviour as whetting a sword behind us, while paying lip-service to the \"improved relations.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK is fully ready for both dialogue and confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the U.S. desperately chooses confrontation disregarding our warning, it will not escape from fatal blows from our strong self-defensive forces. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on danger of U.S. moves for arms buildup \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 11 (KCNA) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense Cohen recently dedicated an article to the Washington post clarifying the U.S. position to enforce the policy of arms buildup. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Rodong Sinmun today runs an article in this regard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Cohen in the article said that the purchase value of military hardware in the current fiscal year would amount to 60 billion dollars. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. attempt at arms buildup is a dangerous act, the news analyst says, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. administration announced in January last year a plan for greatest arms expansion after the Cold War, declaring that it will increase military expenditure to 112 billion dollars for six years until the fiscal year 2005. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. resorting to arms buildup again after the Cold War is a manifestation of its unchangeable essential nature of aggression and a rash criminal act to drive the world into the crucible of arms race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Its attempt was motivated by an impudent ambition to establish a U.S.-led global order with its arrogant strong-arms policy and hegemonism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Very dangerous is the U.S. ambition to modernize the U.S. troops still further through the arms buildup and take the position of the \"military giant\" and have the world under its thumb by force.   Particularly, the U.S. plan to intensify the arms expansion policy under the pretext of an \"emergency on the Korean peninsula\" may cause a new world war by laying a time bomb in the DPRK-U.S. belligerent relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It may break down the international disarmament process and bring about a second arms race and Cold War. It is not difficult to imagine what it means and what consequences it will bring. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. should ponder over the danger of arms buildup and its aftereffect and make its right option. \r\n\r\n"

Korean defectors interviewed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 11 (KCNA) -- Ri Chol Ho, 43, who defected from the south to the north of Korea with his 12-year old daughter shortly ago, was interviewed by reporters at Pyongyang Koryo Hotel today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He had made taxi service in Seoul before his defection. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Noting that his family was broken by betrayal and swindles, that are a deep-seated fashion of the rotten and ailing South Korean society, he told reporters: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   My defection was motivated by my yearning for the northern half of the country, quite different from the south, where all its people form a big family in clean and sound life environment and General Secretary Kim Jong Il's benevolent and independent politics is administered. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   My first impression of Pyongyang is that its streets are clean and citizens are full of life with their faces bright. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSeeing them enjoy folk games, I felt that the north is my genuine motherland where the spirit of the nation is kept. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   On the living conditions of people in the south, Ri said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe south looks gorgeous. However, it is a society in which those with money and power live in clover and the working masses without money and power find no other outlet but suicide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the south preoccupied with the idea of submitting to the U.S., people's anti-American sentiment is radically growing after the GIs' mass killing in Rogun-ri during the Korean War was disclosed, the defector noted, saying: They will fight to drive the yankees, aggressors and murderers, out of South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He further said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   I will do my best to terminate such practices as the misery of life and family I suffered, the South Korean authorities' shocking moves to do harm to the fellow countrymen, continued atrocities of the GIs, and the pro-U.S., pro-Japanese ruling quarters' treachery as soon as possible, and to hasten the day when the 70 million fellow countrymen will lead a happy life in one reunified country, holding Kim Jong Il in high esteem as its President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHis daughter Ri Son Mi said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   I had badly hated my mother for her leaving home. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBut here in the north I came to feel, seeing children learn and grow in happiness, that South Korean society is worse than the mother. \r\n\r\n"
