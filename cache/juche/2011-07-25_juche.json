            "content": "Kim Jong Il Inspects Command of KPA Navy \r\n Pyongyang, July 25 (KCNA) -- Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army Kim Jong Il, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission, inspected the Command of the KPA Navy. \n\t\t\t\t\t Every serviceperson of the unit was filled with the determination to wipe out the enemy, should the confrontation maniacs dare start a war. The unit was ready to become human torpedoes and depth bombs to protect the honor of Juche Korea, Songun Korea and thus send all the enemy troops to the bottom of the sea and demonstrate the mettle of the army of Mt. Paektu which makes no empty talk and shows no mercy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After receiving a salute, he looked up to the statue of President Kim Il Sung among soldiers and said with emotion that the undying feats performed by him in the building of revolutionary armed forces would shine forever in the history of the country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round the rooms devoted to the education in the revolutionary history and the history of the command. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Seeing precious relics and mementoes, he looked back with deep emotion on the proud road of victory and glory covered by the unit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The KPA Navy has fully displayed patriotic devotion and popular heroism in defending the country and socialist construction for the more than six decades and its command produced 103 heroes including heroes on Mujae Hill who protected the trees bearing revolutionary slogans, the eternal treasures of the WPK, at the cost of their lives, he noted, underscoring the need for the servicepersons of the navy to preserve this shining tradition and demonstrate the invincible might in the battles for devotedly defending the country in the future, too. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLooking round the operation study room, he learned in detail about the unit's performance of duty. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He repeatedly praised the command for establishing the revolutionary training style of thinking of combat circumstances and putting their ideas into practice among commanding and staff officers of the unit and helping them widen their tactical insight. He, at the same time, praised them for firmly defending the seas of the country with the death-defying will to resolutely protect the party, revolution and socialist country by force of arms. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As Korea is surrounded by seas on its three sides, the navy has very important role to play, he said, putting forth important tasks to serve as guidelines for bolstering up the armed force of the navy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Soldiers should always be combat-ready though there is no gunfire and keep themselves fully ready to win without fail in a do-or-die battle with the enemy, he said, adding that good fighters in war time are heroes and patriots, but those who are good at trainings are heroes and patriots in peacetime. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had a photo session with servicepersons of the Navy Command. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Kim Jong Un, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission of the WPK; KPA Vice Marshal Ri Yong Ho, member of the Presidium of the Political Bureau of the C.C., the WPK and chief of the General Staff of the KPA; KPA General Kim Jong Gak, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the C.C., the WPK and first vice-director of the General Political Bureau of the KPA; Kim Kyong Ok, member of the CMC of the WPK; and KPA Generals Kim Myong Guk, Kim Won Hong and Hyon Chol Hae."

This is the special exploit he has performed for the great national unity and achieving the cause of national reunification, the article concludes."
