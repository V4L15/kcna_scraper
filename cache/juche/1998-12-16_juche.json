The South Korean chief executive, however, describes the Yankees as \"defenders of peace,\" an act that befits a servant of a nuclear war.\r\n   The South Korean chief executive asked for \"smashing military provocations\" of the north in the hope that the U.S. will unleash a war at an early date and realise his wild ambition for \"unification by northward invasion.\"\r\n   The outburst of the South Korean \"Minister of National Defense\" is evidence that he, getting overheated in war preparations against the north, has lost reason as well as a sound way of thinking.\r\n   We take a serious note of the fact that the South Korean chief executive, the prime minister and other senior \"government\" officials did not hesitate to describe the north as the \"archenemy\" to be annihilated to the last.\r\n   If a war breaks out on this land, we will wipe out not only the U.S. imperialist aggressors but also the authorities, who are running amuck to encourage the outbreak of a fratricidal war with the backing of the Yankees, to wreak a thousandfold revenge. \r\n \r\n"
