            "content": "Rodong Sinmun publica articulo por el Dia de la ONU\r\nPyongyang, 25 de octubre (ACNC) -- El diario Rodong Sinmun divulgo hoy un articulo individual en ocasion del Dia de la ONU.\n\t\t\t\t\tLa situacion internacional de hoy marcha en contrasentido al objetivo de fundacion de la ONU, adelanta el articulista y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA fin de cumplir su responsabilidad por la paz y seguridad internacionales, el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU debe garantizar la imparcialidad en sus actividades. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, se ignoran abiertamente en ese aparato los principios de respeto a soberania, la igualdad y la no intervencion en asuntos internos de otros paises y se adoptan con chapuceria las injustas \"resoluciones\" que justifican y legalizan la politica de hegemonia mundial de EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Consejo de Seguridad es partidario de la logica y sofisma del imperio, segun el cual durante el debate en ese escenario, no importa lo que haga un pais sino quien es el que lo hace y lo justo y lo injusto debe ser definido segun el regimen que tenga el pais sometido a la consideracion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs imperioso reestructurar cuanto antes la ONU para eliminar el peligro de guerra que se cierne sobre el planeta y establecer un nuevo y justo orden internacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs muy justo que la Asamblea General de la ONU tome la iniciativa de todas las actividades de esta organizacion internacional. Sobre todo, debe tener la autoridad de revisar finalmente las resoluciones del CS, que ejercen serias influencias a la paz y seguridad, tales como la sancion y el uso de fuerzas armadas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe presenta como asunto impostergable el cambio del CS, punto medular de la reforma de la ONU. Esta tarea debe ser cumplida en el principio de garantizar la imparcialidad y la objetividad en sus actividades y asegurar en su composicion la representatividad de los paises en vias de desarrollo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo miembro digno de la ONU, la RPDC se esforzara con sinceridad en el futuro tambien por asegurar la paz y seguridad del mundo y desarrollar las relaciones de amistad con todos los paises que respeten su soberania."
