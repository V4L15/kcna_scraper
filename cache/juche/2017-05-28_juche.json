That weapon system is a posthumous one the development of which had been guided by him with much effort since the start. The General would have been very glad to see this perfect weapon system as he had put his heart and soul into the work to bolster up the state anti-aircraft capability until the last moments of his life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He told KPA commanding officers and officials of the academy that the weapon system's efficiency to detect and track targets has remarkably improved and its hitting accuracy has also increased, compared with those of last year. Some defects in the weapon system, discovered last year, were perfectly overcome to stand the test, he said, adding:  This weapon system, whose operation capability has been thoroughly verified, should be mass-produced to deploy in all over the country like forests so as to completely spoil the enemy's wild dream to command the air, boasting of air supremacy and weapon almighty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He set forth highly important tasks for the strategy for development of modern anti-aircraft guided weapon system of Korean style.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accompanying him were Hwang Pyong So, Ri Yong Gil, O Kum Chol, Kim Kwang Hyok, Ri Pyong Chol, Kim Jong Sik and Jong Sung Il"

Korean Warmongers' Plan to Stage Largest-ever Joint Military Drills Flailed\r\n Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the National Peace Committee of Korea released a statement on Sunday to denounce the U.S. and the south Korean warmongers for planning to stage the largest-ever joint military exercises with the involvement of Carl Vinson and Ronald Reagan nuclear task forces in the waters off the Korean peninsula in upcoming June under the pretext of the DPRK's legitimate measure for bolstering the military capabilities for self-defence.\n\t\t\t\t\t In the past the U.S. frequently infiltrated nuclear carrier task force into the waters off the Korean peninsula in its frantic bid to pose military threat to the DPRK. But never has it gone so desperate as now as it plans to stage the joint military drills with the introduction of the two nuclear carrier task forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This proves that the U.S. and the puppet warmongers' ambition for provocation of a war against the DPRK has reached the zenith, a dangerous military act of pushing the acute situation on the Korean peninsula to the worst point of explosion, the statement said, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that the aggressors and provokers are watching for an opportunity to invade the DPRK, regarding it as a thorn in the flesh, it is quite natural for the DPRK to bolster the nuclear sword for justice to defend the destiny of the country and the nation and the life of its people. No one can find fault with this as it is an extremely just option for self-defence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is trying to threaten and blackmail the DPRK with the nuclear carrier but the U.S.-style bluffing can never work on the DPRK and the DPRK will remain undeterred even though more nuclear strategic assets than the two nuclear carrier task forces are brought into.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. must clearly understand that its frantic moves of holding joint military drill against the DPRK with the introduction of nuclear carrier strike groups will only make our nuclear weapons target the heart of the enemies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK are full of the will to make the U.S., which have committed untold crimes against the Korean nation decade after decade, suffer deadly retaliatory strikes bitter defeat.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Time and victory belong to the DPRK holding the nuclear sword of justice."
