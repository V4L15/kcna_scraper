It would be difficult for the talks to make any progress if the U.S. approaches the talks from the stand of unilaterally demanding the DPRK scrap its nuclear weapons in spite of the historical background against which the nuclear issue surfaced on the Korean Peninsula and the objective reality which compelled it to have access to nukes. Unilaterally demanding the DPRK dismantle its nuclear weapons would not help solve the issue of denuclearizing the peninsula. If the U.S. drops its ambition for a \"regime change\" and opts for peaceful co-existence with the DPRK, the talks can make successful progress and settle the issue of denuclearizing the peninsula. But if the U.S. persistently pressurizes its dialogue partner to unilaterally dismantle its nuclear weapons, the situation will lead to an extreme pitch of tension. The U.S. should fulfill its commitments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nUnshakable is the stand of the DPRK to seek a peaceful negotiated settlement of the nuclear issue and achieve the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The U.S. should not be skeptical about such stand of the DPRK but show its frank and sincere attitude to fulfill its responsibility and commitments.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

One of the serious blames for this rests with Japan. The DPRK, therefore, feels no need to sit face to face with Japan, a black-hearted filibuster against the talks.\r\n Minju Joson Saturday says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that a whole string of reckless remarks beclouding the prospect of the six-party talks are heard from Japan, as evidenced by Abe's assertion that the talks would be meaningless if the \"abduction issue\" is not taken up by them, the commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is not keen to make the six-party talks contribute to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula but working hard to meet its own interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the preceding six-party talks Japan stood in the way of fairly settling the nuclear issue in support of the U.S. unreasonable stand. Japan has persistently pursued its hostile policy toward the DPRK, crying out for \"sanctions\" and \"punishment\" for the mere reason that it refused to respond to Tokyo's unreasonable assertion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As if it were not enough with having hamstrung the efforts to seek a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue, Japan is busy with its moves to disturb the six-party talks to be resumed soon, in a bid to totally block the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The whole course of the past fruitless six-party talks and the present reality compel the DPRK to draw an important conclusion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the parties concerned are to bring into bloom a beautiful flower called the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, they should root out the poisonous plant harmful to it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is the height of folly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is a tundra and worst violator of human rights as it is not in a position to guarantee the popular masses even elementary human rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n World people are simply stunned by various forms of human rights abuses reported from Japan styling itself a \"law-governed state\" and \"the safest country in the world.\"\r\n People's political freedom and rights are at peril and a large number of working people exposed to the threat of violence at their worksites. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The annual number of cases of murder averaged more than 1,300 and the cases of crimes of various kinds numbered 300 every year. People's vital rights and right to non-infringement are also exposed to constant threat and abuses. This is the real picture of the Japanese society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Xenophobia, kidnapping, plot-breeding and flesh traffic are perpetrated in Japan at the tacit connivance of its government. This furnishes another clear proof that Japan is the worst human rights abuser and incarnation of criminals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is by no means fortuitous that the special rapporteur of the UN Commission on Human Rights noted that Xenophobia has become very pronounced in the Japanese society, adding the government lacks understanding of the gravity of this issue while the International Labor Organization and the American \"Newsweek\" dubbed Japan \"a country of undisguised flesh traffic.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan abducted and forcibly took away at least 8.4 million Koreans in the last century, recording the most hideous human rights abuses in history. It is censured at home and abroad as the worst kidnapper and plot-breeder and suicide-torn country for the ceaseless human rights violations reported inside and outside the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is disgusting, indeed, for Japan to dare talk about \"human rights issue\" of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Human rights abuses are quite unthinkable in the DPRK as its society is very stable politically and all the people are in perfect harmony because of their shared desire and will and warm brotherhood and sisterhood. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's off-repeated talk about \"the human rights issue\" in the DPRK is aimed at persistently pulling up it over the \"abduction issue\" which had already been settled, impairing its international image and escalating Japan's hostile policy towards Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is the fact that Japan which lacks a proper justification to participate in the six-party talks is foolishly trying to place on their agenda the issue which has nothing to do with the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in a bid to twist the nature of the talks and use them for meeting its selfish purpose. \r\n Japan seems not to know where it stands. \r\n This indiscreet behavior of Japan will only precipitate its own self-destruction.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is an essential requirement in light of the norms governing the international relations. The DPRK has expected the U.S. to show a trustworthy sincere attitude since the mature conditions were provided for the resumption of the six-party talks thanks to the joint efforts of the DPRK and the parties concerned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those who are truly concerned for peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula wish to see each party concerned to respect each other and not to miss the favorable opportunity to show sincerity. Given their wishes, what he uttered cannot be construed otherwise than an intention to hurt the confidence among states and scuttle the talks even before their resumption. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the past period an extreme behavior rejecting and ignoring a dialogue partner and an attempt to isolate and stifle a participating country in the past adversely affected the fate of the talks. If this is taken into consideration, it is important for the talks to make a good start. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A high level of political and moral ethics is prerequisite to the talks, which will deal with sensitive issues related to peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula, the Asia-Pacific region and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. really wants to settle the nuclear issue through the six-party talks, it should be decent enough to stop uttering anything getting on the nerves of other dialogue partner and approach the talks with sincerity.        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Of course, I am a rising musician with little experience in contesting at international concours and a short career as a violinist. But I could win the concours this time as my faith and will to hold in high esteem Kim Jong Il only added to my talent and passion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the letter he vowed to make painstaking efforts, drawing on the experience gained in the concours, to become a violinist known to Kim Jong Il and Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
