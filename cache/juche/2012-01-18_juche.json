            "content": "Kim Jong Un Inspects KPA Unit 169\r\n Pyongyang, January 18 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Un, supreme commander of the Korean Peopleâ€™s Army and supreme leader of the Workers' Party of Korea, state and army, inspected KPA Unit 169 honored with the title of the O Jung Hup-led Seventh Regiment.\n\t\t\t\t\t He was greeted by the commander of the large combined unit and commanding officers of the unit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After receiving a salute, he waved back to the service personnel enthusiastically cheering in tears of emotion. He had a photo session with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Conducted by commanding officers, he went round the monument to the revolutionary history and the spring site associated with unforgettable stories. Visiting the unit in May 1998, General Secretary Kim Jong Il was pleased that the command of the unit was successfully built in the good place chosen by President Kim Il Sung while visiting it five times and its building looked like a rest home. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round the room dedicated to the education of the revolutionary history and the room devoted to the history of the unit, he recollected with deep emotion the undying leadership feats of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il associated with the proud course covered by the unit shining with heroic feats.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He called upon the unit to conduct the combat and political training well, not forgetting the loving care Kim Jong Il showed for its service personnel by having a picture taken with them as he had promised them four years ago while inspecting their unit in November last year, the last period of his life. He, at the same time, urged them to live up to the deep trust Kim Jong Il reposed in them by encouraging them to stand at the head of the whole army, calling the unit the unit like a tiger of Mt. Paektu. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un acquainted himself with the training of the unit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the unit has a very important duty to perform, he set forth the important tasks which would serve as guidelines for increasing the combat capability of the unit in every way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The primary duty of the soldiers is to conduct training well, he said, underlining the need to concentrate all efforts on intensifying training and prepare the service personnel of the unit as all-round fighters capable of satisfactorily and independently discharging any combat duty, in particular.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Making the round of the soldiers' hall and library, he expressed satisfaction over the fact that the unit has conducted political and ideological education of the soldiers in a unique manner to suit their characteristic features by keeping diverse materials for ideological and cultural education and building sufficient facilities for that purpose. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed the need to continue paying primary attention to the political and ideological education of soldiers so that they may become fighters strong in idea and faith.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Looking at the photos of combat heroes, he said that the unit would produce more heroes in the future. He called on it to improve the education by use of materials on combat feats to train all its service personnel as heroes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Stopping before the photos of the officers whom soldiers call \"our officers,\" he appreciated the officers who have warmly loved their soldiers, regarding them as revolutionary comrades-in-arms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then he dropped in at a mess hall and looked at the program for observing the \"day for soldiers.\" He was pleased to learn that commanding officers and families of service personnel have made every sincere effort to take good care of soldiers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round a bedroom, an education room and training and lecture rooms of a company under the unit, he took care of the soldiers' living as their real father would do.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He invited the commanding officers of the unit which Kim Jong Il visited in the last period of his life to have a picture taken together.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Calling upon them to take warm care of the living of the soldiers, he said only by doing so, they will make success in training and it is possible to bolster the combat capability of the unit. He earnestly told the officers to make long and difficult marches for training all together this year and thus finish the combat preparations of the unit without fail as desired by Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by KPA Vice Marshal Ri Yong Ho, chief of the KPA General Staff, KPA Generals Kim Myong Guk, Kim Won Hong and Pak Jae Gyong and KPA Lieut. Gen. Ri Tu Song."

Koreans and Overseas Compatriots' Profound Mourning over Demise of Kim Jong Il\r\n Pyongyang, January 18 (KCNA) -- The Institute for National Reunification on Monday issued a press release to inform the public at home and abroad of exceptionally profound sorrow expressed by south Koreans and overseas compatriots over the great loss to the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t According to it, the sad news came like a bolt from the blue at 12:00, December 19 last year, greatly shocking south Korea and the rest of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was reported by Internet, TVs and all other media of south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Art performances and meetings slated to take place on Christmas and the New Year were cancelled.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t One hour after a special report of the DPRK was aired at least 120,000 condolatory articles were posted on five Internet websites. They had such titles as \"Grief is so deep that even the sky seems to fall down. It is heart-rending to hear the news,\" \"It is painful. We would like to share this sorrow with the brethren in the north,\" \"We pray for the repose of the soul of Chairman of the National Defence Commission Kim Jong Il,\" \"Noble soul of the NDC chairman, the sun of the nation, will always be enshrined in the hearts of the people,\" and \"General Kim Jong Il to go down in human history for all ages.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The homeland was deluged with phone calls and messages from compatriots overseas saying they were so shocked by the sad news of the loss of the father of the nation that they could hardly believe it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Upon hearing the news, compatriots in south Korea and overseas expressed their sad feelings, looking back with deep emotion on the noble life of General Secretary Kim Jong Il and his personality as a great man and his immortal exploits. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Media carried special write-ups introducing the leader's brief history illustrated with his smiling portrait and pictures on his revolutionary career.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean Internet paper Jaju Minbo and other progressive media said that though NDC Chairman Kim Jong Il, the hero of the era and the large star, passed away his spirit and feats will last forever with history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Highlighting the fact that he passed away on a train while making a forced march for field guidance with super-human energy until the last day of his life, media said it was \"journey for settling wide-ranging issues\", \"storm of field guidance\" and \"the spirit of dying while at work\" something rare to be found in any leader of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t People from all walks of life in south Korea said: He provided the inter-Korean summits and made sure that the inter-Korean declarations were adopted and published in order to present reunification to the Korean nation. This was a historic deed to go down in the nation's history. How good it would have been if the NDC chairman had lived longer to bring the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration into a brilliant reality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those who had an opportunity to meet the peerlessly great man felt more sorrowful than any others and remembered him with deep emotion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korean media quoted leaders and personages of different countries as saying: Kim Jong Il was a great strategist without an equal in the world, a man possessed of bold and unpredictable strategy and policies, man of logic, a rare energetic man, a man of varied accomplishments, a man versatile in knowledge about wide-ranging issues and charismatic leader for his dynamism, humor and marvelous skill.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Overseas Koreans posted on Internet websites or contributed to publications condolatory articles under such titles as \"Chairman Kim Jong Il and destiny of the country\", \"Compatriots wailing though night far advanced\" and \"Increasing number of overseas compatriots pay condolatory visits to the homeland\", with their boundless yearning and grief over the demise of the father of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their feelings were clearly manifested during the mourning and in the expression of condolences.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No sooner had the special report been made public than south Korean opposition parties including the Democratic United Party and the United Progressive Party held press conferences and issued statements and commentaries all at once to express condolences over the demise of Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Messages of condolences were sent to the north by the South Side Committee for Implementing June 15 Joint Declaration, the South Headquarters of the Pan-national Alliance for Korea's Reunification, the Confederation of Trade Unions, the Federation of Trade Unions and other organizations grouping people of all social standings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thousands of messages were sent to the north officially or unofficially by political parties, reunification movement organizations, civic and public organizations, religious organizations and personages of all circles in south Korea during the mourning to express condolences over his demise. The number of the similar messages the puppet Ministry of Unification claimed received reached 77.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t People from all walks of life in south Korea vied with each other to form mourners groups before heading for Pyongyang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ri Hui Ho, widow of former south Korean President Kim Dae Jung, and Hyon Jong Un, chairperson of the Hyundai Group, and their parties made long trips via the Military Demarcation Line and expressed condolences before the bier of Kim Jong Il. Hwang Hye Ro, co-representative of the Korea Solidarity for Independent Reunification and Democracy, too, visited Pyongyang at the risk of her life to pay tribute in humble reverence to the bier of the father of the nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Civic and public organizations formed mourners' groups and submitted to the puppet Ministry of Unification applications for visits to the north. Bereaved families of former President Roh Moo Hyun and Rev. Mun Ik Hwan requested the authorities to allow their condolatory visits to Pyongyang. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Opposition parties urged the authorities to allow the dispatch of mourners' groups to Pyongyang, holding that the \"National Assembly\" would dispatch its mourners' group if the \"government\" was not ready to send a similar group. They demanded that the authorities allow the dispatch of at least a nongovernmental mourners' group on behalf of the Pan-national Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation if they were not in a position to allow NA's group of mourners. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak group of traitors, however, brutally suppressed those who wished to pay condolatory visits or express condolences, turning down their applications.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  South Korean people of different circles set up incense-burning altars in different places and put up a fierce struggle to express condolences. In protest against the authorities' crackdown they posted \"cyber incense-burning altars\" on the internet websites.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Overseas compatriot mourners' delegations and groups and individual compatriots visited the DPRK to express deep condolences before the bier of Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Overseas compatriot organizations formed mourning committees. During the mourning period they paid condolatory visits to the DPRK embassies, made public condolatory messages and statements and held memorial services, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At least 500 condolatory letters and messages came to the homeland from overseas compatriot organizations and compatriots in various countries including China, the United States and Russia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The mourning centers at the DPRK embassies and those set up by overseas compatriot organizations were crowded with an endless stream of overseas Korean mourners.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sad feelings expressed by south Koreans of different circles and oversea compatriots were, indeed, the sincerest and the most heartfelt and irrepressible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The press release quoted south Korean media as saying: The north is led by Vice Chairman Kim Jong Un identical to NDC Chairman Kim Jong Il. The world has already recognized Kim Jong Un as the supreme leader of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Compatriots in south Korea and overseas were greatly touched to witness the single-minded unity demonstrated in the DPRK in the course of such events as expression of condolences and the ceremony of bidding last farewell to the leader during the mourning period. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Jaju Minbo of south Korea carried an article by a correspondent of Minjok Thongsin, run by compatriots in the U.S., which said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"The scenes showing residents in the north in the ceremony of bidding last farewell to Chairman of the NDC Kim Jong Il were unprecedented in human history. Citizens put off their mufflers and padded clothes and covered roads with them so that heavy snow might not fall on them. People were sweeping roads. Others were covering roads with their mufflers and coats to keep them clean. Can there be in any other part of the world such a big family in which the leader and people trust and love each other and depend on each other? Are there in the world such people who respect and venerate their leader so much? There is nowhere in the world such country except the DPRK. There is the single-minded unity which no country can ever imagine because its leader and people respect and love each other. And because of this unity no country dares provoke the DPRK.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korean Internet newspaper Surprise said: The DPRK is such society in which the leader and people are single-mindedly united and it is like a wonderful big family. Its members are so simple and genuine that they think only of their leader, party and country. These unique feelings represent the real power and true picture of the DPRK. This precisely means its mightiness.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The profound mourning and the voices enthusiastically eulogizing the great man heard from among south Koreans and compatriots overseas during the mourning period spent in bitter tears helped everyone keenly realize what a great man the Korean nation held in high esteem as the sun and its father, concluded the press release."

That is aimed to fully gratify Japan's ambition to emerge a military giant and launch reinvasion with the help of its American master.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan has already done its utmost to make human and material and legal preparations to put such design into practice. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan provided such legal groundwork for military action of its aggression forces as \"law on overseas dispatch of troops\" and \"law on the situation in surrounding areas\" and upgraded the Defense Agency into a ministry. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is also concentrating efforts on raising the striking and mobile capability of the \"Self-Defense Forces\". It is proven by the present \"defense programme guidelines\" which stresses the need to build warships and change prototype fighters. 90 percent of military hardware for SDF is home-made. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan seeks to acquire the latest weapon technology through the joint development of weapons with the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan has staged military exercises in military bases across Japan and its waters off them and air all the year round in an effort to bolster the cooperation capability of the SDF and the U.S. forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What remains to be done by Japan at present is to establish a well regulated system capable of satisfactorily operating and using the existing material and institutional mechanisms for reinvasion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's bid to set up \"the national security council\" of Japanese version is nothing but an attempt to hold military supremacy in Northeast Asia and round off a state mechanism for launching reinvasion with the U.S backing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's dangerous moves for reinvasion are being pushed forward at a final phase. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's primary target of reinvasion is the Korean Peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is clearly evidenced by the fact that Japan allowed six civilian ports in Honshu area close to the East Sea of Korea and Kyushu area to be used as logistic and sortie bases of the U.S. navy under the simulated conditions of \"contingency\" on the Korean Peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the archipelagoes of Japan have become sortie and logistic bases for reinvasion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the plan of the Japanese militarists to put the Korean Peninsula under control and, furthermore, realize their old dream of \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But, this is no more than a daydream. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world is watching with vigilance the black-hearted intention of Japan to emerge a leader of Asia, backed by the U.S., and the service personnel and people of the DPRK are highly alerted. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If Japan persists in its moves to become a military giant and launch reinvasion, far from drawing a lesson from the blood-stained past history, it will face only a disgraceful defeat and self-destruction."

They formed a new party after deserting the ruling party in protest against them, throwing it into mayhem. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Against the background of this confused political landscape there was a cabinet reshuffle in less than four months after its emergence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noda dismissed those who had been considered by ruling and opposition parties as trouble makers and appointed the man related to the opposition party as deputy prime minister. This is aimed to strengthen the function of the official residence of the prime minister and achieve compromise with opposition forces in a bid to carry out reform policies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under this situation the Liberal Democratic Party insisted it would not agree with an agreement on the consumption tax increase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This led to intensified offensive and defensive warfare between the ruling and opposition parties and the widened division within the ruling camp and touched off growing discontent of the people. It is said there is likelihood that in case of failure to deliberate on the bill at the Diet on Jan. 24, this may lead to the dissolution of the House of Representatives and the general election.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kozo Watanabe, top advisor to the Democratic Party, deplorably said that it is the first time that the politics is in such chaos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to results of the nationwide opinion poll released by Tokyo Shimbun, 85 percent of the respondents expressed discontent with the politics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The politics in Japan is 15 per cent one, indeed. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such poor shape of politics in Japan is deserved judgment and inescapable fate of the politicians of Japan who prolong their remaining days with scramble for power, forsaken by the people, as they are bereft of even elementary morality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural for Japan to be derided by the international community as an untrustworthy government and political pigmy."

Algunas fuerzas del Partido Democratico en el poder rechazan la politica de unas reformas del premier japones como el aumento del impuesto de gastos simpatizando con el movimiento de los partidos opositores y renunciaron al partido en senal de protesta y establecieron el nuevo partido causando disturbios en el seno del partido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn tal complicada situacion politica se efectuo la reestructuracion del gabinete al cabo de 4 meses de su fundacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl premier japones Noda depuso a los miembros problematicos del partido en el poder y los partidos opositores y puso a uno relacionado con los partidos opositores en el cargo del interino no.1 del premier, con el fin de realizar la politica de reformas fortaleciendo la funcion de la residencia del premier y logrando la conciliacion con las fuerzas de los partidos opositores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, el Partido Liberal de Japon insistio en que no participaria en el debate sobre el incremento de impuesto de gastos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn medio de los conflictos entre el partido en el poder y los partidos opositores, la agravacion de division en el primero y la elevacion de desconfianza de los habitantes, se reportan que si no se somete el proyecto de ley a la consideracion de la Dieta que tendra lugar el dia 24, habria la posibilidad de disolver la camara de representantes y efectuar las elecciones generales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl asesor supremo del Partido Democratico Kozo Watanabe, dijo que es por primera vez la circunstancia desordenada de la politica como ahora y expreso su sentimiento de querer llorar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun la encuesta de la opinion publica nacional publicada por Tokio Shimbun, el 85% de los contestadores expresaron sus quejas a la politica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tO sea, la politica de Japon es la de 15%.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTal situacion politica de Japon es la sentencia merecida e inevitable destino para los politicos japoneses carentes de moralidad que se disputan la heguemonia dando espaldas a la opinion publica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs natural que Japon es censurado y burlado por parte de la sociedad internacional como gobierno indigno de confianza y como enano politico."
