Let us stir up throughout the country the atmosphere of supporting and carrying out the declaration this year together with the organizations and personages aspiring after the implementation of the north-south joint declaration and peace and national reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLet us advance the June 15 reunification era by achieving the reconciliation and unity of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLet us mark this year as a year of victory for pro-reunification patriotic forces by overwhelming the anti-reunification forces in and out in the spirit of becoming benefactors and building a paradise under the banner of \"By our nation itself.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt this moment there go on dangerous war moves threatening the destiny of the nation to impose the nuclear disaster upon it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLet us turn out as one in the campaign for peace against war to hinder and foil the reckless war exercises that threaten well-being and peace of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo force on earth can arrest the united Koreans in their grand and vigorous march for independence and reunification demonstrating the spirit of the homogenous nation with Tangun as the nation's founder.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLet us make a breakthrough toward independence, peace and reunification without fail by meeting all challenges in the way of reunification and staging a dynamic reunification movement with fresh conviction under the banner of the historic north-south joint declaration."
