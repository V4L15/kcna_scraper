He called for remodeling the stadium into an all-event stadium to be proud of in the world so as to glorify the leadership exploits of the Generalissimos down through generations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round spectators' seats, track, football field and other places of the stadium. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The May Day Stadium is a very huge stadium with a large seating capacity, he said, stressing the need to install new attractive stools to the spectators' convenience in order to radically change the appearance of their seats.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He instructed officials to provide the track in the field of the stadium with rubber mat and the football field with artificial turf in line with the international standard and install lighting facilities in such a way as to host any match.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round indoor training rooms and rest rooms for players and spectators, etc. of the stadium.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said it is the determination of the Party to successfully remodel the May Day Stadium into an icon of sports facilities in the country and into a stadium befitting the appearance of the highly civilized nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that to remodel the stadium is an important work for further developing the Juche-oriented sports amid the ever-growing zeal for sports and demonstrating the national power and a high level of civilization, he specified tasks and ways to do so.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Choe Ryong Hae, member of the Presidium of the Political Bureau of the C.C., the WPK and director of the General Political Bureau of the KPA; Jang Song Thaek, member of the Political Bureau of the C.C., the WPK and vice-chairman of the NDC; Ro Tu Chol, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the C.C., the WPK and vice-premier of the Cabinet; Ri Yong Su, department director of the C.C., the WPK; Pak Thae Song and Ma Won Chun, vice department directors of the C.C., the WPK; Ri Jong Mu, minister of Physical Culture and Sports; and officials concerned."

Korean Warmongers' Anti-DPRK Maneuvers Get Frantic: News Analyst\r\n Pyongyang, September 24 (KCNA) -- The north-south relations which had advanced toward reconciliation and cooperation thanks to the broad-minded and positive efforts of the DPRK have again faced the phase of confrontation and tensions.\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet warmongers have resorted to dangerous war moves against the DPRK though an agreement on bringing operations in the Kaesong Industrial Zone to normal was adopted and the issues such as reunion of separated families and their relatives and the resumption of the suspended tour of Mt. Kumgang progressed. They staged the large-scale Ulji Freedom Guardian joint war military exercises targeting the DPRK from August 19 in league with the U.S. under the pretext of \"annual drills\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On August 22 when the joint military exercises were in the height, Hukryong Unit of the puppet Marine Corps got frantic with the north-targeted war maneuvers around five islands in the West Sea of Korea, claiming that it will cope with firepower provocation, infiltration and surprise occupation by the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The 17th Infantry Division of the puppet Army held combined anti-terrorism drills in Inchon and Puchon on August 20 and 21.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Never a day has passed since August without war maneuvers, notably a drill for urgent provision of munitions to a unit of the puppet forces in Phaju, Kyonggi Province from Kwangju City and combined anti-infiltration drill by the 23rd Infantry Division of the puppet Army in Samchok, south Korean Kangwon Province and Uljin, North Kyongsang Province.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t One more typical example is the burlesque for confrontation with the DPRK staged in Inchon on September 15.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That day there staged a farce for repeating the landing operation in Inchon committed by the U.S. imperialists during the June 25 Korean War with huge forces including the U.S. forces and south Korean navy and marine corps, at least 10 warships, more than 20 planes and over 20 armored cars involved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean conservative regime has gone more desperate than ever before to beef up armed forces to invade the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The warmongers are continuing stepping up the purchase of fighters from the U.S. and trying to introduce from overseas refueling tankers to drastically increase the operating hours of F-15K and KF-16 fighters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Latest mine-cleaning tanks have been deployed for the U.S. forces present in south Korea and the ground air reconnoitering unit equipped with 30 OH-58Ds will join the U.S. forces based in Phyongthaek.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The warmongers deployed mobile maritime monitoring radars on five islands in the West Sea of Korea and are squandering a large amount of money for the development and introduction of war hardware including the test of launching torpedo from submarine and the building of submarine with vertical launcher.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Traitor Kim Kwan Jin, minister of Defense, told the military recently that they should firmly keep the combat posture though the phase of south-north dialogue is open, revealing the attempt to confront with the DPRK to the last.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not content with describing a recent series of progresses made in the inter-Korean relations as the fruition of their \"theory of principle\", the warmongers are countering the just steps and warnings of the DPRK with \"decisive countermeasure\" and \"international sanctions and resolute retaliation\".

Korea\" Is Product of New Cold War Strategy: KCNA Commentary\r\n Pyongyang, September 24 (KCNA) -- The U.S. is putting spurs to the establishment of missile defense system in the Asia-Pacific.\n\t\t\t\t\t As part of this move it recently staged again interceptor missile tests on an island of Marshallese and the area near it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is claiming that the tests were to cope with \"missile threat from north Korea\" but no one will believe it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This was apparently prompted by its design to contain China and Russia, nuclear powers in the Asia-Pacific, and maintain and strengthen its military supremacy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The tests arouse greater concern of Asian countries as they were conducted after the deployment of a new missile shield on Guam.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. escalated moves for missile shield provoke serious backlash and prompt vigilance against the outbreak of the new Cold War in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a dangerous move that may spark off new stand-off and arms race not only in the region but the rest of the world in the future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Historically, theories of \"threats\" raised by the U.S. were no more than excuses to justify its aggression and interference in the internal affairs of other countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the Second World War the U.S. persistently pursued the Cold War strategy relying on anti-Soviet Union and anti-communist forces under the pretext of holding back the \"threat of spread of communism.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the Cold War the U.S. cried out for a uni-polar world, boasting of being the world's only superpower. Later, it launched the \"war on terrorism\" while resorting to highhanded and arbitrary practices under the signboard of \"threat of terrorism.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The arrogant U.S. got increasingly crippled, being saddled with enormous state debt, troubled with economic decline and mired in \"anti-terrorism war\" while the Asia-Pacific rapidly rose as a center of world development in the 21st century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Upset by the rise of the region, home to a half of the world population and nuclear and economic powers and newly-emerging economies with rich natural resources and markets, the U.S. raised the pivot to Asia-Pacific strategy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To carry out its strategy for world supremacy the U.S. again designated its rivals and \"states posing threat to it\" as in the period of Cold War and grappled with forming an encirclement ring.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It mounted pressure offensive while covertly using the phrase of \"potential rival\" by taking into consideration the failed uni-polar world strategy, changed structure of forces caused by the world trend of multipolarization and international rebuff.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"potential rival\" designated by the U.S. meant China rapidly emerging as an economic power in Asia and Russia which retook its position as power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to establish the U.S.-led domination order in the Asia-Pacific and take control of the world by containing the two big powers the U.S. is pushing ahead with the formation of big missile shield covering vast areas from Alaska to Australia through south Korea, Japan and the Philippines.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. insists that the tests were to \"provide against the missile development of north Korea\", not meant to target the powers in surrounding areas. But this is a base deception of the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Washington Post disclosed the fact that the CIA defined already in the 1990s China and Russia as \"potential rivals\" that can challenge the U.S. interests and put the DPRK and Iran on the list of \"states posing threat to the U.S.\" in a bid to secure the pretext for establishing the missile shield in Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Victor Yesin, former chief of the General Staff of the Strategic Rocket Forces of Russia, said that U.S. response to the DPRK is asymmetric, adding the former is establishing the theatre missile defense system to deter nuclear potentials of China and Russia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. schemes to put military pressure on those countries through new missile shield and inveigle them into new arms race so that they may use up their national capabilities and plunge into an economic turmoil.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As seen above, the U.S. theory of \"missile threat from north Korea\" is no more than sophism to cover up its criminal nature as it is a product of its new strategy for world supremacy, Cold War strategy of the Asian version.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should never be allowed to turn the Asia-Pacific into a springboard for world domination and theater of new Cold War as the countries in the region aspire after peace and development.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The anachronistic attempt of the U.S. is bound to fail."

            "content": "ACNC comenta teoria de EE.UU. sobre \"amenaza de misiles del Norte de Corea\"\r\nPyongyang, 24 de septiembre (ACNC) -- Estados Unidos da mas acicate al establecimiento del sistema de defensa antimisil en la region de Asia-Pacifico.\n\t\t\t\t\tComo parte de ello, volvio a ejecutar recientemente la prueba de interceptacion de misiles en las islas Marshallese bajo el pretexto de hacer frente a la \"amenaza de misiles del Norte de Corea\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste movimiento militar partio de su malsano intento de mantener a rayas a China y Rusia, potencias nucleares de Asia-Pacifico, y mantener y afianzar su hegemonia militar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa reciente prueba causa gran preocupacion de los paises asiaticos porque se realizo despues del establecimiento en la isla Guam del nuevo sistema de defensa antimisil.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa ampliacion de la red antimisil de EE.UU. levanta la seria repulsion y vigilancia siendo calificada de llegada de nueva guerra fria en la region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs que constituye un acto peligroso que busca la nueva epoca de confrontacion y carrera armamentista no solo en la region sino en la palestra internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas teorias sobre la \"amenaza\", presentadas historicamente por el imperio, no fueron mas que una justificacion para defender sus actos de agresion e intervencion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDespues de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, el imperio persiguio obstinadamente la estrategia de nueva guerra fria basada en el campo antisovietico y anticomunista bajo el pretexto de prevenir la \"proliferacion del comunismo\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTerminada la guerra fria, EE.UU. preconizaba el mundo unipolarizado proclamandose como \"unica superpotencia\". Despues ejecuto la \"guerra antiterrorista\" bajo el vistoso rotulo de eliminar las \"amenazas del terrorismo\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando el prepotente imperio fue agobiado por las enormes deudas estatales y la decadencia economica como consecuencias de la \"guerra antiterrorista\", la region de Asia-Pacifico emergio bruscamente como centro de desarrollo mundial del siglo XXI.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAtemorizado ante el crecimiento de esa region con abundantes recursos naturales y mercados, donde habita casi la mitad de la poblacion mundial y estan concentrados las potencias nucleares y economicas y nuevos paises con grandes capacidades economicas, EE.UU. presento la llamada estrategia de dar importancia a Asia-Pacifico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara realizar su nueva estrategia de hegemonia, procedio a la formacion del cerco definiendo a los paises rivales y \"estados amenazantes\" al igual que en el periodo de la Guerra Fria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTomando en cuenta el fracaso de la estrategia de mundo unipolarizado, la estructura de fuerzas cambiada con la tendencia de multipolarizacion mundial y la repulsion internacional, comenzo a usar la expresion de \"rivales potenciales\" en alusion a China y Rusia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara disuadirlos, el imperio promueve la formacion del sistema antimisiles desde Alaska, Sur de Corea, Japon y Filipinas hasta Australia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEngana a la sociedad internacional con el embuste de que ese sistema no toma en consideracion a las potencias del contorno sino para \"hacer frente al desarrollo de misiles por el Norte de Corea\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Washington Post revelo que la Agencia Central de Inteligencia de EE.UU. ha definido ya en la decada de 1990 a China y Rusia como sus \"rivales potenciales\" y la RPDC e Iran fueron incluidos en la lista de \"Estados amenazantes\" porque se necesitaba la justificacion de establecer el sistema de defensa antimisil en Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ex jefe del estado mayor general de las fuerzas coheteriles estrategicas de Rusia senalo que es asimetrica la reaccion del imperio contra la RPDC, especificando que el primero establece la red antimisil para disuadir la potencialidad nuclear de Rusia y China.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon el funcionamiento del nuevo sistema de defensa antimisil, el imperio trata de presionar militarmente a esos paises y al mismo tiempo, involucrarlos en la nueva carrera armamentista que conducira al desgaste de la fuerza nacional y al disturbio economico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi la teoria sobre la \"amenaza de misiles del Norte de Corea\" es un chisme para encubrir el caracter criminal de la nueva estrategia de hegemonia mundial y la de guerra fria de version asiatica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo se puede tolerar jamas el intento del imperio de convertir la region de Asia-Pacifico aspirante a la paz y al desarrollo en la cabeza de puente hacia la hegemonia mundial y en el teatro de nueva guerra fria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta condenado al fracaso el intento anacronico de EE.UU."
