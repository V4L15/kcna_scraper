This is a blatant challenge to the global peace, security and stability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarist reactionary forces have become extremely arrogant and the danger posed by them is becoming increasingly potential. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should discard its nuclear ambition, not oblivious of the lesson of history drawn from the nuclear disaster suffered by it in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan persistently opts for nuclear armament, it will only invite an unimaginable nuclear disaster.     \r\n\r\n"
