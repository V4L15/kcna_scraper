It was not accidental that U.S. State Secretary Hillary gave lecture on \"Internet freedom\" twice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this regard the international community raises a question about whether the U.S. is truly interested in Internet freedom or freedom for infiltration, overthrow and aggression against other countries through Internet.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Clear is the answer to this question.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What the U.S. seeks is to ideologically disorganize the sovereign states, the anti-imperialist independent countries in particular and foster social confusion and division to put them under its control and, furthermore, dominate the world."

Y hasta su amo norteamericano le considera como un molesto. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda tÃ­tere, aislada tanto en el interior como en el exterior, habla de la \"represalia separada\" diciendo que las conversaciones Norte-Sur sobre la desnuclearizaciÃ³n y los casos de hundimiento de la corbeta \"Cheonan\" y de caÃ±onazos en la isla Yonphyong son cuestiones apartes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, no puede engaÃ±ar a nadie con tal artimaÃ±a tendente a frenar el diÃ¡logo RPDC-EE.UU. y la reanudaciÃ³n de las conversaciones a 6 bandas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi la banda tÃ­tere tiene de veras algÃºn interÃ©s en el diÃ¡logo Norte-Sur, debe dejar sus acciones provocativas y retirar completamente las \"premisas\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn fin de cuentas, la banda tÃ­tere se entrega mÃ¡s que nunca a las maniobras conflictivas anti-RPDC con el fin de dilatar infinitamente el tiempo pretextando el diÃ¡logo Norte-Sur. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora la banda tÃ­tere surcoreana implora a EE.UU. que apoyara su posiciÃ³n. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl traidor Lee invita diariamente a banquete a sus compinches y a otras personalidades de distintos estratos, a quienes no echaba ni un vistazo en el tiempo ordinario, y les ofrece hasta \"recuerdos\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, tales actos asquerosos provocan crÃ­ticas sociales y nadie quiere compartir el destino con el traidor. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy dÃ­a, el traidor Lee se apoya sÃ³lo en algunos manÃ­acos anti-reunificaciÃ³n como Hyon In Thaek. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas maniobras conflictivas de la banda tÃ­tere llevarÃ¡n las relaciones Ã­ntercoreanas a la fase mÃ¡s catastrÃ³fica y a la larga, se extenderÃ¡n a la guerra que acarrearÃ­a incontables desgracias a la naciÃ³n coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa camarilla de Lee debe actuar con prudencia reflexionÃ¡ndose de la consecuencia que se emane de su polÃ­tica conflictiva."
