It instituted its own year and dealt heavy blows at the aggressors when they infringed upon its dignity. As a strong country in Asia with a vast territory, large population, powerful state power and strict principle of independence, Koguryo exerted a strong influence not only on Paekje, Silla and Kaya, the countries where people of the same blood lived, but on a series of Japanese islands and several other countries and nations in the continent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Koguryo could demonstrate its might as a powerful state because it had had the status of an emperor state ever since its appearance on the historical arena as an independent country and successfully beat back foreign invasions throughout its history and firmly maintained independence in relations with other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The truth that Koguryo was a successor to Ancient Korea and other states that existed in Korea can be proved by the fact that King Tongmyong, a descendent of the population of Ancient Korea, and his supporters independently built Koguryo on the land where ancestral state Kuryo stood and its population were also descendents of Ancient Korea. And many historic relics and their customs suffice to prove the fact. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The despicable scramble for power among the ruling quarters and traitorous acts of rulers of Silla who cooperated with the outsiders led the country to a ruin but its people turned out in a courageous struggle to repel aggression and rebuild the country to get rid of the shame as a stateless people and give vent to their grudge. This culminated in the rebuilding of Koguryo and the appearance of Palhae, a successor to Koguryo, in 698. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Koryo was a successor to Koguryo, they said, adding that this can be proved by the fact that Wang Gon, founder of Koryo, nurtured the intention to revive the whole territory of Koguryo as a descendent of the population of Koguryo, Koryo people declared themselves as successors to Koguryo and its descendents and felt highly proud of this and this was internationally recognized. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The symposium was attended by Thae Hyong Chol, president of the academy, officials concerned and officials in the fields of social science, education and the preservation of cultural relics.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It was the first organization of anti-Japanese national united front involving workers, peasants, intellectuals, youth and students and even national capitalists and believers of conscience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  After its foundation, it expanded its organizations across the country and took deep roots in broad areas of Manchuria including East Manchuria where many Koreans lived as well as in different parts of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With a membership of at least two hundred thousand it rallied masses in its ranks under the leadership of Kim Il Sung to greatly contribute to winning national liberation by defeating the Japanese imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The founding of the association which united the masses of all walks of life differing in social and class status, ism and idea and religion under the banner of patriotism was a significant event that established the tradition of unity of the whole nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This proud tradition of great national unity established by Kim Il Sung is being successfully carried forward today with leader Kim Jong Il at the top post of the revolution. Kim Jong Il is wisely guiding the work for accomplishing the cause of national reunification with the united strength of the nation, fully inheriting Kim Il Sung's idea of great national unity and his feats in achieving it and precious experience and tradition of struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Great national unity is the great foundation of the reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By putting forward the five-point policy of great national unity Kim Jong Il provided a programmatic guideline of reunification. And he, with the publication of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration that is throwing its rays in the history of the nation's reunification movement, made the whole nation turn out in the struggle for independent reunification, guided by the idea of \"By Our Nation Itself\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il to accomplish the cause of reunification with the might of great national unity, a new phase previously unknown in the inter-Korean relations and the history of the national reunification movement opened and unprecedented achievements and changes have been recorded. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The Korean people will achieve without fail the cause of national reunification, the greatest desire of the nation, with the powerful weapon of great national unity which has all along registered victories and glory in the history of the revolutionary struggle.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "S. Korean Ultra-Right Conservatives' Anti-North Vituperation Assailed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 5 (KCNA) -- Members of the \"group of National Assemblymen who proposed the motion on the impeachment\" in their final pleading for impeachment held at the Constitutional Court in south Korea on April 30 did not bother to let loose a string of unsavory remarks malignantly slandering the dignified political system in the DPRK. They argued that \"an impeachment trial is the only way of containing the president\" and even pulled up the north over the accident at Ryongchon Railway Station in North Phyongan Province. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland in a statement issued to the press Wednesday dismissed this as an unpardonable and deliberate act intended to incite confrontation as it is a serious political provocation against the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As well known to the world, the accident at Ryongchon was a big disaster that occurred all of a sudden and it, therefore, should be treated as a humanitarian issue that needs an urgent relief. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Riff-raffs of the group hurled a spate of vituperation at the north, deliberately linking the accident to the political system in the north, far from expressing sympathy with the victims of the disaster. This can be done only by those immoral politicians who do not have an iota of morality but crazy for power only. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the accident at Ryongchon Railway Station was attributable to the political system in the north, how can they explain a chain of big accidents in south Korea which stunned the world? It is highly illogical to deliberately attribute the accident in the north to its system. This rubbish can be talked only by those fanatics hell-bent on inciting confrontation bereft of reason. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean ultra-right conservative forces' malarkey fully discloses their true intention to \"impeach the president\" at any cost at the instigation of the U.S., usurp power and bring the inter-Korean relations back to those in the era of confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Given that members of the above-said group seriously got on the nerves of the north, we make it clear that we would not deal in the future with the political parties to which they belong unless they make a formal apology to the north.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
