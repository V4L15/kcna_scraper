It also tried to realize its ambition to dominate the world by subordinating those countries to it through \"aid\" and organizing military block for aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the period of the Cold War the U.S. made all its efforts to oppose the socialist countries while raising a hue and cry over the \"threat of socialism\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean War and Vietnamese War provoked by the U.S. imperialists were typical examples. But the U.S. could not but sustain bitter defeats by the united strength of the revolutionary forces against imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reactionary imperialist forces have intensified the offensive against the independent forces against imperialism after the collapse of the Soviet Union and socialist countries in eastern Europe and in particular, the U.S. which emerged as the \"only superpower\" in the world has become all the more undisguised in its high-handed and arbitrary practices in the world arena, violating the sovereignty of independent states. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their offensive was targeted against the DPRK which has invariably held aloft the banner of socialism, banner of independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK people have defended socialism and strikingly demonstrated the dignity and might of the country as they have fought with the formidable imperialist enemy with dignity under the uplifted banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. launched the military aggression against Afghanistan and Iraq under the pretext of the \"anti-terror war\" aimed at the aggression and plunder of other countries and put those countries under its occupation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There thus emerged new imperialist method for aggression and gangster-like plunder in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the U.S. seeks the expansion and protraction of the \"anti-terror war\" to invade by force and dominate the independent countries against imperialism and countries located in the places of strategic importance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists' intensified strong-arm policy will bring them worse situation and destruction in the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
