            "content": "Solicitation diplomacy leads to ruin of nation\r\n Pyongyang, February 20 (KCNA) -- Some politicians of South Korea are now reportedly busy garnering support for their call for the adoption a \"six-nation joint declaration\" for inter-Korean peaceful coexistence and peace and stability in Northeast Asia. By the \"six nations\" they mean two halves of Korea, the United States, China, Japan and Russia.\r\n   The call may sound good. But it is a silly and dangerous \"plan.\"\r\n   The present situation of Northeast Asia is different from that of Europe in 1975 when the \"Helsinki Declaration\" was adopted.\r\n   Antagonism has continued with no sign of willingness to recognize each other as state. And the state of war has not been terminated in technical terms.  This is the situation of Northeast Asia quite different from Europe's.\r\n   If state leaders gather and adopt a joint declaration under such circumstances, it is as foolish as trying to build a house on sand without foundation.\r\n   Stability and peace have not been ensured on the Korean Peninsula not because there is no \"declaration\" by its neighbouring nations but because the United States has still kept huge armed forces in south korea and presented military threat to the DPRK though the cold war ended long ago.\r\n   Calling for a \"sixth-nation declaration\" without seeing the keypoint of the issue is either a revelation of their illiteracy or a manifestation of their sinister political intrigue intentionally ignoring the essense of the issue.\r\n   Their solicitation diplomacy over the issue related to the destiny of the nation is a very dangerous act.\r\n   It is a serious lesson given by the history of the Korean nation that solicitation leads to national ruin.\r\n   The present South Korean regime in its waning days has also ruined inter-Korean relations with solicitation diplomacy.\r\n   In the closing years of Ri dynasty the rulers of Korea had ruined the nation with such a solicitation diplomacy towards powers. But such a traitorous tendency still prevails in south korea. It is really a deplorable thing.\r\n   The South Korean politicians must know that if they want to do something, they should do in their own way, and this is what the nation requires.    \r\n  \r\n"

So, all their military activities are aimed at realising the U.S. military domination over the whole of Korea and the rest of Asia.\r\n   Arms buildup and military exercises in South Korea and Japan are also aimed at increasing combat and attack capabilities.\r\n   It is nonsense that the U.S. military presense in South Korea and Japan is necessary for peace and stability. \r\n   Wrecking peace and stability is all it has done. What the United States seeks is not to ensure peace and stability but intentionally increase tension and instability in the Asia-Pacific region. In this way, it wants to have a reason to keep its troops in this region and start a war of aggression.\r\n   The U.S. troop pullout means the elimination of the factor of instability on the Korean Peninsula and in the rest of the Asia-Pacific region. It is a prerequisite to peace and stability in this region.    \r\n     \r\n\r\n"

He, who suffered behind bars for 34 years in South Korea, has conducted writing activities with a strong will since returning to the motherland.\r\n   In the previous year some 60 heroes were produced among soldiers of the Korean People's Army, builders and volunteers who built the large-scale Anbyon Youth Power Station on the east coast of korea by overcoming all difficulties and trials.   \r\n   A soldier of the Korean People's Security Forces, Jong Kwang Son, who returned to his unit triumphantly from South Korea, was awarded the medal of hero of the republic that year.\r\n   The increasing number of heroes in socialist Korea is attributable to the benevolent politics of General Secretary Kim Jong Il. Saying that to live like heroes and to become a hero is the most valuable and worthwhile way of life for independent beings, he has encouraged all the people to heroic feats.\r\n   The Korean people's heroism which was started in the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle and shown in the arduous yet fruitful years of the revolution is now being fully displayed in the forced march of socialism.   \r\n   It is today's features of korea that all the servicemen and people, like heroes, reliably defend socialism, which is a strong bastion of ideology and fortress of faith.     \r\n\r\n"
