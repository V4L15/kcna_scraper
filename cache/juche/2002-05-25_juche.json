In this regard Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary says:\r\n Through this step Japan has secured preconditions for larger-scale military actions overseas. It is, therefore, clear that its military actions against sovereign states will enter into a more serious phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent decision to prolong the period of Japan's \"logistic support for the U.S.\" merits a more serious attention as it was made with the U.S. operation to attack Iraq at hand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This step of Japan means a dangerous military action against Asian countries which would bring the disaster of war to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are now working hard to establish a wartime system by adopting the controversial \"law on emergency\" under the pretext of \"combating terrorism\" and mobilize everything of the country for overseas aggression any time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If there are politicians in Japan who are concerned about the future of Japan, not oblivious of the lesson drawn from its past defeat, they should move to straighten out the dangerous situation.\r\n"

A proof of this is that the anti-U.S. movements are growing in South Korea and the surrounding area. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should face up to the anti-U.S. trend of the times and make a bold decision on the withdrawal of the U.S. forces.\r\n"

The spirit is prevailing in the whole society, opening the heyday of great creation and change performing new miracles and feats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
