This is a big step toward the building of a state pursuing a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now it is going to scrap the \"pacifist constitution\" in a bid to make Japan a war-oriented state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The word \"pacifist\" could be attached to the present constitution of Japan because Article 9 of it bans possession of war capability and war itself. The Japanese reactionary ruling camp is going to get rid of such basic provisions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Abe group is working to create a social climate favorable for bringing a war-oriented state into shape by inculcating militarist idea into the minds of the Japanese people in real earnest. It is only too natural that the world is heightening vigilance against the militarization maneuvers of the Japanese reactionaries.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This book is said to have been distributed in some foreigners' schools in south Korea, too.\r\n Commenting on this, a Rodong Sinmun analyst Wednesday says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an intolerable mockery of and insult to the Korean nation and a very nefarious act trampling upon justice and praising the history of injustice for the U.S. to allow itself to use the novel distorting history as a middle school textbook, in which the reactionaries of Japan maliciously slander the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for the autobiographical novel which is said to have been written by a daughter of a Japanese war criminal who was eleven years old when the Japanese imperialists were defeated, it is full of lies and fabrication utterly inconsistent with the then historical environment and facts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. must know that Japan kept Korea under their military occupation and brutal and harsh colonial fascist repressive rule unparalleled in history for over 40 years. Nevertheless, the U.S. is openly using the blatantly distorted history book of Japan, which was written by an offspring of a war criminal. This reveals its intention to bury in oblivion the bloody past crimes of the islanders and use them as a shock brigade of aggression and war by misleading public opinion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All this proves irrefutably that the U.S. and Japan are dangerous accomplices and conspirators in the hostile policies against the DPRK and aggressive moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The criminal acts of Japan insulting the Korean nation and brazenly distorting history and the U.S. imperialists zealously singing duet with them can never be overlooked.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Things have come to such a pass that the Japanese ruling quarters and the group of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan are letting loose an ugly torrent of outbursts urging hasty preparations for taking part in armed sanctions against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Far from honestly reflecting on and compensating for the past crimes, the Japanese are piling up crimes upon the crimes they have already committed, persisting in the moves against the DPRK and Chongryon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These moves can never be tolerated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries should stop at once their foolish acts hostile to the DPRK and Chongryon, looking straight into the hatred for Japan rankling deeply in the hearts of the Korean people.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
