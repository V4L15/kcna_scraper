The DPRK has always won victory in the standoff with the U.S. imperialists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The arrogant Trump administration should stop the war provocation moves and hostile policy toward the DPRK, though belatedly, clearly understanding that if they ignite a war on the Korean peninsula, the whole land of the U.S. would reduce to ashes so that there would be no one left to sign a surrender document.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should reasonably depend on the nation and take the option to improve the inter-Korean relations and achieve peace and reunification of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The General Association of Koreans in China and all Koreans in China will more vigorously turn out in the patriotic struggle to open up the avenue to independent reunification after driving the U.S. forces out of south Korea at an early date and resolutely smashing the sanctions and war moves of the U.S. imperialists and warlike forces at home and abroad."
