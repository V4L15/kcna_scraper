It fully demonstrated the superiority and vitality of the socialist system in the North Korea where everything serves the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The President Kim Il Sung saw to it that the DPRK government reiterated its unshakable position to the effect that the homeland fully provides the returnees with all means needed for their repatriation and looks after all aspects of their living in a responsible manner after their repatriation. He aroused the Korean people as well as all the Korean nationals in Japan to a dynamic struggle for the repatriation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is thanks to the leadership of the great Kim Jong Il that the return and visits of overseas Koreans to the homeland continue without a let-up and the movement of overseas Koreans has grown in scope and strength along with triumphant advance of the Juche revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All the people who returned to the socialist homeland enjoy a worthy life, glorifying their socio-political life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe naturalized Japanese women share the destiny with the socialist homeland as well. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Hundreds of the returnees have gained great achievements with intense loyalty to the party and the country over the last four decades to receive Kim Il Sung Order, Kim Il Sung Prize, citations of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il and their gifts. Dozens of the returnees have become labor heroes and heroines, tens of thousands state commentation winners and hundreds people's scientists, people's artistes, people's actors and actresses and people's sportsmen, academicians, professors, doctors, associate professors, and masters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Koreans in Japan have kept flowers of loyalty and filial piety in full bloom with the honor of being members of a large socialist family in the past period. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The reporter attributed this to the deep political trust and great loving care of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il  who took warm care of the returnees and gave them social prominence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The credit for this also  went to the Worker's Party of Korea that has pursued benevolent, all-embracing policies, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Vice-chairman Nam Sung U of the central standing committee of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan made an address at the meeting. \r\n\r\n"

Pulling up the north again, he asserted that all efforts are exerted to increase their combat preparedness and beef up the South Korea-U.S. combined deterrent force and that a \"planning group for military innovation\" has already been created to \"make specific preparations.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This cannot but arouse vigilance of the north as it is a very serious development which may escalate again the military confrontation on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This indicates that the South Korean chief executive and other belligerent forces in South Korea are now further stepping up preparations for a criminal war against the north than ever before under the deceptive signboard of the \"engagement policy.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What merits more serious attention is that the war moves of the South Korean authorities are timed to coincide with the madcap anti-DPRK campaign of the U.S. conservative hard-liners. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is a clear proof that the U.S. and the South Korean authorities are to blame for the failure to make any substantial progress in the dialogues aimed to ease the tensions and ensure peace on the Korean peninsula.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Although they are talking about \"dialogue\" and so on their ulterior purpose to militarily contain the north and lead it to \"collapse\" remains unchanged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK has declared more than once that it is fully ready for both political dialogue and military showdown. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean warmongers had better stop acting rashly, clearly mindful what catastrophic consequences will be entailed by their persistent pursuance of the military confrontation with the north, depending on the U.S. and other outside forces. \r\n\r\n"

Korea since 1950s disclosed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, December 15 (KCNA) -- A recently publicized U.S. government document disclosed the fact that the U.S. has deployed nuclear weapons in South Korea since the 1950s, said the South Korean newspaper Chungang Ilbo on Monday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The paper went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. deployed thousands of nuclear weapons and their parts in South Korea, Japan, Guam, the Philippines and so on in the 1950s according to the then U.S. strategy that called for deploying nuclear weapons in the Pacific and Europe to cope with a war against the former Soviet Union.   A report of the U.S. far east command dated Nov. 1, 1956, indicates that separate locations in Japan including sites on the main islands had nuclear weapons or components or were earmarked to receive weapons in the event of impending war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The facts prove that the U.S. has long deployed nuclear weapons in Asia including South Korea in a bid to fight a nuclear war. \r\n\r\n"
