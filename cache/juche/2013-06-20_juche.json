Let's go to south Korea.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At 11:00 a.m. a van arrived but the couple only let the youngsters take it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They had whole four-day travel being handed over from one man to another, Mun Chol said, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After getting off the van we crossed a high mountain on foot.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Following a man who came to take us over, we dropped in at a small village to get only drinking water and we took another van.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  After traveling by van for about 20 to 30 minutes we came to a stop to be met by Jang Ha Jin and his wife.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The last guide handed us over to Jang's couple who passed the guide a thick money envelope.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was only at that time that we realized we illegally crossed the border of China. There we spent one night and the next morning we went to a bus-stop to take bus.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Mun Chol said he was so tired that he dozed off inside the bus, adding that when he was awakened from the sleep he found that the bus was held up, being intercepted at a checkpoint.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ri Kwang Hyok said he heard later that the government of that country proved those on board to be abductees to south Korea by flesh traffickers and rendered help so that they could be sent back to Pyongyang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The teenagers explained how they were made to live in Jang Ha Jin's house in Dandong, China.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Paek Yong Won said that he was kidnapped by Jang Ha Jin when he was walking along the road in Changbai region of China one day in December last year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pak Kwang Hyok, Mun Chol, Ryu Chol Ryong and other teenagers said that Jang and his wife shut them up in their house and inflicted heavy penalties on them for the mere reason that they did not memorize well the book of bible and hymn. They said that Jang and his wife beat them with baseball bat and umbrella, making them unable to walk or hear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Paek Yong Won expressed his indignation, saying that clergyman Jang urged him to pray for the construction of a church on Mansu Hill.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that he protested, Paek Yong Won continued that even though he left the homeland he could not forget the loving care shown by the great Generalissimos Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il who were always alive in their hearts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When he wrote letters reading \"General Kim Jong Il Lives Forever!\" and \"Long Live the Workers' Party of Korea!\" in his notebook, the clergyman and his wife took off their shoes and beat him in the face, calling him \"red\" and \"communist spy\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Mun Chol said that once he overheard clergyman Jang saying that he begged for charity from south Koreans after showing them photos of Paek Yong Won with his ears frozen and swollen to collect money.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Jong Kwang Yong said that he once saw clergyman Jang being criticized by a man from south Korea called \"ring grandfather\" who scolded Jang for using up without result all the money allotted for the collection of more children. Jong Kwang Yong added that Jang humbly begged pardon with his face ablush, explaining that he could not move for a good while with his collar being seized by Chinese police.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pak Kwang Hyok disclosed that Jang used to have contact with old, dreadful-looking American lady who claimed to be the representative of the \"Association for Freedom of North Korea\", an organization in Washington, from whom he used to get separate fund.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pak added that through the American woman Jang took to south Korea in September 2011 other teenagers called Mun Il Phyong, Sim Su Man and Kim Yong Min who stayed there before him and took to the U.S. in August 2012 Hyon Chon Ryong, Ri Mun Chol, Kim Pong Chol and Han Chol Jun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pak Kwang Hyok said that Jang tried to include him in the group of children who were taken to the U.S. in August 2012. Jang promised to send him to the U.S. later because he did not get an approval from the old lady.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those teenagers expressed their impressions of returning to the homeland, free from the plot of abduction by the puppet group of south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ri Kwang Hyok said that he saw a TV footage of the 7th Congress of the Korean Children's Union after return home. He added that he felt tears welling up when he saw the dear respected Marshal Kim Jong Un coming to the tribune of honor, letting children of his age be seated next to him, calling a student of Mangyongdae Revolutionary School close to him and talking to him, while fondling his cheek. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Mun Chol said that Kim Jong Un is like the bright sun embracing all of them and opening up a bright future for them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The returnees sang song \"Ardent Desire\" feeling thankful for Kim Jong Un."

Korean Regime for Justifying War Provoked by Outsiders\r\n Pyongyang, June 20 (KCNA) -- The south Korean puppet forces are working hard to twist historical facts that the U.S. ignited the war against the DPRK in 1950.\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Hye at a meeting of senior secretaries of Chongwadae on June 17 expressed regret at the results of the opinion poll conducted among youngsters over their understanding of history which showed that about 70 percent of the respondents answered the June 25 war was invasion against the north. She instructed the new “government” to put the situation under control without fail as it is a matter which should never be overlooked.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What she uttered is one more act of treachery to cover up the true colors of the U.S. as a provocateur of the Korean war recorded in history and justify its invasion to reduce the Korean people to slaves. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a mean act of passing the buck for the U.S. ignition of the June 25 war to the fellow countrymen in a bid to conceal the treacherous acts the puppet forces perpetrated by leveling guns at compatriots as a shock brigade in carrying out the war policy of foreign forces and justify their dependence on outsiders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Historical facts prove that the Korean war in the 1950s was foreign forces' war of aggression against the DPRK, to all intents and purposes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t McArthur sent a message to Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida on June 26, 1950 in which he issued an order to suspend the publication of Akahata, organ of the Japanese Communist Party, for 30 days from June 27.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The then newspaper reported that McArthur issued such order because it carried the news that the Syngman Rhee puppet army illegally invaded the area north of the 38 parallel in Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Zhou Enlai, the then premier and minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of China, on June 28, 1950 stated as follows as regards Truman's statement on June 27:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"In actuality, the Syngman Rhee puppet government's attack on the DPRK by the agitation of the U.S. government was kicked off by the U.S. for the purpose of securing a pretext for invading Korea, Vietnam and other countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is another interference of the U.S. imperialists in Asian issues.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The international political situation and the balance of forces in the international affairs at that time were completely unfavorable for carrying out the U.S. strategy for dominating the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the international arena, the influence of the socialist countries steadily increased and the anti-imperialist national liberation struggle gained further momentum in many countries which were under the domination and control of the imperialists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the meantime, the U.S. military industry complex and the financial situation in Wall Street badly required wars of aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. began to sink in economic depression from 1946 after it greeted heyday by gaining huge profits through mass production and sale of arms during the Second World War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At a time when arms expansion unprecedented in the history of America started and the fear of economic depression reached an extreme phase, the U.S. political and military authorities decided to start the Korean War as a way out.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The option made by the U.S. put spurs to the revival of Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. investment in Japan early in 1950 totaled 2.5 billion U.S. dollars.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. war provocateurs planned to use Japan as a military strategic springboard in the Far East. The ruling quarters of Japan had the hope of using the Korean war for implementing their plans to take revenge.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A correspondent of the Swiss paper Neue Zurcher Zeitung dispatched the following report from the Far East five days before the U.S. started its provocation to the DPRK:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There are many people in south Korea who seek the settlement of economic difficulties through the invasion of north Korea. 100,000 troops who were well trained by Americans and 50 000 policemen surely outnumber the north Korean forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said facts are just the tip of the iceberg of the disclosed facts about the aim sought by the U.S in igniting the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t History never changes no matter how hard one may try to alter it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The perpetrators of the crimes will surely be forced to pay for them one day."

It called for collecting all information about phone calls inside the U.S. and between it and other countries and provide it to the U.S. National Security Council on a daily basis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pursuant to this directive, contents of e-mails and phone calls made by millions of Americans have reportedly been gathered by the agency until now since April last.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Earlier, the Chinese Xinhua News said the agency gathered 1.7 billion information pieces about phone callers and netizens every day and among them are even information about family secrets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is clear evidence showing the true colors of the U.S. as a criminal state where human rights abuses are organized and legitimatized.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When recalling that U.S. Congress adopted a law on allowing the government to gather information about private matters of people through wiretapping and electronic communication media from long ago, such crimes committed by the agency pursuant to the directive of the said court is nothing surprising.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. Department of Justice secretly gathered phone calls made by AP and the tax authorities investigated and monitored some suspected persons by the same method. There are too many instances of disclosure of tapping of private messages in the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is surprising is the attitude taken by the high-ranking U.S. officials towards the state-sponsored human rights abuses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On June 7 U.S. President Obama, when interviewed by reporters as regards what the U.S. National Security Agency has done, unblushingly answered that the agency's actions were approved by U.S. Congress and it contributes to combating terrorism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A senior official of the agency blustered gathering of phone messages serves as an important means to protect the country from the threat of the terrorists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This clearly indicates the brazen-faced nature of the U.S., which openly justifies the human rights abuses perpetrated under the signboard of \"anti-terror\" as its policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world people have already branded the \"war on terrorism\" of the U.S. as an unpardonable crime against humanity as it has mercilessly encroached upon the sovereignty of other countries and nations in a bid to protect the security and interests of the privileged who account for just one percent of the population.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What the U.S. dignitaries uttered is no more than a declaration that it may encroach upon the independent rights of the popular masses if it is for the sake of the interests and security of the privileged.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the real picture of the U.S."

Coryo una mesa redonda con los jovenes y los ninos quienes repatriaron en medio de llevarse hacia el Sur de Corea seducidos y secuestrados por la banda de los titeres  surcoreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t Participaron en la ocasion Ro Jong Yong (14 anos de edad), Ryu Chol Ryong, Jang Kuk Hwa, Ri Kwang Hyok (15 anos de edad), Jong Kwang Yong (16 anos de edad), Pak Kwang Hyok (17 anos de edad), Ryu Kwang Hyok (18 anos de edad) y Mun Chol y Paek Yong Won (19 anos de edad).\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Los participantes dijeron primero acerca del trayecto de llevarse secuestrados al Sur de Corea por las maniobras intrigantes de la banda titere.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Mun Chol recordo que en la casa del pastor surcoreano Jang Ha Jin en Dandong de China, Pak Kwang Hyok vivia durante 3 anos, Ryu Chol Ryong, Ri Kwang Hyok y Jong Kwang Yong, casi 2 anos, el mismo, Ryu Kwang Hyok, Jang Kuk Hwa y Ro Jong Yong, un ano y medio y Paek Yong Won, 5 meses y continuo:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A fines de abril pasado, Jang Ha Jin, muy inquieto, dijo a su esposa que \"no podemos vivir mas en China e iremos al Sur de Corea\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A las once, vino un camion pequeno de carga en que nos hicieron montar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Fuimos trasladandonos uno a otro y nos llevaron durante 4 dias en el camion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Despues de bajar, crucemos a pie un monte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Siguiendo a un hombre que vino para recibirnos, llegamos a una aldea pequena donde bebimos solo el agua y tomamos el otro camion de carga.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El camion paro al cabo de 20-30 minutos y alli nos recibieron los esposos del pastor Jang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El ultimo conductor nos entrego a los esposos Jang quienes dieron al primero el sobre voluminoso de dinero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Aquel momento, supimos que cruzamos ilegalmente la frontera china.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Alli, pasamos una noche y por la manana del dia siguiente, fuimos a la parada de omnibus.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Yo dormi muy fatigado en omnibus y cuando me desperte, el transporte mantuvo parado por la inspeccion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ri Kwang Hyok dijo que el gobierno de aquel pais, tras identificar que eramos secuestrados por los traficantes de seres humanos del Sur de Corea, nos ofrecio una ayuda activa para que nos regresaramos a Pyongyang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Los participantes mencionaron el motivo de haber convivido juntos en la casa de Jang Ha Jin.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Paek Yong Won dijo que un dia de diciembre del ano pasado cuando estaba en la zona de Changbai de China, fue raptado de modo forzoso por Jang cuando iba a pie por la carretera.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pak Kwang Hyok, Mun Chol, Ryu Chol Ryong y otros recordaron que los matrimonios de Jang les encarcelaron en su casa y les impusieron memorizar la Biblia y el cantico y revelaron que si no los hicimos bien, les dieron un tremendo castigo y golpe con el bate o con el baston de paraguas, asi que ellos se hicieron cojos o sordos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Paek Yong Won expuso su indignacion por el hecho de que el pastor Jang le forzo orar para edificar en la colina Mansu una iglesia y continuo:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pero, yo lo negue porque aunque abandone la patria, no pude olvidar el amor de los Generalisimos ni sus imagenes con amplia sonrisa guardados en mi corazon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Por eso, escribi en el libro \"!el Dirigente Kim Jong Il siempre esta vivo!\" y \"!Viva el Partido del Trabajo de Corea!\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Entonces, los conyuges del pastor me golpearon con los zapatos mi cara calificandome como \"rojo\" y \"espia comunista\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Mun Chol recordo que una vez, escucho a escondidas las palabras de Jang quien dijo haber ganado dineros al cabo de peticion con lagrimas mostrandoles a otras personas la foto de Paek Yong Won quien padecia de sabanon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Jong Kwang Yong recordo que un hombre llamado como \"abuelo de anillo\" proveniente del Sur de Corea pesquiso como gasto el dineros enviado anteriormente para secuestrar mas a ninos y Jang con cara enrojada respondio que no podia hacer nada por las autoridades de seguridad publica de China.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pak Kwang Hyok dijo que el pastor se reunio a menudo con una mujer estadounidense llamada como delegada de \"Alianza por la Libertad del Norte de Corea\" quien le dio tambien el dinero y continuo:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Jang, a traves de esa mujer estadounidense, llevo en septiembre de 2011 al Sur de Corea a Mun Il Phyong, Sim Su Man y Kim Yong Min quienes vinieron antes que nosotros y en agosto de 2012, a Estados Unidos a Hyon Chon Ryong, Ri Mun Chol, Kim Pong Chol, Han Chol Jun y otros.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El pastor intento incluirme entre los ninos que se llevaban en agosto de 2012, pero, la norteamericana no lo acepto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Los participantes dijeron sus impresiones de repatriacion liberados de la intriga de la banda titere,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ri Kwang Hyok dijo que en TV vio la escena del VII Congreso de la Organizacion de Ninos de Corea y agrego que lloro al ver al Mariscal Kim Jong Un quien en la tribuna hace sentarse a su lado a los ninos iguales a si mismos y acariciaba a un hijo de la escuela revolucionaria de Mangyongdae halandole algo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Mun Chol subrayo que el regazo del Mariscal es igual que el sol afectuoso.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Los
